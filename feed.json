      "New Zealand's racing minister says the country will outlaw greyhound racing, citing the injury rates for racing dogs",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- New Zealand plans to outlaw greyhound racing because too many dogs are hurt or killed, the government said Tuesday, spelling an end to the practice in one of the few countries where it still operates.",
      "The racing of greyhounds as a betting sport was wildly popular at times last century. But the number of dogs euthanized due to race-day injuries, or because homes cannot be found for them after their short careers end, has provoked animal welfare campaigns and growing public distaste for the sport.",
      "Commercial greyhound racing continues in the United States, Australia, the U.K. and Ireland, with only two tracks remaining in the U.S. after many states ended the practice.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s ban is not yet law but has universal political support. The government plans to stop the racing from Aug. 1, 2026, to allow the 2,900 racing dogs to be rehomed and more than 1,000 people employed in the industry to find other work, Racing Minister Winston Peters said Tuesday.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s greyhound racing industry has faced repeated reviews in recent years over its dog safety record, with multiple reports urging sweeping changes. Peters said the industry had made progress -\u2013 but not enough.",
      "Stricter policies governing when dogs can be euthanized, and rehoming programs that send retired New Zealand greyhounds abroad as pets when homes cannot be found domestically, have reduced the numbers killed each year. But the percentage of dogs injured \u201cremains persistently high,\u201d Peters said.",
      "\u201cThe time has come to make a call in the best interest of the animals,\u201d he said.",
      "Greyhound Racing New Zealand, an industry group, accused the government of not recognizing improvements made, including its commitment to tracking the care of every retired dog for the rest of its life. Tuesday\u2019s announcement was \u201ca devastating blow,\u201d said chair Sean Hannan.",
      "The animal welfare organization SPCA praised the government for showing \u201ccompassion for dogs made to work in a dangerous gambling industry.\u201d The practice has long been out of favor in New Zealand, spokesperson Arnja Dale said.",
      "Some lawmakers in parliament on Tuesday described the racing industry\u2019s end as inevitable following the steady decline of greyhound racing worldwide.",
      "Commercial racing operates in four other countries. In the U.S., its popularity peaked in the 1980s and the number of states allowing the practice has dwindled since then amid reports of dog mistreatment and the explosion of other gambling options.",
      "Only two tracks remain -\u2013 both in West Virginia -\u2013 after Iowa, Arkansas and Florida shuttered their racing industries. Greyhounds have become popular as pets in the U.S., and New Zealand has sent dozens of dogs to new owners there when homes could not be found in the country of 5 million people.",
      "Greyhound racing is also legal in Australia, where critics have decried the practice, and the rules governing it vary by state. Commercial racing currently operates throughout the U.K. and Ireland, but the Scottish parliament is considering a ban there.",
      "The practice remains legal in Mexico and Vietnam, but there are no longer operational tracks in either country, according to information supplied by Peters\u2019 office.",
      "Hours after it announced the end to greyhound racing, New Zealand's government rushed through a law to prevent dogs from being killed while the industry winds down, unless a veterinarian deems it unavoidable. This will prevent owners from euthanizing dogs for economic reasons, Peters said.",
      "Lawmakers unanimously agreed to the change.",
      "The law shutting down the industry will take longer, however, and is not expected to pass until next year after a period of public submissions. All political parties support the ban.",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 01:06:36 -0500",
    "summary": "The Onion's bid to buy conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars is back in a Texas courtroom",
    "story": [
      "The Onion's bid to buy conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars is back in a Texas courtroom",
      "A bankruptcy judge scrutinizing The Onion\u2019s bid for Alex Jones \u2019 Infowars platform was expected to hear a second day of testimony Tuesday after an auctioneer defended the satirical news outlet\u2019s winning offer in November.",
      "It is not clear how quickly U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez in Houston will decide whether to approve the bid. The Onion, which wants to turn Infowars\u2019 website and social media accounts into parodies, offered $1.75 million for Infowars\u2019 assets in the auction.",
      "Jones did not attend Monday\u2019s start of the key hearing and instead continued to broadcast from his studios in Austin.",
      "Jeff Tanenbaum, president of ThreeSixty Asset Advisors, was grilled by lawyers for Jones and the company in a Houston courtroom on Monday over how The Onion\u2019s bid came to be valued at $7 million and why a live auction was not held. He defended both the value of the bid and its selection after the two sealed offers were opened.",
      "Lopez could ultimately decide whether to void The Onion\u2019s bid, name the Jones-affiliated company the winner or hold another auction, among other possibilities.",
      "Jones and First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements and submitted the other bid, are alleging fraud and collusion in the auction that concluded on Nov. 14. The trustee and The Onion deny the allegations, accusing Jones and the company of sour grapes. First United American Companies bid $3.5 million.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut. Jones repeatedly called the 2012 shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors and aimed at increasing gun control.",
      "Most of the proceeds from the sale of Infowars, as well as many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, will go to the Sandy Hook families to help satisfy judgments issued by juries and judges in state courts in Connecticut and Texas. Some proceeds will go to Jones\u2019 other creditors.",
      "The Onion\u2019s bid also included a pledge by many of the Sandy Hook families to forgo some or all of the auction proceeds due to them to give other creditors a total of $100,000 more than they would receive under other bids.",
      "The trustee, Christopher Murray, chose The Onion, saying its proposal was better for creditors because they would receive more money. The Onion valued the bid, with the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer, at $7 million, because that amount was equal to a purchase price that would provide the same amount of money to the other creditors.",
      "Tanenbaum testified that he agreed with the $7 million valuation and believed The Onion\u2019s bid conformed to the auction rules.",
      "A lawyer for Jones, Ben Broocks, asked Tanenbaum how it was possible that the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer boosted The Onion\u2019s offer to such a high amount.",
      "\u201cIt means the purchase price value has gone up because another purchase price would have to be higher than that value in order to provide the same net benefit to that group of creditors,\u201d Tanenbaum said.",
      "During his opening argument, Broocks said there was no way The Onion should have been chosen over First United American.",
      "\u201cHow does a $1.75 million bid beat a $3.5 million bid?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow is that $1.75 million greater? Well, it\u2019s voodoo economics to use a phrase.\u201d",
      "Joshua Wolfshohl, an attorney for Murray, told the judge Monday that no wrongdoing occurred during the auction. He called the complaints by Jones and First United American Companies unfounded.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of their complaints are just fantastic, imagined conspiracy theories that have no basis in reality,\u201d he said.",
      "Murray, The Onion and the Sandy families deny allegations of wrongdoing. In his own court filing, Murray called the allegations \u201ca disappointed bidder\u2019s improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open auction process.\u201d",
      "Up for sale at the auction were all the equipment and other assets in the Infowars studio in Austin, Texas, as well as its social media accounts, websites, video archive and product trademarks. Jones uses the studio to broadcast his far-right, conspiracy theory-filled shows on the Infowars website, his account on the social platform X and radio stations.",
      "Jones has set up another studio, websites and social media accounts in case The Onion wins approval to buy Infowars and kicks him out. Jones has said he could continue using the Infowars platforms if the auction winner is friendly to him.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights but has acknowledged that the school shooting happened."

      "Nikki Giovanni, the poet, author, educator and public speaker who rose from borrowing money to release her first book to decades as a literary celebrity sharing her takes on everything from racism and love to space travel and mortality, has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Nikki Giovanni, the poet, author, educator and public speaker who rose from borrowing money to release her first book to decades as a literary celebrity sharing her blunt and conversational takes on everything from racism and love to space travel and mortality, has died. She was 81.",
      "Giovanni, subject of the prize-winning 2023 documentary \u201cGoing to Mars,\" died Monday with her life-long partner, Virginia (Ginney) Fowler, by her side, according to a statement from friend and author Ren\u00e9e Watson",
      "\u201cWe will forever feel blessed to have shared a legacy and love with our dear cousin,\u201d Allison (Pat) Ragan, Giovanni\u2019s cousin, said in a statement on behalf of the family.",
      "Author of more than 25 books, Giovanni was a born confessor and performer whom fans came to know well from her work, her readings and other live appearances and her years on the faculty of Virginia Tech among other schools. Poetry collections such as \"Black Judgement\" and \"Black Feeling Black Talk\" sold thousands of copies, led to invitations from \"The Tonight Show\" and other television programs and made her popular enough to fill a 3,000-seat concert hall at Lincoln Center for a celebration of her 30th birthday.",
      "In poetry, prose and the spoken word, she told her story. She looked back on her childhood in Tennessee and Ohio, championed the Black Power movement, addressed her battles with lung cancer, paid tribute to heroes from Nina Simone to Angela Davis and reflected on such personal passions as food, romance, family and rocketing into space, a journey she believed Black women uniquely qualified for, if only because of how much they had already survived. She also edited a groundbreaking anthology of Black women poets, \"Night Comes Softly,\" and helped found a publishing cooperative that promoted works by Gwendolyn Brooks and Margaret Walker among others.",
      "For a time, she was called \"The Princess of Black Poetry.\"",
      "\"All I know is the she is the most cowardly, bravest, least understanding, most sensitive, slowest to anger, most quixotic, lyingest, most honest woman I know,\" her friend Barbara Crosby wrote in the introduction to \"The Prosaic Soul of Nikki Giovanni,\" an anthology of nonfiction prose published in 2003. \"To love her is to love contradiction and conflict. To know her is to never understand but to be sure that all is life.\"",
      "Giovanni's admirers ranged from James Baldwin to Teena Marie, who name-checked her on the dance hit \u201cSquare Biz,\u201d to Oprah Winfrey, who invited the poet to her \"Living Legends\" summit in 2005, when other guests of honor included Rosa Parks and Toni Morrison. Giovanni was a National Book Award finalist in 1973 for a prose work about her life, \"Gemini.\" She also received a Grammy nomination for the spoken word album \"The Nikki Giovanni Poetry Collection.\"",
      "In January 2009, at the request of NPR, she wrote a poem about the incoming president, Barack Obama:",
      "\"I'll walk the streets",
      "And knock on doors",
      "Share with the folks:",
      "Not my dreams but yours",
      "I'll talk with the people",
      "I'll listen and learn",
      "I'll make the butter",
      "Then clean the churn\"",
      "____",
      "Giovanni had a son, Thomas Watson Giovanni, in 1969. She never married the father, because, she told Ebony magazine, \"I didn\u2019t want to get married, and I could afford not to get married.\" Over the latter part of her life she lived with her partner, Virginia Fowler, a fellow faculty member at Virginia Tech.",
      "She was born Yolande Cornelia Giovanni Jr. in Knoxville, Tennessee, and was soon called \"Nikki\" by her older sister. She was 4 when her family moved to Ohio and eventually settled in the Black community of Lincoln Heights, outside of Cincinnati. She would travel often between Tennessee and Ohio, bound to her parents and to her maternal grandparents in her \"spiritual home\" in Knoxville.",
      "As a girl, she read everything from history books to Ayn Rand and was accepted to Fisk University, the historically Black school in Nashville, after her junior year of high school. College was a time for achievement, and for trouble. Her grades were strong, she edited the Fisk literary magazine and helped start the campus branch of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee. But she rebelled against school curfews and other rules and was kicked out for a time because her \u201cattitudes did not fit those of a Fisk woman,\u201d she later wrote. After the school changed the dean of women, Giovanni returned and graduated with honors in history in 1967.",
      "Giovanni relied on support from friends to publish her debut collection, \"Black Poetry Black Talk,\" which came out in 1968, and in the same year she self-published \"Black Judgement.\" The radical Black Arts Movement was at its height and early Giovanni poems such as \"A Short Essay of Affirmation Explaining Why,\" \"Of Liberation\" and \"A Litany for Peppe\" were militant calls to overthrow white power. (\"The worst junkie or black businessman is more humane/than the best honkie\").",
      "\"I have been considered a writer who writes from rage and it confuses me. What else do writers write from?\" she wrote in a biographical sketch for Contemporary Writers. \"A poem has to say something. It has to make some sort of sense; be lyrical; to the point; and still able to be read by whatever reader is kind enough to pick up the book.\"",
      "Her opposition to the political system moderated over time, although she never stopped advocating for change and self-empowerment, or remembering martyrs of the past. In 2020, she was featured in an ad for presidential candidate Joe Biden, in which she urged young people to \u201cvote because someone died for you to have the right to vote.\u201d",
      "Her best known work came early in her career; the 1968 poem \"Nikki-Rosa.\" It was a declaration of her right to define herself, a warning to others (including obituary writers) against telling her story and a brief meditation on her poverty as a girl and the blessings, from holiday gatherings to bathing in \"one of those big tubs that folk in chicago barbecue in,\" which transcended it.",
      "\"and I really hope no white person ever has cause",
      "to write about me",
      "because they never understand",
      "Black love is Black wealth and they'll",
      "probably talk about my hard childhood",
      "and never understand that",
      "all the while I was quite happy\""

      "It could be argued that 2024 wasn't the best year for television.",
      "Highly anticipated shows like the final season of \u201cStranger Things,\" \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d and \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d didn't even make it on the calendar and will instead return in 2025. Streamers and networks tightened their budgets by saying yes to less.",
      "Writing off this year's selection, however, seems unfair. There were new standout comedies, dramas, reality TV and remakes of old favorites that caught the attention of viewers, awards voters and the zeitgeist.",
      "In no particular order, here are 10 new shows from 2024 to check out before the new year.",
      "In 2024, pop culture experienced a Brodyssance when Netflix's \u201cNobody Wants This\u201d reminded many why they had a crush on Adam Brody in the early aughts when he was on \u201cThe O.C.\u201d In this rom-com created by Erin Foster, Brody plays a rabbi named Noah who begins dating a gentile named Joanne (the always entertaining Kristen Bell) and their courtship as thirtysomethings unfolds. Before reaching their happily ever after, a number of obstacles \u2014 like religious differences, family pressures and career goals \u2014 need to be addressed. Hope is not lost, however, and throughout it all Noah and Joanne remain a good match. The supporting cast, by the way, is also a delight.",
      "The British series \u201cSupacell\u201d introduced a smart spin on the superhero template. Created and written by Rapman, the show centers on a group of Black, working class people in London who discover they have superpowers. At first, it seems the powerful are linked by just the color of their skin but their real connection is a family history of sickle cell disease. The show addresses themes like the medical exploitation of the Black community, poverty and how the media often overlooks cases of missing people of color. The show has been renewed for a second season and is on Netflix.",
      "Another fresh take on the world of superheroes and their villains is \u201cThe Penguin,\u201d on Max. The story picks up after the 2022 film \u201cThe Batman\u201d starring Robert Pattinson but here, Batman is more a background character to the gangster story of Oz Cobb. Colin Farrell played the criminal kingpin in the Pattinson film and reprises that role here. Cristin Milioti has also gotten positive reviews \u2014 and a Golden Globe nomination \u2014 for her portrayal of villain Sofia Falcone.",
      "When CBS first announced a new \u201cMatlock\u201d with Kathy Bates in the lead role, it seemed like just a gender-flipped remake. Au contraire. Bates plays Madeline Kingston, a wealthy lawyer who comes out of retirement under the alias Mattie Matlock (with a similar folksy demeanor as Andy Griffith's). Her reason for returning to work is that she needs money but, in reality, she's out for revenge. It's also fun to see how the series addresses older people being often overlooked and underestimated, which Madeline sometimes leans into for her own benefit. It streams on Paramount+. (Bates also snagged a Globe nomination.)",
      "When \u201cVanderpump Rules\u201d spinoff \u201cThe Valley\u201d debuted on Bravo in spring, some fans rolled their eyes. It follows three former \u201cVanderpump\u201d castmates \u2014 Jax Taylor, Brittany Cartwright and Kristen Doute \u2014 now living more settled lives amid a new circle of friends. Taylor and Doute knew the assignment \u2014 or just quickly fell into old habits of saying too much and stirring the pot. The new cast also impressed. Janet Caperna positioned herself as both above the drama and very much living for it. Jesse Lally showed vulnerability over the demise of his marriage to castmate Michelle Sanai, while also being an unapologetic snob. Viewers watched Taylor and Cartwright's marriage spiral, too (they're now divorcing). It streams on Peacock.",
      "Another adaptation with a twist is Prime Video's \u201cMr. & Mrs. Smith,\u201d starring Donald Glover and Maya Erskine. It shares a title with the film starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, but differs dramatically: Glover and Erskine play spies assigned to pose as a married couple named John and Jane Smith. They quickly go from strangers to co-workers to lovers. Each episode sees John and Jane on a new assignment, with notable guest stars like Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, Michaela Coel and Sharon Horgan. The show was nominated for 16 Emmy Awards and three Golden Globes.",
      "Andrew Scott stars in \u201cRipley,\u201d a neo-noir Netflix adaptation about the con artist and serial killer created by Patricia Highsmith. Like the 1999 movie starring Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law, this limited series is based on the Highsmith's \u201cThe Talented Mr. Ripley.\u201d Tom Ripley is hired by a wealthy businessman to travel to Italy and encourage his son, Dickie, who is living a life of leisure, to return to the States. Ripley ends up becoming enamored with Dickie's lifestyle and the ruse turns deadly.",
      "Brian Jordan Alvarez created and stars in FX's \u201cEnglish Teacher\u201d as Evan, a high school teacher in Texas, juggling the normal demands of the job amid societal changes. In one episode, Evan must show sensitivity to a student who has self-diagnosed herself with a made-up disease. In another, he successfully gets the school's gun safety program shut down but then is told all faculty must receive firearm training. As the adults on the show often struggle with getting it right, it's the students who seem less bothered with labels. The show also has a great soundtrack. It streams on Hulu.",
      "\u201cSh\u014dgun\u201d had a triumphant first season on FX, winning a historic 18 awards at this year's Emmys \u2014 including best drama series and best actor and actress in a drama for Hiroyuki Sanada and Anna Sawai. It's set during the power struggles in feudal Japan and is based on a 1975 James Clavell novel. FX didn't skimp on the production value, netting comparisons to \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d It was originally planned as a limited series, but now two more seasons are planned. Episodes stream on Hulu.",
      "Jake Gyllenhaal starred in his first TV series, \u201cPresumed Innocent,\u201d for Apple TV+. Gyllenhaal is Rusty Sabich, a Chicago prosecutor accused of killing a colleague. Gyllenhaal's real brother-in-law, Peter Sarsgaard, plays Rusty's adversary, another lawyer trying to prove his guilt. The story comes from a Scott Turow novel that was made into a Harrison Ford film in 1990 but doesn't follow either to the letter. It was the streamer's most watched drama series so far and a second season has been ordered, with Gyllenhaal staying on as an executive producer."

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jay-Z says a rape allegation made against him is part of an extortion attempt.",
      "A woman who previously sued Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, alleging she was raped at an awards show after-party in 2000 when she was 13, amended the lawsuit Sunday to include a new allegation that Jay-Z was also at the party and participated in the sexual assault.",
      "The 24-time Grammy award winning rapper, producer and music mogul called the allegations \u201cidiotic\u201d and \u201cheinous in nature\" in a statement released by Roc Nation, one of his companies.",
      "He also revealed that he had anonymously sued the woman's lawyer, Tony Buzbee, last month, alleging he was trying to blackmail the rapper by threatening to make the rape allegation public if he didn't agree to a legal settlement. He said Buzbee sent a letter to his lawyer appearing to seek a settlement, but that the letter had the \u201copposite effect\" on him.",
      "\u201cIt made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion,\u201d Jay-Z's statement read. \u201cSo no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!!\u201d",
      "The litigation is part of a wave of sexual assault lawsuits levied against Combs as the hip-hop mogul remains in custody in New York awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "The unnamed woman says she was hanging around Radio City Music Hall during the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards and managed to talk a limousine driver into bringing her to a celebrity-studded party at a private residence after the event.",
      "She said that while she was in the limousine, she was asked to sign a nondisclosure document. Once at the party, the lawsuit said, she took a drink that made her feel \u201cwoozy and lightheaded\u201d and went into a bedroom to lie down.",
      "She said that Combs and Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, then barged into the room along with another unnamed celebrity and raped her. The woman said she eventually escaped the room, fled the house and called for a ride from a nearby gas station.",
      "Buzbee, a personal injury lawyer in Houston, said the notion that he was trying to blackmail Jay-Z is \u201cstupid and laughable,\u201d and that his letter simply sought confidential mediation in the litigation.",
      "\u201cWhat he fails to say in his recent statement is that my firm sent his lawyer a basic demand letter on behalf of an alleged victim and that victim never demanded a penny from him,\u201d he said in an emailed statement. \u201cSince I sent the letter on her behalf, Mr. Carter has not only sued me, but he has tried to bully and harass me and this plaintiff. His conduct has had the opposite impact. She is emboldened. I\u2019m very proud of her resolve.\u201d",
      "Jay-Z's attorney, Alex Spiro, filed court paperwork Monday asking a judge to require his accuser, who is only identified as Jane Doe, to reveal her identity if she wants to continue the lawsuit. Spiro said the woman hasn\u2019t provided any evidence to justify her anonymity and that her \u201cvague assertions of potential harm fall far short of the stringent requirements\u201d under the law.",

      "Buzbee announced at a news conference in October that he represents some 120 people \u2014 both men and women \u2014 with allegations of sexual misconduct against Combs.",
      "His firm, which has set up a 1-800 number for accusers, began filing a wave of suits against the hip-hop mogul a few weeks later.",
      "Jay-Z, in his statement, challenged Buzbee to seek criminal charges and said his \u201cheart and support goes out to true victims in the world.\u201d",
      "He also lamented that he and wife Beyonc\u00e9 will likely have to address the claims with their three children and \u201cexplain the cruelty and greed of people.\u201d",
      "\u201cI mourn yet another loss of innocence,\u201d Jay-Z wrote.",
      "Combs' lawyers, in a statement, also dismissed Buzbee\u2019s lawsuits as \u201cshameless publicity stunts, designed to extract payments from celebrities who fear having lies spread about them, just as lies have been spread about Mr. Combs.\u201d",
      "Combs was denied bail a third time last month. He\u2019s pleaded not guilty to charges he coerced and abused women for years and faces trial in May.",
      "Jay-Z and Combs are part of a generation of hip-hop titans who rose to prominence in the 2000s, emerging as wide-ranging entrepreneurs and two of the world\u2019s wealthiest rappers. Earlier this year, Forbes estimated Jay-Z\u2019s net worth to be $2.5 billion.",

      "\u201cThis feels really surreal and wild, and I think it\u2019s particularly special because it\u2019s for a musical \u2026 it feels like a really beautiful full-circle moment to be celebrated for this, and it\u2019s a bit of a dream come true because there was definitely a time that I didn\u2019t think that would ever happen \u2026 I don\u2019t know how often you get to do a big musical onscreen. Some people who don\u2019t go to musicals full stop are going to see this, it\u2019s just been the most incredible thing to see happen, and my eyes are wide open every day and my brain is blown away by the connection that it's making with people.\" \u2014 In an interview with The Associated Press. It's Erivo's fourth Globe nomination.",
      "\u201cI was sort of prepared for the film to be overlooked, given the way it's been going ... So it is just indescribably meaningful to me that the Globes recognized the film on the grounds of its artistry and as a film. I think this has been a real battle from the get-go to get it made, but even more so to get it seen. And to sort of convince the industry that it was worthy of being seen. It's a human and archetypal story that could not possibly be more relevant or essential to the moment that we are living through. ... I\u2019m just happy because I think this means more people will see the movie, which has been the only goal. If you want to understand where America is in 2024, a lot of it points to Roy Cohn and his influence on Donald Trump.\u201d \u2014 In an interview. Strong played Trump mentor Roy Cohn.",
      "\u201cJust to have this recognition, this acknowledgment, to be part of the conversation, I think is a huge win for women, but also for people seeing the importance of self-love and self-acceptance, which is really the kind of overall messaging in this. So I really am thrilled.\u201d \u2014 In an interview.",
      "\u201cThis is a tiny little film that got me out of my garden. I was making pickles and jam. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be doing more in this industry. I was a little disappointed in myself and was kind of reassessing some of my life choices. But then this came up and I read it and I could hear her voice in my head, I could see it already and I just thought, \u2018This is life or death. I have to do this film.\u2019 This is that feeling that people get when they respond to material and they have to do it. Of course, wasn\u2019t thinking about any of this. I was just thinking \u2018I need some place to put my entire life.\u2019 And that was this film, all my life experience from childhood until now.\u201d \u2014 In an interview.",
      "\u201cYesterday was my birthday and everybody was texting me and calling me \u2013 but today it\u2019s more than that. It was a very interesting time (making the film) and of course I hoped that some interesting people would see it, but I absolutely had no idea about all this stuff, the Palme d\u2019Or, everything \u2026. Everyone (on cast and crew) they gave absolutely 100% \u2014 and more than 100% \u2014 of the energy and attention that they have, and that's why I am very happy that they are nominated, too.\u201d \u2014 In an interview.",
      "\u201cThe thing that I\u2019m most happy about in terms of the nomination is just that I get to have another stage \u2014 a big stage \u2014 to be able to advocate for them and talk to them. This part \u2014 this person \u2014 means the world to me and it\u2019s very, very special.\u201d \u2014 In an interview. Koch played Erik Menendez.",

      "\u201cI wanted to show the humanity of what goes on behind closed doors, the messiness, the imperfection, the ambition. In that sense, I feel this movie is not so much about religion than politics. It is a political thriller. It could be about Washington, D.C., or about CEOs \u2014 the politics of power.\u201d \u2014 In an interview.",

      "The 21-track, two-LP album \u2014 recorded in concert at the Parco della Musica auditorium in Italy's capital in June \u2014 is a fan-friendly sing-along that strings together some of the best sounds of their 25-year career.",
      "Eight of the band\u2019s 10 studio albums are represented in \u201cRome,\u201d releasing Friday from this Ohio-born and New York-based quintet fronted by the gravel-voiced Matt Berninger and fueled by two sets of brothers: Aaron and Bryce Dessner and Bryan and Scott Devendorf.",
      "The opener, \u201cRunaway,\u201d is one of a handful of deeper cuts, this one from the lyrically dreary yet melodically uplifting 2010 album \u201cHigh Violet.\" The drumming brilliance of Bryan Devendorf shines throughout another \u201cHigh Violet\u201d cut, \u201cBloodbuzz Ohio\u201d and spreads into \u201cThe System Only Dreams in Total Darkness,\u201d the heart of their 2017 album, \u201cSleep Well Beast.\u201d",
      "The self-described \u201csad dads,\u201d a self-deprecating nickname that shows up on some of their own merchandise, are rocking as hard as ever on this record.",
      "Berninger, as he described during an interview last year with David Letterman, battled depression during the pandemic. \u201cFirst Two Pages of Frankenstein,\u201d one of two albums released last year in what became a revitalization for Berninger and his bandmates, has a significant presence on \u201cRome.\u201d",
      "An example: The angst in \u201cEucalyptus\u201d over the impending breakup of a close relationship is palpable, but the genius of Berninger's lyrics performed live lies in a mood-lightening list of household items \u2014 from bottled water to a ceiling fan. \u201cWhat about the ornaments?\u201d he sings. \u201cWhat if I reinvented again? What about the moon drop light?\u201d",
      "Berninger's baritone becomes scratchier by the song, as much a feature of a National performance as it is a bug. And for that reason, \u201cRome\u201d is not the place to make a diehard fan out of a newbie listener. Berninger rarely holds back during a show, and 2023's \u201cSmoke Detector\u201d is one of those songs that devolves into a cacophonic mess of top-of-the-lungs screaming.",
      "The encore features a live-show staple, 2010's \u201cTerrible Love,\u201d during which Berninger typically delights the crowd by trying to body surf as staff frantically try to feed him enough slack on the microphone cord to make the stunt work.",
      "On the closer, \u201cHigh Violet\u201d cut \u201cVanderlyle Crybaby Geeks,\u201d Berninger lets the crowd take the first verse. As the horns from Benjamin Lanz and Kyle Resnick \u2014 frequent tour guests from the band Beirut \u2014 punctuate the breaks, the feel-good melody that belies every anxiety-ridden verse resonates to the end."

      "The Golden Globes nominated more than 40 individual films Monday and yet still managed to overlook quite a bit",
      "The Golden Globes nominated more than 40 individual films Monday \u2014 and yet still managed to overlook quite a bit. That may just be the brutal truth of awards season: The field narrows and suddenly great performances and wonderful films are simply left in the dust.",
      "The Globes have always had quirks, like A-lister tunnel vision, and while there might not be anything quite as glaring as the infamous year of \u201cThe Tourist,\u201d this batch is not without its oddities: Some good, some bad, some simply perplexing.",
      "Here are some of the biggest snubs and surprises from the nominations.",
      "Danielle Deadwyler just can\u2019t catch an awards season break. After being overlooked for \u201cTill\u201d by both the Globes and the Oscars, it seemed likely she\u2019d be recognized for her turn in Malcolm Washington\u2019s adaptation of August Wilson\u2019s \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d (which somehow got no nominations at all). Oscar nominations are still over a month away, however, so perhaps this is the spark needed to remind voters.",
      "It may be fun to needle the Golden Globes, but every once in a while they get something very, very right \u2014 and this year, the proof is in the nominations for \u201cAll We Imagine as Light.\u201d The Indian film from a small distributor is one of those gems that, more often than not, is mainly celebrated by critics groups. And yet here it was nominated not only alongside a truly great batch of films in the international category \u2014 which it won't be at the Oscars because India controversially selected another film to represent the country \u2014 but also in directing, for Payal Kapadia.",
      "For an actor who has received four Golden Globe nominations in her lifetime and one win (\u201cLady Bird\u201d), it was a bit of a shocker that Saoirse Ronan did not receive any this year. She had two major performances in notable films: as a recovering alcoholic in \u201cThe Outrun\u201d and as a mother in wartime London in Steve McQueen\u2019s \u201cBlitz\u201d (also entirely, bafflingly empty-handed). Recognition for both would not have been undeserved.",
      "Sebastian Stan managed to get a supporting and lead nomination for two different roles, however. His lauded portrayal of a young Donald Trump in \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d is not awards season kryptonite, after all (Jeremy Strong was also nominated). Equally exciting is Stan's recognition for \u201cA Different Man,\u201d and yet that also comes with a snub caveat: His breakout co-star Adam Pearson did not get the same.",
      "Another major oversight is Marianne Jean-Baptiste, who delivered the performance of a lifetime in Mike Leigh\u2019s \u201cHard Truths\u201d as Pansy, the very unpleasant, but very quotable English woman with a chip on her shoulder. She has been getting recognition from prominent critics groups \u2014 most recently from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association \u2014 so hopefully all is not lost for other nominations.",
      "Where do we even start with this one? Certainly, when only six are nominated there are going to be some major exclusions, but the absences were glaring, including RaMell Ross (\u201cNickel Boys\u201d), Denis Villeneuve (\u201cDune: Part Two\u201d), Jon M. Chu (\u201cWicked\u201d), Mohammad Rasoulof (\u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig\u201d), and Jesse Eisenberg (\u201cA Real Pain\u201d).",
      "One nomination for \u201cSing Sing,\u201d for Colman Domingo, does not seem sufficient. Though it would have fit well in the best drama category, most glaring is the exclusion of Clarence \u201cDivine Eye\u201d Maclin from supporting. The former inmate was a revelation in this film about incarcerated men who participate in a theater program.",
      "The lead performance category for \u201cmusical or comedy\u201d is, as always, all over the place. Unlike most years, there are actual musicals (Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n for \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d and Cynthia Erivo for \u201cWicked\u201d). While the others might have comedic elements, mostly of the dark or satirical variety, there\u2019s not really a straight comedy in the batch, which is unfortunate in a year when June Squibb delivered such a great comedic performance in \u201cThelma\u201d \u2014 also her first leading role. A real missed opportunity.",
      "Pamela Anderson\u2019s renaissance is in full swing, with a nomination for \u201cThe Last Showgirl\u201d that caught some off guard. She and Brazilian actor Fernanda Torres are up against the likes of heavy hitters like Angelina Jolie, Nicole Kidman, Tilda Swinton and Kate Winslet.",
      "Meryl Streep has been nominated 34 times at the Golden Globes (including receiving the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2017) and yet somehow her delightful turn in \u201cOnly Murders in the Building\u201d was not one of them this year.",
      "The Globes love movie stars, especially the charismatic kinds who put on charm offensives at guild Q&As. Ryan Reynolds may not exactly be an Oscar contender for \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d but he should have been a shoo-in for the Globes. Is it a sign of the reformed times of the Globes 2.0 that he didn\u2019t make the cut? Or perhaps Glen Powell took the high-wattage charm spot this year? Either way, we\u2019ll look forward to an inside joke the next time the merc with a mouth graces our movie theater screens."

      "The new numbers were provided to The Associated Press on Monday, the morning after Swift wrapped the Eras tour with its final show in Vancouver, Canada. Last year, Swift\u2019s landmark tour became the first to cross the billion-dollar mark.",
      "In North America, Swift's tour earned an estimated $1.04 billion over its run. Globally, that number jumps to an estimated $2.2 billion.",
      "\u201cWe are witnessing history in the making. What Taylor Swift and The Eras Tour accomplished in 21 months across five continents before 10 million fans is extraordinary and unprecedented. The tour\u2019s $2.2 billion estimated gross is the highest of all time and nearly doubles the second biggest tour,\u201d said Andy Gensler, editor-in-chief of Pollstar & VenuesNow, in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s also an example of the limits this industry continues to push far past while bringing music, community and peak life experiences to legions across the globe.\u201d",
      "The second biggest tour is Coldplay\u2019s ongoing \u201cMusic of the Spheres\u201d run, currently at an estimated $1.14 billion since March 2022, with more dates to come in 2025.",
      "According to Pollstar's approximations, Coldplay has sold more than 10.3 million tickets; Swift's tour sold just over 10 million, which means she's sold the most tickets of any solo performer.",
      "Pollstar data is pulled from box office reports, venue capacity estimates, historical Pollstar venue ticket sales data, and other undefined research, collected from November 2022 to December 2024.",
      "Additional data will become available in Pollstar\u2019s special year-end issue and on Pollstar.com beginning Friday."

      "The nominations for the Globes, which will be televised by CBS and streamed on Paramount+ on Jan. 5, were announced on Monday morning by Mindy Kaling and Morris Chestnut.",
      "The embattled Globes, which are no longer presented by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, are still in comeback mode after years of scandal and organizational upheaval. Working in the Globes favor this year: a especially starry field of nominees. Zendaya, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Angelina Jolie, Daniel Craig, Denzel Washington, Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo, Glen Powell and Selena Gomez all scored nominations.",

      "While \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and, to a lesser degree, \u201cBarbie,\u201d sailed into the Globes nominations as the clear heavyweights of awards season, no such frontrunner has emerged this year \u2014 and, with the exception of \u201cWicked,\" most of the contenders are far lighter on box office. The Globes don\u2019t often align with the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, a much larger group that far more closely reflects the film industry. But they can give movies a major boost, and ripe fodder for their awards marketing.",
      "Netflix, which acquired \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d after its Cannes Film Festival debut, dominated the nominations, leading all studios in both film nods (13) and in the TV categories (23).",
      "\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\" an operatic genre-skipping movie that combines elements of a narco thriller, a Broadway musical and a trans drama, scored nominations for its three stars: Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Gomez. No comedy or musical has ever received more Globe nominations.",
      "Brady Corbet\u2019s \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d landed seven nominations, including best picture, drama, and acting nods for Adrien Brody and Guy Pearce. The soon-to-be-released film, from A24, is uncommonly ambitious, with a runtime of three-and-a-half hours, including an intermission.",
      "A24 narrowly trailed Netflix in the film categories, scoring 12 nominations overall, including best actor, drama, for Hugh Grant's darkest turn yet in the horror film \u201cHeretic.\u201d Grant, in a statement, thanked the directors, Scott Beck and Bryan Woods \u201cfor spotting my need to kill.\"",
      "Close behind it was Edward Berger\u2019s \u201cConclave,\u201d starring Ralph Fiennes as a cardinal tasked with leading the conclave to elect a new pope. It landed six nominations, including best picture, drama, and acting nods for Fiennes and Isabella Rossellini.",
      "Sean Baker's Palme d'Or-winning \u201cAnora,\u201d starring Mikey Madison as a Brooklyn sex worker who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, was nominated for five awards, including best picture, comedy or musical, and best female actor for Madison and best supporting actor for Yura Borisov.",
      "The Globes will be hosted by comedian Nikki Glaser, who scored her own nomination for best stand-up special. CBS, which began airing the Globes last year on a new deal, will hope Glaser manages to do better than last year\u2019s emcee, Jo Koy, whose stint was widely panned.",
      "The nominees for best motion picture drama are: \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d; \u201cA Complete Unknown,\u201d; \u201cConclave\u201d; \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d; \u201cNickel Boys;\u201d \u201cSeptember 5.\u201d",

      "Coralie Fargeat's gory body horror satire \u201cThe Substance,\" starring Demi Moore as an actress who resorts to extremes to stay young in a Hollywood obsessed with young beauty, landed five nominations overall, including nods for both Moore and her younger doppelganger, Margaret Qualley.",
      "Among animated movies, DreamWorks' \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d also had an especially good day. The tale of the shipwrecked robot came away with four nominations, including one for cinematic and box office achievement, a relatively new category populated by big ticket-sellers like \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2.\u201d The strong showing suggests the other animated nominees \u2014 \u201cFlow,\u201d \u201cInside Out 2,\" \u201cMemoir of a Snail,\" \u201cMoana 2,\" \u201cWallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl\u201d \u2014 may have a hard time besting \u201cThe Wild Robot.\u201d",
      "The Bob Dylan film \u201cA Complete Unknown,\" starring Chalamet, also had a lot to celebrate. Coming off an endorsement from Dylan, himself, the film landed nominations for Chalamet, Edward Norton (who plays Woody Guthrie) and best picture, drama.",
      "Pamela Anderson also landed her first Golden Globe nomination. In \u201cThe Last Showgirl,\u201d Anderson plays an aging Las Vegas showgirl, a performance that's led to the best reviews of Anderson's career.

      "\u201cThe Bear,\u201d which dominated the 2024 Globes, led all series with five nominations for its third season. That included nods for Jeremy Allen White, Ayo Edebiri, Liza Col\u00f3n-Zayas and Ebon Moss-Bachrach. Its stiffest competition this year might come in the FX series \u201cShogun\" (four nominations, including acting nods for Anna Sawai and Hiroyuki Sanada) or Apple TV's \u201cSlow Horses\" (nods for Gary Oldman and Jack Lowden).",
      "\u201cOnly Murders in the Building\u201d again led the comedy or musical category, with nominations for it stars Steve Martin, Martin Short and Gomez, her second nomination to go with hers for \"Emilia P\u00e9rez.\"",
      "The Globes aren\u2019t ever quite drama-free, but things have settled down for the embattled awards body. After The Los Angeles Times reported that the HFPA voters included no Black members, among other issues, most of Hollywood boycotted the show and the 2022 ceremony was scrapped.",
      "Last January's Globes were the first after the disbanding of the HFPA and their acquisition by Dick Clark Productions and billionaire Todd Boehly\u2019s private equity firm Eldridge Industries. However, earlier this fall, the Ankler reported that former members of the HFPA filed a letter with the California attorney general\u2019s office questioning \u201cthe validity of the purchase.\u201d",
      "Though the 2024 Globes were mostly panned, ratings improved. According to Nielsen, some 9.5 million watched, leading CBS to give the show a five-year deal.",
      "Last year, the Globes introduced two new categories that remain this time around: the cinematic and box office achievement award and the best performance in stand-up comedy on television. One tweak this time comes in the lifetime achievement awards. This year, those are going to Ted Danson (for the Carol Burnett Award) and Viola Davis (for the Cecil B. DeMille Award). Those will be handed out in a gala dinner on Friday, Jan. 3, two days before the Globes.",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 22:18:38 -0500",
    "summary": "The Onion's bid to buy conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars returned to a Texas courtroom",
    "story": [
      "The Onion's bid to buy conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars returned to a Texas courtroom",
      "An auction company executive involved in the liquidation of Alex Jones\u2019 conspiracy theory platform Infowars testified for nearly five hours Monday, as a bankruptcy judge in Texas began a hearing into whether The Onion satirical news outlet was properly named the winning bidder over a company affiliated with Jones.",
      "Jeff Tanenbaum, president of ThreeSixty Asset Advisors, was grilled by lawyers for Jones and the company in a Houston courtroom over how The Onion\u2019s bid came to be valued at $7 million and why a live auction was not held. He defended both the value of the bid and its selection after the two sealed offers were opened.",
      "U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez continued the hearing to Tuesday afternoon, when the trustee overseeing the sale of Jones\u2019 assets is expected to take the stand. Lopez could ultimately decide whether to void The Onion\u2019s bid, name the Jones-affiliated company the winner or hold another auction, among other possibilities.",
      "Jones and First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements and submitted the other bid, are alleging fraud and collusion in the auction that concluded on Nov. 14. The trustee and The Onion deny the allegations, accusing Jones and the company of sour grapes.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut. Jones repeatedly called the 2012 shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors and aimed at increasing gun control.",
      "Most of the proceeds from the sale of Infowars, as well as many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, will go to the Sandy Hook families to help satisfy judgments issued by juries and judges in state courts in Connecticut and Texas. Some proceeds will go to Jones\u2019 other creditors.",
      "The Onion, which wants to turn Infowars\u2019 website and social media accounts into parodies, offered $1.75 million for Infowars\u2019 assets in the auction, while First United American Companies bid $3.5 million.",
      "But The Onion\u2019s bid also included a pledge by many of the Sandy Hook families to forgo some or all of the auction proceeds due to them to give other creditors a total of $100,000 more than they would receive under other bids.",
      "The trustee, Christopher Murray, chose The Onion, saying its proposal was better for creditors because they would receive more money. The Onion valued the bid, with the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer, at $7 million, because that amount was equal to a purchase price that would provide the same amount of money to the other creditors.",
      "Tanenbaum testified that he agreed with the $7 million valuation and believed The Onion\u2019s bid conformed to the auction rules.",
      "A lawyer for Jones, Ben Broocks, asked Tanenbaum how it was possible that the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer boosted The Onion\u2019s offer to such a high amount.",
      "\u201cIt means the purchase price value has gone up because another purchase price would have to be higher than that value in order to provide the same net benefit to that group of creditors,\u201d Tanenbaum said.",
      "During his opening argument, Broocks said there was no way The Onion should have been chosen over First United American.",
      "\u201cHow does a $1.75 million bid beat a $3.5 million bid?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow is that $1.75 million greater? Well, it\u2019s voodoo economics to use a phrase.\u201d",
      "Broocks and a lawyer for First United American, Walter Cicack, also questioned why a live bidding round wasn\u2019t held after the sealed offers weren\u2019t submitted, as they said they expected, but the judge\u2019s order made live bidding optional.",
      "Jones has been criticizing the sale process on his show and social media sites, calling it \u201crigged\u201d and a \u201cfraud.\u201d",
      "Joshua Wolfshohl, an attorney for Murray, told the judge Monday that no wrongdoing occurred during the auction. He called the complaints by Jones and First United American Companies unfounded.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of their complaints are just fantastic, imagined conspiracy theories that have no basis in reality,\u201d he said.",
      "Murray, The Onion and the Sandy families deny allegations of wrongdoing. In his own court filing, Murray called the allegations \u201ca disappointed bidder\u2019s improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open auction process.\u201d",
      "Up for sale at the auction were all the equipment and other assets in the Infowars studio in Austin, Texas, as well as its social media accounts, websites, video archive and product trademarks. Jones uses the studio to broadcast his far-right, conspiracy theory-filled shows on the Infowars website, his account on the social platform X and radio stations.",
      "Jones has set up another studio, websites and social media accounts in case The Onion wins approval to buy Infowars and kicks him out. Jones has said he could continue using the Infowars platforms if the auction winner is friendly to him.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights but has acknowledged that the school shooting happened.",
      "On Friday, a Connecticut appeals court reduced by $150 million the original $1.44 billion judgment against Jones in the lawsuit against him in that state, but upheld the rest of the award. Jones\u2019 lawyer said he will ask Connecticut\u2019s highest court to review the appellate ruling. Jones is also appealing a $50 million judgment in a similar Texas defamation lawsuit."

      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d remains at the top of the box office in its second weekend in theaters as it pulled in another record haul",
      "The Walt Disney Co.'s animated film \u201cMoana 2\u201d remained at the top of the box office in its second weekend in theaters as it brought in another record haul.",
      "The film added $52 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. That brings its domestic total to $300 million, surpassing the original, and its global tally to a staggering $600 million.",
      "The amount set a record gross for a movie on the weekend following Thanksgiving weekend, unseating \u201cFrozen II,\u201d which earned $35.2 million in the same time frame in 2019. The numbers are not adjusted for inflation. Originally conceived as a Disney+ series, \u201cMoana 2\u201d has already broken into the top five highest grossing releases of the year. Its performance means Disney has three films in this year's top five, including \u201cInside Out 2\u201d and \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine.\u201d The studio also has another big movie on the way before the year ends: Barry Jenkins' \u201cMufasa,\" out Dec. 20.",
      "The weekend also showcased several new releases, including A24\u2019s horror comedy \u201cY2K\u201d and the Jude Law crime thriller \u201cThe Order.\u201d But nothing was ever going to present significant competition to the enticing Thanksgiving leftovers, \u201cMoana 2,\u201d \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II.\u201d",
      "Second place at the box office was occupied by \u201cWicked,\u201d which added $34.9 million, bringing its domestic total to $320.5 million in three weeks. Globally, the musical adaptation released by Universal is at $455.6 million. \u201cGladiator II\u201d followed in third place with $12.5 million, while \u201cRed One\u201d came in fourth with $7 million.",
      "\u201cThese holdovers are going to create the momentum that\u2019s going to put an $8.5 billion-plus box office year on the horizon,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.",
      "Pre-pandemic, $11 billion had become the annual norm for the movie business. Since then, the closest the industry has gotten to that number was last year, which cracked $9 billion. This year started off slow and up to a few months ago, Dergarabedian said, even hitting $8 billion for the year was in doubt. But in the two weeks since Thanksgiving, the deficit from last year has narrowed by over 5%.",
      "The newcomers struggled to make a significant impact.

      "Celebrities and cultural icons gathered for the Kennedy Center Honors.",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 \u201cNot Fade Away\u201d closed out the Kennedy Center Honors at this year's ceremony, just as honorees The Grateful Dead had used Buddy Holly\u2019s ode to enduring love to close out hundreds of concerts over the years.",
      "The packed house Sunday night danced in the aisles to the bouncy beat after a night of honoring the Dead and other recipients of the lifetime achievement award for artistic accomplishment: director Francis Ford Coppola, jazz trumpeter Arturo Sandoval and singer-songwriter Bonnie Raitt. The venerable Harlem theater The Apollo, which has launched generations of Black artists, also was recognized.",
      "Longtime Deadheads, including actors Miles Teller and Chloe Sevigny and talk show host David Letterman, paid tribute to the band's blend of musical experimentation, longevity and community-building. \u201cTheir music fills the universe,\u201d Letterman proclaimed.",
      "The choice to honor The Apollo was an unusual one: the first time the Kennedy Center has chosen to honor a specific performance venue.",
      "\u201cThe Apollo means so much to so many of us,\" Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said while arriving on the red carpet. Moore pointed to iconic Apollo performances from Lauryn Hill and a young Michael Jackson as treasured memories of his youth.",
      "The tribute to The Apollo highlighted the sheer diversity of art forms showcased at the 90-year-old theater. Savion Glover did a spirited tap dance routine; husband and wife duo The War and Treaty performed a medley of hits by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell; and comedian Dave Chappelle recounted his terrifying first Apollo performance at age 15.",
      "\u201cEverybody started booing. It was like I was outside my body watching,\u201d he said. Eventually Chappelle was rushed off the stage by the theater's infamous \u201cSandman,\u201d but he credited the experience with helping him overcome his fear of bombing.",
      "The annual gala at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts always features personalized tributes with performances and testimonials from fellow artists. Medallions were presented during the traditional Saturday night ceremony at the State Department.",
      "In the first of the night\u2019s tributes, Emmylou Harris and Dave Matthews performed a cover of Raitt\u2019s duet with the late John Prine, \u201cAngel from Montgomery.\u201d",
      "Music star Sheryl Crow paid tribute to Raitt's trailblazing career as not just a singer or songwriter but as a widely respected blues guitarist in a male-dominated field.",
      "\u201cI would not be doing what I'm doing if I had not seen her perform as a 17-year old,\u201d said Crow, who bought her first guitar shortly after seeing Raitt in concert.",
      "Raitt herself, on the pre-event red carpet, predicted an emotional evening.",
      "\u201cI've brought a massive box of Kleenex and my waterproof eye liner,\u201d she laughed.",
      "Coppola received a tribute filled with previous Kennedy Center honorees, including Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese, Al Pacino and George Lucas. All described an iconoclastic and driven auteur who loved to nurture and support younger filmmakers.",
      "\u201cWhat Francis does creatively is jump off cliffs,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cWhen you spend enough time with Francis, you begin to believe you can jump off cliffs, too.\u201d",
      "Sandoval's tribute featured multiple performances from an all-star band featuring Trombone Shorty and pianist Chucho Valdez from Sandoval's original band, plus a flamenco dance performance by Timo Nunez. It also included a bit of light roast comedy from actor Andy Garcia.",
      "\u201cArturo spoke very little English when he first came to America from Cuba all those years ago,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cBut now his English ... is much worse.\u201d",
      "The tribute performances are often kept secret from the recipients themselves, most notably in 2018 when Cyndi Lauper flat out lied to her longtime friend Cher about being unable to attend. Lauper appeared on stage to perform Cher's hit, \u201cIf I Could Turn Back Time.\u201d",
      "At a ceremony at the White House before attending the awards event itself, President Joe Biden praised each honoree. He also had De Niro, who was in the audience, stand before declaring, \u201cIf I get in trouble, I\u2019m coming to you pal.\u201d",
      "De Niro grinned and nodded and others in attendance, including the honorees, laughed at what appeared to be a reference to De Niro sometimes playing hardnosed enforcers in movies like \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d But Biden actually meant he might seek the actor\u2019s help for post-presidency career advice.",
      "\u201cThings are not looking good for February,\u201d Biden joked.",
      "Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris received an extended standing ovation from the audience when introduced at Kennedy Center. But this could be the last honors ceremony without political intrigue for a while.",
      "During Donald Trump's first four years in office, Kennedy Center officials were forced to walk a public tightrope between the tradition of the president attending the ceremony and the open antipathy toward Trump from multiple honorees. In 2017, recipient Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Trump attended. Trump, who takes office in January, skipped the ceremony for the entirety of his first term.",
      "On the red carpet Sunday night, multiple Democratic political figures seemed to offer an olive branch.",
      "\u201cI hope he does come,\u201d Moore said. \"This is a wonderful celebration of genius in all its forms.\"",
      "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi added, \u201cI think he would really enjoy it.\u201d",
      "The awards show will air on CBS on Dec. 22."

    "story": [
      "Each year, celebrities descend on Morocco to attend the Marrakech International Film Festival, enjoy warm weather, luxurious resorts and laud the power of cinema",
      "MARRAKECH, Morocco -- After the movie \u201cCabo Negro\u201d screened at the Marrakech International Film Festival this week, organizers anticipating backlash whisked its crew away and canceled screenwriter-director Abdellah Taia\u2019s scheduled post-film Q&A.",
      "The film \u2014 selected as one of the festival\u2019s 70 features and approved by authorities to be shot in Morocco \u2014 is a queer tale of two young men spending a summer on a beach in the north of the country.",
      "\u201cI am Moroccan. I am gay. And I always have wanted to put the reality of Moroccan gays in cinema,\u201d Taia said, introducing the film at a screening last week. \u201cThe love that I never got growing up, I invented it; I created it; and I put it in \u2018Cabo Negro\u2019 to give it to today\u2019s Moroccan youth.\u201d",
      "Sixteen years after Taia came out in Moroccan media and 11 years after he released his first film with gay protagonists, the subject of \u201cCabo Negro\u201d isn\u2019t new. Nor was his statement out of step with the actors and directors who similarly laud what movies are capable of at the festival.",
      "Yet the chain of events that followed laid bare some of the tensions animating Morocco\u2019s film industry.",
      "When the Marrakech festival rolls out its red carpet each year, movie stars in attendance find sunny winter weather, luxurious resorts and a venue to laud cinema and its power to change minds. This year\u2019s event wrapped up on Saturday and featured stars such as actor Sean Penn and director Luca Guadagnino. But the image that the festival projects about freedoms in Morocco\u2019s film industry often clashes with censorship and economic realities facing filmmakers.",
      "Such tensions have become paramount for the global film industry as new festivals crop up in countries like Saudi Arabia and China, the world\u2019s second largest entertainment industry.",
      "In Morocco, foreign films with sex scenes can screen at the Marrakech Film Festival without issue, yet normally segments that contain kissing in films such as \u201cTitanic\u201d or \u201cSpiderman\u201d are censored on Moroccan television. Audiences can applaud a film about Iran\u2019s repression of nationwide protests in 2022. But Moroccan journalists and activists critical of the government continue to be sentenced to prison time, including as recently as last month. And Moroccan films like \u201cCabo Negro\u201d may be shown, but homosexuality remains outlawed under Morocco\u2019s penal code.",
      "When a video of Taia\u2019s remarks spread in Moroccan media and on social networks, supporters defended his right to freedom of expression while detractors, including a former prime minister, questioned why films about homosexuality were allowed to be screened at all.",
      "The festival\u2019s French-led management team declined to comment about the \u201cCabo Negro\u201d screening or scrapped Q&A but have previously described the festival as a a platform for the region's filmmakers.",
      "\u201cWhat makes the identity of Marrakech unique is it creates a ... space to have prestigious big names of the industry coming very generously to meet the audience and at the same time giving a strong spotlight on new discoveries,\u201d Remi Bonhomme, the festival\u2019s artistic director, said last week. \u201cWe work with this emerging generation of filmmakers from Morocco, the Arab region and the African continent.\u201d",
      "But some have begun to ask about who and what the festival serves.",
      "\u201cThere are people who think the festival is some \u2018bling bling\u2019 thing only for foreigners, only for the country\u2019s marketing,\u201d said Mariam El Ajraoui, a Moroccan film scholar and Abu Dhabi University professor. \u201cThere are others who think that to support local cinema, you have to look abroad.\u201d",
      "Morocco\u2019s film industry has risen to new heights over the past decade, with movies winning awards at the Cannes Film Festival and productions like \u201cGladiator II\u201d shooting in the country.",
      "Despite growth, it remains relatively small domestically. Morocco projects $11 million worth of tickets will be sold in 2024 \u2014 a sum almost double the box office total from a decade ago. Less than half the tickets sold are for Moroccan films.",
      "Morocco\u2019s film authority has offered $5.9 million in support to 32 films this year, roughly $184,000 per movie. Because it often costs more for movies to make it to the screen, the majority of films seek state or private funds outside Morocco, either in Europe or the Middle East. Such a funding landscape boosts films with narratives that can win approval from Moroccan authorities and also appeal to what western producers think about Morocco.",
      "\u201cYou have to get the money either in Morocco or outside Morocco,\u201d said a producer who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions because his films often apply for state funding.",
      "Films that get necessary funding and authorization often thread a fine line. They take on themes like religion, sexuality and the battle between tradition and modernity, but often subtly and without explicit words in the scripts they submit for film permits.",
      "\u201cIf the CCM is against you, you find funding outside. But you still must shoot the movie in Morocco, so you need the \u2018OK\u2019 from the CCM,\u201d the producer added, using the French acronym for Morocco\u2019s film authority.",
      "Taia\u2019s film \u201cCabo Negro\u201d was a low budget endeavor with no state support, but received authorization from CCM.",
      "\u201cWhy not? If there's a population interested in these films, why deprive them?\u201d said CCM director Abdelaziz El Bouzdaini. \u201cThat's what it's like in Morocco. We're a welcoming country.\u201d",
      "Addressing these social issues wins festival placement, international praise and access to foreign funding. But for others like Taia, addressing those very taboos too directly can risk domestic pushback.",
      "The dynamic can also add difficulty for directors aiming to make comedies, thrillers or crime capers.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sort of paradox that I haven\u2019t been able to explain to myself about how the market works. \u2026 Social films that might be less audience-friendly get a lot more spectators,\u201d director Yasmine Benkiran said on a festival panel on Friday.",
      "Filmmakers whose work centers on social issues, regardless of the level of taboo, say their inspirations are straightforward and argue that the themes they cover are part of Moroccan life.",
      "Director Nabil Ayouch\u2019s film \u201cEverybody Loves Touda,\u201d about the struggles of a Moroccan folk singer who moves from an impoverished village to the country\u2019s largest city, premiered at Cannes, was shown at the festival last week and opens in Moroccan theaters on Dec. 11.",
      "His movies have dealt with radicalization, poverty and sexuality, including \u201cMuch Loved,\u201d a film about prostitutes in Marrakech that Morocco banned in 2015. The country has previously submitted six of his movies to be considered for the Oscars\u2019 Best International Feature award.",
      "In the past, some in Morocco have criticized Ayouch\u2019s choice of topics. But he said in an interview that he was inspired by stories and rarely thought about whether subjects may appeal to audiences in Morocco or the West.",
      "\u201cI am trying to be as frank and sincere as I can be when I\u2019m doing my movies,\u201d Ayouch said. \u201cCommon points in my work are a strong interest in people that we don\u2019t especially want to hear or see because it\u2019s much easier to judge them.\u201d"

      "MILAN -- Milan\u2019s Pinacoteca di Brera museum, conceived under Napoleon as a \u201clittle Louvre,\u201d is finally getting a modern art addition first envisioned more than 50 years ago with the opening Sunday of Palazzo Citterio, home to one of the world\u2019s most important collections of 20th century Italian art.",
      "Completing the project long beset by shifting priorities, periods of neglect and most recently an ill-fated architectural vision was a priority for Brera director Angelo Crespi when he took over in January.",
      "Italy's then-culture minister set Dec. 7 \u2014 the feast day for Milan\u2019s patron St. Ambrose \u2014 as the target opening date, giving Crespi just months to resolve structural issues and oversee the installation of hundreds of modern works of art donated to the Brera decades ago.",
      "On deadline, the current culture minister, Alessandro Giuli, who inherited the project in September, inaugurated Palazzo Citterio on Saturday\u2019s feast day, ahead of the public opening on Sunday.",
      "The accelerated timeline after decades of delays \u201cwasn\u2019t to prove something,\" Crespi told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThere was awareness that it needed to be opened,\" he said. \"The question was not just economic, but also ethical. After 52 years, we couldn\u2019t keep such a beautiful building closed simply because of inertia.\u201d",
      "The Palazzo Citterio opening completes a decades-old vision for a \u201cGrande Brera,\u201d which encompasses also the Pinacoteca and the Braidense National Library, just as it takes on greater heft in the Italian cultural landscape.",
      "From Dec. 2, the Grande Brera also incorporated into its fold Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cLast Supper,\u201d arguably Italy\u2019s most famous masterpiece. The fragile wall mural is located in a church complex a kilometer (half a mile) away from the Pinacoteca and Palazzo Citterio.",
      "The merger creates a system of state-run museums in Milan that boosts Brera\u2019s cachet and gives Crespi significant autonomy in their management, including control over 80% of revenue.",
      "Combined, the \u201cLast Supper,\u201d and the Pinacoteca di Brera, receive 1 million visitors a year, and take in more than 10 million euros ($10.5 million) in revenue, Crespi said. As a single entity, they are among the top 10 most-visited sites in Italy.",
      "Crespi hopes to use this greater visibility to promote other institutes in the Brera complex, including the Academy of Fine Arts, botanical gardens and an observatory, while also pitching Milan \u2014 better known for fashion and finance \u2014 as a city of the arts.",
      "Beside the Grande Brera\u2019s vast collections and the \u201cLast Supper,\u201d masterpieces by Michelangelo, Canova, Caravaggio, Raffaello, Bellini, Piero della Francesca and others are displayed in museums and landmarks within walking distance of Milan's central Duomo cathedral. Yet they are often overlooked by visitors.",
      "\u201cAll of the biggest masterpieces and names who made Italian art great over the centuries are concentrated within a few hundred meters,\u201d Crespi said, adding that as an art city, Milan can rival Florence, Rome and Venice.",
      "The Grande Brera should become \u201cthe motor of this narration of Milan as a city of art,\" he said.",
      "By spring, the Pinacoteca di Brera will be linked to Palazzo Citterio, a few minutes' walk away, by a passageway through the botanical gardens behind the museums.",
      "Inside Palazzo Citterio, visitors are greeted by the monumental late 19th century painting \u201cHuman Flood,\u201d by Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo, intended as a bridge from the Pinacoteca's collection that is rich in Italian Renaissance and Baroque art taken from areas conquered by Napoleon's army.",
      "In the new museum, hundreds of artworks donated to the Brera decades ago by the art collectors Emilio Jesi and Lamberto Vitali form \u201ca manual of Italian contemporary art,\u201d with a particular focus on Giorgio Morandi, said curator Marina Gargiulo.",
      "Jesi, who lived in an apartment in the palazzo, focused his collection on painters who were his contemporaries in the 1930-1960s, most of them Italian artists, with notable exceptions including Picasso.",
      "Vitali's tastes were more eclectic, ranging from archaeological artifacts to Byzantine mosaics and art from the medieval era through the 20th century, with paintings by his friend Morandi and by Modigliani, Gargiulo said.",
      "The new museum also includes a series of 152 miniature self-portraits commissioned by Italian neorealistic screenwriter Cesare Zavattini.",
      "Workers were still installing the permanent collection and an exhibition two days before the public opening, and Crespi said his own staff suggested postponing the opening as the date neared. But he held fast.",
      "\u201cOtherwise, we could have entered in a new loop, with more years of other ideas, other projects. It is the right moment and we need to do it,\u201d Crespi said.",
      "For now, the Palazzo Citterio will be open Thursday-Sunday from 2 p.m.-7 p.m., while the Pinacoteca di Brera is open Tuesday-Sunday from 8:30 a.m. until 7:15 p.m. Reservations are recommended for Leonardo\u2019s Last Supper Museum, open from 8:15 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday-Sunday, with a maximum 40 people admitted every 15 minutes."

      "This is the second year ESPN has done an alternate broadcast for an NFL game. It used the characters from \u201cToy Story\u201d for last year\u2019s Sunday morning game from London between the Atlanta Falcons and Jacksonville Jaguars.",
      "\u201cThe Simpsons\u201d has featured many sports-themed episodes during its 35 seasons. Even though \u201cHomer at the Bat\u201d remains the consensus favorite sports episode for many Simpsons fans, there have been football ones such as \u201cBart Star\u201d and \u201cLisa The Greek.\u201d There also was a Super Bowl-themed one after Fox\u2019s broadcast of Super Bowl 33 between Denver and Atlanta in 1999.",
      "Even though \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d remains a staple on Fox\u2019s prime-time schedule, it is part of the Disney family after their acquisition of 20th Century Fox in 2019. All 35 seasons are on Disney+.",
      "The show\u2019s creators have worked with ESPN and the NFL to make sure the look and sound is definitely Simpsonsesque.",
      "The theme song is a mash-up of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d opening and \u201cMonday Night Football\u2019s\u201d iconic \u201cHeavy Action.\u201d",
      "There have also been pre-recorded skits and bits to use during the broadcast featuring Simpson\u2019s legendary voices Hank Azaria, Nancy Cartwright, Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, and Yeardley Smith.",
      "The telecast will be entirely animated, with the players\u2019 movements in sync with what is happening in real-time on the field. That is done through player-tracking data enabled by the NFL\u2019s Next Gen Stats system and Sony\u2019s Beyond Sports Technology.",
      "While Next Gen Stats tracks where players are on the field with a tracking chip in the shoulder pads, there is skeletal data tracking and limb tracking data \u2014 which uses 29 points per player \u2014 to get closer to the player\u2019s movements.",
      "The other data tracking will allow Beyond Sports and Disney to add special characters to the game. For example, there might be a play where Lisa catches the ball and goes 30 yards instead of Cincinnati\u2019s Tee Higgins.",
      "\u201cLisa is much smaller than the rest of the players. So, in real life, the ball would go over her head, but now, with data processing, we can take the ball and make it go exactly into her hands. So for the viewer, it still looks believable, and it all makes sense,\u201d said Beyond Sports co-founder Nicolaas Westerhof.",
      "The other major challenge is making \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d two-dimensional cartoon characters into 3-D simulations. Szykowny and his team worked to make that a reality over the past couple of months.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a big leap of faith for them to say, hey, we trust you to make our characters 3-D and work with it. Our ESPN creative studio team has done a wonderful job,\u201d Szykowny said.",
      "Lisa, Krusty, Nelson, Milhouse and Ralph will be with Bart and the Bengals; while Carl, Barney, Lenny and Moe join up with with Homer and the Cowboys.",
      "The broadcast will also feature ESPN personalities Stephen A. Smith, Peyton Manning and Eli Manning.",
      "ESPN\u2019s Drew Carter, Mina Kimes and Dan Orlovsky will call the game from Bristol, Connecticut, and also be animated. They will wear Meta Quest Pro headsets to experience the game from Springfield using VR technology.",
      "For Kimes, being part of the broadcast and being an animated Simpsons character is a dream come true. She is a massive fan of the show and has a framed photo of Lisa Simpson \u2014 who she said is a personal hero and icon \u2014 as part of her backdrop when she makes appearances on ESPN NFL shows from her home in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have any input, and I didn\u2019t see anything beforehand, so I wasn\u2019t sure if it would look like me, but it kind of does, which is very funny,\u201d said Kimes, who drew Simpsons characters when she was a kid. \u201cTo see the actual staff turn me into one was a dream.\u201d",
      "Even though the Bengals (4-8) and Cowboys (5-7) have struggled this season, Selman thinks both teams have personalities that appeal to \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d universe.",
      "\u201cWe were just so lucky also that the Cowboys are sort of like a Homer Simpson-type team, American team, and Mike McCarthy might be a Homer-type guy, one might imagine,\u201d he said. \u201dAnd then you have Joe Burrow on the other side who is a cool young, spiky-haired, blonde bad boy -- he\u2019s like Bart. And that fits our character archetypes so perfectly.",
      "\u201cIf Homer is mad at Bart and has a hot dog dream while watching \u2019Monday Night Football\u2019, and then it\u2019s basically McCarthy versus Burrow, Homer versus Bart, and that\u2019s the simple father versus son strangling \u2014 Homer strangling Bart dynamic that has been part of the show for 35 years. I don\u2019t know if that would have worked as well if it was like Titans versus Jacksonville. We would have found something. We would have made it work.\u201d",

      "Court records show New York prosecutors have charged a man with murder in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO",
      "ALTOONA, Pa. -- After UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO was gunned down on a New York sidewalk, police searched for the masked gunman with dogs, drones and scuba divers. Officers used the city's muscular surveillance system. Investigators analyzed DNA samples, fingerprints and internet addresses. Police went door-to-door looking for witnesses.",
      "When an arrest came five days later, those sprawling investigative efforts shared credit with an alert civilian's instincts. A Pennsylvania McDonald's customer noticed another patron who resembled the man in the oblique security-camera photos that New York police had publicized.",
      "Luigi Nicholas Mangione, a 26-year-old Ivy League graduate from a prominent Maryland real estate family, was arrested Monday in the killing of Brian Thompson, who headed one of the United States\u2019 largest medical insurance companies.",
      "He remained jailed in Pennsylvania, where he was initially charged with possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police. By late evening, prosecutors in Manhattan had added a charge of murder, according to an online court docket. He's expected to be extradited to New York eventually.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether Mangione has an attorney who can comment on the allegations. Asked at Monday's arraignment whether he needed a public defender, Mangione asked whether he could \u201canswer that at a future date.\u201d",
      "Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after the McDonald's customer recognized him and notified an employee, authorities said. Police in Altoona, about 233 miles (375 kilometers) west of New York City, were soon summoned.",
      "They arrived to find Mangione sitting at a table in the back of the restaurant, wearing a blue medical mask and looking at a laptop, according to a Pennsylvania police criminal complaint.",
      "He initially gave them a fake ID, but when an officer asked Mangione whether he\u2019d been to New York recently, he \u201cbecame quiet and started to shake,\u201d the complaint says.",
      "When he pulled his mask down at officers' request, \u201cwe knew that was our guy,\u201d rookie Officer Tyler Frye said at a news conference in Hollidaysburg.",
      "New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at a Manhattan news conference that Mangione was carrying a gun like the one used to kill Thompson and the same fake ID the shooter had used to check into a New York hostel, along with a passport and other fraudulent IDs.",
      "NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said Mangione also had a three-page, handwritten document that shows \u201csome ill will toward corporate America.\"",
      "A law enforcement official who wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity said the document included a line in which Mangione claimed to have acted alone.",
      "\u201cTo the Feds, I\u2019ll keep this short, because I do respect what you do for our country. To save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly that I wasn\u2019t working with anyone,\u201d the document said, according to the official.",
      "It also had a line that said, \u201cI do apologize for any strife or traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites simply had it coming.\u201d",
      "Pennsylvania prosecutor Peter Weeks said in court that Mangione was found with a passport and $10,000 in cash \u2014 $2,000 of it in foreign currency. Mangione disputed the amount.",
      "Thompson, 50, was killed last Wednesday as he walked alone to a midtown Manhattan hotel for an investor conference. Police quickly came to see the shooting as a targeted attack by a gunman who appeared to wait for Thompson, came up behind him and fired a 9 mm pistol.",
      "Investigators have said \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were written on ammunition found near Thompson\u2019s body. The words mimic a phrase used to criticize the insurance industry.",
      "From surveillance video, New York investigators gathered that the shooter fled by bike into Central Park, emerged, then took a taxi to a northern Manhattan bus terminal.",
      "Once in Pennsylvania, he went from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, \u201ctrying to stay low-profile\u201d by avoiding cameras, Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said.",
      "A grandson of a wealthy, self-made real estate developer and philanthropist, Mangione is a cousin of a current Maryland state legislator. Mangione was valedictorian at his elite Baltimore prep school, where his 2016 graduation speech lauded his classmates\u2019 \u201cincredible courage to explore the unknown and try new things.\u201d",
      "He went on to earn undergraduate and graduate degrees in computer science in 2020 from the University of Pennsylvania, a spokesperson said.",
      "\u201cOur family is shocked and devastated by Luigi\u2019s arrest,\u201d Mangione\u2019s family said in a statement posted on social media late Monday by his cousin, Maryland lawmaker Nino Mangione. \u201cWe offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved.\u201d",
      "Luigi Nicholas Mangione worked for a time for the car-buying website TrueCar and left in 2023, CEO Jantoon Reigersman said by email.",
      "From January to June 2022, Mangione lived at Surfbreak, a \u201cco-living\u201d space at the edge of Honolulu tourist mecca Waikiki.",
      "Like other residents of the shared penthouse catering to remote workers, Mangione underwent a background check, said Josiah Ryan, a spokesperson for owner and founder R.J. Martin.",
      "\u201cLuigi was just widely considered to be a great guy. There were no complaints,\u201d Ryan said. \"There was no sign that might point to these alleged crimes they\u2019re saying he committed.\u201d",
      "At Surfbreak, Martin learned Mangione had severe back pain from childhood that interfered with many aspects of his life, from surfing to romance, Ryan said.",
      "\u201cHe went surfing with R.J. once but it didn\u2019t work out because of his back,\" Ryan said, but noted that Mangione and Martin often went together to a rock-climbing gym.",
      "Mangione left Surfbreak to get surgery on the mainland, Ryan said, then later returned to Honolulu and rented an apartment.",
      "Martin stopped hearing from Mangione six months to a year ago.",
      "Although the gunman obscured his face during the shooting, he left a trail of evidence in New York, including a backpack he ditched in Central Park, a cellphone found in a pedestrian plaza, a water bottle and a protein bar wrapper.",
      "In the days after the shooting, the NYPD collected hundreds of hours of surveillance video and released multiple clips and still images in hopes of enlisting the public\u2019s eyes to help find a suspect.",

    "summary": "A federal appeals court is expected to hear arguments over whether Idaho should be prohibited from enforcing a strict abortion ban during medical emergencies when a pregnant patient&rsquo;s life or health is at risk",
    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court is expected to hear arguments over whether Idaho should be prohibited from enforcing a strict abortion ban during medical emergencies when a pregnant patient\u2019s life or health is at risk",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- A federal appeals court is expected to hear arguments Tuesday afternoon over whether Idaho should be prohibited from enforcing a strict abortion ban during medical emergencies when a pregnant patient's life or health is at risk.",
      "The state law makes it a felony to perform an abortion unless the procedure is necessary to prevent the death of the patient. President Biden\u2019s administration sued Idaho two years ago, contending the law violates a federal rule called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA, because it prevents doctors from performing abortions that save their patients from serious infections, organ loss or other major medical issues.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court heard the case earlier this year, but bounced it back to the lower court on a procedural issue, leaving unanswered questions about the legality of the state abortion ban.",
      "Idaho officials have argued in court filings that the state abortion ban doesn\u2019t violate EMTALA. Instead, they say the fetus or embryo should be considered a patient with protections under EMTALA as well. They also argue that doctors have enough wiggle room under the law to use their best judgment about when to treat pregnant people with life-threatening medical conditions.",
      "\u201cTaking EMTALA for what it actually says, there is no direct conflict with Idaho\u2019s Defense of Life Act,\u201d attorneys representing the Idaho Legislature wrote in court filings earlier this month. \u201cNothing in EMTALA requires physicians to violate state law. And nothing in Idaho law \u2014 whether in EMTALA-covered circumstances or beyond \u2014 denies medical care to pregnant women.\u201d",
      "About 50,000 people in the U.S. develop life-threatening complications during pregnancy each year. Those complications can include major blood loss, sepsis, or the loss of reproductive organs. In rare cases, doctors might need to terminate a pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant person, especially in cases where there is no chance for a fetus to survive.",
      "But some state abortion bans have made medical decisions that once seemed clear feel particularly fraught for emergency room physicians. Complaints that pregnant patients were turned away from U.S. emergency rooms spiked in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.",
      "\u201cThese harms are not hypothetical,\u201d Idaho's largest hospital system, St. Luke's Health System, wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief in October. \u201cIn all of 2023, before Idaho's law went into effect, only one pregnant patient presenting to St. Luke\u2019s with a medical emergency was airlifted out of state for care. Yet in the few months when Idaho\u2019s new abortion law was in effect, six pregnant St. Luke\u2019s patients with medical emergencies were transferred out of state for termination of their pregnancy.\u201d",
      "One of those patients had severe preeclampsia \u2014 a condition that causes dangerously high blood pressure that can be fatal if untreated \u2014 and the others had premature rupture of their membranes, putting them at risk of life-threatening infections, St. Luke's said.",
      "\u201cThe stakes could not be higher,\u201d ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project Deputy Director Alexa Kolbi-Molinas said Monday. She noted recent news reports in Texas about women who died after being denied appropriate treatments for incomplete miscarriages. \u201cThe reality is, exceptions don't work. They don't actually protect the health and rights of pregnant people regardless of what is written on the page, and that is just the reality when you threaten physicians with criminal penalties.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "California lawmakers will consider a bill to require labels on social media platforms warning of their effects on young people\u2019s lives",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California, home to some of the largest technology companies in the world, would be the first U.S. state to require mental health warning labels on social media sites if lawmakers pass a bill introduced Monday.",
      "The legislation sponsored by state Attorney General Rob Bonta is necessary to bolster safety for children online, supporters say, but industry officials vow to fight the measure and others like it under the First Amendment. Warning labels for social media gained swift bipartisan support from dozens of attorneys general, including Bonta, after U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called on Congress to establish the requirements earlier this year, saying social media is a contributing factor in the mental health crisis among young people.",
      "\u201cThese companies know the harmful impact their products can have on our children, and they refuse to take meaningful steps to make them safer,\u201d Bonta said at a news conference Monday. \u201cTime is up. It\u2019s time we stepped in and demanded change.\u201d",
      "State officials haven't provided details on the bill, but Bonta said the warning labels could pop up once weekly.",
      "Up to 95% of youth ages 13 to 17 say they use a social media platform, and more than a third say that they use social media \u201calmost constantly,\u201d according to 2022 data from the Pew Research Center. Parents\u2019 concerns prompted Australia to pass the world\u2019s first law banning social media for children under 16 in November.",
      "\u201cThe promise of social media, although real, has turned into a situation where they\u2019re turning our children\u2019s attention into a commodity,\u201d Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, who authored the California bill, said Monday. \u201cThe attention economy is using our children and their well-being to make money for these California companies.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers instead should focus on online safety education and mental health resources, not warning label bills that are \u201cconstitutionally unsound,\u201d said Todd O\u2019Boyle, a vice president of the tech industry policy group Chamber of Progress.",
      "\u201cWe strongly suspect that the courts will set them aside as compelled speech,\u201d O\u2019Boyle told The Associated Press.",
      "Victoria Hinks' 16-year-old daughter, Alexandra, died by suicide four months ago after being \u201cled down dark rabbit holes\u201d on social media that glamorized eating disorders and self-harm. Hinks said the labels would help protect children from companies that turn a blind eye to the harm caused to children\u2019s mental health when they become addicted to social media platforms.",
      "\u201cThere's not a bone in my body that doubts social media played a role in leading her to that final, irreversible decision,\u201d Hinks said. \u201cThis could be your story.\"",
      "Common Sense Media, a sponsor of the bill, said it plans to lobby for similar proposals in other states.",
      "California in the past decade has positioned itself as a leader in regulating and fighting the tech industry to bolster online safety for children.",
      "The state was the first in 2022 to bar online platforms from using users\u2019 personal information in ways that could harm children. It was one of the states that sued Meta in 2023 and TikTok in October for deliberately designing addictive features that keep kids hooked on their platforms.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, also signed several bills in September to help curb the effects of social media on children, including one to prohibit social media platforms from knowingly providing addictive feeds to children without parental consent and one to limit or ban students from using smartphones on school campus.",
      "Federal lawmakers have held hearings on child online safety and legislation is in the works to force companies to take reasonable steps to prevent harm. The legislation has the support of X owner Elon Musk and the President-elect\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr. Still, the last federal law aimed at protecting children online was enacted in 1998, six years before Facebook\u2019s founding."

      "As Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet begins to take shape, the nominees offer a preview of how his administration might handle abortion after he repeatedly flip-flopped on the issue on the campaign trail",
      "CHICAGO -- As Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet begins to take shape, those on both sides of the abortion debate are watching closely for clues about how his picks might affect reproductive rights policy in the president-elect\u2019s second term.",
      "Trump\u2019s cabinet picks offer a preview of how his administration could handle abortion after he repeatedly flip-flopped on the issue on the campaign trail. He attempted to distance himself from anti-abortion allies by deferring to states on abortion policy, even while boasting about nominating three Supreme Court justices who helped strike down the constitutional protections for abortion that had stood for half a century.",
      "In an NBC News interview that aired Sunday, Trump said he doesn't plan to restrict medication abortion but also seemed to leave the door open, saying \u201cthings change.\u201d",
      "\u201cThings do change, but I don't think it's going to change at all,\u201d he said.",
      "The early lineup of his new administration, including nominations to lead health agencies, the Justice Department and event the Department of Veterans Affairs, has garnered mixed \u2014 but generally positive \u2014 reactions from anti-abortion groups.",
      "Abortion law experts said Trump's decision to include fewer candidates with deep ties to the anti-abortion movement could indicate that abortion will not be a priority for Trump's administration.",
      "\u201cIt almost seems to suggest that President Trump might be focusing his administration in other directions,\" said Greer Donley, an associate law professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law.",
      "Karen Stone, vice president of public policy at Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said while many of the nominees have \u201cextensive records against reproductive health care,\u201d some do not. She cautioned against making assumptions based on Trump's initial cabinet selections.",
      "Still, many abortion rights groups are wary, in part because many of the nominees hold strong anti-abortion views even if they do not have direct ties to anti-abortion activists. They're concerned that an administration filled with top-level officials who are personally opposed to abortion could take steps to restrict access to the procedure and funding.",
      "After Trump\u2019s ambiguity about abortion during his campaign, \"there\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know about what policy is going to look like,\" said Mary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law. That approach may be revealed as the staffs within key departments are announced.",
      "Trump announced he would nominate anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Health and Human Services Department, which anti-abortion forces have long targeted as central to curtailing abortion rights nationwide. Yet Kennedy shifted on the issue during his own presidential campaign.",
      "In campaign videos, Kennedy said he supports abortion access until viability, which doctors say is sometime after 21 weeks, although there is no defined timeframe. But he also said \u201cevery abortion is a tragedy\u201d and argued for a national ban after 15 weeks of pregnancy, a stance he quickly walked back.",
      "The head of Health and Human Services oversees Title X funding for a host of family planning services and has sweeping authority over agencies that directly affect abortion access, including the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Vought was a key architect of Project 2025, a right-wing blueprint for running the federal government.

He made his way to a bus station that offers commuter service to New Jersey and routes to the East Coast, police said.",

      "Winter is a great time to experiment with new food preparations and flavors to keep your meals nutritious and interesting",
      "Winter is settling in across much of the U.S., erasing the freshness and vibrancy of months past.",
      "But the chilly season doesn't have to usher in weeks of lifeless, colorless dinner plates.",
      "Dieticians and food experts say winter is a great time to experiment with your food, try out underappreciated seasonal produce and cook a healthy meal for loved ones.",
      "\u201cEmbrace the cold, embrace the winter and appreciate the bounty,\u201d said Kristen Rasmussen, a culinary dietician and chef who teaches at the University of California Berkeley.",
      "Here are tips from nutrition experts on how to \u201cwinterize\u201d your meals.",
      "Only 1 in 10 Americans eat the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables each day, data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows.",
      "Staple fruits and vegetables are generally available year-around in the grocery store, but it's also peak season for certain types of produce.",
      "Citrus fruits are among those fresh in winter \u2014 lemons, limes, oranges and more. When it comes to root vegetables, pull sweet potatoes and pumpkin out of Thanksgiving deserts and into savory meals and snacks. Try out parsnips, beets and radishes, too.",
      "And don't forget those winter greens: Rasmussen recommends including more members of the chicory family like radicchio, escarole and endive. (These can be on the bitter side, so they might be an acquired taste.) You can also test out different types of kale and the leafy tops of root vegetables, like radish greens.",
      "If fresh options are limited, experts say canned and frozen fruits and vegetables still have a lot of nutritional value, as long as you don't overcook them. Also make sure they don't have a lot of added salt or fat.",
      "Dried fruits \u2014 think apricots, dates and raisins \u2014 and nuts are also great to bring into salads, bakes and more.",
      "\u201cWithout a doubt, there's a lot of nutritional benefit, even in dried (fruits),\u201d said Linda Van Horn, a clinical nutrition epidemiologist at Northwestern University.",
      "Soups, stews and porridges span history and cultures. They are a great way to build out a well-rounded meal. They're also easily adaptable to any flavor palate, easy to make and great to freeze.",
      "Plus, you can throw just about anything in them.",
      "\u201cThe benefit of it is that it's all contained,\u201d Van Horn said, noting nutrients that leak out of the ingredients while cooking stay in the broth.",
      "These cozy meals are also a great way to try out different beans and legumes, which Rasmussen called a \u201cnutritional powerhouse.\u201d They're also affordable, accessible and an excellent source of plant-protein and fiber said Alicia Henson, a pediatric clinical dietician at the University of California San Francisco's Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital.",
      "Meanwhile, porridges \u2014 at breakfast and beyond \u2014 are a great way to try out different grains and lend themselves as a base to any cultural flavor, from congee to atole to overnight oats.",
      "\u201cYou can make it savory or sweet, you can put leftovers on top, lemon or salsa macha, chili oil or an egg,\" Rasmussen said. \"There's so much versatility.\u201d",
      "When it comes to flavor, let rosemary, thyme, nutmeg and star anise shine all winter \u2014 not just for a holiday meal.",
      "Spices and herbs are a great source of flavor and nutrition. For example, turmeric is known to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits. Some spices have more research on them than others, Rasmussen said. But they're worth still worth experimenting with in meals, experts agreed.",
      "Liven up snacks and drinks with spices, from smoky chilies to so-called \u201cwarming\u201d spices \u2014 cloves, ginger and cumin.",
      "Adding aromatic spices to teas can be great in the winter, whether you're grating your own ginger into the cup or popping in a tea bag, said Susan Aaronson, director of dietetics education at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health. Spices are also great to add to plain popcorn and other snacks \u2014 and a way to avoid extra salt and fats that often come in pre-made options.",
      "Winter can be particularly isolating for some people, so eat seasonally with friends and family beyond the holidays.",
      "Eating things that are in season can help people connect with the sources of their food and the environment, as well as learn about other cultures and take pride in their own, experts said.",
      "For nearly a decade, Aaronson and some friends meet for a \u201csoup group,\u201d where they share and eat \u201cexperimental\u201d soups they've each made through the fall and winter.",
      "\u201cIt's just a fun way to socialize and try new things,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "People with substance use disorder are not getting a direct say on how most opioid settlement money is used",
      "People with substance use disorder across the country are not getting a formal say in how most of the approximately $50 billion in opioid lawsuit settlement money is being used to stem the crisis, a new analysis found.",
      "Some advocates say that is one factor in why portions of the money are going to efforts they don't consider to be proven ways to save lives from overdose, including equipment to scan jail inmates for contraband, drug-sniffing police dogs and systems to neutralize unneeded prescription medications.",
      "In Jackson County, West Virginia, officials voted earlier this year to use more than $500,000 in settlement funds for a first-responder training center and a shooting range. They also allocated $35,000 to a quick response team that works with overdose survivors.",
      "Josh George, who has been in recovery for three years after 23 years of drug use, primarily heroin, now runs a recovery group with his wife and other family members.",
      "Some of the money could have gone to the county's only recovery house, he said.",
      "\u201cAll these people were doing it on their own dime,\" George said, \u201ctrying to help these people.\u201d",
      "Over the past eight years, drugmakers, wholesalers, pharmacy chains and other companies have agreed to settlements to resolve thousands of lawsuits filed by state, local and Native American tribal governments claiming the companies\u2019 practices contributed to the crisis.",
      "Opioids have been a major problem in the U.S. since the late 1990s, with the deadliest stretch earlier this decade reaching more than 80,000 annually. The major causes have shifted from prescription pills to heroin to fentanyl and other lab-produced substances often added to other illicit drugs.",
      "Funds from the multi-billion dollar nationwide settlements began rolling out in 2022 and will continue until at least 2038. The agreements require most of the money be used to fight the crisis but offer great flexibility in how to do it.",
      "Christine Minhee of Opioid Settlement Tracker and Vital Strategies, a public health organization, released a state-by-state guide on Monday outlining how government funding decisions are being made. The guide aims to help advocates know where to raise their voices.",
      "Using that information and other data, Minhee, who has tallied just under $50 billion in settlements excluding one with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma that the Supreme Court rejected, found advisory groups help determine spending of about half of it. But they have decision-making authority over less than one-fifth of it.",
      "Less than $1 in $7 is overseen by boards that reserve at least one seat for someone who is using or has used drugs, though some places where it's not required may have such members anyway.",
      "Brandon Marshall, a professor of epidemiology at the Brown University School of Public Health and a former member of the Rhode Island Opioid Settlement Advisory Committee, said he has observed that processes involving experts and people with drug use experience have made quick allocations to groups working on harm reduction and other areas because they know the groups.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just a way to ensure that the funds are used effectively,\u201d he said. \u201cThose kinds of systems are also ensuring the funds are getting out the door faster.\u201d",
      "Public health advocates say the money should be used in ways proven to save lives, prevent drug use and focus on racial equity and that the decisions should be transparent.",
      "But many communities are following regular government spending practices rather than assessing local needs or consulting with experts or people impacted by the epidemic.",
      "Renville County, Minnesota, used $100,000 in settlement money to pay about two-thirds of the cost of a body scanner for the county jail to detect drugs on incoming inmates, even if they have swallowed bags of them.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly tell me that whoever made those decisions thinks that\u2019s the best use of the funding,\u201d said Alicia House, executive director of the Steve Rummler Hope Network, which provides overdose prevention and education across Minnesota.",
      "Renville County Sheriff Scott Hable said in an interview that keeping drugs out of the jail \u2014 without subjecting people entering to strip searches \u2014 fits with the facility\u2019s emphasis on treatment for inmates with substance use disorder.",
      "The scanner has been used nearly 1,400 times since last year, identifying contraband in six cases. Twice, it found packets of drugs inmates swallowed before entering, he said.",
      "The county\u2019s governing body made the spending decision. Sara Benson, the county\u2019s public health director, said the government is assembling an advisory group for future settlement use and wants to include people with lived experience.",
      "In West Virginia, Jackson County Commission President Dick Waybright said the training center will help law enforcement, EMS and 911 employees respond to the opioid crisis.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn't just be throwing money to a program that wasn\u2019t going to last,\u201d he said in an interview. Besides, he said, no one else besides the quick response team requested funds from the first opioid settlement payment.",
      "George's mother, Kelly DeWees, said there are many needs in an area hit hard by addiction, including transportation for people in recovery, prevention education and counseling for children of those with substance use disorder. Breath of Life, the group her son and daughter-in-law run, could use help launching a recovery home.",
      "The group is requesting the $15,000 that currently remains in the county\u2019s fund and Waybright said he expects it to be awarded to them soon.",
      "For others, the spending decisions are even more personal.",
      "Tonia Ahern, a community coordinator for the National Center for Advocacy and Recovery, lost her son to an overdose when he was 29. She co-founded a group planning to produce a handbook of suggestions for New Jersey communities on how to use the funding.",
      "\u201cIf you haven\u2019t ever experienced it, you have no idea what they need,\u201d Ahern said."

      "After African countries struggled to get testing kits during the COVID-19 pandemic, officials vowed to make the continent less dependent on imported medical supplies",
      "TAMESNA, Morocco -- After African countries struggled to get testing kits during the COVID-19 pandemic, officials vowed to make the continent less dependent on imported medical supplies. Now, in a first for Africa, a Moroccan company is filling orders for mpox tests as an outbreak continues.",
      "Moroccan startup Moldiag began developing mpox tests after the World Health Organization declared the virus a global emergency in August. Africa\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported more than 59,000 mpox cases and 1,164 deaths in 20 countries this year.",
      "The WHO has also announced a plan to provide mpox tests, vaccines and treatments to the most vulnerable people in the world\u2019s poorest countries, after facing criticism for moving too slowly on vaccines. It recommends all suspected mpox cases be tested.",
      "But in some far-flung areas of the mpox outbreak, tests have to be delivered to distant labs for processing. Most of Congo\u2019s 26 provinces don\u2019t have such facilities. And some areas have no tests. In eastern Congo\u2019s South Kivu province, doctors are still diagnosing patients by taking temperatures and looking for visible symptoms.",
      "That makes it difficult to tell how the virus is spreading, health officials say.",
      "\"This is a major problem,\u201d said Musole Robert, medical director of the Kavumu Referral Hospital, one of the few treating mpox patients in eastern Congo. \u201cThe main issue remains the laboratory, which is not adequately equipped.\u201d",
      "Mpox primarily spreads through close skin-to-skin contact with infected people or their soiled clothes or bedsheets. It often causes visible skin lesions. A health worker swabs the rash and sends the sample to a lab. Mpox testing is critical because many symptoms resemble diseases like chicken pox or measles.",
      "When mpox cases were found in some Western countries like the United States in 2022, some companies began developing rapid test kits that don\u2019t require lab processing. But they shelved those efforts when the virus was largely contained.",
      "Then outbreaks emerged again in Africa. Scientists are concerned by the spread of a new version of the disease that might be more easily transmitted among people.",
      "Morocco has reported three mpox cases, though most have been in central Africa.",
      "At his factory in Morocco, Moldiag founder and chief scientific officer Abdeladim Moumen said the tests they make \u2014 sold for $5 each \u2014 can help to remedy shortages affordably.",
      "The company last month began accepting orders from Burundi, Uganda and Congo and has also sold them to Senegal and Nigeria as well.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s rather easy to send tests from an African nation to another one rather than waiting for tests to come in from China or Europe,\u201d Moumen said.",
      "Moldiag was founded out of Morocco\u2019s Foundation for Advanced Science, Innovation and Research, a university-affiliated nonprofit whose research has received funding from the European Commission and Morocco\u2019s government. The startup previously developed similar genetic tests for COVID-19 and tuberculosis.",
      "Moldiag won approval to distribute its mpox tests from the Africa CDC in November. But it hasn't submitted paperwork to be considered for expedited approval from the WHO, which during this outbreak has approved three mpox tests and is considering five others. Each is made in North America, Europe or Asia.",
      "The Africa CDC\u2019s acting director for laboratory diagnostics and systems, Yenew Tebeje, said the organization created a process to accelerate approval of tests like Moldiag\u2019s because the WHO\u2019s approval process can take months or years and \u201cbe a limiting factor for access to diagnostics.\u201d",
      "Historically, international institutions have not always ensured medical supplies like tests are quickly made available for crises in Africa, Tebeje added.",
      "Only mpox tests that require laboratory processing have been approved by the WHO and Africa CDC, which has expressed the need for rapid tests that don't need to be sent to labs.",
      "Moldiag and other companies are working to develop rapid tests and pursue approval.",
      "Moldiag's $5 price for the current tests aligns with recommendations from both the WHO's target product standards and demands of health advocates who have criticized the cost of other tests. The nonprofit Public Citizen last month called on Cepheid \u2014 one of the WHO's three approved mpox test manufacturers \u2014 to reduce its price from about $20 to $5, citing a Doctors Without Borders analysis showing genetic tests can be produced for less.",
      "Africa-based manufacturing fulfills a primary objective that African Union member states agreed on after the COVID-19 pandemic, which revealed global disparities and unequal access to medical supplies, including vaccines, tests and antiviral medications.",
      "In 2022, shaken by the pandemic, African leaders called for action to address those disparities plaguing the continent's over 1.4 billion people, who experience the highest incidence of public health emergencies.",
      "Moumen said experts were waking up to the fact that it makes more sense for tests to come from regions where outbreaks are taking place so manufacturers can tailor production to address issues close to home.",
      "\"They want African tests for Africa,\" he said.",

      "Some residents of seven Louisiana nursing homes who were sent to ride out 2021's Hurricane Ida in a warehouse are being offered shares of a nearly $9 million settlement",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Some of the elderly residents of seven Louisiana nursing homes who were sent in 2021 to ride out Hurricane Ida in a crowded, ill-equipped warehouse are being offered shares of a nearly $9 million settlement after they sued.",
      "Retired state judge William \u201cRusty\u201d Knight told The Times-Picayune of New Orleans that all the 427 former residents who filed legal claims are being sent letters outlining the proposed settlement. Knight said amounts differ based on patients' individual circumstances.",
      "People who don't contest the amount offered can expect to receive money within a few weeks. A hearing for those who want to fight the settlement will be held in January.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a longer road getting here than we wanted it to be,\u201d Knight said. \u201cNobody\u2019s getting what they should. quite frankly, because there\u2019s not enough money.\u201d",
      "Bob Dean Jr., 70, owned seven nursing homes in New Orleans and southeast Louisiana. As Ida approached, Dean moved hundreds of residents into a building in the town of Independence, roughly 70 miles (110 kilometers) northwest of New Orleans.",
      "Authorities said conditions at the warehouse deteriorated rapidly after the powerful storm hit on Aug. 29, 2021. They found ill and elderly bedridden people on mattresses on the wet floor, some crying for help, some lying in their own waste. Civil suits against Dean\u2019s corporation said the ceiling leaked and toilets overflowed at the sweltering warehouse, and there was too little food and water.",
      "Within days after the storm hit, the state reported the deaths of seven of the evacuees, five of them classified as storm-related.",
      "By the time Dean was arrested on state charges in June 2022, he had lost state licenses and federal funding for his nursing homes. Dean pleaded no contest to 15 criminal counts in July and was sentenced to three years of probation, paying $258,000 in restitution and more than $1 million as a penalty.",
      "Last month, Dean agreed to pay $8.2 million to the federal government to settle allegations that he misused assets and income from four nursing homes whose loans were insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Prosecutors say he funneled nursing home money to his personal bank accounts, using the money to buy antiques, guns and cars.",
      "But Dean also faced civil lawsuits or legal claims from 427 of the 843 patients who were taken to Independence, or their surviving relatives. Many of the plaintiffs and their lawyers have suggested Dean was hiding other assets.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no true justice after what my clients endured,\u201d attorney Matthew Hemmer, who represents hundreds of nursing home victims, told WVUE-TV.",
      "Knight said he knows of 165 of Dean's former residents who have died since the evacuation, and he said he expects to learn more people have died as responses to the settlement offer are returned."

      "Nearly four days after the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, police still do not know the gunman\u2019s name or whereabouts or have a motive for the killing",
      "NEW YORK -- The gunman who killed the CEO of the largest U.S. health insurer likely left New York City on a bus soon after the brazen ambush that has shaken corporate America, police officials said. But he left something behind: a backpack that was discovered in Central Park.",
      "Nearly four days after the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, police still did not know the gunman\u2019s name or whereabouts or have a motive for the killing. Investigators were looking at whether the shooter may have been a disgruntled employee or client of the insurer, Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told reporters.",
      "The FBI announced Friday night it was offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction.",
      "Video of the gunman fleeing Wednesday\u2019s shooting showed him riding a bicycle into Central Park and later taking a taxi to a bus terminal that offers commuter service to New Jersey and Greyhound routes to Philadelphia, Boston and Washington, D.C, according to Kenny.",
      "Police have video of the man entering the bus station but no video of him exiting, leading them to believe he left the city, Kenny said.",
      "Investigators on Friday found a backpack in the park that had been worn by the gunman during the shooting, police said, following a massive sweep to find it in a vast area with lakes and ponds, meadows, playgrounds and woods.",
      "Police didn\u2019t immediately reveal what, if anything, it contained but said it would be analyzed for clues.",
      "The gunman made sure to conceal his identity with a mask during almost all of his time in the city, including during the attack and while he ate, yet left a trail of evidence in view of the nation\u2019s biggest city and its network of security cameras.",
      "The gunman arrived in New York City on Nov. 24 and shot Thompson 10 days later outside his company\u2019s annual investor conference at a hotel just blocks from Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center.",
      "The gunman got off a bus that originated in Atlanta and made several stops along the way, Kenny said. Police have not determined where he got on the bus. Investigators have a list of passengers, but none of them would have had to provide an ID when they climbed aboard, Kenny said.",
      "Investigators believe the suspect used a fake identification card and paid cash, Kenny said, when he checked in at the hostel, which has a caf\u00e9 along with shared and private rooms and is blocks from Columbia University.",
      "Investigators have tested a discarded water bottle and protein bar wrapper in a hunt for his DNA. They also were trying to obtain additional information from a cellphone found along the gunman\u2019s escape route.",
      "Photos of the suspected shooter that were taken in the lobby of a hostel on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side appear to from the only time he removed his mask, Kenny said. The images, showing a man smiling in the lobby of the HI New York City hostel. They are among a collection of photos and video circulated since the shooting \u2014 including footage of the attack, as well as images of the suspected gunman at a Starbucks beforehand.",
      "\u201cFrom every indication we have from witnesses, from the Starbucks, from the hostel, he kept his mask on at all times except for the one instance where we have him photographed with the mask off,\u201d Kenny said.",
      "His roommates at the hostel also said he didn\u2019t speak to them. Nothing of investigative value was found in a search of the suspected shooter\u2019s hotel room.",
      "Asked how close he felt police were to making an arrest, Kenny said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t \u2018Blue Bloods.\u2019 We\u2019re not going to solve this in 60 minutes. We\u2019re painstakingly going through every bit of evidence that we can come across. Eventually, when an apprehension is made, we will have to present all of these facts to a judge and jury, so we\u2019re taking our time, doing it right and making sure we\u2019re going to get justice for this victim and closure for his family.\u201d",
      "Security video of the shooting shows the killer approaching Thompson from behind, firing several shots with a gun equipped with a silencer, barely pausing to clear a jam while the executive fell to the sidewalk.",
      "Police were looking into the possibility that the weapon was a veterinary pistol, which is a weapon commonly used on farms and ranches if an animal has to be euthanized quietly, Kenny said \u2014 though he stressed that hadn\u2019t been confirmed.",
      "The words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were scrawled on the ammunition, one word on each of three bullets, Kenny said. A law enforcement official previously told The Associated Press the words were \u201cdeny,\u201d \u201cdefend\u201d and \u201cdepose.\u201d The messages mirror the phrase \u201cdelay, deny, defend,\u201d which is commonly used by lawyers and critics about insurers that delay payments, deny claims and defend their actions.",
      "Thompson, a father of two sons who lived in a Minneapolis suburb, had been with Minnesota-based UnitedHealthcare since 2004 and served as CEO for more than three years.",
      "The insurer\u2019s parent company, UnitedHealth Group Inc., was holding its annual meeting in New York for investors. The company abruptly ended the conference after Thompson\u2019s death.",
      "UnitedHealth Group said it was focused on supporting Thompson\u2019s family, ensuring the safety of employees and assisting investigators. \u201cWhile our hearts are broken, we have been touched by the huge outpouring,\u201d the company said.",
      "UnitedHealthcare provides coverage for more than 49 million Americans. It manages health insurance coverage for employers and state and federally funded Medicaid programs.",
      "In October, UnitedHealthcare was named along with Humana and CVS in a Senate report detailing how its denial rate for prior authorizations for some Medicare Advantage patients has surged in recent years.",
      "The shooting has rocked the health insurance industry in particular, causing companies to reevaluate security plans and delete photos of executives from their websites.

      "For years, patients in the U.S. health care system have grown frustrated with a bureaucracy they don\u2019t understand.",
      "Doctors are included in an insurer\u2019s network one year but not the next. Getting someone on the phone to help can be next to impossible. Coverage of care and prescriptions is often unceremoniously denied.",
      "This week\u2019s fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has unleashed a wave of public feeling \u2014 exasperation, anger, resentment, helplessness \u2014 from Americans sharing personal stories of interactions with insurance companies, often seen as faceless corporate giants.",
      "In particular, the words written on ammunition found at the shooting scene \u2014 \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose,\u201d echoing a phrase used to describe how insurers dodge claim payouts \u2014 amplified voices that have long been critical of the industry.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden, I am fired up again,\u201d said Tim Anderson, describing how his wife, Mary, had to deal with UnitedHealthcare coverage denials before she died from Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in 2022.",
      "Anderson said they couldn\u2019t get coverage for machines to help his wife breathe or talk \u2014 toward the end, she communicated by blinking when he showed her pictures. The family had to rely on donations from a local ALS group, he said.",
      "\u201cThe business model for insurance is don\u2019t pay,\u201d said Anderson, 67, of Centerville, Ohio.",
      "\u201cWhen Mary could still talk, she said to me to keep fighting this,\u201d he added. \u201cIt needs to be exposed.\u201d",
      "For Anderson and others, Thompson's death and the message left at the scene have created an opportunity to vent their frustrations. Conversations at dinner tables, office water coolers, social gatherings and on social media have pivoted to the topic, as police efforts to find the gunman keep the case in the news.",
      "Hans Maristela said he understands why the chatter is bubbling up. The 54-year-old caregiver in California was moved to comment on Facebook about UnitedHealthcare's reputation of denying coverage. As a Catholic, he said, he grieves Thompson's death and feels for his family, especially with the holidays around the corner.",
      "But he sees frustration with insurers even among his clients, most of them wealthy older people who've not been shielded from high out-of-pocket costs.",
      "\u201cAnd then you know the CEO of this company you pay a lot of money to gets $10 million dollars a year, you won\u2019t have a lot of sympathy for the guy,\" Maristela said, citing Thompson's compensation package that included base pay and stock options. \u201cHealth care is a business, I understand, but the obsession with share price, with profit, has to be reevaluated.\u201d",
      "University of Pennsylvania researcher Michael Anne Kyle said she's not surprised by the growth of conversation around insurers.",
      "\u201cPeople are often struggling with this by themselves, and when you see someone else talk about it, that may prompt you to join the conversation,\u201d she said.",
      "Kyle studies how patients access care and said she's seen frustration with the system build for years. Costs are rising, and insurers are using more controls such as prior authorizations and doctor networks to manage them. Patients are often stuck in the middle of disputes between doctors and insurers.",
      "\u201cPatients are already spending a lot of money on health care, and then they\u2019re still facing problems with the service,\u201d she said.",
      "Insurers often note that most of the money they bring in goes back out the door to pay claims, and that they try to corral soaring costs and the overuse of some care.",
      "In Ohio, Anderson said his initial reaction to the CEO shooting was to question whether it was connected to a coverage denial, like the ones he'd experienced with his wife.",
      "\u201cI definitely do not condone killing people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I read it and said, 'I wonder if somebody had a spouse whose coverage was denied.\u2019\u201d",
      "It's something Will Flanary, a Portland-based ophthalmologist and comedian with a large social media following, saw online a lot in the shooting's immediate aftermath and found very telling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s zero sympathy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the lesson to take away from that is not, \u2018Let\u2019s shame people for celebrating a murder.\u2019 No, it\u2019s: \u2018Look at the amount of anger that people have toward this system that\u2019s taken advantage of people and do something to try to fix that.\u2019\u201d",
      "Flanary's content, published under the name Dr. Glaucomflecken, started out as niche eye doctor jokes and a way to cope with his own experiences with two cancer diagnoses and a sudden cardiac arrest. But it has evolved, featuring character skits that call attention to and satirize the decisions of large health insurers, including UnitedHealthcare.",
      "He said he's never seen conversations around health insurance policy take off the way they did this week \u2014 and he hopes these new voices can help bring about change.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always talking about how powerful social media can be with advocacy,\" he said, \"because it really is the only way to put a significant amount of pressure on these corporations who are doing bad things for patients.\u201d",

      "The Hospital de Jesus in Mexico City\u2019s bustling historic center covers most of a city block",
      "MEXICO CITY -- In Mexico City\u2019s bustling historic center, the Hospital de Jesus covers most of a city block. Its faded unassuming yellow facade, characteristic of the middle of the last century, obscures the medical center within founded 500 years ago by Spanish conqueror Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s.",
      "Entering between street-level shoe stores, visitors find the oldest continuously operating hospital in the Americas. Stone arches lead to expansive patios filled with lush vegetation.",
      "The hospital was founded to treat the conquering Spanish, then later opened to the local Indigenous inhabitants to ensure a healthy workforce. Today it provides 24/7 emergency care, as well as affordable access to medical specialists for current residents of what was at the time of its founding the center of the Aztec empire.",
      "\u201cYou can feel the Mexican heritage here,\u201d said Dr. Pedro \u00c1lvarez S\u00e1nchez. \u201cFor 500 years, the hospital has never closed its doors.\u201d",
      "On Nov. 8, 1519, Cort\u00e9s and his soldiers entered Tenochtitlan, the Aztec name for the capital, and met Aztec emperor Moctezuma in a place known as Huitzilan, just in front of the present-day hospital.",
      "Cort\u00e9s had conquered the city by 1521, and to honor that original encounter, he founded the hospital in 1524.",
      "The meeting of Cort\u00e9s and Moctezuma is depicted in a floor-to-ceiling tile mural beside one of the central patios. The main temple of Tenochtitlan \u2014 only a few blocks from the hospital \u2014 sits in the background. The union of two suns represents the meeting of two cultures.",
      "Cort\u00e9s is buried in a small church adjacent to the hospital. Descendants of him and Moctezuma met here in 2019 to mark the anniversary of that initial encounter.",
      "Around the world, only a handful of hospitals can boast such longevity. For example, St. Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital in London founded in 1123 and Bellevue Hospital in New York City founded in 1736 also continue to provide full medical services.",
      "Much of the hospital has remained intact thanks to a board of trustees founded in the 16th century. Over the years, countless doctors have quietly worked to conserve the hospital\u2019s mission of affordable care and to preserve the building\u2019s unique architectural features.",
      "\u201cWe want to ensure that this hospital continues to provide quality medical attention to patients,\u201d said Dr. Octaviano Rosalez Seraf\u00edn, 71, president of the hospital\u2019s board of trustees. \u201cWe want to continue the tradition of care the hospital has had for years.\u201d",
      "Celia Ch\u00e1vez Escamilla, 56, arrived at the hospital at dawn recently for an appointment with her dermatologist. \u201cHere they take good care of us,\u201d said Ch\u00e1vez. \u201cThe prices here are accessible. If you go somewhere else it\u2019s too expensive.\u201d Her consultation was just 400 pesos or under $20.",
      "Escamilla was accompanied by her daughter Myriam Rafael Sanchez, 26, who was fascinated by the medical center. \u201cI\u2019ve seen (the hospital) a lot in movies and TV shows,\u201d she said excitedly. \u201cWe have all of Mexico\u2019s history around us.\u201d",
      "The hospital didn\u2019t always serve the entire public, according to Sandra Elena Guevara Flores, an anthropologist focusing on medicine at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.",
      "Guevara said the hospital was not open to the Indigenous population initially, but only to the Spanish who had recently arrived in the Americas.",
      "However, as epidemics began to spread, the hospital opened its doors to more patients. \u201cIt was a strategy by the Spanish governors in the new Spain to treat the whole population,\u201d said Guevara. \u201cIt (was) so the servants and the whole labor system wouldn\u2019t die.\u201d",
      "Early Spanish doctors at the hospital often used native Mexican herbs to cure their patients. \u201cIt\u2019s said that traditional Galenic Hippocratic medicine was used in the hospital, but really it was Indigenous medicine,\u201d said Guevara. \u201cThey (Indigenous peoples) would share their knowledge.\u201d",
      "The Spanish imprint can be seen in the hospital\u2019s architecture, said Hugo Antonio Arciniega \u00c1vila, a historian and archaeological expert from the National Autonomous University of Mexico.",
      "The hospital, like some other colonial structures in Mexico City, is \u2018encapsulated\u2019 inside a newer building from the 1950s.",
      "Because the Spanish built low stone structures on huge lots with massive stone walls, people who wanted to build newer facilities a century or two later would often just build over, around or among the colonial-era structures. Sometimes they would incorporate the old masonry walls into the new building, either for preservation reasons or because it was cheaper to use them than to tear them down. So from the street, there is often no sign that behind a Victorian or functionalist facade, there is a partially preserved Spanish structure within.",
      "The hospital was built in the form of a T, with two large patios and a grand staircase devised by Spanish architect Claudio de Arciniega in the 16th century. The design provided constant ventilation and sunshine to patients. The architect also included a chapel on each of the two original floors.",
      "\u201cThe architecture of this hospital is fascinating,\u201d said Arciniega about the intentional layout of religious spaces and access to open air. \u201cIf you cure the soul, you can cure the body \u2013 it\u2019s the same way the doctors thought.\u201d",
      "For the 67-year-old \u00c1lvarez, who has worked at the hospital for nearly 50 years and also serves as the board of trustees\u2019 treasurer, the center has been a constant in his life. He began working at the hospital as a lab assistant at age 18.",
      "\u201cA lot of people ask me, why do you keep working at the Hospital de Jesus?\u201d he said. \u201cI tell them because I love it.\u201d",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 19:14:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Planned Parenthood wanted to resume offering abortions in several Missouri clinics on Friday, immediately after the state's new constitutional amendment rolling back a near total ban took effect",
    "story": [
      "Planned Parenthood wanted to resume offering abortions in several Missouri clinics on Friday, immediately after the state's new constitutional amendment rolling back a near total ban took effect",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Planned Parenthood wanted to resume offering abortions in several Missouri clinics on Friday, immediately after a newly passed constitutional amendment rolling back the state\u2019s near-total ban took effect, but they remain on hold as a complicated court battle drags on.",
      "The issue is that the amendment does not specifically override any state laws. And even before the end of Roe v. Wade enabled Missouri's Republican-led legislature to approve a near-total ban, the state's numerous restrictions left it with just one abortion clinic, in St. Louis.",
      "Missouri\u2019s Republican attorney general says many of those old laws \u2014 like a 72-hour waiting period \u2014 should still be enforced despite the amendment; Planned Parenthood says they shouldn't.",
      "Prosecutors are caught in the middle. They want a preliminary injunction halting enforcement of the old laws while attorneys argue about what to do.",
      "But so far, Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang hasn't acted on that request.",
      "\u201cAs of today, Missourians have an unrealized constitutional right,\u201d said Emily Wales, president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood Great Plains in a written statement. \"They are entitled to access abortion under the state\u2019s constitution, and every day they cannot get that care here at home, their rights are being violated.\u201d",
      "Here is what to know about the complicated legal battle and the state of abortion access:",
      "Missouri is one of five states where voters approved ballot measures in November adding the right to an abortion to their state constitutions. Ultimately approved by almost 52% of voters, it guarantees people\u2019s right to make decisions about their reproductive health, such as whether to get an abortion, take birth control or get in vitro fertilization.",
      "While the amendment is widely understood to prevent the state from restricting abortions up to the point of viability, abortion-rights advocates must persuade judges to prevent old regulations from being enforced.",
      "\u201cThere were certainly people who thought the issue was decided after the vote \u2014 that we would have access,\" Wales said Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ve had patients calling for weeks now saying, \u2018Can I get in? Can I stay close to home?\u2019 Of course, that\u2019s not true.\u201d",
      "Reproductive rights activists are also suing to dismantle Arizona's 15-week abortion ban that conflicts with the fundamental right to abortion voters approved.",
      "Maryland's new abortion rights amendment won't make an immediate difference, since the state already allows access to abortion. It's a similar situation in Montana, where abortion is already legal until viability. Colorado's measure enshrined already-existing access and undoes an earlier amendment that prohibited state and local government funding for abortion, opening the possibility of state Medicaid and government employee insurance plans covering care.",
      "The day after voters approved Missouri's amendment, the two Planned Parenthood branches asked a judge to find the state\u2019s near-total ban and most of its other abortion regulations unenforceable.",
      "Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey has already conceded that most abortions are now legal. He issued an opinion last month, stating that he will not enforce Missouri\u2019s ban on abortions before viability.",
      "But his office is still fighting to keep a 72-hour waiting period before an abortion can be performed; bans on abortions based on race, sex or a possible Down syndrome diagnosis; and a requirement that medical facilities that provide abortions be licensed as ambulatory surgical centers, among other regulations.",
      "This patchwork of old laws is a big problem for abortion providers. They say those restrictions had effectively blocked abortions across most of the state even before Missouri enacted a law banning all abortions except in cases of medical emergency, minutes after Roe was toppled.",
      "\u201cWe have already been living in a post-Roe world,\u201d Dr. Iman Alsaden, the medical director of the Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said at the time.",
      "But Missouri Solicitor General Josh Divine has defended these laws, arguing that most women regret their abortions and that the requirements are designed to give them the time to think through their decisions.",
      "\"What we are trying to do is create a situation where women can in fact make the choice they want to do \u2014 and we know that most of the time that is childbirth,\u201d Divine said after a court hearing Wednesday.",
      "Wales, of Planned Parenthood, said Missourians showed at the ballot box that they value reproductive rights. And she expressed frustration with what she described as \"an Attorney General\u2019s office that has made clear it will fight tooth and nail to prevent Missourians from accessing their new constitutional right to reproductive freedom.\u201d",

      "The U.S. government on Friday ordered testing of the nation's milk supply for bird flu to better monitor the spread of the virus in dairy cows.",
      "Raw or unpasteurized milk from dairy farms and processors nationwide must be tested on request starting Dec. 16, the Agriculture Department said. Testing will begin in six states \u2014 California, Colorado, Michigan, Mississippi, Oregon and Pennsylvania.",
      "Officials said the move is aimed at \u201ccontaining and ultimately eliminating the virus,\" known as Type A H5N1, which was detected for the first time in March in U.S. dairy cows. Since then, more than 700 herds have been confirmed to be infected in 15 states.",
      "\u201cThis will give farms and farmworkers better confidence in the safety of their animals and ability to protect themselves, and it will put us on a path to quickly controlling and stopping the virus\u2019 spread nationwide,\u201d Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement.",
      "The risk to people from bird flu remains low, health officials said. Pasteurization, or heat treatment, kills the virus in milk, leaving it safe to drink.",
      "Veterinarians, farmers, scientists and academics have been calling for nationwide milk testing for months, said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, who led the efforts.",
      "\u201cIt's another step in the right direction,\u201d Poulsen said. \u201cThey're coming around that we need a better handle on it.\u201d",
      "Dairy farmers and processors across the U.S. have been reluctant to test animals or milk for the virus, fearing economic or other repercussions. Jamie Jonker, chief science officer of the National Milk Producers Federation, said the industry supports USDA efforts to eliminate the virus.",
      "Under the federal order, dairy farmers and those who handle raw milk intended for pasteurization must provide samples of the milk on request for testing for bird flu. It requires reporting of positive tests to the USDA and it requires herd owners to provide basic information to allow tracing of the disease in cattle.",
      "The move follows an April 24 federal order that mandated testing of certain dairy cattle before they could move between states and required reporting of any positive tests. Despite that order, the virus has continued to spread, Poulsen noted.",
      "Raw milk from infected cows contains high loads of live virus, testing has shown.",
      "At least 58 people in the U.S. have been infected with bird flu, mostly farm workers who became mildly ill after close contact with infected cows, including their milk, or infected poultry.",
      "Bird flu has also been spreading among wild birds and a number of other animals.",
      "Federal officials continue to warn against drinking raw milk, which can contain a host of germs that make people sick. In California, officials quarantined a farm and halted distribution of milk after bird flu virus was detected in raw milk sold in stores. Raw Farm of Fresno issued a voluntary recall of raw milk and cream produced after Nov. 9.",

      "Weighted blankets are a popular choice to warm up in cold weather, but research on their effectiveness is limited",
      "NEW YORK -- Rhonda James was skeptical when her husband ordered a weighted blanket for her online. But five minutes after she wrapped it around her body, she zonked out.",
      "\u201cIt felt like a really big hug,\u201d said James, a banker in Charleston, South Carolina.",
      "As outside temperatures grow chilly, weighted blankets can be a popular choice to warm up. Some people say the added pressure helps them soothe the worries of the day and get to sleep faster.",
      "But research on the effectiveness of weighted blankets is limited. Here's what to know.",
      "Weighted blankets come with extra heft in the form of glass beads, pellets, cotton or another filling. Scientists haven\u2019t studied exactly how the blankets work, but they have a few ideas.",
      "The blankets\u2019 firm touch may calm the brain's fight-or-flight response, said Dr. Neal Walia, a sleep medicine expert at UCLA Health.",
      "\u201cThe evenly distributed weight on you tells your body, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re in a calm environment,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "The extra pressure also may signal the brain to release what\u2019s called the love hormone, also known as oxytocin. It\u2019s produced during bonding and cuddling, and can also lower anxiety, Walia said.",
      "For most healthy adults, experts say to choose a blanket that is about 10% of their body weight. So a 150-pound person may opt for a 15-pound blanket.",
      "Weighted blankets are not recommended for babies or toddlers since they can hinder movement and breathing.",
      "People with sleep apnea, sleep-related disorders or respiratory problems should check with a doctor before using a weighted blanket.",
      "The blankets aren't for everyone and each person gets the best out of their blanket differently. For example, some may find them too hot to use during warmer months.",
      "And the extra swaddling comes at a cost: quality weighted blankets can range from $50 to over $300 depending on the size, weight and material.",
      "James takes hers out of the closet to unwind when she\u2019s watching TV or sipping a glass of wine.",
      "Lucy Taylor, a freelance writer from Wales, uses her blanket to fall asleep when her anxiety spikes during the winter.",
      "\u201cIf my body\u2019s relaxed, my mind follows suit,\u201d she said.",
      "There isn't a ton of research on whether weighted blankets actually work, and the studies that do exist are on small groups. Most studies don't focus on the average sleeper. Instead, they investigate whether weighted blankets can help people with chronic sleep problems, mental health conditions or developmental disorders.",
      "There are some hints that weighted blankets can help with anxiety, chronic pain and sleep. But the research isn't conclusive.",
      "A study on 120 people with insomnia found that the weighted blankets helped them sleep better compared to a light blanket. Another study on 67 children with autism found the weighted blanket didn\u2019t affect their sleep at all \u2013 but the children and their parents preferred it to a regular blanket.",
      "And a third study on 94 adults with chronic pain found that a heavier weighted blanket didn\u2019t affect sleep, but was better at reducing pain compared to a lighter one.",
      "Even though there\u2019s not yet strong evidence to back up the benefits of weighted blankets, sleep experts say there\u2019s no harm in giving them a try if you're willing to splurge.",
      "Dr. Daniel Barone, a sleep medicine expert at Weill Cornell Medicine, suggests it to his patients after other traditional therapies and medicines.",
      "\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t hurt and it may help, it\u2019s worth a shot,\u201d he said.",

      "A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat",
      "A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat. Researchers found at higher temperatures and humidity, the heat kills far more young people under 35 than those older than 50.",
      "For decades, health and weather experts have warned that the elderly and the youngest children were most vulnerable in heat waves. But this study looking at all deaths in Mexico from 1998 to 2019 shows that when the combination of humidity and temperature reach uncomfortable levels, such as the mid to upper 80s Fahrenheit (around 30 degrees Celsius) and 50% relative humidity, there were nearly 32 temperature-related deaths of people 35 years old for every temperature-related death of someone 50 and older.",
      "The study in Friday's journal Science Advances shows an especially surprising spike of heat-related deaths in an age group thought to be young and robust: People between 18 and 35. That age group alone had nine times as many temperature-related deaths as those older than 50.",
      "Study authors and outside experts are scrambling to figure out why. Demographics alone don't explain why more young adult Mexicans are dying in high heat than their elders. Two theories: Outdoor workers who can't escape the heat, and young people who don't know their limits.",
      "The trend is likely to widen as the world warms from human-caused climate change, according to computer simulations run by the study team.",
      "\u201cWe found that younger people are especially vulnerable to humid heat,\u201d study co-author Jeffrey Shrader, a climate economist at Columbia University, said. \u201cAs the climate warms, we're really going to be shifting the burden of temperature-related mortality towards younger individuals and away from older individuals who tend to be more vulnerable to cold temperatures.\u201d",
      "Data from cold weather shows more than 300 deaths of Mexican residents 50 and older for every young person dying from cold temperatures, according to the study.",
      "\u201cPeople of all ages are increasingly at risk from the rising temperatures, and this study shows that those that we might have considered relatively safe from heat-related adverse health outcomes might not be so much so,\u201d said Marina Romanello, executive director of the Lancet Countdown that monitors health effects of climate change. She was not part of the study team.",
      "\u201cHeat is a much more dangerous silent killer than most people acknowledge it to be, and that heat is increasingly putting our health and survival at risk,\" Romanello said in an email.",
      "Study authors decided to examine weather-related deaths in Mexico because that country not only has detailed mortality data, but it has a variety of different climates making it an ideal place to study in depth, Shrader said.",
      "Researchers also want to figure out whether this is just a situation in Mexico or other warmer sections of the globe have similar spikes in young adult deaths in high heat and humidity.",
      "Initially the team just wanted to look at deaths and what scientists call wet-bulb globe temperatures, but when they looked at age differences, they were surprised and looked in more detail, Shrader said. Wet-bulb temperature, which is intended to mirror how the body cools itself, is derived using a complicated measurement system that factors in humidity and solar radiation. A wet-bulb globe temperature of 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) is thought to be the limit for human survivability. Most places don\u2019t reach that level.",
      "Researchers determined temperature-related mortality by complex statistical analysis that compares numerous factors in the number of deaths and removes everything they can except temperature fluctuations, said study co-author Andrew Wilson, a Columbia climate economics researcher.",
      "Researchers also calculated the ideal temperature for when there are the fewest excess deaths at each age group. Younger adults' sweet temperature spot is about nine degrees Fahrenheit (five degrees Celsius) cooler than it is for older people, Shrader and Wilson said.",
      "Some outside health and climate experts were initially puzzled at the higher youth mortality seen in the study. Co-author Patrick Kinney, a professor of urban health and sustainability at Boston University, said it was likely the study included a higher proportion of outdoor workers exposed to heat than prior studies did.",
      "Study co-author Tereza Cavazos, a climate scientist at the Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education in Mexico, said she remembers her father's generations taking siestas in the high heat of the day and that was healthy. That doesn't happen so much now, she said.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of population that is vulnerable in the future. Not even in the future, right now,\u201d Cavazos said. She mentioned three Mexican heat waves this year that hit in the middle of the country and kept the deadly heat going overnight so people had little relief. Usually cool nights allow a body to recover.",
      "Younger people often have a sense of invulnerability to weather extremes and do things that increase their risk, such as play sports in high heat, Cavazos said.",
      "\u201cHigh humidity makes it a lot harder for the body to cool itself through sweating \u2013 which is how our body primarily stays cool,\" said Dr. Renee Salas, an emergency medicine physician and climate change expert at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. She was not part of the study team. \"So someone young and healthy working outside in heat and high humidity can reach a point where the body can no longer cool itself safely \u2013 causing a deadly form of heat injury called heat stroke.\u201d",

    "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2024 03:14:20 -0500",

      "New Zealand's racing minister says the country will outlaw greyhound racing, citing the injury rates for racing dogs",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- New Zealand plans to outlaw greyhound racing because too many dogs are hurt or killed, the government said Tuesday, spelling an end to the practice in one of the few countries where it still operates.",
      "The racing of greyhounds as a betting sport was wildly popular at times last century. But the number of dogs euthanized due to race-day injuries, or because homes cannot be found for them after their short careers end, has provoked animal welfare campaigns and growing public distaste for the sport.",
      "Commercial greyhound racing continues in the United States, Australia, the U.K. and Ireland, with only two tracks remaining in the U.S. after many states ended the practice.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s ban is not yet law but has universal political support. The government plans to stop the racing from Aug. 1, 2026, to allow the 2,900 racing dogs to be rehomed and more than 1,000 people employed in the industry to find other work, Racing Minister Winston Peters said Tuesday.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s greyhound racing industry has faced repeated reviews in recent years over its dog safety record, with multiple reports urging sweeping changes. Peters said the industry had made progress -\u2013 but not enough.",
      "Stricter policies governing when dogs can be euthanized, and rehoming programs that send retired New Zealand greyhounds abroad as pets when homes cannot be found domestically, have reduced the numbers killed each year. But the percentage of dogs injured \u201cremains persistently high,\u201d Peters said.",
      "\u201cThe time has come to make a call in the best interest of the animals,\u201d he said.",
      "Greyhound Racing New Zealand, an industry group, accused the government of not recognizing improvements made, including its commitment to tracking the care of every retired dog for the rest of its life. Tuesday\u2019s announcement was \u201ca devastating blow,\u201d said chair Sean Hannan.",
      "The animal welfare organization SPCA praised the government for showing \u201ccompassion for dogs made to work in a dangerous gambling industry.\u201d The practice has long been out of favor in New Zealand, spokesperson Arnja Dale said.",
      "Some lawmakers in parliament on Tuesday described the racing industry\u2019s end as inevitable following the steady decline of greyhound racing worldwide.",
      "Commercial racing operates in four other countries. In the U.S., its popularity peaked in the 1980s and the number of states allowing the practice has dwindled since then amid reports of dog mistreatment and the explosion of other gambling options.",
      "Only two tracks remain -\u2013 both in West Virginia -\u2013 after Iowa, Arkansas and Florida shuttered their racing industries. Greyhounds have become popular as pets in the U.S., and New Zealand has sent dozens of dogs to new owners there when homes could not be found in the country of 5 million people.",
      "Greyhound racing is also legal in Australia, where critics have decried the practice, and the rules governing it vary by state. Commercial racing currently operates throughout the U.K. and Ireland, but the Scottish parliament is considering a ban there.",
      "The practice remains legal in Mexico and Vietnam, but there are no longer operational tracks in either country, according to information supplied by Peters\u2019 office.",
      "Hours after it announced the end to greyhound racing, New Zealand's government rushed through a law to prevent dogs from being killed while the industry winds down, unless a veterinarian deems it unavoidable. This will prevent owners from euthanizing dogs for economic reasons, Peters said.",
      "Lawmakers unanimously agreed to the change.",
      "The law shutting down the industry will take longer, however, and is not expected to pass until next year after a period of public submissions. All political parties support the ban."

      "Here\u2019s a look at the three main cases concerning the prime minister:",
      "The most damaging case against Netanyahu involves an influence-peddling scandal in which two former aides have testified against him on suspicions of promoting regulation worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Israel\u2019s Bezeq telecom company.

Former journalists at the Walla news site have attested to being pressured to refrain from negative reporting of Netanyahu. The charges here include bribery, fraud and breach of trust.",

      "The indictment says Packer, who reportedly sought Israeli residency status for tax purposes, also gave Netanyahu champagne and cigars. Netanyahu has said all he received were gifts from friends. Another former aide, Ari Harow, is a state witness in this case. The charges include fraud and breach of trust.",
      "Netanyahu is also alleged to have offered a newspaper publisher legislation that would weaken his paper\u2019s main rival in return for more favorable coverage.",
      "Netanyahu reportedly was recorded asking Arnon Mozes, the publisher of the Yediot Ahronot daily, for positive coverage in exchange for helping to weaken Israel Hayom, a free pro-Netanyahu newspaper that had cut into Yediot\u2019s business.",
      "Israel Hayom is financed by Netanyahu\u2019s late American billionaire friend Sheldon Adelson and largely serves as a mouthpiece for the prime minister. Netanyahu has noted that a proposed law to weaken Israel Hayom never passed and that he had even dissolved his coalition and called a new election in 2015 because of his opposition to the proposal. Harow is a state witness in this case, too.",

Eight years I am waiting to knock down once and for all these deluded and absurd charges against me,\u201d Netanyahu said defiantly on the eve of his testimony. \u201cThese investigations were born of sin. There was no offense, so they found an offense.\u201d",
      "Dozens of people gathered outside of the court in Tel Aviv, some protesting against Netanyahu, including family members of hostages held in Gaza, and also a group of his supporters. A banner draped in front of the court read: \u201cCrime Minister.\"",
      "Under Israeli law, indicted prime ministers are not required to step down. But the charges against Netanyahu cleaved deep divisions in Israel, with protesters demanding he resign and former political allies refusing to serve in government with the Israeli leader, triggering a political crisis that led to five elections in less than four years beginning in 2019.",
      "Netanyahu's supporters view the charges as the result of the justice system\u2019s bias and overreach.",
      "Despite the pressure, the polarizing Netanyahu has rejected calls to step down and has used his position as prime minister to lash out at law enforcement, media and courts.",
      "The testimony, set to take place six hours a day, three days a week for several weeks, will take up a significant chunk of Netanyahu\u2019s working hours, prompting critics to ask if he can capably manage a country embroiled in a war on one front, containing the fallout from a second, and keeping tabs on other potential regional threats, including from Iran or the recent fall of Bashar Assad in Syria.",
      "An Israeli court rejected a request by Netanyahu\u2019s lawyers to reduce the expected testimony hours, as well as several other requests to delay the start of the testimony, which they said were necessary because of the prime minister\u2019s busy schedule and the country's significant challenges."

With sledgehammers, shovels and drills, men pounded holes in floors and walls, looking for what they believed were secret dungeons, or chasing sounds they thought they heard from underground. They found nothing.",
      "Insurgents freed dozens of people from the Saydnaya military prison on Sunday when Damascus fell. Since then, almost no one has been found.",
      "\u201cWhere is everyone? Where are everyone\u2019s children? Where are they?\u201d said Ghada Assad, breaking down in tears.",
      "She had rushed from her Damascus home to the prison on the capital\u2019s outskirts, hoping to find her brother. He was detained in 2011, the year that protests first erupted against the former president's rule \u2013 before they turned into a long, grueling civil war. She didn\u2019t know why he was arrested.",
      "\u201cMy heart has been burned over my brother. For 13 years, I kept looking for him,\u201d she said. When insurgents last week seized Aleppo \u2014 her original hometown \u2014 at the start of their swiftly victorious offensive, \u201cI prayed that they would reach Damascus just so they can open up this prison,\u201d she said.",
      "Civil defense officials helping in the search were as confused as the families over why no further inmates were being found. It appeared fewer were held here in recent weeks, they said.",
      "But few were giving up, a sign of how powerfully Saydnaya looms in the minds of Syrians as the heart of Assad\u2019s brutal police state. The sense of loss over the missing \u2014 and the sudden hope they might be found -- brought a kind of dark unity among Syrians from across the country.",
      "During Assad\u2019s rule and particularly after the 2011 protests began, any hint of dissent could land someone in Saydnaya. Few ever emerged.",
      "In 2017, Amnesty International estimated that 10,000-20,000 people were being held there at the time \u201cfrom every sector of society.\u201d It said they were effectively slated for \u201cextermination.\u201d",
      "Thousands were killed in frequent mass executions, Amnesty reported, citing testimony from freed prisoners and prison officials. Prisoners were subjected to constant torture, intense beatings and rape. Almost daily, guards did rounds of the cells to collect bodies of inmates who had died overnight from injuries, disease or starvation. Some inmates fell into psychosis and starved themselves, the human rights group said.",
      "\u201cThere is not a home, there is not a woman in Syria who didn\u2019t lose a brother, a child or a husband,\u201d said Khairiya Ismail, 54. Two of her sons were detained in the early days of the protests against Assad \u2013 one of them when he came to visit her after she herself had been detained.",
      "Ismail, accused of helping her son evade military service, spent eight months in Adra prison, northeast of Damascus. \u201cThey detained everyone.\u201d",
      "An estimated 150,000 people were detained or went missing in Syria since 2011 \u2014 and tens of thousands of them are believed to have gone through Saydnaya.",
      "\u201cPeople expected many more to be here ... They are clinging to the slightest sliver of hope,\u201d said Ghayath Abu al-Dahab, a spokesman for the White Helmets, the search and rescue group that operated in rebel-held areas throughout the war.",
      "Five White Helmet teams, with two canine teams, came to Saydnaya to help the search. They even brought in the prison electrician, who had the floor plan, and went through every shaft, vent and sewage opening. So far, there were no answers, Abu al-Dahab said.",
      "He said the civil defense had documents showing more than 3,500 people were in Saydnaya until three months before the fall of Damascus. But the number may have been less by the time the prison was stormed, he said.",
      "\u201cThere are other prisons,\u201d he said. \u201cThe regime had turned all of Syria into a big prison.\u201d Detainees were held in security agencies, military facilities, government offices and even universities, he added.",
      "Around the Y-shaped main building of the prison, everyone kept trying, convinced they could find some hidden chamber with detainees, dead or alive.",
      "Dozens of men tried to force a metal gate open until they realized it led only to more cells upstairs. Others asked the insurgents guarding the prison to use their rifle to lever open a closed door.",
      "A handful of men were gathered, excavating what looked like a sewage opening in a basement. Others dug up electrical wiring, thinking it might lead to hidden underground chambers.",
      "In a scene throughout the day, hundreds cheered as men with sledgehammers and shovels battered a huge column in the building\u2019s atrium, thinking they had found a secret cell. Hundreds ran to see. But there was nothing, and tears and loud sighs replaced the celebrations.",
      "In the wards, lines of cells were empty. Some had blankets, a few plastic pots or a few names scribbled on walls. Documents, some with names of prisoners, were left strewn in the yard, the kitchen and elsewhere. Families scoured them for their loved ones\u2019 names.",
      "A brief protest broke out in the prison yard, when a group of men began chanting: \u201cBring us the prison warden.\u201d Calls on social media urged anyone with information of the secret cells of the prison to come forth and help.",
      "Firas al-Halabi, one of the prisoners freed when insurgents first broke into Saydnaya, was back on Monday visiting. Those searching flocked around him, whispering names of relatives to see if he met them.",
      "Al-Halabi, who had been an army conscript when he was arrested, said he spent four years in a cell with 20 others.",
      "His only food was a quarter loaf of bread and some burghul. He suffered from tuberculosis because of the cell conditions. He was tortured by electrocution, he said, and the beatings were constant.",
      "\u201cDuring our time in the yard, there was beating. When going to the bathroom, there was beating. If we sat on the floor, we got beaten. If you look at the light, you are beaten,\u201d he said. He was once thrown into solitary for simply praying in his cell.",
      "\u201cEverything is considered a violation,\u201d he said. \u201cYour life is one big violation to them.\u201d",
      "He said that in his first year in the prison guards would call out hundreds of names over the course of days. One officer told him it was for executions.",
      "When he was freed Sunday, he thought he was dreaming. \u201cWe never thought we would see this moment. We thought we would be executed, one by one.\u201d",
      "Noha Qweidar and her cousin sat in the yard on Monday, taking a rest from searching. Their husbands were detained in 2013 and 2015. Qweidar said she had received word from other inmates that her husband was killed in a summary execution in prison.",
      "But she couldn\u2019t know for sure. Prisoners reported dead in the past have turned up alive.",
      "\u201cI heard that (he was executed) but I still have hope he is alive.\u201d",
      "Just before sundown on Monday, rescue teams brought in an excavator to dig deeper.",
      "But late at night, the White Helmets announced the end of their search, saying in a statement they had found no hidden areas in the facility.",
      "\u201cWe share the profound disappointment of the families of the thousands who remain missing and whose fates are unknown.\u201d"

      "U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to slap tariffs of 60% or more on imports of Chinese goods, complicating Beijing's efforts by threatening an area of the economy that has performed relatively well while the property sector remains in the doldrums and consumer spending remains fragile.",

    "story": [
      "South Korean prosecutors are seeking to formally arrest the former defense minister alleged to have colluded with President Yoon Suk Yeol and others in imposing martial law last week",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean prosecutors are seeking to formally arrest the former defense minister alleged to have colluded with President Yoon Suk Yeol in imposing martial law last week, as authorities investigate whether their acts amount to rebellion.",
      "Martial law, the first in more than 40 years, lasted only about six hours but has triggered a domestic firestorm and large street protests. Yoon and his associates face criminal investigations and impeachment attempts. The Justice Ministry has banned Yoon and eight others from leaving the country as authorities see them as key suspects in the martial law case. It\u2019s the first time that a sitting president in South Korea has received a travel ban.",
      "The Seoul Central District Court said Tuesday it was reviewing a request from prosecutors for a warrant to arrest former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, who has been accused of recommending martial law to Yoon and sending troops to the National Assembly to block lawmakers from voting on it. Enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter a parliament chamber and unanimously rejected Yoon\u2019s decree, forcing the Cabinet to lift it before daybreak on Dec. 4.",
      "Kim said in a statement Tuesday that he \u201cdeeply apologizes for causing significant anxiety and inconvenience.\u201d He said all responsibility for the imposition of martial law rests solely with him and pleaded for leniency for soldiers deployed to enforce it, saying they were only following his order.",
      "Kim has been detained since Sunday. If an arrest warrant is issued, he would be the first person arrested in the case. Prosecutors would have up to 20 days to investigate Kim and determine whether to indict him. A conviction on the charge of rebellion would carry up to the death penalty.",
      "Prosecutors reportedly accuse Kim of playing a key role in a rebellion and committing abuse of power by staging a riot to disrupt the constitution in collaboration with Yoon and other military and police officers. Prosecutors' offices in Seoul couldn't immediately confirm the reports.",
      "The opposition-controlled parliament passed a bill Tuesday to appoint an independent special counsel to investigate Yoon and other top military officials over the martial law introduction. The main opposition Democratic Party had advocated for a special counsel investigation, arguing that public prosecutors cannot be trusted to conduct a thorough investigation of Yoon, a former prosecutor-general.",
      "During a parliamentary hearing Tuesday, Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command whose troops were sent to parliament, testified that he received direct instructions from Kim Yong Hyun to obstruct lawmakers from entering the National Assembly\u2019s main chamber. Kwak said the purpose of Kim\u2019s instructions was to prevent the 300-member parliament from gathering the 150 votes necessary to overturn Yoon\u2019s martial law order.",
      "At the same hearing, senior officer Kim Dae-woo of the military\u2019s counterintelligence agency said his commander, Yeo In-hyung, asked him if an army bunker in Seoul had space to detain politicians and other figures after martial law was imposed. Yeo is considered a close associate of Kim Yong Hyun. Last week, Hong Jang-won, a deputy director of the country's spy agency, said Yoon ordered him to help Yeo\u2019s command to detain some of his political rivals but he ignored the president\u2019s order.",
      "Kwak and Yeo are among those who face opposition-raised rebellion charges along with Yoon and Kim, and the Defense Ministry suspended them last week.",
      "Opposition parties and many experts say the martial law decree was unconstitutional. They say a president is by law allowed to declare martial law only during \u201cwartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states\u201d and South Korea wasn\u2019t in such a situation. They argue that deploying troops to seal the National Assembly to suspend its political activities amounted to rebellion because the South Korean Constitution doesn\u2019t allow a president to use the military to suspend parliament in any situation.",
      "In his martial law announcement, the conservative Yoon stressed a need to rebuild the country by eliminating \u201cshameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces\u201d in a reference to his liberal rivals who control parliament. Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has been on a near-constant collision course with the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which has introduced motions seeking to impeach some of his top officials and launched a fierce political offensive against Yoon over a spate of scandals involving him and his wife.",
      "The focus of attention now is how authorities can investigate Yoon and whether they can detain him.",
      "South Korean law gives a president immunity from prosecution while in office, except for allegations of rebellion or treason. This means that Yoon can be questioned and detained by investigative agencies over his martial law decree, but many observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service. They also say the security service won\u2019t likely permit searches of Yoon\u2019s office, citing a law that prohibits searches of sites with state secrets without approval from those in charge of those areas.",
      "In the case of former President Park Geun-hye, who was thrown out of office in 2017 after being impeached by parliament over a corruption scandal, prosecutors failed to search her office and ended up receiving documents outside the compound because presidential officials turned them away. After refusing to meet with prosecutors while in office, Park underwent questioning by them and was arrested after the Constitutional Court approved her impeachment and ruled to dismiss her as president in March 2017.",
      "Yoon avoided impeachment on Saturday after most governing party lawmakers boycotted a floor vote in the National Assembly. The Democratic Party said it would prepare for a new vote on Yoon's impeachment on Saturday. The party on Tuesday submitted motions to impeach Yoon\u2019s police chief and justice minister as well. It pushed to impeach Kim Yong Hyun and the safety minister, but they resigned before parliament took a vote.",
      "If Yoon is impeached, his presidential powers would be suspended until the Constitutional Court decides whether to restore his powers or remove him from office. If it voted for removal, a new presidential election would be required."

      "When libertarian President Javier Milei assumed office one year ago, Argentine supermarkets were marking price increases almost daily",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- When libertarian President Javier Milei assumed office one year ago, Argentine supermarkets were marking price increases on an almost daily basis. Middle-class families tried to spend their rapidly depreciating pesos as quickly as they got them, and economists warned the country was teetering on the brink of hyperinflation.",
      "It was popular outrage over this upside-down economy that fueled the rise of Milei, a self-declared \u201canarcho-capitalist\u201d and former TV pundit who rode to power on vows to \u201cblow up\u201d the central bank, take an axe to the bloated government and kill sky-high inflation.",
      "It was an almost impossible job, and Milei's lack of government experience, unkempt hairdo, sexual boasts and missionary-like zeal for his dead dog, the Rolling Stones and the free market didn't inspire much confidence in a country with a history of failed economic reforms.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a given that he could govern Argentina when he took office,\u201d said Marcelo J. Garc\u00eda, Americas director at geopolitical risk firm Horizon Engage. \"He was Mr. Nobody.\"",
      "On taking power, Milei implemented a series of austerity measures, including slashing energy and transportation subsidies, laying off tens of thousands of government workers, freezing public infrastructure projects and imposing wage and pension freezes below inflation.",
      "It has been brutal. Unemployment has climbed, economic activity has declined and poverty has surged.",
      "But now signs have emerged that Argentina\u2019s bizarre and long mismanaged economy is starting to look a little more normal.",
      "Monthly inflation has plummeted, bonds have rallied and the closely watched gap between the black market dollar and the official rate has shrunk as much as 44%. Argentina's country-risk index, an influential measure of the risk of default, is at its lowest point in five years.",
      "\u201cHe reaches the anniversary at the best moment of his administration,\" Garc\u00eda said.",
      "Inflation, Argentina's perpetual scourge and Milei's top priority upon coming to office, slowed from a monthly rate of 25.5% in December 2023 to just 2.7% in October \u2014 its lowest level in three years.",
      "\u201cInflation has gone down faster than what everyone has expected,\" said Ignacio Labaqui, a Buenos Aires-based senior analyst at risk consultancy Medley Global Advisors. \u201cThat\u2019s something that validates his narrative and sustains his popularity.\u201d",
      "In a sign of Milei's long way to go \u2014 and the unmitigated shambles he inherited \u2014 Argentina's annual inflation rate remains at 193%.",
      "But Argentines are paying closer attention to month-to-month inflation, taking the sharp decline as a sign that Milei\u2019s fiscal shock therapy is paying off.",
      "\u201cLast year it was a shock to the system, I couldn\u2019t keep up with the prices,\u201d said 34-year-old deli worker Jazmin Quintana. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I like the guy, I find his personality very weird and aggressive, but I admit \u2014 if he continues on this route I\u2019ll be very happy.\u201d",
      "A stronger peso is also boosting confidence. The black market dollar price has dropped since July, narrowing its gap with the official rate of 980.",
      "Chileans, once accustomed to bargain-hunting in Argentina, are now surprised to see the traffic reversed. Shoppers unable to afford iPhones and kitchen appliances in Argentina arrive at Chilean border towns by the busload to get the most bang from their buck. The customs office shut down briefly last month because officials were overwhelmed.",
      "Underpinning the currency appreciation is a new tax amnesty to lure Argentines to declare their hidden U.S. dollar savings \u2014 longs squirreled away in offshore bank accounts and under mattresses. Ahead of the first-phase deadline on Oct. 31, the scheme drew some $19 billion into Argentina\u2019s banks, the tax agency reported, boosting scarce foreign exchange reserves.",
      "But a strong peso also carries risks \u2014 squeezing domestic industry by making exports more costly, deterring investors and raising fears of a crash. Foreign visitors are warned of higher prices as peak tourism season begins.",
      "\u201cThe prices are INSANE,\u201d reads a popular Reddit post about travel in Argentina, filled with cautionary tales of $50 dinners and $100 T-shirts.",
      "Argentina's first budget surplus in 12 years has come at a steep cost. Milei halted inflation increases for university budgets, leaving some universities struggling to keep their lights on and elevators running. He downgraded the culture ministry, closed the national theater institute, shuttered a state-funded news agency and defunded scientific research.",
      "He suspended public works projects, leaving cities littered with white-elephant structures. An estimated 200,000 construction workers lost their jobs in the last year, says the Argentine Chamber of Construction.",
      "The brutal austerity has deepened Argentina's recession, with consumer spending falling 20% percent in the past year and poverty rates soaring to a two-decade high of 52.9% in the second half of last year.",
      "Argentina\u2019s retirees are perhaps the most potent symbol of the strife inflicted by Milei\u2019s fiscal shock.",
      "Some of the government\u2019s biggest savings came from holding down the real value of pensions. The average minimum monthly pension is just $300.",
      "\u201cWe have always been in bad shape, but now things are even harsher,\u201d said Rub\u00e9n Cocurullo, 76, among dozens of pensioners protesting at the social welfare office in Buenos Aires last week. \u201cDo they want to kill us?\"",
      "In a country with a long history of raucous street protests, it's striking that the mass unrest pundits predicted last year has not materialized.",
      "That his approval ratings have held up at some 50% is also a sign of how desperately Argentines wanted change after years of crisis.",
      "\u201cStrangely enough, there comes a time in all societies, when the cost of a fiscal adjustment becomes less than the cost of continuing with inflation,\u201d said Sebasti\u00e1n Mazzuca, an Argentine political scientist at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIt\u2019s like a fire. There are badly injured people, but the fire was put out, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d",
      "It helps Milei that Argentina's left-leaning Peronist opposition is in disarray, with former President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez charged with beating his ex-wife while in office.",
      "Many also attribute the social peace to Milei\u2019s expectation management. He warned that things would get worse before they got better.",
      "But now, as an ebullient Milei declares his government the most successful in history and assures Argentines they\u2019ll soon collect on the economic revival he pledged would follow the pain, the bar is getting higher even as risks remain.",
      "To fulfill his promise of transforming the heavily regulated nation into one of the world\u2019s freest economies, Milei needs to lift strict currency controls. That requires a fresh infusion of cash or a new deal with the International Monetary Fund, which would relieve pressure on the billions of dollars in debt repayments due next year.",
      "Foreign investors, as well as the IMF, to which Argentina owes an unprecedented $44 billion, have expressed excitement about Milei\u2019s changes. But, still haunted by Argentina\u2019s 2001 crisis \u2014 which culminated in the largest foreign-debt default in modern history \u2014 they\u2019re cautious.",
      "\u201cArgentina still seems to be mired in a major \u2018wait and see\u2019 period,\u201d said consulting firm Zuban C\u00f3rdoba and Associates in a report on Milei\u2019s first year.",
      "The radical populist hopes to profit from his budding bromances with President-elect Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk. As president of the biggest shareholder of the IMF in 2018, Trump was key to Argentina securing a record $56 billion loan package.",
      "The three men dined and danced together at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida last month. Milei claims his brutal cost-cutting inspired Trump and Musk to plan their so-called Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Last week the Conservative Political Action Conference brought its traveling program to Buenos Aires, where Milei and right-wing political figures railed against socialism, praised Trump and pledged to battle what they saw as the global scourge of liberal \u201cwoke-ism.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone assumed that we were going to fail politically,\" Milei told the cheering crowd. \u201cToday they admit, through gritted teeth, that they are surprised.\u201d",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- About 87,000 people were being evacuated in a central Philippine region Tuesday a day after a volcano briefly erupted with a towering ash plume and superhot streams of gas and debris hurtling down its western slopes.",
      "The latest eruption of Mount Kanlaon on central Negros island did not cause any immediate casualties, but the alert level was raised one level, indicating further and more explosive eruptions may occur.",
      "Volcanic ash fell on a wide area, including Antique province, more than 200 kilometers (124 miles) across seawaters west of the volcano, obscuring visibility and posing health risks, Philippine chief volcanologist Teresito Bacolcol and other officials said by telephone.",
      "At least six domestic flights and a flight bound for Singapore were canceled and two local flights were diverted in the region Monday and Tuesday due to Kanlaon\u2019s eruption, according to the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines.",
      "The mass evacuations were being carried out urgently in towns and villages nearest the western and southern slopes of Kanlaon which were blanketed by its ash, including in La Castellana town in Negros Occidental where nearly 47,000 people have to be evacuated out of a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) danger zone, the Office of Civil Defense said.",
      "More than 6,000 have moved to evacuation centers aside from those who have temporarily transferred to the homes of relatives in La Castellana by Tuesday morning, the town\u2019s mayor, Rhumyla Mangilimutan, told The Associated Press by telephone.",
      "President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said authorities were ready to provide support to large numbers of displaced villagers and that his social welfare secretary flew early Tuesday to the affected region.",
      "\"We are ready to support the families who have been evacuated outside the 6-kilometer danger zone,\u201d Marcos told reporters.",
      "Government scientists were monitoring the air quality due to the risk of contamination from toxic volcanic gases that may require more people to be evacuated from areas affected by Monday\u2019s eruption.",

      "\u201cIt's a one-time but major eruption,\u201d Bacolcol told the AP, adding that volcanologists were assessing if Monday's eruption spewed old volcanic debris and rocks clogged in and near the summit crater or was caused by rising magma from underneath.",

      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Americans are realizing that \"tariffs on everything from Canada would make life a lot more expensive\" and says he would retaliate if Donald Trump imposes them",
      "TORONTO -- Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday that Americans \u201care beginning to wake up to the real reality that tariffs on everything from Canada would make life a lot more expensive\" and said he will retaliate if Donald Trump goes ahead with them.",
      "Trump later responded by calling Canada a state and Trudeau the governor.",
      "Speaking at an event put on by the Halifax Chamber of Commerce, Trudeau also said dealing with Trump will be \u201ca little more challenging\u201d than the last time because Trump\u2019s team is coming in with a much clearer set of ideas of what they want to do right away than after his first election win in 2016.",
      "The U.S. president-elect has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs.",
      "\u201cTrump got elected on a commitment to make life better and more affordable for Americans, and I think people south of the border are beginning to wake up to the real reality that tariffs on everything from Canada would make life a lot more expensive,\" Trudeau said.",
      "On the weekend, Trump appeared in an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d where the president-elect said he can\u2019t guarantee that his promised tariffs on key U.S. foreign trade partners won\u2019t raise prices for American consumers.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves in any way, shape or form, 25% tariffs on everything going to the United States would be devastating for the Canadian economy,\" Trudeau said.",
      "\u201cIt would also, however, mean real hardship for Americans as well. Americans import 65% of their crude oil from Canada, significant amounts of electricity. Just about all the natural gas exported from Canada goes to the United States. They rely on us for steel and aluminum. They rely on us for a range of agriculture imports. All of those things would get more expensive.\u201d",
      "Trump seemed to respond to Trudeau's comments with a post on social media late Monday, in which he noted Trudeau's recent dinner at Mar-a-Lago where some said Trump joked about Canada becoming the 51st state.",
      "\u201cIt was a pleasure to have dinner the other night with Governor Justin Trudeau of the Great State of Canada. I look forward to seeing the Governor again soon so that we may continue our in depth talks on Tariffs and Trade, the results of which will be truly spectacular for all! DJT,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social.",
      "If Trump makes good on his threat to slap 25% tariffs on everything imported from Mexico and Canada, the price increases that could follow will collide with his campaign promise to give American families a break from inflation.",
      "Economists say companies would have little choice but to pass along the added costs, dramatically raising prices for food, clothing, automobiles, alcohol and other goods.",
      "The Produce Distributors Association, a Washington trade group, has said tariffs will raise prices for fresh fruit and vegetables and hurt U.S. farmers when the countries retaliate.",
      "\u201cWe will of course, as we did eight years ago, respond to unfair tariffs,\u201d Trudeau said.",
      "Trudeau said his government is still mulling over \u201cthe right ways\u201d to respond, referencing when Canada put billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum.",
      "Many of the U.S. products were chosen for their political rather than economic impact. For example, Canada imports just $3 million worth of yogurt from the U.S. annually and most of it comes from one plant in Wisconsin, the home state of then-Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan. That product was hit with a 10% duty.",
      "\u201cIt was the fact that we put tariffs on bourbon and Harley-Davidsons and playing cards and Heinz ketchup and cherries and a number of other things that were very carefully targeted because they were politically impactful to the president\u2019s party and colleagues,\u201d Trudeau said.",
      "Trudeau said when Trump says things he means them but they also know Trump is trying to insert uncertainty and \u201ca bit of chaos\u201d into democracies.",
      "\u201cOne of the most important things for us to do is not freak out, not to panic,\u201d Trudeau said.",
      "\u201cKnowing these would be absolutely devastating means we have to take them seriously but it does mean we have to be thoughtful and strategic and not going around making our opponents arguments for him but making our arguments in a significant and united way.\"",
      "Canadian officials have said it is unfair to lump Canada in with Mexico.",
      "U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border.",
      "Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. \u2014 where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually \u2014 is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia.",
      "On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol reported 1.53 million encounters with irregular migrants at the southwest border with Mexico between October 2023 and September 2024. That compares to 23,721 encounters at the Canadian border during that time.",
      "Trump has also claimed the U.S. is \u201csubsidizing Canada to the tune of over $100 billion a year.\"",
      "On America\u2019s trade deficit Canada\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Kirsten Hillman, told the AP U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year but noted a third of what Canada sells into the U.S. are energy exports and prices have been high.",
      "About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports as well.",
      "Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing for national security.",
      "Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states."

      "For the first time in 50 years, the question of how Syria will be governed is wide open",
      "BEIRUT -- For the first time in 50 years, the question of how Syria will be governed is wide open. The end of the Assad family's rule is for many Syrians a moment of mixed joy and fear, of the total unknown.",
      "The insurgency that swept President Bashar Assad out of power is rooted in Islamist jihadi fighters. Its leader says he has renounced past ties to al-Qaida, and he has gone out of his way to assert a vision of creating a pluralistic Syria governed by civil institutions \u2014 not dictators and not ideology.",
      "But even if he is sincere, he is not the only player. The insurgency is made up of multiple factions, and the country is riven among armed groups, including U.S.-backed Kurdish fighters controlling the east. Remnants of the old regime\u2019s military \u2014 and its feared security and intelligence services \u2014 could coalesce once again.",
      "Foreign powers with their own interests have their hands deep in the country, and any of them \u2014 Russia, Iran, Turkey, the United States and Israel \u2014 could act as spoilers.",
      "Syria\u2019s multifaith and multiethnic population sees itself poised on a moment that could tip either into chaos or cohesion. The country\u2019s Sunni Muslims, Shiite Alawites, Christians and ethnic Kurds have often been pitted against each, whether by Assad\u2019s rule or a 14-year civil war.",
      "Divisions from the conflict run deep, and many worry about revenge killings, whether against former figures of Assad\u2019s state or \u2014 more frightening \u2014 whole communities seen as backing the old system.",
      "The civil war displaced half of Syria's prewar population of 23 million. Many who fled are watching developments closely to determine whether the time has come to return.",
      "Right now there are only questions.",
      "In the short period following Assad\u2019s abrupt fall, rebel leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, has sought to reassure Syrians that the group he leads \u2014 Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS \u2013 does not seek to dominate the country and will continue government services. He has spoken of setting up a decentralized governance system.",
      "Government officials who remained in Damascus as Assad fled \u2014 including Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali \u2014 have met with the rebels to discuss the transfer of power.",
      "The Al Jazeera television network reported Monday that HTS had decided to appoint the head of the \u201csalvation government\u201d running its stronghold in northwest Syria, Mohammed Al-Bashir, to form a transitional government. There was no official confirmation.",
      "Details on what form the government will take have been scarce.",
      "The rebels likely did not expect to be saddled with running an entire country when they launched their offensive against Aleppo less than two weeks ago, said Qutaiba Idlbi, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Rafik Hariri Center and Middle East Programs. The rapid fall of Damascus and the melting away of police and military, left security challenges, he said.",
      "The only existing framework for a transition is no longer relevant. U.N. Security Council Resolution 2254 had called for a political process involving both Assad\u2019s government and opposition groups.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s saying, especially rebels on the ground, \u2018That framework is no longer applicable, because there is no longer a regime. We\u2019re not going to give the regime in politics what they lost through military means,\u2019\u201d Idlbi said.",
      "So far, public sector workers have not heeded calls from the caretaker prime minister to go back to their jobs -- causing troubles in places like airports, borders and at the Foreign Ministry, said Adam Abdelmoula, the U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator for Syria.",
      "\u201cI think it will take a couple of days \u2014 and a lot of assurance on the part of the armed groups \u2014 for these people to return to work again,\u201d he said. In the current chaos, U.N. workers have had difficulty accessing the country, and that has hampered distribution of humanitarian aid, he said.",
      "The insurgents have sought to reassure Syria\u2019s religious minorities that they will not be targeted, despite HTS' fundamentalist Sunni Muslim origins.",
      "So far the civil peace seems to be holding. The insurgents have appeared disciplined, working to keep order, with no sign of reprisals. Experts say only time will tell what post-Assad Syria will look like.",
      "\u201cEveryone\u2019s still willing to really engage, really work with others,\u201d said Haid Haid, a consulting fellow at the Middle East and North Africa program of Chatham House. \u201cThat sort of positive atmosphere is crucial, but it might not last long.\u201d",
      "Splits could open as decisions are made.",
      "It can\u2019t be guaranteed all the fighters within the HTS will back al-Sharaa\u2019s talk of a pluralist system. Outside Damascus\u2019 historic Hamadiyeh market on Sunday, around a dozen fighters chanted, \u201cDown, down with a secular state\u201d \u2014 a sign that at least some among the insurgents may seek a harder Islamist line.",
      "\u201cThe opposition is not a homogenous movement,\u201d said Burcu Ozcelik, a senior research fellow for Middle East Security at the Royal United Services Institute think tank in London.",
      "There are multiple armed opposition groups, including forces in the south who are distinct from HTS and the Turkish-backed groups in the north. Internal fractures within the HTS-led movement, \u201cwhich may become more salient in the weeks and months to come, may lead to discord and threaten Syrian stability,\u201d Ozcelik said.",
      "There may be pressure to purge former members of Assad\u2019s large state bureaucracy, especially those employed as part of a vast security state that included informers and officers widely hated for torture, abuses and corruption.",
      "Insurgents and many in the public don\u2019t want them to return. But a purge can spark a destabilizing backlash \u2014 as when U.S. administrators disbanded Iraq\u2019s army after Saddam Hussein\u2019s fall in 2003, fueling a Sunni insurgency.",
      "Syria\u2019s Alawite population is feeling particularly vulnerable. Assad and his family were Alawites \u2014 a branch of Shia Islam \u2014 and many among the Sunni insurgents see the community as his loyalists.",
      "Kurdish-led forces allied with the United States have run a semi-autonomous zone in Syria\u2019s northeast for years, where they have been a key player in the fight against the Islamic State militant group. While both were opponents of the government during the civil war, the relationship between the Kurds and the Arab opposition groups is tense.",
      "HTS has been extending an olive branch to the Kurds. Reintegrating the east would likely mean some form of concession to Kurdish autonomy.",
      "But that risks angering neighboring Turkey, which vehemently opposes the Kurdish factions that run Syria\u2019s east. Already, Turkish-backed insurgents allied with HTS have taken the opportunity to push the Kurds out of some pockets of territory, seizing the northern town of Manbij, and clashes have broken out in other areas.",
      "While the insurgents' largely benign approach to minorities so far has allayed many international worries, Abdelmoula said, \u201cthose pockets of fighting are very significant because the fighting is mostly along ethnic lines. And that\u2019s dangerous.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014\u2014",
      "Associated Press writers Danica Kirka in London and Jamey Keaten in Geneva contributed to this report. Keath reported from Cairo."

      "Mexico's president says much of the money gained by eliminating independent oversight and regulatory agencies will go to the army to fund a rise in soldiers\u2019 pay",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico\u2019s president said Monday that much of the money gained by eliminating independent oversight and regulatory agencies will go to the army to fund a rise in soldiers\u2019 pay.",
      "The announcement by President Claudia Sheinbaum is the latest in a a series of new and unusual funding sources to pay for the country\u2019s increasingly influential military.",
      "Last week, Mexico\u2019s Congress approved charging every cruise ship passenger a $42 immigration fee, with much of that money also going to the armed forces.",
      "Under Sheinbaum's Morena party, since 2019 the military has been given powers to build and run everything from railways, airports and airlines in Mexico, and some of those projects appear to be losing money.",
      "For over a century before, Mexico's armed forces were very limited in their actions, restricted from taking any role in politics and didn't have many business interests. But that all changed under Sheinbaum's predecessor, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who saw the army as a loyal, unquestioning ally and a safeguard for his political and policy legacy.",
      "L\u00f3pez Obrador, Sheinbaum's political mentor, also made the armed forces, and the quasi-military National Guard, the country's main law enforcement forces.",
      "In late November, Mexico\u2019s Senate voted to eliminate seven independent regulatory and oversight agencies, a move that critics warn will cement the ruling party\u2019s power and avoid outside scrutiny.",
      "Sheinbaum called it a money-saving measure, arguing that the government can more efficiently handle functions like freedom of information requests, anti-monopoly enforcement and energy-market regulation.",
      "However, critics and foreign investors and critics fear this could open the door to favoritism and a lack of transparency.",
      "And earlier this month, Mexico\u2019s Senate \u2014 controlled by the president's Morena party \u2014 voted to charge cruise ship passengers $42 per head for port calls, drawing sharp criticism from the tourism industry.",
      "Mexican business chambers say the immigration charge \u2014 from which cruise passengers used to be exempt \u2014 may hurt the country\u2019s $500 million per year cruise industry.",
      "Two-thirds of the money raised from the cruise ship charges would go to the Mexican army, not to improve port facilities.",
      "Moreover, many of the military-run projects appear to be big money losers, which may help explain the government's urge to find extra funding for the armed forces.",
      "For example, one of L\u00f3pez Obrador's pet projects \u2014 the \u201cMaya Train,\u201d a tourist line which runs in a loop around the Yucatan Peninsula \u2014 has drawn only 20% of the ridership expected when it was proposed.",
      "The Maya Train started service on Dec. 16, 2023. While it's not completely finished \u2014 two relatively little-used stretches are scheduled to enter service later this months \u2014 the most popular and heavily-travelled parts of the line are already in service.",
      "As of Dec. 8, authorities announced the train line had carried a little more than 600,000 passengers in its first 51 weeks. That is only one-fifth of the 3 million passengers authorities had claimed it would carry per year.",
      "On Monday, the government announced a \u201cpackage tour\u201d deal in which another military-run, money losing project \u2014 the government-owned Mexicana airline \u2014 would offer flights to stations along the Maya Train line.",
      "The flight would take off, of course, from another military-run project, the new Mexico City Felipe Angeles airport, which is just starting to break even because the government forced cargo planes, and some passenger flights, to use it.",
      "Mexico\u2019s ruling Morena party is already running enormous budget deficits to fund its favorite building projects like railways and oil refineries \u2014 some of which are being built by the army. The government is desperate to find new revenue sources."

      "Previously president of the West African nation between 2012 and 2017, the 65-year-old Mahama received 56.5% of votes cast, or 6.3 million votes, the electoral commission said. His main opponent from the current governing party, Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia, conceded defeat on Sunday and got 41%, or 4.6 million votes.",

      "The economy is \u201clargely a bread and butter issue for every Ghanaian,\u201d Alidu said. \u201cWhen the people elect you, they require you to do certain things for them. But it was also about the style of governance (because) even in other countries facing economic challenges, governments were being honest with the people, telling them what the reality is, and the steps they have taken to manage it.\u201d"

      "BANGKOK -- One of the most powerful ethnic minority armed groups battling Myanmar\u2019s army has claimed the capture of the last army outpost in the strategic western town of Maungdaw, gaining full control of the 271-kilometer (168-mile) -long border with Bangladesh.",
      "The capture by the Arakan Army makes the group\u2019s control of the northern part of Rakhine state complete, and marks another advance in its bid for self-rule there.",
      "Rakhine has become a focal point for Myanmar\u2019s nationwide civil war, in which pro-democracy guerrillas and ethnic minority armed forces seeking autonomy battle the country\u2019s military rulers, who took power in 2021 after the army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.",
      "Khaing Thukha, a spokesperson for the Arakan Army, told The Associated Press by text message from an undisclosed location late Monday that his group had seized the last remaining military outpost in Maungdaw on Sunday.",
      "Outpost commander Brig. Gen. Thurein Tun, was captured while attempting to flee the battle, Khaing Thukha said.",
      "The situation in Maungdaw could not be independently confirmed, with access to the internet and mobile phone services in the area mostly cut off.",
      "Myanmar\u2019s military government did not immediately comment.",
      "Maungdaw, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) southwest of Mandalay, Myanmar\u2019s second-largest city, has been the target of an Arakan Army offensive since June. The group captured Paletwa and Buthidaung, two other towns on the border with Bangladesh, earlier this year.",
      "Since November 2023, the Arakan Army has gained control of 11 of Rakhine\u2019s 17 townships, along with one in neighboring Chin state.",
      "Ann, a town in Rakhine that hosts the strategically important military headquarters overseeing the western part of the country, appears to be on the verge of falling entirely to the Arakan Army.",
      "The group posted on the Telegram messaging app late Friday that it had taken more than 30 military outposts, except the army\u2019s western command, which controls Rakhine and the southern part of neighboring Chin state, as well as the country\u2019s territorial waters in the Bay of Bengal.",
      "Recent fighting in Rakhine has raised fears of a revival of organized violence against members of the Muslim Rohingya minority, similar to that which drove at least 740,000 members of their community in 2017 to flee to neighboring Bangladesh for safety.",
      "The Arakan Army, which is the military wing of the Buddhist Rakhine ethnic group in Rakhine state, where they are the majority and seek autonomy from Myanmar\u2019s central government, denies the allegations, though witnesses have described the group\u2019s actions to the AP and other media.",
      "Rohingya have lived in Myanmar for generations, but they are widely regarded by many in the country\u2019s Buddhist majority, including members of the Rakhine minority, as having illegally migrated from Bangladesh. The Rohingya face a great amount of prejudice and are generally denied citizenship and other basic rights.",
      "The border between Myanmar and Bangladesh extends from land to the Naf River and offshore in the Bay of Bengal.",
      "The Arakan Army said Sunday it had ordered the suspension of transport across the Naf River because police and local Muslims affiliated with the army were attempting to escape by boat to Bangladesh.",
      "The rebel group has been accused of major human rights violations, particularly involving its capture of the town of Buthidaung in mid-May, when it was accused of forcing an estimated 200,000 residents, largely Rohingyas, to leave, and then setting fire to most of the buildings. It was accused of attacking Rohingya civilians fleeing fighting in Maungdaw in August.",
      "The Arakan Army is also part of an armed ethnic alliance that launched an offensive in northeastern Myanmar last year and gained strategic territory along the border with China."

      "A Ukrainian man who embarked on a perilous journey fleeing his war-torn country into Romania has been rescued from a deep mountain ravine in subzero temperatures with an unlikely companion: his months-old kitten named Peach",
      "BUCHAREST, Romania -- A Ukrainian man who embarked on a perilous journey fleeing his war-torn country into Romania was rescued from a deep mountain ravine in subzero temperatures with an unlikely companion: his months-old kitten named Peach.",
      "More than a dozen rescuers worked in a harsh blizzard to save Vladislav Duda, 28, who was found \u201csoaked and frozen\u201d and severely hypothermic in a 400-meter (437-yard) deep ravine in the northern Maramures region last week, according to the region's mountain rescue service. Duda had fled Ukraine to avoid being drafted into his country's armed forces fighting Russia.",
      "\u201cThe cat was warm and was warming him \u2026 so he saved his life,\u201d Dan Benga, the director of the Maramures mountain rescue service, told The Associated Press. \u201cThe only thing we saw he is caring about is the cat. He doesn\u2019t care about himself.\u201d",
      "When the rescue team located and found the Ukrainian, they unzipped his jacket and discovered Peach snuggled up inside. Benga recalls asking Duda if he was OK, to which he replied: \u201cI\u2019m happy because my cat is alive. I got a chance from God for a new life. The happiest moment is because the cat is here with me,\u201d Benga recalled Duda saying.",
      "The auburn-colored kitten, a tomcat named \u201cPeach\u201d in Ukrainian, was experiencing the effects of malnutrition after they ran out of food four days earlier and melted snow helped to keep him alive.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a dream, after all I have been through, I only hoped to be found and to survive,\" Duda, who worked as a journalist in Ukraine, told the AP. \u201cPeach kept my heart warm and he kept my faith alive.\"",
      "A helicopter retrieval was initially launched but was aborted due to dangerous weather that hampered visibility. Ground rescuers then embarked on a grueling mission through deep snow and temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit) until they reached the pair.",
      "During the complex ascent out of the ravine which took more than five hours, the Ukrainian would not let go of his kitten. He kept Peach clutched to his chest \u201cfrom the bottom to the top ... until we put him in the ambulance,\" Benga said. \u201cHe said only \u2018Please take care of the cat.'\u201d",
      "Close to getting frostbite, Duda is now receiving anti-inflammatory medication and blood circulation treatment, said Izabella Kiskasza, who runs a community center for Ukrainian refugees in Maramures and is assisting the duo. Peach received veterinary treatment in Baia Mare on Monday and is expected to fully recover.",
      "Duda left his home in Ukraine\u2019s war-ravaged Kharkiv region more than a week before getting stranded with his feline companion in the arching Carpathian Mountain range, which straddles northern Romania and southwest Ukraine.",
      "While Peach is the first feline rescued from the mountainous Romanian region, Duda is just one of many Ukrainian men who have risked their lives traversing the harsh conditions of the mountains to avoid being drafted into their country's grinding war with Russia.",
      "Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, more than 160 Ukrainian men have been rescued from Romania\u2019s Maramures region and the numbers have doubled each year since, Benga said. Another 16 have been found dead.",
      "Two other Ukrainian draft-aged men were rescued by helicopter the same day as Duda, he said.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of people who are coming, but they have no medical problem \u2026 and they don\u2019t call for help,\u201d Benga said. \u201cThe people who are calling for help are in the last few hours of their life.\u201d",
      "Ukraine has taken steps to broaden its pool of draft-eligible men, but the efforts have only scratched the surface against a much larger Russian military. In April, Ukraine\u2019s parliament passed a law lowering its draft-eligible age for men from 27 to 25.",
      "Desertion is also starving the Ukrainian army of desperately needed manpower at a crucial time in its war with Russia. The U.S. has also urged Ukraine to draft more troops, and allow for the conscription of those as young as 18.",
      "\u201cWhat I remember is the fear of the unknown and the fear of not making it through the night alive,\u201d Duda recalled on Monday. \u201cMy Peach kept me alive. When escaping we were afraid of everybody, not to be sent back to fight in a war that is not ours.\u201d"

      "The dramatic downfall of Syrian President Bashar Assad presents possible danger, and an opening, for neighboring Israel",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- The dramatic downfall of Syrian President Bashar Assad presents possible danger, and an opening, for neighboring Israel.",
      "After fighting wars on multiple fronts for months, Israel is now concerned that unrest in Syria could spill over into its territory. Israel also views the end of the Assad regime as a chance to disrupt Iran's ability to smuggle weapons through Syria to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.",
      "The Israeli military over the weekend began seizing control of a demilitarized buffer zone in Syria created as part of a 1974 ceasefire between the countries. It said the move was temporary and meant to secure its border.",
      "But the incursion sparked condemnation, with critics accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire and possibly exploiting the chaos in Syria for a land grab. Israel still controls the Golan Heights that it captured from Syria during the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed \u2014 a move not recognized by most of the international community.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at recent developments along the Syrian frontier.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israeli forces were moving to control a roughly 400-square-kilometer (155-square-mile) demilitarized buffer zone in Syrian territory. The buffer zone between Syria and the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights was created by the U.N. after the 1973 Mideast war. A U.N. force of about 1,100 troops has patrolled the area since then.",
      "On a visit Sunday to a Golan Heights hilltop overlooking Syria, Netanyahu said that because Syrian troops had abandoned their positions, Israel's move into the buffer zone was necessary as a \"temporary defensive position.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe peacekeepers at (the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, or UNDOF) informed the Israeli counterparts that these actions would constitute a violation of the 1974 disengagement agreement, that there should be no military forces or activities in the area of separation,\u201d said U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric. He added that the buffer zone was calm and UNDOF peacekeepers remained in their position. The Security Council is scheduled to meet for special consultations called by Russia to discuss the buffer zone issue.",
      "The rebels who ousted Assad and now control much of Syria are led by a former senior al-Qaida militant, although he severed ties with the extremist group years ago and has promised representative government and religious tolerance.",
      "On Monday evening, Netanyahu said Assad\u2019s fall is the \u201cdirect result of the heavy blows we landed on Hamas, on Hezbollah and on Iran.\u201d He added that Israel would occupy the summit of Mount Hermon, which is within the buffer zone on the Syria-Lebanon border, and at 2,814 meters (9,232 feet) is the highest peak in the eastern Mediterranean coast.",
      "Israel has sent troops into the buffer zone, including on the Syrian side of snow-dusted Mount Hermon, which is divided between the Golan Heights, Lebanon, and Syria. Only the United States recognizes Israel's control of the Golan Heights.",
      "Israeli troops began moving into the buffer zone Saturday. Also on Saturday, armed men attacked U.N. forces near the border with Israel, according to Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar.",
      "\u201c(The Israeli military) took targeted and temporary control of certain areas near the border to prevent an Oct. 7 scenario from Syria,\u201d Saar said, referring to Hamas' surprise 2023 attack into Israel from the Gaza Strip.",
      "Dujarric also acknowledged Saturday's attack.",
      "\u201cArmed individuals climbed the wall of a U.N. position near Hadar,\u201d he said. \u201cFollowing an exchange of fire with U.N. peacekeepers who were protecting the position, the base was partially looted. There were no casualties.\u201d",
      "UNDOF forces later recovered some of the looted items, \u201cincluding a number of the weapons and ammunition that had been taken,\u201d he added.",
      "Many in the region condemned the move. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry accused Israel of \u201cexploiting the power vacuum \u2026 to occupy more Syrian territories and create a fait accompli in violation of international law.\u201d",
      "Saudi Arabia separately criticized Israel for what it called its \u201cdetermination to undermine opportunities for Syria to restore its security, stability and territorial integrity.\"",
      "This isn\u2019t the first time Israel has entered the buffer zone this year.",
      "An Associated Press report last month examining satellite imagery found that Israel had been working on a construction project, possibly a new road, along the border with Syria from as early as July, and had in some cases entered the buffer zone during construction. Following the AP report, U.N. forces warned that the Israeli military has committed \u201csevere violations\u201d of its ceasefire deal with Syria.",
      "Israeli political and military leaders have stressed that the seizure of the buffer zone is temporary and not a prelude to entering other parts of Syrian territory.",
      "\u201cThe plan at the moment is that this is a temporary step to make sure stability is kept in the border, making sure the buffer zone is kept, and the U.N. forces can stay,\u201d said a military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with military guidelines.",
      "The official noted that in 2014, U.N. peacekeepers fled the buffer zone after al-Qaida-linked Syrian rebels attacked their encampments. After armed men attacked U.N. forces over the weekend, Israel wanted to ensure the situation did not repeat itself, the official said.",
      "Israel isn\u2019t currently trying to change the border or prepare for an invasion into Syria, said Carmit Valensi, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies, a Tel Aviv think-tank.",
      "\u201cRight now, it\u2019s a tactical operation, not a long-term strategy, in response to the dynamic situation in Syria,\u201d she said. With the collapse of the Syrian army, Israel wants to protect its borders until the situation stabilizes, she said.",
      "Israel says its immediate goal is to prevent the instability in Syria from spreading into the border region.",
      "Defense Minister Israel Katz on Monday laid out Israel\u2019s plans for the border area. He said that after completing the takeover of the buffer zone, Israel would create a \u201csecurity zone\u201d beyond it by destroying heavy artillery across Syria and preventing Iran from smuggling weapons through Syria into Lebanon.",
      "Foreign Minister Saar said Monday that Israel has struck multiple sites holding chemical weapons and long-range missiles to prevent them from falling into the hands of hostile actors. Saar did not say when the strikes occurred. Analysts said Israel is likely to continue carrying out strikes against targets across Syria.",
      "Israel is planning outreach to Syria\u2019s Druze population, a close-knit religious minority that also lives in Israel, Jordan and Lebanon and has maintained some ties across borders.",
      "Israel is also trying to open lines of communication with Syrian rebel groups, to help ensure Iranian-backed factions don\u2019t reclaim any territory, according to Valensi.",
      "For many years, Israel quietly provided food, medicine, clothing and other assistance to war-ravaged southern Syria through \u201cOperation Good Neighbor,\u201d which ended in 2018. More than 4,000 wounded and sick Syrians received medical treatment in Israel or in Israeli field hospitals, and those non-diplomatic connections could now prove crucial.",

      "Germany's Federal Office for Migration and Refugees said Monday that more than 47,000 applications are currently pending. It said it would reassess the situation and resume decisions once things in Syria have stabilized.",
      "Interior Ministry spokesperson Sonja Kock noted that asylum decisions take account of the circumstances of each case, which involves assessing the situation in the applicant\u2019s country. She said the migration authority has the option of prioritizing cases from other places if a situation is unclear, as it currently is in Syria.",
      "More broadly, German officials said it\u2019s too early to tell what the fall of Assad will ultimately mean for the many Syrians who sought refuge in Germany in recent years, particularly in the mid-2010s.",
      "Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said it\u2019s not yet possible to predict \u201cconcrete possibilities to return\u201d and \u201cit would be unserious to speculate about this in such a volatile situation.\u201d",

      "Sweden's Migration Agency said it will also pause decisions on Syrian asylum cases, arguing that it isn't possible at present to assess applicants' reasons for seeking protection.

      "This weekend, those hard-won gains seemed a distant memory. Assad hastily fled to Moscow as his power crumbled during a lightning offensive by rebels that his main international allies, Russia and Iran, were unable to stem.",
      "The Kremlin\u2019s failure to prevent Assad\u2019s swift downfall has exposed limits of Russia\u2019s power and dented its international clout at a pivotal stage of its war in Ukraine.",
      "A look at Russia\u2019s involvement in Syria and the possible consequences of Assad\u2019s demise for Moscow:",
      "The Soviet Union was a longtime ally of Assad's father, Hafez Assad, who ruled the country for nearly 30 years, and provided military advisers and aid.",
      "After an 2011 uprising against Bashar Assad\u2019s rule morphed into a civil war, Russia continued to be a key backer of Damascus, offering political support at the United Nations. When Assad\u2019s rule neared collapse after a series of battlefield defeats in 2015, Russia joined Iran to intervene militarily.",
      "Russia deployed warplanes to the Hemeimeem air base in Syria\u2019s coastal province of Latakia, delivering thousands of tons of military equipment and supplies in an operation dubbed the \u201cSyrian Express.\u201d On Sept. 30, 2015, Moscow launched its air campaign.",
      "Russia kept only about 50 warplanes at Hemeimeem, but they operated at a frenetic pace, each flying several sorties a day. Most of the Russian air force personnel were rotated through the base, giving them combat experience.",
      "At the same time, Moscow expanded and upgraded its naval base in Tartus, the only such outpost outside the former USSR. It deployed special operations forces for critical ground missions and sent hundreds of military advisers to train Syrian troops and direct their operations. Mercenaries from Yevgeny Prigozhin\u2019s Wagner Group military contractor also joined the battle.",
      "The military intervention allowed Assad to reclaim control of most of Syria, making the Kremlin a key power broker in the Middle East and boosting Russia\u2019s prestige. Putin's triumphal visit to Hemeimeem on Dec. 11, 2017, came a week after Russia declared victory over the Islamic State group in Syria and shortly after he announced a reelection bid for 2018.",
      "It was Russia\u2019s first military operation outside the former Soviet Union since the USSR's collapse in 1991 and gave Moscow a chance to test its latest weapons in combat. That military success emboldened Putin and was a key factor that contributed to his decision to invade Ukraine in 2022.",
      "After helping Assad regain control over most Syria, Russia urged him to engage in talks with moderate opposition groups. Buoyed by opposition defeats, however, Assad staunchly resisted any initiatives aimed at national reconciliation.",
      "\u201cTrying to minimize its costs in Syria, Russia has increasingly focused on maintaining the shaky and inefficient status quo, preserving the crumbling and delegitimized Assad regime without any perspectives,\u201d said Ruslan Pukhov, a Moscow-based military expert, in an analysis.",
      "During recent contacts between Syrian and Turkish officials that Moscow helped broker this year, Assad\u2019s government showed little interest in compromise -\u2013 a recalcitrance that paved the way for the offensive by Turkey-backed opposition groups that ousted Assad.",
      "Syria\u2019s economic woes, exacerbated by isolating international sanctions, weakened the country and its military. The demoralized Syrian army quickly crumbled under the brunt of the opposition offensive, a rapid meltdown that Tehran and Moscow couldn't avert with the small contingents they had in Syria.",
      "Russia dedicated the bulk of its assets to the war in Ukraine, while Iran, weakened by international sanctions and locked in a tense standoff with Israel, similarly lacked resources to help Assad.",
      "Alexander Dugin, an ideologue linked to some hawkish Kremlin circles, called Assad\u2019s demise as a painful blow to Russia.",
      "\u201cThe Assad regime that we supported through enormous efforts collapsed in just a few days. It\u2019s very sad,\u201d Dugin said.",
      "With Assad\u2019s demise, the future of Russia bases in Syria \u2014 its only military foothold outside the former Soviet Union \u2014 is in question.",
      "The number of Russian warplanes at Hemeimeem air base has shrunk from several dozen to just a few, although it continues to be a key logistics point. Russian military cargo planes ferrying private contractors and supplies to Africa used it for refueling, and its loss would pose logistical problems for operations there.",
      "\u201cThe importance of Syria for Russia\u2019s operations in Africa has been invaluable,\u201d Moscow-based Middle East expert Nikolai Sukhov said in televised comments.",
      "The Tartus naval base is used by Russian warships for maintenance, refueling and replenishing supplies on visits to the Mediterranean. While opposition forces that eventually ousted Assad swept across Syria in late November, the Russian navy and air force held drills in the eastern Mediterranean, with Tartus as its operational center.",
      "Even as Putin granted Assad and his family an asylum in Russia, Moscow reached out to the new Syrian authorities to try to ensure the security of its bases and to extend their stay. An opposition flag quickly was hoisted at the Syrian Embassy in Moscow.",
      "Asked about the bases, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it would be a topic for future discussions with the new authorities.",
      "\u201cFor now, we are witnessing a period of transformation and extreme instability, so it will obviously take time and require a serious conversation with those who will have power,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cAirline personnel said the aggressor said a close relative of his had been kidnapped, and at the moment the flight lifted off from Leon, he had received a death threat if he traveled to Tijuana,\u201d the department said in a statement.",
      "Guanajuato state has long been dominated by warring drug cartels, and has the highest number of homicides of any state in Mexico.",

      "Officials gave only the man's first name and age, 31, and said the other passengers continued on to Tijuana.",
      "The Attorney General's office said the man would face charges, including making threats and an attack on transportation.",

      "A gang leader who controls a key port in Haiti\u2019s capital is accused of massacring older people and Vodou religious leaders in his community to avenge his son's death",
      "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- A gang leader who controls a key port in Haiti's capital is accused of massacring older people and Vodou religious leaders in his community to avenge his son's death, according to the government and human rights organizations that estimate more than 100 were killed.",
      "Reports on the number of dead in Port-au-Prince can vary wildly in a country where such killings often occur in gang-controlled, largely inaccessible areas.",
      "Haiti\u2019s government in a statement Monday acknowledged the massacre, saying over 100 were killed in the Cit\u00e9 Soleil neighborhood, and promised to bring to justice those responsible for \u201cthis unspeakable carnage.\u201d",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres condemned the ongoing violence, which saw the killing of \u201cat least 184 people, including 127 elderly men and women, between December 6-8 in the Wharf J\u00e9r\u00e9mie neighborhood of Cite Soleil,\u201d U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. The U.N. did not respond to queries on how it obtained those figures.",
      "Guterres called on Haitian authorities to conduct a thorough investigation and ensure the perpetrators are brought to justice for this killing and all other human rights abuses and violations, Dujarric said.",
      "Volker T\u00fcrk, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, told journalists earlier Monday that at least 184 people were killed by a powerful gang leader.",
      "Haitian watchdogs also estimated more than 100 were killed, at times citing community residents.",
      "The Cooperative for Peace and Development, a local rights group, said in a statement Sunday its monitoring unit found that around 20 older people were killed. But it noted that unidentified residents in the community controlled by gang leader Micanor Alt\u00e8s, also known as Monel Felix and Wa Mikan\u00f2, claimed there were more than 100 victims.",
      "The National Human Rights Defense Network, another local rights group, said at least 110 people were killed between Friday and Saturday. The group and its executive director, Pierre Esp\u00e9rance, did not say where it obtained that information, and Esp\u00e9rance did not return requests for comment.",
      "The murky information was a worrying sign in a country in the grip of widespread gang violence.",
      "\u201cThe fact that we have so many doubts about what happened days after the massacre is a signal that clearly indicates the level of control (gangs) have on the population,\u201d said Diego Da Rin, an analyst with the International Crisis Group.",
      "The accused gang leader controls the coastal communities of Wharf J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, La Saline and Fort Dimanche and was known for robbery, extortion and hijacking of goods and trucks, according to a U.N. report earlier this year.",
      "\u201cMicanor was not known for being as brutal as other gang leaders,\u201d Da Rin said. \u201cNot until now.\u201d",
      "The gang leader could not be reached for comment and has not posted on social media. A spokesman for Haiti's National Police did not return a message for comment.",
      "The National Human Rights Defense Network said the massacre occurred because the gang leader's child was severely ill, prompting him to seek advice from a Vodou priest. After his son died, he accused older people in the community \u201cof practicing witchcraft and harming the child.\u201d",
      "The Cooperative for Peace and Development said that according to information circulating in the community, Micanor accused people in the neighborhood for causing his son\u2019s illness.",
      "\u201cHe decided to cruelly punish all elderly people and (Vodou) practitioners who, in his imagination, would be capable of casting a bad spell on his son,\u201d the group said.",
      "It said gunmen rounded up well-known community leaders and took them to the gang leader\u2019s stronghold, where they were executed. Also killed were motorcycle drivers who tried to save some victims.",
      "The group also noted that there\u2019s a ban on people leaving the community \u201cin order to continue to identify (Vodou) practitioners and the elderly with the aim of carrying out the silent killing.\u201d",
      "Da Rin noted that usually killings in Haiti are documented and posted on social media, though they can be difficult to verify. \u201cIn this case, there was not even a message on WhatsApp or a video on TikTok, which is very unusual,\u201d he said.",
      "The Cooperative for Peace and Development said Micanor has previously targeted Vodou practitioners, killing a dozen older women and Vodou leaders \u201cwrongly accused of witchcraft\u201d in recent years.",
      "It\u2019s not unusual for Haitians to seek medical and other advice from Vodou priests known as \u201coungans.\u201d The religion that mixes Catholicism with animist beliefs was at the root of the revolution that led Haiti to become the world\u2019s first free Black republic in 1804.",
      "The massacre in Port-au-Prince comes two months after over 70 people were killed in the central town of Pont-Sond\u00e9, where gangs are vying to control more territory.",
      "Such killings have overwhelmed Haiti\u2019s National Police and a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police that lacks funds and personnel, with the U.S. and other countries pushing for a U.N. peacekeeping mission.",
      "\u201cThe crisis in Haiti has reached catastrophic levels with allied criminal groups intensifying large-scale, coordinated attacks on the population and key state infrastructure,\u201d Human Rights Watch said Monday as it called for a U.N. mission.",
      "It noted that \u201cmany Haitians live with the constant fear of being killed, raped, kidnapped, or forcibly recruited even as they struggle every day to find adequate food, water, and health care to survive.\u201d",
      "More than 4,500 people have been reported killed in Haiti this year, according to the U.N.",

      "ALTOONA, Pa. -- After UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO was gunned down on a New York sidewalk, police searched for the masked gunman with dogs, drones and scuba divers. Officers used the city's muscular surveillance system. Investigators analyzed DNA samples, fingerprints and internet addresses. Police went door-to-door looking for witnesses.",
      "When an arrest came five days later, those sprawling investigative efforts shared credit with an alert civilian's instincts. A Pennsylvania McDonald's customer noticed another patron who resembled the man in the oblique security-camera photos that New York police had publicized.",
      "Luigi Nicholas Mangione, a 26-year-old Ivy League graduate from a prominent Maryland real estate family, was arrested Monday in the killing of Brian Thompson, who headed one of the United States\u2019 largest medical insurance companies.",
      "He remained jailed in Pennsylvania, where he was initially charged with possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police. By late evening, prosecutors in Manhattan had added a charge of murder, according to an online court docket. He's expected to be extradited to New York eventually.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether Mangione has an attorney who can comment on the allegations. Asked at Monday's arraignment whether he needed a public defender, Mangione asked whether he could \u201canswer that at a future date.\u201d",
      "Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after the McDonald's customer recognized him and notified an employee, authorities said. Police in Altoona, about 233 miles (375 kilometers) west of New York City, were soon summoned.",
      "They arrived to find Mangione sitting at a table in the back of the restaurant, wearing a blue medical mask and looking at a laptop, according to a Pennsylvania police criminal complaint.",
      "He initially gave them a fake ID, but when an officer asked Mangione whether he\u2019d been to New York recently, he \u201cbecame quiet and started to shake,\u201d the complaint says.",

      "New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at a Manhattan news conference that Mangione was carrying a gun like the one used to kill Thompson and the same fake ID the shooter had used to check into a New York hostel, along with a passport and other fraudulent IDs.",
      "NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said Mangione also had a three-page, handwritten document that shows \u201csome ill will toward corporate America.\"",
      "A law enforcement official who wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity said the document included a line in which Mangione claimed to have acted alone.",
      "\u201cTo the Feds, I\u2019ll keep this short, because I do respect what you do for our country. To save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly that I wasn\u2019t working with anyone,\u201d the document said, according to the official.",
      "It also had a line that said, \u201cI do apologize for any strife or traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites simply had it coming.\u201d",
      "Pennsylvania prosecutor Peter Weeks said in court that Mangione was found with a passport and $10,000 in cash \u2014 $2,000 of it in foreign currency. Mangione disputed the amount.",
      "Thompson, 50, was killed last Wednesday as he walked alone to a midtown Manhattan hotel for an investor conference. Police quickly came to see the shooting as a targeted attack by a gunman who appeared to wait for Thompson, came up behind him and fired a 9 mm pistol.",
      "Investigators have said \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were written on ammunition found near Thompson\u2019s body. The words mimic a phrase used to criticize the insurance industry.",
      "From surveillance video, New York investigators gathered that the shooter fled by bike into Central Park, emerged, then took a taxi to a northern Manhattan bus terminal.",

      "The Onion's bid to buy conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars is back in a Texas courtroom",
      "A bankruptcy judge scrutinizing The Onion\u2019s bid for Alex Jones \u2019 Infowars platform was expected to hear a second day of testimony Tuesday after an auctioneer defended the satirical news outlet\u2019s winning offer in November.",
      "It is not clear how quickly U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez in Houston will decide whether to approve the bid. The Onion, which wants to turn Infowars\u2019 website and social media accounts into parodies, offered $1.75 million for Infowars\u2019 assets in the auction.",
      "Jones did not attend Monday\u2019s start of the key hearing and instead continued to broadcast from his studios in Austin.",
      "Jeff Tanenbaum, president of ThreeSixty Asset Advisors, was grilled by lawyers for Jones and the company in a Houston courtroom on Monday over how The Onion\u2019s bid came to be valued at $7 million and why a live auction was not held. He defended both the value of the bid and its selection after the two sealed offers were opened.",
      "Lopez could ultimately decide whether to void The Onion\u2019s bid, name the Jones-affiliated company the winner or hold another auction, among other possibilities.",
      "Jones and First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements and submitted the other bid, are alleging fraud and collusion in the auction that concluded on Nov. 14. The trustee and The Onion deny the allegations, accusing Jones and the company of sour grapes. First United American Companies bid $3.5 million.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut. Jones repeatedly called the 2012 shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors and aimed at increasing gun control.",
      "Most of the proceeds from the sale of Infowars, as well as many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, will go to the Sandy Hook families to help satisfy judgments issued by juries and judges in state courts in Connecticut and Texas. Some proceeds will go to Jones\u2019 other creditors.",
      "The Onion\u2019s bid also included a pledge by many of the Sandy Hook families to forgo some or all of the auction proceeds due to them to give other creditors a total of $100,000 more than they would receive under other bids.",
      "The trustee, Christopher Murray, chose The Onion, saying its proposal was better for creditors because they would receive more money. The Onion valued the bid, with the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer, at $7 million, because that amount was equal to a purchase price that would provide the same amount of money to the other creditors.",
      "Tanenbaum testified that he agreed with the $7 million valuation and believed The Onion\u2019s bid conformed to the auction rules.",
      "A lawyer for Jones, Ben Broocks, asked Tanenbaum how it was possible that the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer boosted The Onion\u2019s offer to such a high amount.",
      "\u201cIt means the purchase price value has gone up because another purchase price would have to be higher than that value in order to provide the same net benefit to that group of creditors,\u201d Tanenbaum said.",
      "During his opening argument, Broocks said there was no way The Onion should have been chosen over First United American.",
      "\u201cHow does a $1.75 million bid beat a $3.5 million bid?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow is that $1.75 million greater? Well, it\u2019s voodoo economics to use a phrase.\u201d",
      "Joshua Wolfshohl, an attorney for Murray, told the judge Monday that no wrongdoing occurred during the auction. He called the complaints by Jones and First United American Companies unfounded.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of their complaints are just fantastic, imagined conspiracy theories that have no basis in reality,\u201d he said.",
      "Murray, The Onion and the Sandy families deny allegations of wrongdoing. In his own court filing, Murray called the allegations \u201ca disappointed bidder\u2019s improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open auction process.\u201d",
      "Up for sale at the auction were all the equipment and other assets in the Infowars studio in Austin, Texas, as well as its social media accounts, websites, video archive and product trademarks. Jones uses the studio to broadcast his far-right, conspiracy theory-filled shows on the Infowars website, his account on the social platform X and radio stations.",
      "Jones has set up another studio, websites and social media accounts in case The Onion wins approval to buy Infowars and kicks him out. Jones has said he could continue using the Infowars platforms if the auction winner is friendly to him.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights but has acknowledged that the school shooting happened."

Gorman Jr. of the Second Judicial District Court characterized the plan to change the trust as a \u201ccarefully crafted charade\u201d to \u201cpermanently cement Lachlan Murdoch\u2019s executive roles\u201d inside the empire \u201cregardless of the impacts such control would have over the companies or the beneficiaries\u201d of the family trust.",

      "Gorman in his conclusion said: \u201cThe effort was an attempt to stack the deck in Lachlan Murdoch\u2019s favor after Rupert Murdoch\u2019s passing so that his succession would be immutable. The play might have worked; but an evidentiary hearing, like a showdown in a game of poker, is where gamesmanship collides with the facts and at its conclusion, all the bluffs are called and the cards lie face up.\u201d",

      "Customs data Tuesday showed exports grew 6.7% from a year earlier, down from a 12.7% increase in October. Analysts had estimated that exports had risen more than 8%.",

      "U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to slap tariffs of 60% or more on imports of Chinese goods, complicating Beijing's efforts by threatening an area of the economy that has performed relatively well while the property sector remains in the doldrums and consumer spending remains fragile.",

      "When libertarian President Javier Milei assumed office one year ago, Argentine supermarkets were marking price increases almost daily",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- When libertarian President Javier Milei assumed office one year ago, Argentine supermarkets were marking price increases on an almost daily basis. Middle-class families tried to spend their rapidly depreciating pesos as quickly as they got them, and economists warned the country was teetering on the brink of hyperinflation.",
      "It was popular outrage over this upside-down economy that fueled the rise of Milei, a self-declared \u201canarcho-capitalist\u201d and former TV pundit who rode to power on vows to \u201cblow up\u201d the central bank, take an axe to the bloated government and kill sky-high inflation.",
      "It was an almost impossible job, and Milei's lack of government experience, unkempt hairdo, sexual boasts and missionary-like zeal for his dead dog, the Rolling Stones and the free market didn't inspire much confidence in a country with a history of failed economic reforms.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a given that he could govern Argentina when he took office,\u201d said Marcelo J. Garc\u00eda, Americas director at geopolitical risk firm Horizon Engage. \"He was Mr. Nobody.\"",
      "On taking power, Milei implemented a series of austerity measures, including slashing energy and transportation subsidies, laying off tens of thousands of government workers, freezing public infrastructure projects and imposing wage and pension freezes below inflation.",
      "It has been brutal. Unemployment has climbed, economic activity has declined and poverty has surged.",
      "But now signs have emerged that Argentina\u2019s bizarre and long mismanaged economy is starting to look a little more normal.",
      "Monthly inflation has plummeted, bonds have rallied and the closely watched gap between the black market dollar and the official rate has shrunk as much as 44%. Argentina's country-risk index, an influential measure of the risk of default, is at its lowest point in five years.",
      "\u201cHe reaches the anniversary at the best moment of his administration,\" Garc\u00eda said.",
      "Inflation, Argentina's perpetual scourge and Milei's top priority upon coming to office, slowed from a monthly rate of 25.5% in December 2023 to just 2.7% in October \u2014 its lowest level in three years.",
      "\u201cInflation has gone down faster than what everyone has expected,\" said Ignacio Labaqui, a Buenos Aires-based senior analyst at risk consultancy Medley Global Advisors. \u201cThat\u2019s something that validates his narrative and sustains his popularity.\u201d",
      "In a sign of Milei's long way to go \u2014 and the unmitigated shambles he inherited \u2014 Argentina's annual inflation rate remains at 193%.",
      "But Argentines are paying closer attention to month-to-month inflation, taking the sharp decline as a sign that Milei\u2019s fiscal shock therapy is paying off.",
      "\u201cLast year it was a shock to the system, I couldn\u2019t keep up with the prices,\u201d said 34-year-old deli worker Jazmin Quintana. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I like the guy, I find his personality very weird and aggressive, but I admit \u2014 if he continues on this route I\u2019ll be very happy.\u201d",
      "A stronger peso is also boosting confidence. The black market dollar price has dropped since July, narrowing its gap with the official rate of 980.",
      "Chileans, once accustomed to bargain-hunting in Argentina, are now surprised to see the traffic reversed. Shoppers unable to afford iPhones and kitchen appliances in Argentina arrive at Chilean border towns by the busload to get the most bang from their buck. The customs office shut down briefly last month because officials were overwhelmed.",
      "Underpinning the currency appreciation is a new tax amnesty to lure Argentines to declare their hidden U.S. dollar savings \u2014 longs squirreled away in offshore bank accounts and under mattresses. Ahead of the first-phase deadline on Oct. 31, the scheme drew some $19 billion into Argentina\u2019s banks, the tax agency reported, boosting scarce foreign exchange reserves.",
      "But a strong peso also carries risks \u2014 squeezing domestic industry by making exports more costly, deterring investors and raising fears of a crash. Foreign visitors are warned of higher prices as peak tourism season begins.",
      "\u201cThe prices are INSANE,\u201d reads a popular Reddit post about travel in Argentina, filled with cautionary tales of $50 dinners and $100 T-shirts.",
      "Argentina's first budget surplus in 12 years has come at a steep cost. Milei halted inflation increases for university budgets, leaving some universities struggling to keep their lights on and elevators running. He downgraded the culture ministry, closed the national theater institute, shuttered a state-funded news agency and defunded scientific research.",
      "He suspended public works projects, leaving cities littered with white-elephant structures. An estimated 200,000 construction workers lost their jobs in the last year, says the Argentine Chamber of Construction.",
      "The brutal austerity has deepened Argentina's recession, with consumer spending falling 20% percent in the past year and poverty rates soaring to a two-decade high of 52.9% in the second half of last year.",
      "Argentina\u2019s retirees are perhaps the most potent symbol of the strife inflicted by Milei\u2019s fiscal shock.",
      "Some of the government\u2019s biggest savings came from holding down the real value of pensions. The average minimum monthly pension is just $300.",
      "\u201cWe have always been in bad shape, but now things are even harsher,\u201d said Rub\u00e9n Cocurullo, 76, among dozens of pensioners protesting at the social welfare office in Buenos Aires last week. \u201cDo they want to kill us?\"",
      "In a country with a long history of raucous street protests, it's striking that the mass unrest pundits predicted last year has not materialized.",
      "That his approval ratings have held up at some 50% is also a sign of how desperately Argentines wanted change after years of crisis.",
      "\u201cStrangely enough, there comes a time in all societies, when the cost of a fiscal adjustment becomes less than the cost of continuing with inflation,\u201d said Sebasti\u00e1n Mazzuca, an Argentine political scientist at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIt\u2019s like a fire. There are badly injured people, but the fire was put out, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d",
      "It helps Milei that Argentina's left-leaning Peronist opposition is in disarray, with former President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez charged with beating his ex-wife while in office.",
      "Many also attribute the social peace to Milei\u2019s expectation management. He warned that things would get worse before they got better.",
      "But now, as an ebullient Milei declares his government the most successful in history and assures Argentines they\u2019ll soon collect on the economic revival he pledged would follow the pain, the bar is getting higher even as risks remain.",
      "To fulfill his promise of transforming the heavily regulated nation into one of the world\u2019s freest economies, Milei needs to lift strict currency controls. That requires a fresh infusion of cash or a new deal with the International Monetary Fund, which would relieve pressure on the billions of dollars in debt repayments due next year.",
      "Foreign investors, as well as the IMF, to which Argentina owes an unprecedented $44 billion, have expressed excitement about Milei\u2019s changes. But, still haunted by Argentina\u2019s 2001 crisis \u2014 which culminated in the largest foreign-debt default in modern history \u2014 they\u2019re cautious.",
      "\u201cArgentina still seems to be mired in a major \u2018wait and see\u2019 period,\u201d said consulting firm Zuban C\u00f3rdoba and Associates in a report on Milei\u2019s first year.",
      "The radical populist hopes to profit from his budding bromances with President-elect Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk. As president of the biggest shareholder of the IMF in 2018, Trump was key to Argentina securing a record $56 billion loan package.",
      "The three men dined and danced together at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida last month. Milei claims his brutal cost-cutting inspired Trump and Musk to plan their so-called Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Last week the Conservative Political Action Conference brought its traveling program to Buenos Aires, where Milei and right-wing political figures railed against socialism, praised Trump and pledged to battle what they saw as the global scourge of liberal \u201cwoke-ism.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone assumed that we were going to fail politically,\" Milei told the cheering crowd. \u201cToday they admit, through gritted teeth, that they are surprised.\u201d",

      "Nearly 400 Boeing employees were laid off in Washington state and more than 500 in California, news outlets reported Monday.",
      "The aerospace giant announced previously it would reduce its workforce by 10% in the coming months as it tries to recover from financial and regulatory troubles and a strike by its machinists that lasted almost two months.",
      "CEO Kelly Ortberg has said the strike did not cause the layoffs, which he said was the result of overstaffing.",

    "story": [
      "The Biden administration has given approval for the sale of oil and gas leases in Alaska, leaving the door open for drilling in a portion of the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- The Biden administration has approved plans for a sale of oil and gas leases in Alaska that leaves open the door for drilling in a portion of the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.",
      "The sale will be held Jan. 9, less than two weeks before President Joe Biden leaves office. It will include a fraction of the land total that was available for bidding roughly four years ago in a sale held during the Trump administration.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump pledged during his latest run for the White House to expand oil drilling in the U.S., and he\u2019s pointed to the passage of a 2017 law that enabled Monday's announcement as a highlight when it comes to Alaska policy.",
      "The 2017 law mandated two lease sales by late 2024, but major oil companies sat out the first sale. The Biden administration reviewed the leasing program, and seven leases from the first sale ultimately were canceled.",
      "It\u2019s unclear. A lease sale is one step in a long process \u2014 one that can often get mired in litigation. There are ongoing lawsuits surrounding the first lease sale, and environmentalists have vowed to go to court to keep drilling out of the refuge.",
      "There are other examples, too: the Biden administration's approval of the large Willow oil project in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, west of the refuge, has yet to be settled in the courts, nearly two years after it got the green light to proceed. The company behind Willow, ConocoPhillips Alaska, has been continuing work on the project in the meantime.",
      "Once any leases are issued for the refuge, potential exploration or development plans would still have to undergo environmental review, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management has said.",
      "The law called for lease sales in the refuge's coastal plain, a roughly 1.5-million acre (more than 6 million hectare) swath of the vast, wild refuge that borders the Beaufort Sea. The coastal plain accounts for a small part of the refuge, which boasts an array of landscapes and provides habitat for wildlife including polar bears, caribou, musk ox and birds. Debate over whether to open the coastal plain to drilling has gone on for decades.",
      "Indigenous Gwich\u2019in leaders consider the coastal plain sacred, and caribou the Gwich\u2019in rely on calve there. Meanwhile, leaders of the I\u00f1upiaq community of Kaktovik, which is within the refuge, have supported drilling.",
      "The Bureau of Land Management said the area that would be available for lease next month calls for the smallest footprint of potential surface disturbance and avoids key polar bear denning and caribou calving areas. It would involve 400,000 acres (nearly 162,000 hectares), the minimum required by the 2017 law, the agency said. That compares to about 1.1 million acres (4.4 million hectares) included in the first sale.",
      "Bids in the first sale covered nearly 553,000 acres (about 224,000 hectares) the agency said at the time. Two of the leases were later given up by the small companies that held them amid legal wrangling and uncertainty over the drilling program. Seven leases that were acquired by a state corporation were canceled by the Biden administration. Litigation surrounding the lease cancellation is pending.",
      "Erik Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice who has been involved in litigation surrounding the refuge, said his organization would go to court \u201cas often as necessary\" to protect the refuge from oil drilling.",
      "Many environmentalists and climate scientists have pushed for a phase-out of fossil fuels to avert the worst consequences of climate change.",
      "While the Bureau of Land Management has said the coastal plain could contain 4.25 billion to 11.8 billion barrels of recoverable oil, there is limited information about the amount and quality of oil that's there.",
      "Drilling supporters, including some Alaska political leaders, have expressed frustration with the constraints set on the planned lease sale and said they hope for a change in approach under Trump.",
      "Nagruk Harcharek, president of Voice of the Arctic I\u00f1upiat, an advocacy group whose members include Alaska North Slope leaders, characterized the scope of the new lease sale as \u201ca deliberate attempt by the Biden administration\u2019s Interior Department to kneecap the potential of development\u201d in the refuge.",
      "He said it goes against the wishes of North Slope I\u00f1upiat, particularly those in Kaktovik."

      "Speaking at an event put on by the Halifax Chamber of Commerce, Trudeau also said dealing with Trump will be \u201ca little more challenging\u201d than the last time because Trump\u2019s team is coming in with a much clearer set of ideas of what they want to do right away than after his first election win in 2016.",
      "The U.S. president-elect has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs.",
      "\u201cTrump got elected on a commitment to make life better and more affordable for Americans, and I think people south of the border are beginning to wake up to the real reality that tariffs on everything from Canada would make life a lot more expensive,\" Trudeau said.",
      "On the weekend, Trump appeared in an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d where the president-elect said he can\u2019t guarantee that his promised tariffs on key U.S. foreign trade partners won\u2019t raise prices for American consumers.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves in any way, shape or form, 25% tariffs on everything going to the United States would be devastating for the Canadian economy,\" Trudeau said.",
      "\u201cIt would also, however, mean real hardship for Americans as well. Americans import 65% of their crude oil from Canada, significant amounts of electricity. Just about all the natural gas exported from Canada goes to the United States. They rely on us for steel and aluminum. They rely on us for a range of agriculture imports. All of those things would get more expensive.\u201d",

I look forward to seeing the Governor again soon so that we may continue our in depth talks on Tariffs and Trade, the results of which will be truly spectacular for all! DJT,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social.",
      "If Trump makes good on his threat to slap 25% tariffs on everything imported from Mexico and Canada, the price increases that could follow will collide with his campaign promise to give American families a break from inflation.",
      "Economists say companies would have little choice but to pass along the added costs, dramatically raising prices for food, clothing, automobiles, alcohol and other goods.",
      "The Produce Distributors Association, a Washington trade group, has said tariffs will raise prices for fresh fruit and vegetables and hurt U.S. farmers when the countries retaliate.",
      "\u201cWe will of course, as we did eight years ago, respond to unfair tariffs,\u201d Trudeau said.",
      "Trudeau said his government is still mulling over \u201cthe right ways\u201d to respond, referencing when Canada put billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum.",
      "Many of the U.S. products were chosen for their political rather than economic impact. For example, Canada imports just $3 million worth of yogurt from the U.S. annually and most of it comes from one plant in Wisconsin, the home state of then-Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan. That product was hit with a 10% duty.",
      "\u201cIt was the fact that we put tariffs on bourbon and Harley-Davidsons and playing cards and Heinz ketchup and cherries and a number of other things that were very carefully targeted because they were politically impactful to the president\u2019s party and colleagues,\u201d Trudeau said.",
      "Trudeau said when Trump says things he means them but they also know Trump is trying to insert uncertainty and \u201ca bit of chaos\u201d into democracies.",
      "\u201cOne of the most important things for us to do is not freak out, not to panic,\u201d Trudeau said.",

    "summary": "George Soros' philanthropy, Open Society Foundations, will continue to fund human rights movements around the world",
    "story": [
      "George Soros' philanthropy, Open Society Foundations, will continue to fund human rights movements around the world",
      "NEW YORK -- Despite years of internal turmoil and changes, Open Society Foundations wants those in the human rights sector to know their movements will still receive support from the organization, its president Binaifer Nowrojee said Tuesday.",
      "The foundations, founded by billionaire investor George Soros and now led by one of his sons, Alex Soros, have historically been one of the largest funders of human rights groups. But since 2021, they closed some of their programs and reduced their staff as part of a major internal reorganization.",
      "In the process, many grantees and others in the human rights movement have waited anxiously to see where the chips would fall.",
      "\u201cA reimagination has taken place under the leadership of the new board chair at Open Society Foundations,\u201d Nowrojee said, referring to Alex Soros.",
      "\u201cOne of the reasons that we wanted to really reiterate in a large way, with balloons, et cetera, that we are still committed to human rights, is because of this fear that\u2019s permeated with the changes that somehow Open Society Foundations is no longer going to be working on rights or equity or justice,\u201d she said in advance of Human Rights Day, which the United Nations observes on Dec. 10.",
      "Nowrojee offered few new details about OSF's specific funding priorities, though earlier this year, the foundations committed $400 million toward green jobs and economic development.",
      "Another new program focuses on protecting environmental defenders that will work in a few countries, like Colombia and the Democratic Republic of Congo and end after five years, said Sharan Srinvias, a director of programs at OSF.",
      "\u201cWe did a survey of what other donors are supporting and in general, we saw that this is where the gap is,\u201d he said of people who come under attack for defending land, water or other resources. \u201cEspecially bilateral donors find it much easier to support global organizations, who in turn are able to support prominent rights defenders in capital cities who are well known.\u201d",
      "One benefit of the limited time horizon, Srinvias said, is his team will mostly make grants of three or five years \u2014 longer than OSF's typical grants \u2014 and offer grantees more flexibility. It will also have some funds to respond to emergencies for human rights defenders all over the world.",
      "In 2020, OSF was the largest global human rights funder, giving out the most money overall and making the largest number of grants. That's according to the Human Rights Funders Network, a membership organization of grantmakers that tracks philanthropic funding for human rights groups.",
      "\u201cWhen major funders adjust their priorities, it can have a ripple effect. Their decisions can dramatically impact the human rights movements they once supported, especially in regions where they\u2019ve been a long-time champion,\u201d HRFN wrote in its most recent Advancing Human Rights report from September.",
      "To add to the atmosphere of uncertainty, another major human rights funder, Wellspring Philanthropic Fund, announced earlier this year that it would end its work by 2028.",
      "OSF's board aims to employ 600 people in total around the world, Nowrojee said, which is down from a reported 800 in 2021.",
      "Some of the changes OSF made in the last three years include winding down its global public health program and significantly diminishing its programs in the European Union. It spun off its area of work focused on Roma communities into a new organization and issued final grants to many of its partners.",
      "\u201cYou never want philanthropy to just be doing the same thing. You want philanthropy to be getting out of stuff,\u201d Nowrojee said. \u201cAnd so there\u2019s large areas of work where huge achievements were made, which we have retreated from, not because we don\u2019t think that there\u2019s value in them, but the movements themselves have strengthened.\u201d",
      "People who worked for OSF's public health program and some of their grantees have spoken about its impacts over almost three decades through an oral history project led by University of Southern California Institute on Inequalities in Global Health and funded by OSF.",
      "Jonathan Cohen, who led the OSF public health program and now holds positions at USC, told an interviewer with the oral history project about a decision in 2020 by OSF's leadership to take funding from its programs and reallocate it to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cThat claw-back in April should have been a sign, I think, to all of us that we were not long for this world,\u201d Cohen said, of the public health program. \"But of course, you don\u2019t accept that. You fight. You resist. You try to keep your program, which is what we did until we couldn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Among the movements that OSF had supported under its public health program was the the Network of Sex Work Projects, a global coalition of sex worker groups. It formed in 1992 in part in response to the killing of sex workers who had HIV, said Ruth Morgan Thomas, who was NSWP's global coordinator for many years, as part of the oral history project. She said she was saddened to see the closure of OSF's public health work.",
      "\u201cI hope as it reemerges and its global strategy reemerges, it will retain its stance and support for promoting the realization of sex workers\u2019 rights and inclusion in our societies,\u201d she said.",

      "For the first time, New Mexico\u2019s investment income is expected to surpass its revenue from personal income taxes",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- Efforts by New Mexico to save and invest portions of a financial windfall from local oil production are paying off as state government income on investments surpasses personal income tax collections for the first time, according to a new forecast Monday.",
      "General fund income from the state's two, multibillion-dollar permanent funds and interest on treasury accounts is expected to climb to $2.1 billion for the fiscal year between July 2024 and June 2025, surpassing $2 billion in revenue from personal income taxes.",
      "The investment earnings are designed to ensure that critical programs \u2014 ranging from childcare subsidies to tuition-free college and trade school education \u2014 endure if oil income falters amid a possible transition to new sources of energy.",
      "At the same time, legislators this year revised personal income tax brackets to lower taxes in the nation's No. 2 state for oil production behind Texas.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not a poor state anymore,\u201d said Democratic state Sen. George Mu\u00f1oz of Gallup. \u201cWe\u2019ve got things that we can win on \u2014 free education, childcare ... low taxes for working families, for children. And that\u2019s all because we\u2019ve done a lot of the work to set this up for the future.\u201d",
      "The comments came at a legislative panel Monday where economists from four government agencies announced an income estimate for the coming year. The figures are the baseline for budget negotiations when the Democratic-led Legislature convenes in January.",
      "State government income, which is closely linked to oil production in New Mexico, continues to grow, though at a slower pace, as legislators discuss new investments in social programs aimed at curbing crime and homelessness.",
      "Economists estimate the state will bring in a record-setting $13.6 billion in general fund income for the fiscal year that runs from July 2025 to June 2026, a 2.6% increase over the current period.",
      "This year\u2019s income bump leaves room for an additional $892 million in state spending in the coming fiscal year, a 7% increase, according to the Legislature\u2019s accountability and budgeting office. State income is forecast to exceed current bedrock annual spending obligations by $3.4 billion.",
      "New Mexico legislators are pushing to open new savings accounts.",
      "One proposal would set aside as much as $1 billion in a trust to underwrite spending on mental health and addiction treatment in response to public frustration with crime and homelessness. Legislators also are likely to revisit a stalled proposal to create a trust for Native American education that could expand Indigenous language instruction."

    "story": [
      "California lawmakers will consider a bill to require labels on social media platforms warning of their effects on young people\u2019s lives",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California, home to some of the largest technology companies in the world, would be the first U.S. state to require mental health warning labels on social media sites if lawmakers pass a bill introduced Monday.",
      "The legislation sponsored by state Attorney General Rob Bonta is necessary to bolster safety for children online, supporters say, but industry officials vow to fight the measure and others like it under the First Amendment. Warning labels for social media gained swift bipartisan support from dozens of attorneys general, including Bonta, after U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called on Congress to establish the requirements earlier this year, saying social media is a contributing factor in the mental health crisis among young people.",
      "\u201cThese companies know the harmful impact their products can have on our children, and they refuse to take meaningful steps to make them safer,\u201d Bonta said at a news conference Monday. \u201cTime is up. It\u2019s time we stepped in and demanded change.\u201d",
      "State officials haven't provided details on the bill, but Bonta said the warning labels could pop up once weekly.",
      "Up to 95% of youth ages 13 to 17 say they use a social media platform, and more than a third say that they use social media \u201calmost constantly,\u201d according to 2022 data from the Pew Research Center. Parents\u2019 concerns prompted Australia to pass the world\u2019s first law banning social media for children under 16 in November.",
      "\u201cThe promise of social media, although real, has turned into a situation where they\u2019re turning our children\u2019s attention into a commodity,\u201d Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, who authored the California bill, said Monday. \u201cThe attention economy is using our children and their well-being to make money for these California companies.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers instead should focus on online safety education and mental health resources, not warning label bills that are \u201cconstitutionally unsound,\u201d said Todd O\u2019Boyle, a vice president of the tech industry policy group Chamber of Progress.",
      "\u201cWe strongly suspect that the courts will set them aside as compelled speech,\u201d O\u2019Boyle told The Associated Press.",
      "Victoria Hinks' 16-year-old daughter, Alexandra, died by suicide four months ago after being \u201cled down dark rabbit holes\u201d on social media that glamorized eating disorders and self-harm. Hinks said the labels would help protect children from companies that turn a blind eye to the harm caused to children\u2019s mental health when they become addicted to social media platforms.",
      "\u201cThere's not a bone in my body that doubts social media played a role in leading her to that final, irreversible decision,\u201d Hinks said. \u201cThis could be your story.\"",
      "Common Sense Media, a sponsor of the bill, said it plans to lobby for similar proposals in other states.",
      "California in the past decade has positioned itself as a leader in regulating and fighting the tech industry to bolster online safety for children.",
      "The state was the first in 2022 to bar online platforms from using users\u2019 personal information in ways that could harm children. It was one of the states that sued Meta in 2023 and TikTok in October for deliberately designing addictive features that keep kids hooked on their platforms.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, also signed several bills in September to help curb the effects of social media on children, including one to prohibit social media platforms from knowingly providing addictive feeds to children without parental consent and one to limit or ban students from using smartphones on school campus.",
      "Federal lawmakers have held hearings on child online safety and legislation is in the works to force companies to take reasonable steps to prevent harm. The legislation has the support of X owner Elon Musk and the President-elect\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr. Still, the last federal law aimed at protecting children online was enacted in 1998, six years before Facebook\u2019s founding."

      "Attorneys for Meta shareholders are asking a Delaware judge to sanction former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and fellow Facebook board member and current White House chief of staff Jeff Zients for deleting emails related to the Cambridge Anal...",
      "WILMINGTON, Del. -- Attorneys for Meta shareholders asked a Delaware judge Monday to sanction the company's former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and fellow Facebook board member and current White House chief of staff Jeff Zients for deleting emails related to the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal, despite being told to preserve such records.",
      "The plaintiff attorneys contend that Sandberg and Zients used personal email accounts to communicate about key issues relating to their 2018 shareholder lawsuit that alleged Facebook officers and directors violated both the law and their fiduciary duties in failing for years to protect the privacy of user data.",
      "\u201cAlthough Sandberg and Zients received a litigation hold requiring them to preserve documents from these accounts, they both knowingly and permanently destroyed electronically stored information from such sources,\u201d attorneys said in a court filing.",
      "The plaintiffs say the former board members were either \u201creckless or intentional\u201d in destroying documents, noting that Sandberg deleted communications to and from her Gmail account after only 30 days, even after being notified of the \u201clitigation hold\u201d to preserve documents. Zients never disabled an auto-delete function on his email account, even though he, too, received a litigation hold and consulted with lawyers, they said.",
      "The plaintiffs argue that Sandberg and Zients should be prohibited from testifying about information they sent or received using their personal email accounts. They also say the burden of proof for any affirmative defense they present should be raised to a standard of \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d instead of the lower standard of a \u201cpreponderance\u201d of the evidence.",
      "Sandberg was deposed last week. Plaintiff attorney Max Huffman said Zients is \u201cbusy\u201d and will be deposed in February \u201cafter there\u2019s an effective transition in Washington.\u201d",
      "Defense attorney Berton Ashman described the email deletions as \u201cunfortunate\u201d but argued that the plaintiffs have not shown that they were prejudiced in any way.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no intent here to destroy relevant or responsive information,\u201d Ashman told Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster, adding that there no \u201ctrove of missing emails.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no grand scheme or suggestion of bad behavior,\u201d he added.",
      "Ashman said the vast majority of emails that Sandberg and Zients sent or received using their personal accounts were also received by other individuals at Facebook. He suggested that any emails that may have been deleted have been made available to the plaintiffs from other sources at Facebook.",
      "Huffman, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer, said Sandberg does not deserve the benefit of the doubt.",
      "\u201cShe unilaterally controlled what was kept and what was destroyed,\u201d he told the judge.",
      "Laster, who is scheduled to preside over a non-jury trial in April, said he wanted to see a transcript of Sandberg\u2019s deposition before ruling on the motion for sanctions.",
      "Last year, the judge rejected a defense motion arguing that the lawsuit should be dismissed because the plaintiffs did not first demand that Facebook\u2019s board take legal action before filing litigation themselves. He agreed with the plaintiffs that such a demand would have been futile because of doubts that a majority of the relevant Facebook board members, many with close personal and business ties to Mark Zuckerberg, would be willing to confront the CEO and founder of the company over its privacy failures.",
      "Laster noted that, in deciding on a motion to dismiss, he was required to accept the allegations in the complaint as true.",
      "The complaint alleges that Facebook officials repeatedly and continually violated a 2012 consent order with the Federal Trade Commission under which Facebook agreed to stop collecting and sharing personal data on platform users and friends without their consent.",
      "Facebook later sold user data to commercial partners in direct violation of the consent order and removed disclosures from privacy settings that were required under consent order, the lawsuit alleges. The company\u2019s conduct resulted in significant fines from regulators in Europe and culminated in  the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018.  That case involved a British political consulting firm hired by Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign that paid a Facebook app developer for the personal information of tens of millions Facebook users.",
      "The fallout led to Facebook agreeing to pay unprecedented $5 billion penalty to settle FTC charges that the company violated the 2012 consent order by deceiving users about their ability to protect their personal information."

      "The powerful Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry, restaurant and grocers associations say the law violates a state constitutional requirement that ballot measures only address one issue because it included the minimum wage increase and paid sick leave.",

      "Alaska voters approved a similar measure, while voters in California rejected an effort to raise the minimum wage for most workers to $18 an hour. In Arizona, voters rejected a measure that would have allowed businesses to pay tipped workers 25% less than the minimum wage, provided that tips pushed their total pay above the minimum wage. In Massachusetts, voters defeated a measure that would have gradually raised the minimum wage for tipped employees until it matches the rate for other employees.",
      "Nebraska voters approved a measure to require many employers to provide sick leave, but it will not change wages.",
      "Business groups also argue that Missouri voters were misled about how much the law will cost local governments and which companies and workers it will apply to.",
      "For example, government employees and workers at businesses that make less than $500,000 a year are exempt from the paid sick leave entitlements. A short summary of the ballot measure provided to voters did not describe all exempt employees.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The deadly crash of two vintage military planes at a 2022 air show in Texas was caused by a lack of proper planning to keep aircraft separated and relying instead on a \u201csee-and-avoid strategy\u201d by pilots, federal investigators said Monday.",
      "A Bell P-63F fighter was descending and banking to the left when it clipped the left wing of a Boeing B-17G bomber from behind. All six people aboard the World War II-era planes \u2014 the pilot of the fighter and the pilot, copilot and three other crew members on the bomber \u2014 were killed.",
      "National Transportation Safety Board investigators said Monday that the pilots' visibility was limited by their flight paths, obstructions in the cockpits, and \u201cthe attention demands associated with the air show performance.\u201d",
      "The investigators said the probable cause of the accident was the lack of a briefing on aircraft separation by the show organizer and the \u201cair boss,\" who used binoculars and a two-way radio to direct pilots. Instead, they relied \u201con the air boss\u2019s real-time deconfliction directives and the see-and-avoid strategy for collision avoidance,\u201d investigators said.",

      "Aviation safety experts have said they were surprised that there was no briefing beforehand about keeping planes at separate altitudes, and that such planning occurs at other air shows. A person familiar with the show\u2019s operations that day said pilots were given general directions on altitude during a pre-show briefing, but they did not discuss specific altitudes for each pass that the aircraft would perform.",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 13:46:30 -0500",
    "summary": "Mexico's president says much of the money gained by eliminating independent oversight and regulatory agencies will go to the army to fund a rise in soldiers&rsquo; pay",
    "story": [
      "Mexico's president says much of the money gained by eliminating independent oversight and regulatory agencies will go to the army to fund a rise in soldiers\u2019 pay",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico\u2019s president said Monday that much of the money gained by eliminating independent oversight and regulatory agencies will go to the army to fund a rise in soldiers\u2019 pay.",
      "The announcement by President Claudia Sheinbaum is the latest in a a series of new and unusual funding sources to pay for the country\u2019s increasingly influential military.",
      "Last week, Mexico\u2019s Congress approved charging every cruise ship passenger a $42 immigration fee, with much of that money also going to the armed forces.",
      "Under Sheinbaum's Morena party, since 2019 the military has been given powers to build and run everything from railways, airports and airlines in Mexico, and some of those projects appear to be losing money.",
      "For over a century before, Mexico's armed forces were very limited in their actions, restricted from taking any role in politics and didn't have many business interests. But that all changed under Sheinbaum's predecessor, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who saw the army as a loyal, unquestioning ally and a safeguard for his political and policy legacy.",
      "L\u00f3pez Obrador, Sheinbaum's political mentor, also made the armed forces, and the quasi-military National Guard, the country's main law enforcement forces.",
      "In late November, Mexico\u2019s Senate voted to eliminate seven independent regulatory and oversight agencies, a move that critics warn will cement the ruling party\u2019s power and avoid outside scrutiny.",
      "Sheinbaum called it a money-saving measure, arguing that the government can more efficiently handle functions like freedom of information requests, anti-monopoly enforcement and energy-market regulation.",
      "However, critics and foreign investors and critics fear this could open the door to favoritism and a lack of transparency.",
      "And earlier this month, Mexico\u2019s Senate \u2014 controlled by the president's Morena party \u2014 voted to charge cruise ship passengers $42 per head for port calls, drawing sharp criticism from the tourism industry.",
      "Mexican business chambers say the immigration charge \u2014 from which cruise passengers used to be exempt \u2014 may hurt the country\u2019s $500 million per year cruise industry.",
      "Two-thirds of the money raised from the cruise ship charges would go to the Mexican army, not to improve port facilities.",
      "Moreover, many of the military-run projects appear to be big money losers, which may help explain the government's urge to find extra funding for the armed forces.",
      "For example, one of L\u00f3pez Obrador's pet projects \u2014 the \u201cMaya Train,\u201d a tourist line which runs in a loop around the Yucatan Peninsula \u2014 has drawn only 20% of the ridership expected when it was proposed.",
      "The Maya Train started service on Dec. 16, 2023. While it's not completely finished \u2014 two relatively little-used stretches are scheduled to enter service later this months \u2014 the most popular and heavily-travelled parts of the line are already in service.",
      "As of Dec. 8, authorities announced the train line had carried a little more than 600,000 passengers in its first 51 weeks. That is only one-fifth of the 3 million passengers authorities had claimed it would carry per year.",
      "On Monday, the government announced a \u201cpackage tour\u201d deal in which another military-run, money losing project \u2014 the government-owned Mexicana airline \u2014 would offer flights to stations along the Maya Train line.",
      "The flight would take off, of course, from another military-run project, the new Mexico City Felipe Angeles airport, which is just starting to break even because the government forced cargo planes, and some passenger flights, to use it.",
      "Mexico\u2019s ruling Morena party is already running enormous budget deficits to fund its favorite building projects like railways and oil refineries \u2014 some of which are being built by the army. The government is desperate to find new revenue sources."

      "If Juan Soto replicates his 2024 performance throughout his $765 million, 15-year deal with the Mets, he'll make roughly $1.2 million for every home run he hits",
      "These were Juan Soto\u2019s numbers in 2024: 41 home runs, 109 RBIs, a .288 batting average.",
      "Keep doing that over the next 15 years, and he\u2019ll be making roughly $1.2 million for every home run. Or $467,890 for every RBI. Or $307,229 for every hit.",
      "(Pre-tax, of course.)",
      "Soto\u2019s $765 million, 15-year agreement with the New York Mets \u2014 the richest contract in terms of total value to a player in U.S. major sports history, a massive move by billionaire Mets owner Steve Cohen \u2014 provides a chance to look at the numbers in some very silly ways.",
      "He\u2019ll make $314,815 per game. Based on his numbers this season, he'd get $671,053 for every extra-base hit. Or $46,322 every time he swings the bat no matter if he misses, hits a tapper back to the mound or has Mr. Met celebrating in the stands after driving one out at Citi Field. Of course, that's assuming Soto remains as healthy and productive as he was in 2024. If he misses significant time, those rates just go up.",
      "\u201cThank you Uncle Steve,\u201d Mets outfielder Brandon Nimmo wrote on social media.",
      "Some of the numbers around the sports world, when broken down by accomplishment, are simply eye-popping in this era. (And keep in mind, these examples are based on current earnings, not taking into account restructurings or any other potential changes.)",
      "A look:",
      "The two-time Cy Young winner will earn about $65 million in 2025, most of which is a signing bonus that comes his way in January. He\u2019s also never made more than 32 starts in a season. If he makes 32 starts in 2025, he\u2019d be getting (when factoring in the signing bonus) $2,031,250 per game. For comparison\u2019s sake, Detroit\u2019s Tarik Skubal made $2.65 million for the entire 2024 season \u2014 and won a Cy Young award.",
      "His record $700 million deal is no longer a record because of the Soto deal, but Ohtani still holds the mark for average total value at $70 million a year. The only member of baseball\u2019s 50-50 club (54 homers, 59 stolen bases in 2024) would \u2014 at this past season\u2019s rate \u2014 be making $619,469 every time he hits one out or steals a base.",
      "It\u2019s unfair to break down his stats this year because he\u2019s hurt, but Prescott\u2019s current deal is worth an average of $60 million a season from Dallas. Based on his career average, that means over the lifetime of his current contract, Prescott gets $13,680 for every passing yard.",
      "The per-game numbers in the NFL for starting quarterbacks are wild. Patrick Mahomes\u2019 current $450 million contract isn\u2019t even at the top of the cash-per-game standings: Prescott gets about $3.5 million for every Dallas regular season game, while Jacksonville\u2019s Trevor Lawrence, Cincinnati\u2019s Joe Burrow and Green Bay\u2019s Jordan Love are around $3.25 million per game.",
      "At nearly $56 million this season, Curry leads the NBA salary race (for this year, anyway). The NBA\u2019s all-time 3-point king is earning about $680,000 per game in 2024-25; if he was paid by the 3-pointer only, he\u2019d be getting about $161,908 every time he makes one of those this season.",
      "Brown is starting a five-year deal worth around $285 million, Tatum will start a five-year deal next year worth around $314 million. At those rates, the Celtics would be paying their two best players (at their current scoring paces) around $27,406 for every point scored. To compare \u2014 Larry Bird, for his career, made about $1,100 per point.",
      "He\u2019ll start a contract next year that will pay him an average of $14 million a season over eight seasons. At his current rate of scoring, he\u2019d be earning roughly $119,393 for every goal or assist over that span.",
      "Shesterkin just got the richest extension for a goalie, $92 million over eight years. At his current averages, every time he makes a save, he\u2019ll be earning $5,084.",
      "Based just on his Major League Soccer guaranteed salary, Messi got just over $1 million per goal this season ($20.4 million, 20 goals). Again, just counting the MLS salary \u2014 his full deal with Inter Miami is worth at least $150 million for 2\u00bd years \u2014 Messi made $229 for every second he was on the field during the 2024 regular season.",
      "Scheffler\u2019s official earnings in 2024 were $29,228,357 (plus an Olympic gold medal, which is priceless). And that doesn\u2019t include $34,037,500 million in bonuses and unofficial earnings, including $25 million for winning the FedExCup. Add it all up, and that meant the world\u2019s No. 1 player earned about $11,243 per shot he took this season."

On Monday afternoon, Baltimore County police officers had blocked off an entrance to the property, which public records link to Luigi Mangione\u2019s parents. A swarm of reporters and photographers gathered outside the entrance.",

      "Mangione, a high school valedictorian from a Maryland prep school, earned undergraduate and graduate degrees in computer science in 2020 from the University of Pennsylvania, a spokesman told The Associated Press on Monday.",
      "He had learned to code in high school and helped start a club at Penn for people interested in gaming and game design, according to a 2018 story in Penn Today, a campus publication.",
      "His posts also suggest that he belonged to the fraternity Phi Kappa Psi. They also show him taking part in a 2019 program at Stanford University, and in photos with family and friends in Hawaii, San Diego, Puerto Rico, the New Jersey shore and other destinations.",
      "Altoona police say officers were dispatched to a McDonald\u2019s on Monday morning in response to reports of a male matching the description of the man wanted in connection with the United Healthcare CEO\u2019s killing in New York City.",

      "Juan Soto\u2019s record $765 million, 15-year contract with the New York Mets, the largest and longest deal in baseball history, has reverberated across the winter meetings",
      "DALLAS -- Shortly after striking a record $765 million, 15-year contract for Juan Soto with the New York Mets, agent Scott Boras walked into Nick & Sam's, a restaurant near the winter meetings hotel, with about a dozen of his staff.",
      "They were given a bottle of celebratory champagne and dined on deviled eggs, crab, shrimp and a New York strip steak \u2014 appropriate given that the Mets had stripped the All-Star outfielder from the rival Yankees.",
      "\u201cScott is coming with his army of personnel. It was kind of like the `Gladiator,'\u201d said Boston Red Sox manager Alex Cora, who watched from across the steakhouse Sunday night.",
      "Soto's deal, the largest and longest in baseball history, was pending a physical. The agreement reverberated across the winter meetings and stung the Yankees, who on Sunday morning had raised their offer to $760 million over 16 years from $712.5 million for 15 years.",
      "\u201cMy first thought is that my oldest kid is going to be 28 when he\u2019s done playing. That really puts it in perspective for me,\u201d San Francisco president of baseball operations Buster Posey said.",
      "Yankees manager Aaron Boone learned of Soto's decision when his flight arrived in Dallas.",
      "\u201cLiterally that the wheels hit the runway and the alert hit my phone that he had signed with the Mets,\u201d Boone recalled.",
      "He texted an emoji of a face to Mets manager Carlos Mendoza, a former Yankees coach. Mendoza wasn't sure what Boone meant.",
      "\u201cI sent him another face,\u201d Mendoza said Monday, shrugging his shoulders.",
      "Soto's deal, which includes a $75 million signing bonus, would rise to $805 million if the Mets exercise their right to void Soto's ability to opt out after the 2029 season.",
      "\u201cI was shocked when I saw the bonus. My goodness,\u201d said Cincinnati manager Terry Francona, thinking about the implications for prices other teams will have to pay for players. \u201cI think it makes it harder, but I certainly don\u2019t begrudge teams for doing it if they can. They\u2019re not breaking the rules. We\u2019re going to have to make really good decisions, and we\u2019re not going to be able to outspend on mistakes, so we have to limit those.\u201d",
      "Soto's deal sparked even greater expectations in a free agent market that includes pitchers Corbin Burnes and Max Fried, first basemen Pete Alonso and Christian Walker, third baseman Alex Bregman and outfielder Anthony Santander.",
      "\u201cI think everybody\u2019s intent is hopefully to land their planes as soon as possible, whether it\u2019s trades or free agency,\u201d Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said.",
      "Some teams have feared the economic might of Mets billionaire owner Steve Cohen, whose team has been baseball's biggest spender during the last two years.",
      "\u201cWe want to win and we have an owner that is willing to do whatever it takes,\u201d Mendoza said.",
      "Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns wouldn't discuss Soto because the deal wasn't finalized.",
      "\u201cEvery year I\u2019ve ever been around the game at some point in the offseason there is a cry of inflationary free agency,\" he said. \u201cAnd then at some point in the offseason there\u2019s this worry that a bunch of players aren\u2019t going to either get paid what they deserve or aren\u2019t going to have jobs.\u201d",
      "Many small-market teams have long sought a salary cap but the consensus since the 1994-95 strike has been not to propose a hard limit, knowing it would provoke another lengthy work stoppage. The current labor contract expires in December 2026.",
      "Most teams were priced out of the Soto market.",
      "\u201cWe have to be creative. We have to put the best 26 guys on a roster or the best 40 guys on a roster, not the best one or two,\u201d Kansas City manager Matt Quatraro said. \u201cI still think at the end of the day you have a chance to compete against those guys. Soto is going to hit four to five times a night. Those are impactful at-bats, but there\u2019s other ways to combat that with a full 26-man roster.\u201d",
      "Soto, 26, helped Washington win the 2019 World Series and in 2022 turned down a $440 million, 15-year offer from the Nationals, who then traded him to San Diego.",
      "\u201cI can sit here and say that I\u2019m the only manager that won a World Series with him,\u201d Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. \u201cHow about that?\u201d",
      "San Diego traded Soto to the Yankees last December.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anything we could do any different,\u201d Cashman said. \u201cOutside of winning the World Series, it played out perfect.\u201d",
      "Combining with Aaron Judge, Soto helped the Yankees win their first AL pennant since 2009 before they lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the World Series.",
      "Boras asked Saturday night for final offers in the morning.",
      "'Hal Steinbrenner really stepped up to find a way to retain Juan Soto,\" Cashman said. \u201cHe is one of one. He is a unique guy with a unique age.\"",

      "\u201cWhen you get a chance, give me a slot and we\u2019ll talk about who\u2019s remaining on the board,\u201d Cashman said he told Boras during their Sunday night conversation.",

      "A unanimous National League MVP after becoming the first player with at least 50 homers and 50 stolen bases in a season, Ohtani surely wants to be in the lineup in Japan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not cemented. If something doesn\u2019t look right, feel right, obviously we\u2019ve got to pivot. Maybe a lot of disappointed fans,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do what\u2019s best for Shohei. But where we stand right now, I expect him to play.\u201d",
      "Roberts doesn't believe the recent surgery on the left shoulder is going to have much of an impact on Ohtani pitching.",
      "\u201cHis right elbow is the biggest factor. I just think the question is when he starts pitching in major league games and how we build him up prior to,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as a minor league rehab situation, but I don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s a conversation that once we sort of get closer, we\u2019ll figure out. That\u2019s going to be ... we\u2019ve got to kind of be nimble with that one.\u201d",
      "After his elbow surgery at the end of his MLB rookie season in 2018, Ohtani didn't pitch again until two starts early in the COVID-delayed 2020 season that didn't start until that July.",
      "The Dodgers manager said he hasn't yet put a lot of thought into how Ohtani will have to manage things on a day-to-day basis when hitting and pitching full-time again after another surgery.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be interesting, because the continued, not necessarily rehab with the left shoulder, but keeping it strong, maintaining it ... within the overall body stuff. And then the pitching regimen, the side sessions of pitching, to then be a part of hitters\u2019 meetings and get ready, get ramped up to take at-bats as a DH,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI guess if anyone can manage it, it\u2019s Shohei. He doesn\u2019t waste much time when he\u2019s at the ballpark. But it\u2019s certainly going to look a lot different.\u201d",
      "The 52-year-old Roberts, who was born in Japan, just returned over the weekend from a seven-day trip there that he characterized as personal business and a family vacation. He said it was first time he had been back there in about 20 years.",
      "Roberts met with Ohtani's former manager \u2014 even sending a photo of the two together to Ohtani \u2014 and also sat down with 84-year-old Sadaharu Oh, who hit 868 homers for the Yomiuri Giants from 1959-80.",
      "\u201cI think honestly having a conversation with Sadaharu Oh was absolutely insane,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cObviously we were talking hitting. Obviously he\u2019s a huge fan of Shohei. It was just .. I told him, I always thought he was a figment of my imagination. I never really believed that Sadaharu Oh existed until I saw him and put eyes on him.\u201d",
      "Before going to Japan, Roberts got a text from Ohtani telling him to be ready to see a lot of pictures of the two-way star.",
      "\u201cHe was right,\u201d said Roberts, who got recognized plenty himself. \u201cMore than in Los Angeles. It's pretty bananas.\u201d",

      "Two men\u2019s World Cups, one candidate for each, both a shoo-in to win.",

      "Confirming the 2030 and 2034 hosts should be done in a combined decision by acclamation rather than a registered vote. FIFA published each member\u2019s choice in June 2018 in Moscow when the United States, Canada and Mexico won the 2026 World Cup hosting vote 134-65 against Morocco.",

      "Former New England Patriots coach and six-time Super Bowl champion Bill Belichick said Monday he had \u201ca couple of good conversations\u201d with North Carolina Chancellor Lee Roberts amid his discussions about the Tar Heels' head-coaching job.",
      "Speaking on ESPN's \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show,\u201d Belichick said he had spent the 11 months since his departure from the Patriots taking a \u201clonger look\u201d at college football throughout the season as opposed to during the spring lead-up to the draft as a pro coach.",
      "\u201cSo it\u2019s been, it\u2019s been a good year for me. I\u2019ve learned a lot,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cSo I've had the opportunity to talk to Chancellor Roberts and we\u2019ve had a couple of good conversations. So we\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d",
      "Belichick opted not to go into more detail when asked by McAfee. Instead, Belichick offered a quip about his reputation for giving terse responses during news conferences with the Patriots.",
      "\u201cYeah, let's just leave it at that, Pat,\" Belichick said with a grin. \u201cI mean, I don't want to give out too much information. I want to get my press conference aura back.\u201d",
      "Inside Carolina first reported that Belichick had interviewed with UNC last week, a report later confirmed by The Associated Press, as the Tar Heels seek a replacement for Mack Brown. The school fired its all-time winningest coach and College Football Hall of Famer, announcing Nov. 26 he wouldn't return for a seventh season in his second stint with the school.",
      "Brown coached his finale in the Nov. 30 loss to rival N.C. State.",
      "Moving on from the 73-year-old Brown to hire the 72-year-old Belichick would mean UNC is turning to a coach who has never worked at the college level, yet had incredible NFL success alongside quarterback Tom Brady throughout most of his 24-year tenure with the Patriots that ended last season.",
      "In the time since, he had been linked to NFL jobs, notably the Atlanta Falcons in January.",
      "While Belichick didn't dive into details of his UNC discussions, he did offer insights into the parallels he sees between running an NFL team at a college level where players are now able to cash in on their athletic fame with endorsements and with the arrival of revenue sharing looming.",
      "\u201cIf I was in a college program, the college program would be a pipeline to the NFL for the players that had the ability to play in the NFL,\u201d Belichick said. \"It would be a professional program: training, nutrition, scheme, coaching, techniques that would transfer to the NFL.",
      "\u201cIt would be an NFL program at a college level.\u201d",
      "There's also at least a small family tie to the UNC program for Belichick; his late father, Steve, was an assistant coach for the Tar Heels from 1953-55.",

      "If Juan Soto replicates his 2024 performance throughout his $765 million, 15-year deal with the Mets, he'll make roughly $1.2 million for every home run he hits",
      "These were Juan Soto\u2019s numbers in 2024: 41 home runs, 109 RBIs, a .288 batting average.",
      "Keep doing that over the next 15 years, and he\u2019ll be making roughly $1.2 million for every home run. Or $467,890 for every RBI. Or $307,229 for every hit.",
      "(Pre-tax, of course.)",
      "Soto\u2019s $765 million, 15-year agreement with the New York Mets \u2014 the richest contract in terms of total value to a player in U.S. major sports history, a massive move by billionaire Mets owner Steve Cohen \u2014 provides a chance to look at the numbers in some very silly ways.",
      "He\u2019ll make $314,815 per game. Based on his numbers this season, he'd get $671,053 for every extra-base hit. Or $46,322 every time he swings the bat no matter if he misses, hits a tapper back to the mound or has Mr. Met celebrating in the stands after driving one out at Citi Field. Of course, that's assuming Soto remains as healthy and productive as he was in 2024. If he misses significant time, those rates just go up.",
      "\u201cThank you Uncle Steve,\u201d Mets outfielder Brandon Nimmo wrote on social media.",
      "Some of the numbers around the sports world, when broken down by accomplishment, are simply eye-popping in this era. (And keep in mind, these examples are based on current earnings, not taking into account restructurings or any other potential changes.)",
      "A look:",
      "The two-time Cy Young winner will earn about $65 million in 2025, most of which is a signing bonus that comes his way in January. He\u2019s also never made more than 32 starts in a season. If he makes 32 starts in 2025, he\u2019d be getting (when factoring in the signing bonus) $2,031,250 per game. For comparison\u2019s sake, Detroit\u2019s Tarik Skubal made $2.65 million for the entire 2024 season \u2014 and won a Cy Young award.",
      "His record $700 million deal is no longer a record because of the Soto deal, but Ohtani still holds the mark for average total value at $70 million a year. The only member of baseball\u2019s 50-50 club (54 homers, 59 stolen bases in 2024) would \u2014 at this past season\u2019s rate \u2014 be making $619,469 every time he hits one out or steals a base.",
      "It\u2019s unfair to break down his stats this year because he\u2019s hurt, but Prescott\u2019s current deal is worth an average of $60 million a season from Dallas. Based on his career average, that means over the lifetime of his current contract, Prescott gets $13,680 for every passing yard.",
      "The per-game numbers in the NFL for starting quarterbacks are wild. Patrick Mahomes\u2019 current $450 million contract isn\u2019t even at the top of the cash-per-game standings: Prescott gets about $3.5 million for every Dallas regular season game, while Jacksonville\u2019s Trevor Lawrence, Cincinnati\u2019s Joe Burrow and Green Bay\u2019s Jordan Love are around $3.25 million per game.",
      "At nearly $56 million this season, Curry leads the NBA salary race (for this year, anyway). The NBA\u2019s all-time 3-point king is earning about $680,000 per game in 2024-25; if he was paid by the 3-pointer only, he\u2019d be getting about $161,908 every time he makes one of those this season.",
      "Brown is starting a five-year deal worth around $285 million, Tatum will start a five-year deal next year worth around $314 million. At those rates, the Celtics would be paying their two best players (at their current scoring paces) around $27,406 for every point scored. To compare \u2014 Larry Bird, for his career, made about $1,100 per point.",
      "He\u2019ll start a contract next year that will pay him an average of $14 million a season over eight seasons. At his current rate of scoring, he\u2019d be earning roughly $119,393 for every goal or assist over that span.",
      "Shesterkin just got the richest extension for a goalie, $92 million over eight years. At his current averages, every time he makes a save, he\u2019ll be earning $5,084.",
      "Based just on his Major League Soccer guaranteed salary, Messi got just over $1 million per goal this season ($20.4 million, 20 goals). Again, just counting the MLS salary \u2014 his full deal with Inter Miami is worth at least $150 million for 2\u00bd years \u2014 Messi made $229 for every second he was on the field during the 2024 regular season.",
      "Scheffler\u2019s official earnings in 2024 were $29,228,357 (plus an Olympic gold medal, which is priceless). And that doesn\u2019t include $34,037,500 million in bonuses and unofficial earnings, including $25 million for winning the FedExCup. Add it all up, and that meant the world\u2019s No. 1 player earned about $11,243 per shot he took this season."

      "The portal period closes on Dec. 28.",
      "Oklahoma quarterback Jackson Arnold, Texas State running back Ismail Mahdi, Miami (Ohio) wide receiver Reggie Virgil and Georgia Tech wide receiver Eric Singleton Jr. were among the players who entered the portal on opening day. Ohio State quarterback Devin Brown announced his transfer intentions on Sunday.",
      "The sophomore Arnold passed for 1,984 yards with 16 touchdowns and six interceptions and ran for 560 yards and four scores at Oklahoma.",
      "The former five-star recruit took over as the starter before last season\u2019s bowl game after Dillon Gabriel announced he would transfer. Arnold passed for 361 yards with two touchdowns and three interceptions in the Alamo Bowl loss to Arizona.",
      "Arnold entered this season as the starter, but he struggled to move the team as Oklahoma dealt with major injuries on the offensive line and at receiver. Michael Hawkins Jr. replaced him during a loss to Tennessee, then led the Sooners to a win at Auburn.",
      "Hawkins committed three early turnovers in a loss to South Carolina, opening the door for Arnold to regain the job. Arnold had more success after offensive coordinator Seth Littrell was fired midseason and Joe Jon Finley stepped in as the play-caller.",
      "In a stunning 24-3 win over Alabama, Arnold ran 25 times for 131 yards and completed 9 of 11 passes.",
      "Mahdi has announced on social media he will enter the transfer portal.",
      "Mahdi ran for 991 yards and four touchdowns and caught 24 passes for 195 yards and two TDs this season. He also gained 184 yards on kickoff returns.",
      "Last season, Mahdi led the nation with 2,169 all-purpose yards. He ran for 1,331 yards and 10 touchdowns and had 275 yards receiving and 563 kick return yards.",
      "Virgil, a 6-foot-4 junior, played little his first two years with the RedHawks. He broke out and caught 41 passes for 816 yards and nine touchdowns this season.",
      "\u201cThis decision was not easy, but I believe it is the best step for my future,\u201d he said in a social media post. \u201cI am excited for what lies ahead and I\u2019ll remain forever thankful for the support I\u2019ve received.\u201d",
      "Singleton retweeted an On3.com social media post that said he had entered the portal.",
      "The 5-11 sophomore had 104 catches for 1,468 yards and nine touchdowns in two seasons with the Yellow Jackets. He has not used a redshirt year.",
      "Brown entered the transfer portal after three years as a backup. He announced his intention in a social media post, saying he intends to stay with the Buckeyes through the College Football Playoff.",
      "Brown lost a close quarterback competition to Kyle McCord in 2023 and was relegated to a back seat again when the Buckeyes brought in Kansas State transfer Will Howard for 2024.",
      "For 2025, Ohio State has a crowded quarterback room that includes Julian Sayin, who was the top-rated recruit nationally in the 2024 class.",
      "Brown, from Gilbert, Arizona, has thrown for 325 yards and three touchdowns in the past two seasons, mostly in mop-up duty.",

    "summary": "Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley is closing in on the NFL season rushing record",
    "story": [
      "Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley is closing in on the NFL season rushing record",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Eagles fans serenaded Saquon Barkley with chants of \u201cMVP!\u201d after a 9-yard run gave him the team\u2019s season rushing record.",
      "Barkley set the record in style \u2014 passing Eagles Hall of Famers Wilbert Montgomery and record holder LeSean McCoy in a single game \u2014 as he rushed for 124 yards to push his season total to 1,623 in a 22-16 victory over Carolina.",
      "The total was enough for Barkley to top McCoy\u2019s 1,607 yards in 2013.",
      "Barkley also maintained his pace to break Eric Dickerson\u2019s NFL single-season rushing record of 2,105 yards, set in 1984 with the Los Angeles Rams.",
      "At his pace, Barkley should that reach milestone, even possibly ahead of the 17th game of the season that Dickerson and the NFL did not have in 1984.",
      "Barkley captioned an Instagram post \u201cThankful\u201d with a checked box next to \u201cfranchise single-season rushing yards record.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s ahead for Barkley and his chances of catching Dickerson:",
      "Barkley leads the NFL in rushing with 1,623 yards, a hefty 216 yards ahead of Baltimore's Derrick Henry at 1,407 (though the Ravens had a bye Sunday).",
      "He is averaging 124.8 yards per game. At that pace, and with one more game to play than Dickerson had, he would become the top single-season rusher in NFL history. He needs 483 yards over the final four games to top Dickerson\u2019s 40-year-old record. Barkley is on pace for 2,122 yards, which would put him just 17 yards beyond Dickerson's 2,105 total.",
      "Just on the quality of defenses alone, Barkley faces little pushback down the stretch.",
      "He feasted against a Panthers defense that was one of the worst against the run in the NFL. Barkley averaged 6.2 yards on 20 carries against Carolina and could easily expect to match that pace over at least three of the next four games.",
      "The Steelers come to Philadelphia on Sunday and should provide the stiffest test to Barkley in his record pursuit. Pittsburgh is fourth in the NFL in run defense.",
      "After the Steelers, Barkley could run wild.",
      "The Eagles' final three opponents \u2014 Washington, Dallas and the Giants \u2014 all rank near the bottom of the league against the run.",
      "The 27-year-old Barkley has flourished in his first season with the Eagles.",
      "He is among the favorites for league MVP, according to BetMGM Sportsbook. Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen was the only player with better MVP odds on Monday.",
      "Barkley might enjoy the delicious twist of setting the record against his old team, the Giants \u2014 but surely not the 17th-game asterisk that would come with the total.",
      "Barkley was drafted out of Penn State with the No. 2 overall pick in the 2018 draft. He was an instant success in New York and ran for 1,307 yards his rookie season. Barkley ran for 5,211 yards and 35 touchdowns and had 288 receptions for 2,100 yards and 12 TDs in six years with the Giants.",
      "He hit free agency after the Giants elected not to put a franchise tag on him.",
      "Barkley signed a three-year deal with the Eagles for $26 million guaranteed and $37.75 million overall, making him the highest-paid running back in franchise history.",
      "His free agency was chronicled by the reality sports documentary television series \u201cHard Knocks.\u201d",
      "In the crucial scene, Giants general manager Joe Schoen told Barkley the Giants would not make him an offer, nor stick the franchise tag on him. Rather, the Giants would let Barkley test the free-agent market, a move that sent him to an NFC East rival.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll have a tough time sleeping if Saquon goes to Philadelphia, I\u2019ll tell you that,\u201d team owner John Mara said to Schoen in the series. \u201cAs I\u2019ve told you, just being around enough players, he\u2019s the most popular player we have, by far.\u201d",
      "Under general manager Howie Roseman, the Eagles generally had been loath to use high draft picks or valuable salary cap space on a running back.",
      "Barkley was deemed a worthy exception.",
      "Barkley has been a workhorse this season and worked a heavy load in New York \u2014 when he was healthy. Barkley only twice played in 16 games with the Giants.",
      "He played in 14 games last season, missing three because of a high ankle sprain. He ran for 962 yards and six touchdowns. He was limited to two games in 2020 after he suffered a torn ACL.",
      "Barkley has played through minor injuries this season and proved his durability by leading the NFL with 266 carries.",
      "But injuries might not be his only potential problem. The Eagles' nine-game winning streak has them sitting as the No. 2 seed in the NFC. Should they clinch that spot early, the final game against New York could be meaningless and coach Nick Sirianni could have to decide if Barkley goes for the mark or sits out ahead of the playoffs.",
      "Sporting his trademark goggles and Jheri curl, Dickerson was one of the great running backs in the 1980s, and the Hall of Famer was widely considered one of the best of all time.",
      "Dickerson finished his career with 13,259 yards, the ninth-most in NFL history. Emmitt Smith holds the career NFL rushing record with 18,355 yards.",
      "In 1984, Dickerson topped 100 yards rushing 12 times to break Buffalo's O.J. Simpson's 1973 record of 2,003 yards rushing in a single season.",
      "Simpson set his record in 14 games before the NFL expanded to 16 in 1978. The NFL moved to 17 games in 2021.",

      "William Hill operates retail sportsbooks in Atlantic City at the Caesars, Harrah's and Tropicana casinos. The casinos' parent company, Caesars Entertainment, did not respond to messages seeking comment Friday and Monday.",
      "According to documents from the enforcement division, on Feb. 23 and 24, 2022, it took 42 bets via in-person kiosks on 12 college basketball games after the results were already known. William Hill paid just over $5,000 to customers on six bets before it became aware of the error. The remainder of the bets were voided and the customers' initial wagers were returned to them.",
      "William Hill blamed the error on a sportsbook content supplier, London-based OpenBet, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.",
      "Similar errors allowed illegal bets on two boxing matches. On June 11, 2022, William Hill took bets on a Chris Kongo-Sebastian Formella boxing match that it had advertised as starting at noon. However, the match began at 11:15 a.m. and concluded at 11:55 a.m. On April 15, 2023, William Hill took bets on a Denzel Bentley-Kieran Smith fight after it, too, had already ended. The company listed the fight as a noon start, but it began at 11:55 a.m. and ended just 45 seconds later with a knockout.",
      "The division also fined Amelco, a London-based sports betting technology company, $10,000 for violations including allowing sportsbook PlayUp to take a bet in March 2022 on Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg becoming the next U.S. president. Although recent court decisions allowed political betting in last month's election, it was not allowed at the time the bet was made.",
      "PlayUp utilized Amelco and Sportradar as its sportsbook providers. In documents filed with the enforcement division, Amelco said Sportradar listed the U.S. presidential election under a category of bets that Amelco marked as \u201ctrue,\u201d automatically listing it on its menu of betting markets.",
      "Amelco told the division its own trading team failed to recognize the U.S. election as an event that was not authorized to be bet upon.",
      "Sportradar said it does not label any of the betting markets in its data feed as authorized or unauthorized, adding it is the responsibility of each sports betting company to make sure they only offer bets that comply with local laws.",
      "Sportradar also noted that the division did not assess a fine against it, adding that Amelco was \u201csolely liable\u201d for the violation.",
      "PlayUp also accepted two bets worth nearly $700 on a Seton Hall University basketball game on Jan. 18, 2023, in violation of a state law prohibiting bets on New Jersey college teams.",
      "PlayUp and Amelco did not respond to requests for comment Monday. The $1 bet on Buttigieg was voided.",
      "It's not the first time this has happened.",
      "In November 2021, the division fined the Malta-based sports betting technology company Kambi Group and Chicago-based Rush Street Interactive $1,000 apiece for taking bets on a British soccer game that was already over. And in September, it fined bet365 $33,000 for taking bets on already-completed basketball, golf and mixed martial arts events.",

      "The Onion's bid to buy conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars is back in a Texas courtroom",
      "A bankruptcy judge scrutinizing The Onion\u2019s bid for Alex Jones \u2019 Infowars platform was expected to hear a second day of testimony Tuesday after an auctioneer defended the satirical news outlet\u2019s winning offer in November.",
      "It is not clear how quickly U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez in Houston will decide whether to approve the bid. The Onion, which wants to turn Infowars\u2019 website and social media accounts into parodies, offered $1.75 million for Infowars\u2019 assets in the auction.",
      "Jones did not attend Monday\u2019s start of the key hearing and instead continued to broadcast from his studios in Austin.",
      "Jeff Tanenbaum, president of ThreeSixty Asset Advisors, was grilled by lawyers for Jones and the company in a Houston courtroom on Monday over how The Onion\u2019s bid came to be valued at $7 million and why a live auction was not held. He defended both the value of the bid and its selection after the two sealed offers were opened.",
      "Lopez could ultimately decide whether to void The Onion\u2019s bid, name the Jones-affiliated company the winner or hold another auction, among other possibilities.",
      "Jones and First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements and submitted the other bid, are alleging fraud and collusion in the auction that concluded on Nov. 14. The trustee and The Onion deny the allegations, accusing Jones and the company of sour grapes. First United American Companies bid $3.5 million.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut. Jones repeatedly called the 2012 shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors and aimed at increasing gun control.",
      "Most of the proceeds from the sale of Infowars, as well as many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, will go to the Sandy Hook families to help satisfy judgments issued by juries and judges in state courts in Connecticut and Texas. Some proceeds will go to Jones\u2019 other creditors.",
      "The Onion\u2019s bid also included a pledge by many of the Sandy Hook families to forgo some or all of the auction proceeds due to them to give other creditors a total of $100,000 more than they would receive under other bids.",
      "The trustee, Christopher Murray, chose The Onion, saying its proposal was better for creditors because they would receive more money. The Onion valued the bid, with the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer, at $7 million, because that amount was equal to a purchase price that would provide the same amount of money to the other creditors.",
      "Tanenbaum testified that he agreed with the $7 million valuation and believed The Onion\u2019s bid conformed to the auction rules.",
      "A lawyer for Jones, Ben Broocks, asked Tanenbaum how it was possible that the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer boosted The Onion\u2019s offer to such a high amount.",
      "\u201cIt means the purchase price value has gone up because another purchase price would have to be higher than that value in order to provide the same net benefit to that group of creditors,\u201d Tanenbaum said.",
      "During his opening argument, Broocks said there was no way The Onion should have been chosen over First United American.",
      "\u201cHow does a $1.75 million bid beat a $3.5 million bid?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow is that $1.75 million greater? Well, it\u2019s voodoo economics to use a phrase.\u201d",
      "Joshua Wolfshohl, an attorney for Murray, told the judge Monday that no wrongdoing occurred during the auction. He called the complaints by Jones and First United American Companies unfounded.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of their complaints are just fantastic, imagined conspiracy theories that have no basis in reality,\u201d he said.",
      "Murray, The Onion and the Sandy families deny allegations of wrongdoing. In his own court filing, Murray called the allegations \u201ca disappointed bidder\u2019s improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open auction process.\u201d",
      "Up for sale at the auction were all the equipment and other assets in the Infowars studio in Austin, Texas, as well as its social media accounts, websites, video archive and product trademarks. Jones uses the studio to broadcast his far-right, conspiracy theory-filled shows on the Infowars website, his account on the social platform X and radio stations.",
      "Jones has set up another studio, websites and social media accounts in case The Onion wins approval to buy Infowars and kicks him out. Jones has said he could continue using the Infowars platforms if the auction winner is friendly to him.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights but has acknowledged that the school shooting happened."

      "About 87,000 people are being evacuated in a central Philippine region after a volcano erupted with a huge plume of ash and superhot streams of gas and debris hurtling down its slopes",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- About 87,000 people were being evacuated in a central Philippine region Tuesday a day after a volcano briefly erupted with a towering ash plume and superhot streams of gas and debris hurtling down its western slopes.",
      "The latest eruption of Mount Kanlaon on central Negros island did not cause any immediate casualties, but the alert level was raised one level, indicating further and more explosive eruptions may occur.",
      "Volcanic ash fell on a wide area, including Antique province, more than 200 kilometers (124 miles) across seawaters west of the volcano, obscuring visibility and posing health risks, Philippine chief volcanologist Teresito Bacolcol and other officials said by telephone.",
      "At least six domestic flights and a flight bound for Singapore were canceled and two local flights were diverted in the region Monday and Tuesday due to Kanlaon\u2019s eruption, according to the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines.",
      "The mass evacuations were being carried out urgently in towns and villages nearest the western and southern slopes of Kanlaon which were blanketed by its ash, including in La Castellana town in Negros Occidental where nearly 47,000 people have to be evacuated out of a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) danger zone, the Office of Civil Defense said.",
      "More than 6,000 have moved to evacuation centers aside from those who have temporarily transferred to the homes of relatives in La Castellana by Tuesday morning, the town\u2019s mayor, Rhumyla Mangilimutan, told The Associated Press by telephone.",
      "President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said authorities were ready to provide support to large numbers of displaced villagers and that his social welfare secretary flew early Tuesday to the affected region.",
      "\"We are ready to support the families who have been evacuated outside the 6-kilometer danger zone,\u201d Marcos told reporters.",
      "Government scientists were monitoring the air quality due to the risk of contamination from toxic volcanic gases that may require more people to be evacuated from areas affected by Monday\u2019s eruption.",
      "Disaster-response contingents were rapidly establishing evacuation centers and seeking supplies of face masks, food and hygiene packs ahead of the Christmas season, traditionally a peak time for holiday travel and family celebrations in the largely Roman Catholic nation.",
      "Authorities also shut schools and imposed a nighttime curfew in the most vulnerable areas.",
      "The Philippines\u2019 Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said the nearly four-minute eruption of Kanlaon volcano on Monday afternoon had caused a pyroclastic density current \u2014 a superhot stream of gas, ash, debris and rocks that can incinerate anything in its path.",
      "\u201cIt's a one-time but major eruption,\u201d Bacolcol told the AP, adding that volcanologists were assessing if Monday's eruption spewed old volcanic debris and rocks clogged in and near the summit crater or was caused by rising magma from underneath.",
      "Few volcanic earthquakes were detected ahead of Monday's explosion, Bacolcol said.",
      "The alert level around Kanlaon was placed on Monday to the third-highest of a five-step warning system, indicating \u201cmagmatic eruption\" may have begun and may progress to further explosive eruptions.",
      "The 2,435-meter (7,988-foot) volcano, one of the country\u2019s 24 most-active volcanoes, last erupted in June sending hundreds of villagers to emergency shelters.",
      "In 1996, three hikers were killed near the peak and several others were later rescued when Kanlaon erupted without warning, officials said.",
      "Located in the so-called Pacific \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d a region prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, the Philippines is also lashed by about 20 typhoons and storms a year and is among the countries most prone to natural disasters."

    "story": [
      "California lawmakers will consider a bill to require labels on social media platforms warning of their effects on young people\u2019s lives",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California, home to some of the largest technology companies in the world, would be the first U.S. state to require mental health warning labels on social media sites if lawmakers pass a bill introduced Monday.",
      "The legislation sponsored by state Attorney General Rob Bonta is necessary to bolster safety for children online, supporters say, but industry officials vow to fight the measure and others like it under the First Amendment. Warning labels for social media gained swift bipartisan support from dozens of attorneys general, including Bonta, after U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called on Congress to establish the requirements earlier this year, saying social media is a contributing factor in the mental health crisis among young people.",
      "\u201cThese companies know the harmful impact their products can have on our children, and they refuse to take meaningful steps to make them safer,\u201d Bonta said at a news conference Monday. \u201cTime is up. It\u2019s time we stepped in and demanded change.\u201d",
      "State officials haven't provided details on the bill, but Bonta said the warning labels could pop up once weekly.",
      "Up to 95% of youth ages 13 to 17 say they use a social media platform, and more than a third say that they use social media \u201calmost constantly,\u201d according to 2022 data from the Pew Research Center. Parents\u2019 concerns prompted Australia to pass the world\u2019s first law banning social media for children under 16 in November.",
      "\u201cThe promise of social media, although real, has turned into a situation where they\u2019re turning our children\u2019s attention into a commodity,\u201d Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, who authored the California bill, said Monday. \u201cThe attention economy is using our children and their well-being to make money for these California companies.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers instead should focus on online safety education and mental health resources, not warning label bills that are \u201cconstitutionally unsound,\u201d said Todd O\u2019Boyle, a vice president of the tech industry policy group Chamber of Progress.",
      "\u201cWe strongly suspect that the courts will set them aside as compelled speech,\u201d O\u2019Boyle told The Associated Press.",
      "Victoria Hinks' 16-year-old daughter, Alexandra, died by suicide four months ago after being \u201cled down dark rabbit holes\u201d on social media that glamorized eating disorders and self-harm. Hinks said the labels would help protect children from companies that turn a blind eye to the harm caused to children\u2019s mental health when they become addicted to social media platforms.",
      "\u201cThere's not a bone in my body that doubts social media played a role in leading her to that final, irreversible decision,\u201d Hinks said. \u201cThis could be your story.\"",
      "Common Sense Media, a sponsor of the bill, said it plans to lobby for similar proposals in other states.",
      "California in the past decade has positioned itself as a leader in regulating and fighting the tech industry to bolster online safety for children.",
      "The state was the first in 2022 to bar online platforms from using users\u2019 personal information in ways that could harm children. It was one of the states that sued Meta in 2023 and TikTok in October for deliberately designing addictive features that keep kids hooked on their platforms.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, also signed several bills in September to help curb the effects of social media on children, including one to prohibit social media platforms from knowingly providing addictive feeds to children without parental consent and one to limit or ban students from using smartphones on school campus.",
      "Federal lawmakers have held hearings on child online safety and legislation is in the works to force companies to take reasonable steps to prevent harm. The legislation has the support of X owner Elon Musk and the President-elect\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr. Still, the last federal law aimed at protecting children online was enacted in 1998, six years before Facebook\u2019s founding."

      "Attorneys for Meta shareholders are asking a Delaware judge to sanction former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and fellow Facebook board member and current White House chief of staff Jeff Zients for deleting emails related to the Cambridge Anal...",
      "WILMINGTON, Del. -- Attorneys for Meta shareholders asked a Delaware judge Monday to sanction the company's former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and fellow Facebook board member and current White House chief of staff Jeff Zients for deleting emails related to the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal, despite being told to preserve such records.",
      "The plaintiff attorneys contend that Sandberg and Zients used personal email accounts to communicate about key issues relating to their 2018 shareholder lawsuit that alleged Facebook officers and directors violated both the law and their fiduciary duties in failing for years to protect the privacy of user data.",
      "\u201cAlthough Sandberg and Zients received a litigation hold requiring them to preserve documents from these accounts, they both knowingly and permanently destroyed electronically stored information from such sources,\u201d attorneys said in a court filing.",
      "The plaintiffs say the former board members were either \u201creckless or intentional\u201d in destroying documents, noting that Sandberg deleted communications to and from her Gmail account after only 30 days, even after being notified of the \u201clitigation hold\u201d to preserve documents. Zients never disabled an auto-delete function on his email account, even though he, too, received a litigation hold and consulted with lawyers, they said.",
      "The plaintiffs argue that Sandberg and Zients should be prohibited from testifying about information they sent or received using their personal email accounts. They also say the burden of proof for any affirmative defense they present should be raised to a standard of \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d instead of the lower standard of a \u201cpreponderance\u201d of the evidence.",
      "Sandberg was deposed last week. Plaintiff attorney Max Huffman said Zients is \u201cbusy\u201d and will be deposed in February \u201cafter there\u2019s an effective transition in Washington.\u201d",
      "Defense attorney Berton Ashman described the email deletions as \u201cunfortunate\u201d but argued that the plaintiffs have not shown that they were prejudiced in any way.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no intent here to destroy relevant or responsive information,\u201d Ashman told Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster, adding that there no \u201ctrove of missing emails.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no grand scheme or suggestion of bad behavior,\u201d he added.",
      "Ashman said the vast majority of emails that Sandberg and Zients sent or received using their personal accounts were also received by other individuals at Facebook. He suggested that any emails that may have been deleted have been made available to the plaintiffs from other sources at Facebook.",
      "Huffman, the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer, said Sandberg does not deserve the benefit of the doubt.",
      "\u201cShe unilaterally controlled what was kept and what was destroyed,\u201d he told the judge.",
      "Laster, who is scheduled to preside over a non-jury trial in April, said he wanted to see a transcript of Sandberg\u2019s deposition before ruling on the motion for sanctions.",
      "Last year, the judge rejected a defense motion arguing that the lawsuit should be dismissed because the plaintiffs did not first demand that Facebook\u2019s board take legal action before filing litigation themselves. He agreed with the plaintiffs that such a demand would have been futile because of doubts that a majority of the relevant Facebook board members, many with close personal and business ties to Mark Zuckerberg, would be willing to confront the CEO and founder of the company over its privacy failures.",
      "Laster noted that, in deciding on a motion to dismiss, he was required to accept the allegations in the complaint as true.",
      "The complaint alleges that Facebook officials repeatedly and continually violated a 2012 consent order with the Federal Trade Commission under which Facebook agreed to stop collecting and sharing personal data on platform users and friends without their consent.",
      "Facebook later sold user data to commercial partners in direct violation of the consent order and removed disclosures from privacy settings that were required under consent order, the lawsuit alleges. The company\u2019s conduct resulted in significant fines from regulators in Europe and culminated in  the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018.  That case involved a British political consulting firm hired by Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign that paid a Facebook app developer for the personal information of tens of millions Facebook users.",
      "The fallout led to Facebook agreeing to pay unprecedented $5 billion penalty to settle FTC charges that the company violated the 2012 consent order by deceiving users about their ability to protect their personal information."

      "In a brief news release with few details, Chinese regulators appear to be focusing on Nvidia's $6.9 billion acquisition of network and data transmission company Mellanox in 2019.",
      "Nvidia shares fell 2.6% Monday. They are still up 180% so far this year.",
      "Considered a bellwether for artificial intelligence demand, Nvidia has led the AI sector to become one of the stock market\u2019s biggest companies, as tech giants spend heavily on the company\u2019s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems.",
      "Nvidia's shares have surged this year along with the California company's revenue and profit due to AI demand. According to data firm FactSet, about 16% of Nvidia's revenue comes from China, second only to its U.S.-generated revenue.",
      "A spokesperson for the company based in Santa Clara, California, said in an emailed statement that Nvidia is \u201chappy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.\u201d",
      "In its most recent earnings release, Nvidia posted revenue of $35.08 billion, up 94% from $18.12 billion a year ago. Nvidia earned $19.31 billion in the quarter, more than double the $9.24 billion it posted in last year\u2019s third quarter. The earnings release did not break out revenue from China.",
      "The company's market value rocketed to $3.5 trillion recently, passing Microsoft and briefly overtaking Apple as the world's most valuable company.",
      "China\u2019s antitrust investigation follows a report this summer by technology news site The Information that the U.S. Justice Department was investigating complaints from rivals that Nvidia was abusing its market dominance in the chip sector. The allegations reported include Nvidia threatening to punish those who buy products from both itself and its competitors at the same time.",
      "David Bieri, an international finance expert at Virginia Tech, said that China\u2019s investigation is \u201cnot about what Nvidia is doing in China, per se\u201d but rather a signal to the incoming Trump administration. China, Bieri said, is looking to set the tone of future relations.",
      "The Chinese government, he said, is telling the U.S. \u201cdon\u2019t mess with us, because all of your darling corporations that your version of capitalism needs to prosper have entanglements\u201d with China.",
      "Nvidia will have to revise its strategy in China or come up with provisions in their budgets for the type of uncertainty business with China will bring, Bieri said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think this is something that they can shake off,\u201d he said. \u201cI also have a tremendous amount of faith in the brilliance of the management strategy of a corporation like Nvidia to not only pay attention to credit risk, market risk and operational risk, but also to political risk.\u201d",
      "Nvidia\u2019s invention of graphics processor chips, or GPUs, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics.",
      "Last month, it replaced Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, ending the pioneering semiconductor company's 25-year run on the index.",

      "TikTok on Monday asked a federal appeals court to bar the Biden administration from enforcing a law that could lead to a ban on the popular platform until the Supreme Court reviews the case",
      "TikTok asked a federal appeals court on Monday to bar the Biden administration from enforcing a law that could lead to a ban on the popular platform until the Supreme Court reviews its challenge to the statute.",
      "The legal filing was made after a panel of three judges on the same court sided with the government last week and ruled that the law, which requires TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance to divest its stakes in the social media company or face a ban, was constitutional.",
      "If the law is not overturned, both TikTok and its parent ByteDance, which is also a plaintiff in the case, have claimed that the popular app will shut down by Jan. 19, 2025. TikTok has more than 170 million American users who would be affected, the companies have said.",
      "In their legal filing on Monday, attorneys for the two companies wrote that even if a shutdown lasted one month, it would cause TikTok to lose about a third of its daily users in the U.S.",
      "The company would also lose 29% of its total \u201ctargeted global\u201d advertising revenue for next year as well as talent since current and prospective employees would look elsewhere for jobs, they wrote.",
      "\u201cBefore that happens, the Supreme Court should have an opportunity, as the only court with appellate jurisdiction over this action, to decide whether to review this exceptionally important case,\u201d the filing said.",
      "It's not clear if the Supreme Court will take up the case. But some legal experts have said the justices are likely to weigh in on the case since it raises novel issues about social media platforms and how far the government could go in its stated aims of protecting national security.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok the last time he was in the White House, has said he is now against such action.",
      "In their legal filing, the two companies pointed to the political realities, saying that an injunction would provide a \u201cmodest delay\u201d that would give \u201cthe incoming Administration time to determine its position \u2014 which could moot both the impending harms and the need for Supreme Court review.\u201d",
      "Attorneys for the two companies are asking the appeals court to decide on the request for an enforcement pause by Dec. 16. The Department of Justice said in a court filing on Monday that it will oppose the request. Justice officials also suggested that an expedited decision denying TikTok's request would give the Supreme Court more time to consider the case."

      "A large volcano eruption in the Philippines sent a plume of ash and gases up to 1.8 miles high following a powerful blast that sent villagers fleeing to emergency shelters",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- A plume of hot ash and gases up to 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) high forced residents to seek shelter after a volcano in the Philippines erupted on Monday.",
      "There were no immediate reports of casualties in the latest explosion of Mount Kanlaon, on central Negros island, but authorities shut schools and imposed a nighttime curfew after ash falling in several villages clouded the the visibility of motorists and sparked health concerns.",
      "\u201cIt sounded like a cannon,\u201d Mayor Jose Chubasco Cardenas of Canlaon city, which lies southeast of the volcano, told The Associated Press by telephone. \u201cThere have been quiet eruptions before, but this was one very loud.\u201d",
      "Disaster-response officials raised the danger level around Kanlaon due to \u201ca greater risk of hazardous volcanic activity\u201d and ordered villagers within a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) radius of the crater to be evacuated.",
      "About 100 people had fled to emergency shelters in Canlaon by nightfall after the midafternoon volcanic eruption, Cardenas said. The number of displaced people could reach more than 2,000 due to stronger prospects of more eruption, he added.",
      "The Philippines' Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said the eruption had caused a pyroclastic density current \u2014 a superhot stream of ash, debris and rocks that can incinerate anything in its path.",
      "The alert level around Kanlaon is at the third-highest of a five-step warning system, indicating \u201cmagmatic eruption has begun that may progress to further explosive eruptions.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Onion's bid to buy conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars returned to a Texas courtroom",
      "An auction company executive involved in the liquidation of Alex Jones\u2019 conspiracy theory platform Infowars testified for nearly five hours Monday, as a bankruptcy judge in Texas began a hearing into whether The Onion satirical news outlet was properly named the winning bidder over a company affiliated with Jones.",
      "Jeff Tanenbaum, president of ThreeSixty Asset Advisors, was grilled by lawyers for Jones and the company in a Houston courtroom over how The Onion\u2019s bid came to be valued at $7 million and why a live auction was not held. He defended both the value of the bid and its selection after the two sealed offers were opened.",
      "U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez continued the hearing to Tuesday afternoon, when the trustee overseeing the sale of Jones\u2019 assets is expected to take the stand. Lopez could ultimately decide whether to void The Onion\u2019s bid, name the Jones-affiliated company the winner or hold another auction, among other possibilities.",
      "Jones and First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements and submitted the other bid, are alleging fraud and collusion in the auction that concluded on Nov. 14. The trustee and The Onion deny the allegations, accusing Jones and the company of sour grapes.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut. Jones repeatedly called the 2012 shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors and aimed at increasing gun control.",
      "Most of the proceeds from the sale of Infowars, as well as many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, will go to the Sandy Hook families to help satisfy judgments issued by juries and judges in state courts in Connecticut and Texas. Some proceeds will go to Jones\u2019 other creditors.",
      "The Onion, which wants to turn Infowars\u2019 website and social media accounts into parodies, offered $1.75 million for Infowars\u2019 assets in the auction, while First United American Companies bid $3.5 million.",
      "But The Onion\u2019s bid also included a pledge by many of the Sandy Hook families to forgo some or all of the auction proceeds due to them to give other creditors a total of $100,000 more than they would receive under other bids.",
      "The trustee, Christopher Murray, chose The Onion, saying its proposal was better for creditors because they would receive more money. The Onion valued the bid, with the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer, at $7 million, because that amount was equal to a purchase price that would provide the same amount of money to the other creditors.",
      "Tanenbaum testified that he agreed with the $7 million valuation and believed The Onion\u2019s bid conformed to the auction rules.",
      "A lawyer for Jones, Ben Broocks, asked Tanenbaum how it was possible that the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer boosted The Onion\u2019s offer to such a high amount.",
      "\u201cIt means the purchase price value has gone up because another purchase price would have to be higher than that value in order to provide the same net benefit to that group of creditors,\u201d Tanenbaum said.",
      "During his opening argument, Broocks said there was no way The Onion should have been chosen over First United American.",
      "\u201cHow does a $1.75 million bid beat a $3.5 million bid?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow is that $1.75 million greater? Well, it\u2019s voodoo economics to use a phrase.\u201d",
      "Broocks and a lawyer for First United American, Walter Cicack, also questioned why a live bidding round wasn\u2019t held after the sealed offers weren\u2019t submitted, as they said they expected, but the judge\u2019s order made live bidding optional.",
      "Jones has been criticizing the sale process on his show and social media sites, calling it \u201crigged\u201d and a \u201cfraud.\u201d",
      "Joshua Wolfshohl, an attorney for Murray, told the judge Monday that no wrongdoing occurred during the auction. He called the complaints by Jones and First United American Companies unfounded.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of their complaints are just fantastic, imagined conspiracy theories that have no basis in reality,\u201d he said.",
      "Murray, The Onion and the Sandy families deny allegations of wrongdoing. In his own court filing, Murray called the allegations \u201ca disappointed bidder\u2019s improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open auction process.\u201d",
      "Up for sale at the auction were all the equipment and other assets in the Infowars studio in Austin, Texas, as well as its social media accounts, websites, video archive and product trademarks. Jones uses the studio to broadcast his far-right, conspiracy theory-filled shows on the Infowars website, his account on the social platform X and radio stations.",
      "Jones has set up another studio, websites and social media accounts in case The Onion wins approval to buy Infowars and kicks him out. Jones has said he could continue using the Infowars platforms if the auction winner is friendly to him.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights but has acknowledged that the school shooting happened.",
      "On Friday, a Connecticut appeals court reduced by $150 million the original $1.44 billion judgment against Jones in the lawsuit against him in that state, but upheld the rest of the award. Jones\u2019 lawyer said he will ask Connecticut\u2019s highest court to review the appellate ruling. Jones is also appealing a $50 million judgment in a similar Texas defamation lawsuit."

      "TikTok's future in the U.S. appeared uncertain on Friday after a federal appeals court rejected a legal challenge to a law that requires the social media platform to cut ties with its China-based parent company or be banned by mid-January.",
      "A panel of three judges on The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled unanimously that the law withstood constitutional scrutiny, rebuffing arguments from the two companies that the statute violated their rights and the rights of TikTok users in the U.S.",
      "The government has said it wants ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, to divest its stakes. But if it doesn't and the platform goes away, it would have a seismic impact on the lives of content creators who rely on the platform for income as well as users who use it for entertainment and connection.",
      "Here are some details on the ruling and what could happen next:",
      "In their lawsuit, TikTok and ByteDance, which is also a plaintiff in the case, had challenged the law on various fronts, arguing in part that the statute ran afoul of the First Amendment and was an unconstitutional bill of attainder that unfairly targeted the two companies.",
      "But the court sided with attorneys for the Justice Department who said that the government was attempting to address national security concerns and the way in which it chose to do so did not violate the constitution.",
      "The Justice Department has argued in court that TikTok poses a national security risk due to its connections to China. Officials say that Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread, or suppress, information. However, the U.S. hasn't publicly provided examples of that happening.",
      "The appeals court ruling, written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg, said the law was \u201ccarefully crafted to deal only with control by a foreign adversary.\" The judges also rejected the claim that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Furthermore, Ginsburg wrote the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to \u201csuppress content or require a certain mix of content\u201d on TikTok.",
      "TikTok and ByteDance are expected to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, but it's unclear whether the court will take up the case.",
      "TikTok indicated in a statement on Friday the two companies are preparing to take their case to high court, saying the Supreme Court has \u201can established historical record of protecting Americans\u2019 right to free speech.\"",
      "\"We expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\u201d a company spokesperson said.",
      "Alan Morrison, a professor at The George Washington University Law School, said he expects the Supreme Court to take up the case because of the novelty of the issues raised in the lawsuit. If that happens, attorneys for the two companies still have to convince the court to grant them an emergency stay that will prevent the government from enforcing the Jan. 19 divestiture deadline stipulated in the law, Morrison said.",
      "Such a move could drag out the process until the Justices make a ruling.",
      "Tiffany Cianci, a TikTok content creator who has supported the platform, said she was not shocked about the outcome of the court's ruling on Friday because lower courts typically defer to the executive branch on these types of cases. She believes the company will have a stronger case at the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cI believe that the next stages are more likely to produce a victory for TikTokers and for TikTok as a whole,\u201d Cianci said.",
      "Another wild card is President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the recent presidential campaign that he is now against such action.",
      "The Trump transition team has not offered details on how Trump plans to carry out his pledge to \u201csave TikTok.\" But spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement last month that he plans to \u201cdeliver\u201d on his campaign promises.",
      "After Trump takes office on Jan. 20th, it would fall on his Justice Department to enforce the law and punish any potential violators. Penalties would apply to any app stores that would violate a prohibition on TikTok and to internet hosting services which would be barred from supporting it.",
      "Some have speculated that Trump could ask his Justice Department to abstain from enforcing the law. But tech companies like Apple and Google, which offer TikTok's app on their app stores, would then have to trust that the administration would not come after them for any violations.",
      "Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said enforcement discretion \u2014 or executive orders \u2014 can not override existing law, leaving Trump with \u201climited room for unilateral action.\"",
      "There are other things Trump could potentially do. It's possible he could invoke provisions of the law that allow the president to determine whether a sale or a similar transaction frees TikTok from \u201cforeign adversary\u201d control. Another option is to urge Congress to repeal the law. But that too would require support from congressional Republicans who have overwhelmingly supported the prospect of getting TikTok out of the hands of a Chinese company.",
      "In a statement issued Friday, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, said he was \u201coptimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok\u201d and allow its continued use in the United States.",
      "ByteDance has said it won't sell TikTok. And even if it wanted to, a sale of the proprietary algorithm that powers TikTok is likely to get blocked under Chinese export controls that the country issued in 2020.",
      "That means if TikTok is sold without the algorithm, its likely that the buyer would only purchase a shell of the platform that doesn't contain the technology that made the app a cultural powerhouse.",
      "Still, some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in buying it.",
      "This week, a spokesperson for McCourt\u2019s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital. The spokesperson did not disclose the identity of the participants."

      "A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat",
      "A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat. Researchers found at higher temperatures and humidity, the heat kills far more young people under 35 than those older than 50.",
      "For decades, health and weather experts have warned that the elderly and the youngest children were most vulnerable in heat waves. But this study looking at all deaths in Mexico from 1998 to 2019 shows that when the combination of humidity and temperature reach uncomfortable levels, such as the mid to upper 80s Fahrenheit (around 30 degrees Celsius) and 50% relative humidity, there were nearly 32 temperature-related deaths of people 35 years old for every temperature-related death of someone 50 and older.",
      "The study in Friday's journal Science Advances shows an especially surprising spike of heat-related deaths in an age group thought to be young and robust: People between 18 and 35. That age group alone had nine times as many temperature-related deaths as those older than 50.",
      "Study authors and outside experts are scrambling to figure out why. Demographics alone don't explain why more young adult Mexicans are dying in high heat than their elders. Two theories: Outdoor workers who can't escape the heat, and young people who don't know their limits.",
      "The trend is likely to widen as the world warms from human-caused climate change, according to computer simulations run by the study team.",
      "\u201cWe found that younger people are especially vulnerable to humid heat,\u201d study co-author Jeffrey Shrader, a climate economist at Columbia University, said. \u201cAs the climate warms, we're really going to be shifting the burden of temperature-related mortality towards younger individuals and away from older individuals who tend to be more vulnerable to cold temperatures.\u201d",
      "Data from cold weather shows more than 300 deaths of Mexican residents 50 and older for every young person dying from cold temperatures, according to the study.",
      "\u201cPeople of all ages are increasingly at risk from the rising temperatures, and this study shows that those that we might have considered relatively safe from heat-related adverse health outcomes might not be so much so,\u201d said Marina Romanello, executive director of the Lancet Countdown that monitors health effects of climate change. She was not part of the study team.",
      "\u201cHeat is a much more dangerous silent killer than most people acknowledge it to be, and that heat is increasingly putting our health and survival at risk,\" Romanello said in an email.",
      "Study authors decided to examine weather-related deaths in Mexico because that country not only has detailed mortality data, but it has a variety of different climates making it an ideal place to study in depth, Shrader said.",
      "Researchers also want to figure out whether this is just a situation in Mexico or other warmer sections of the globe have similar spikes in young adult deaths in high heat and humidity.",
      "Initially the team just wanted to look at deaths and what scientists call wet-bulb globe temperatures, but when they looked at age differences, they were surprised and looked in more detail, Shrader said. Wet-bulb temperature, which is intended to mirror how the body cools itself, is derived using a complicated measurement system that factors in humidity and solar radiation. A wet-bulb globe temperature of 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) is thought to be the limit for human survivability. Most places don\u2019t reach that level.",
      "Researchers determined temperature-related mortality by complex statistical analysis that compares numerous factors in the number of deaths and removes everything they can except temperature fluctuations, said study co-author Andrew Wilson, a Columbia climate economics researcher.",
      "Researchers also calculated the ideal temperature for when there are the fewest excess deaths at each age group. Younger adults' sweet temperature spot is about nine degrees Fahrenheit (five degrees Celsius) cooler than it is for older people, Shrader and Wilson said.",
      "Some outside health and climate experts were initially puzzled at the higher youth mortality seen in the study. Co-author Patrick Kinney, a professor of urban health and sustainability at Boston University, said it was likely the study included a higher proportion of outdoor workers exposed to heat than prior studies did.",
      "Study co-author Tereza Cavazos, a climate scientist at the Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education in Mexico, said she remembers her father's generations taking siestas in the high heat of the day and that was healthy. That doesn't happen so much now, she said.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of population that is vulnerable in the future. Not even in the future, right now,\u201d Cavazos said. She mentioned three Mexican heat waves this year that hit in the middle of the country and kept the deadly heat going overnight so people had little relief. Usually cool nights allow a body to recover.",
      "Younger people often have a sense of invulnerability to weather extremes and do things that increase their risk, such as play sports in high heat, Cavazos said.",
      "\u201cHigh humidity makes it a lot harder for the body to cool itself through sweating \u2013 which is how our body primarily stays cool,\" said Dr. Renee Salas, an emergency medicine physician and climate change expert at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. She was not part of the study team. \"So someone young and healthy working outside in heat and high humidity can reach a point where the body can no longer cool itself safely \u2013 causing a deadly form of heat injury called heat stroke.\u201d",

      "A federal appeals court panel on Friday unanimously upheld a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok as soon as next month, handing a resounding defeat to the popular social media platform as it fights for its survival in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied TikTok's petition to overturn the law \u2014 which requires TikTok to break ties with its China-based parent company ByteDance or be banned by mid-January \u2014 and rebuffed the company's challenge of the statute, which it argued had ran afoul of the First Amendment.",
      "\u201cThe First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\u201d said the court's opinion, which was written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg. \u201cHere the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary\u2019s ability to gather data on people in the United States.\u201d",
      "TikTok and ByteDance \u2014 another plaintiff in the lawsuit \u2014 are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, though its unclear whether the court will take up the case.",
      "\u201cThe Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said in a statement.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the TikTok ban was conceived and pushed through based upon inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people,\u201d Hughes said. Unless stopped, he argued the statute \u201cwill silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in the US and around the world on January 19th, 2025.\u201d",
      "Though the case is squarely in the court system, it's also possible the two companies might be thrown some sort of a lifeline by President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the presidential campaign that he is now against such action.",
      "\u201cHe wants to save TikTok,\u201d Rep. Michael Waltz, Trump's pick for national security adviser, said Friday during an interview on Fox Business.",
      "The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April, was the culmination of a yearslong saga in Washington over the short-form video-sharing app, which the government sees as a national security threat due to its connections to China.",
      "The U.S. has said it\u2019s concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that\u2019s difficult to detect. The European Union on Friday expressed similar concerns as it investigates intelligence that suggests Russia possibly abused the platform to influence the elections in Romania.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Friday.",
      "TikTok, which sued the government over the law in May, has long denied it could be used by Beijing to spy on or manipulate Americans. Its attorneys have accurately pointed out that the U.S. hasn\u2019t provided evidence to show that the company handed over user data to the Chinese government, or manipulated content for Beijing\u2019s benefit in the U.S. They have also argued the law is predicated on future risks, which the Department of Justice has emphasized pointing in part to unspecified action it claims the two companies have taken in the past due to demands from the Chinese government.",
      "Friday\u2019s ruling came after the appeals court panel, composed of two Republicans and one Democrat appointed judges, heard oral arguments in September.",
      "In the hearing, which lasted more than two hours, the panel appeared to grapple with how TikTok\u2019s foreign ownership affects its rights under the Constitution and how far the government could go to curtail potential influence from abroad on a foreign-owned platform. On Friday, all three denied TikTok\u2019s petition.",
      "In the court's ruling, Ginsburg, a Republican appointee, rejected TikTok's main legal arguments against the law, including that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder, or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. He also said the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to \"suppress content or require a certain mix of content\u201d on TikTok.",
      "\u201cContent on the platform could in principle remain unchanged after divestiture, and people in the United States would remain free to read and share as much PRC propaganda (or any other content) as they desire on TikTok or any other platform of their choosing,\u201d Ginsburg wrote, using the abbreviation for the People\u2019s Republic of China.",
      "Judge Sri Srinivasan, the chief judge on the court, issued a concurring opinion.",
      "TikTok\u2019s lawsuit was consolidated with a second legal challenge brought by several content creators \u2014 for which the company is covering legal costs \u2014 as well as a third one filed on behalf of conservative creators who work with a nonprofit called BASED Politics Inc. Other organizations, including the Knight First Amendment Institute, had also filed amicus briefs supporting TikTok.",
      "\u201cThis is a deeply misguided ruling that reads important First Amendment precedents too narrowly and gives the government sweeping power to restrict Americans\u2019 access to information, ideas, and media from abroad,\u201d said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the organization. \u201cWe hope that the appeals court\u2019s ruling won\u2019t be the last word.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, lawmakers who had pushed for the legislation celebrated the court's ruling.",
      "\"I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,\u201d said Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China.",
      "Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who co-authored the law, said \u201cit's time for ByteDance to accept\u201d the law.",
      "To assuage concerns about the company\u2019s owners, TikTok says it has invested more than $2 billion to bolster protections around U.S. user data.",
      "The company has also argued the government\u2019s broader concerns could have been resolved in a draft agreement it provided the Biden administration more than two years ago during talks between the two sides. It has blamed the government for walking away from further negotiations on the agreement, which the Justice Department argues is insufficient.",
      "Attorneys for the two companies have claimed it\u2019s impossible to divest the platform commercially and technologically. They also say any sale of TikTok without the coveted algorithm \u2014 the platform\u2019s secret sauce that Chinese authorities would likely block under any divesture plan \u2014 would turn the U.S. version of TikTok into an island disconnected from other global content.",
      "Still, some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in purchasing the platform. Both men said earlier this year that they were launching a consortium to purchase TikTok\u2019s U.S. business.",
      "This week, a spokesperson for McCourt\u2019s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said unnamed participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital."

      "The 27-nation bloc\u2019s executive branch is using its sweeping digital rulebook to scrutinize the video-sharing app's role in the vote. which saw the far-right populist Calin Georgescu coming from out of nowhere to take top spot. But the election was thrown into turmoil Friday after the country\u2019s top court annulled results from the first round of voting.",
      "Declassified files released by Romanian authorities earlier this week suggest that a pro-Russia campaign used the messaging app Telegram to recruit thousands of TikTok users to promote Georgescu.",
      "It is unclear from the intelligence release whether Georgescu was aware of the alleged campaign or assisted in it.",
      "European Commission officials said they asked the TikTok to comment on the files and to provide information on actions that it\u2019s taking in response. It\u2019s the second time the commission has asked the TikTok for information since the election\u2019s first round of voting on Nov. 24, and comes a day after it ordered the Chinese-owned platform to retain all election-related files and evidence.",
      "TikTok declined to comment.",
      "\u201cWe are concerned about mounting indications of coordinated foreign online influence operation targeting ongoing Romanian elections, especially on TikTok,\u201d Henna Virkkunen, the commission\u2019s executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, security and democracy, said in a post on X.",
      "TikTok has 24 hours to respond to the EU request, officials told a press briefing in Brussels",
      "Virkunnen said also called on TikTok to \u201curgently redress\u201d its policies on content moderation and amplification policies and comply with the bloc's Digital Services Act, a wide-ranging set of rules designed to clean up social media platforms.",

But now that the Romanian Constitutional Court has issued its unprecedented decision to cancel the initial results, the first round of voting will have to be held again.",

      "BANGKOK -- China has banned exports of key materials used to make a wide range of products, including smartphones, electric vehicles, radar systems and CT scanners, swiping back at Washington after it expanded export controls to include dozens of Chinese companies that make equipment used to produce advanced computer chips.",
      "Both sides say their controls are justified by national security concerns and both accuse the other of \u201cweaponizing\u201d trade. Analysts say the latest restrictions could have a wide impact on manufacturing in many industries and supply chains.",
      "\u201cCritical mineral security is now intrinsically linked to the escalating tech trade war,\u201d Gracelin Baskaran and Meredith Schwartz of the Center for Strategic International Studies, wrote in a report on Beijing's decision.",
      "The full impact will depend partly on whether U.S. industries can compensate for any loss of access to the strategically important materials, equipment and components.",
      "Here\u2019s why this could be a tipping point in trade conflict between the two biggest economies, coming at a time when antagonisms already were expected to heat up once President-elect Donald Trump takes office, given his vows to hike tariffs on imports of Chinese-made products.",
      "China has banned, in principle, exports to the United States of gallium, germanium and antimony \u2014 critical minerals needed to make advanced semiconductors, among many other types of equipment. Beijing also tightened controls on exports of graphite, which is used in EV and grid-storage batteries. China is the largest source for most of these materials and also dominates refining of those materials, which are used both for consumer goods and for military purposes.",
      "The limits announced Tuesday also include exports of super-hard materials, such as diamonds and other synthetic materials that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective coatings.",
      "Next on the list of potential bans, experts say: tungsten, magnesium and aluminum alloys.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced its measures after the U.S. government ordered a slew of new measures meant to prevent sales to China of certain types of advanced semiconductors and the tools and software needed to make them. Washington also expanded its \u201centity list\u201d of companies facing strict export controls to include 140 more companies, nearly all of them based in China or Chinese-owned.",
      "Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the revised rules were intended to impair China\u2019s ability to use advanced technologies that \u201cpose a risk to our national security.\u201d The updated regulations also limit exports to China of high-bandwidth memory chips that are needed to process massive amounts of data in advanced applications such as artificial intelligence.",
      "Export licenses will likely be denied for any U.S. company trying to do business with the 140 companies newly added to the \u201centity list,\u201d as well as the dozens of others already on the list. The aim, officials said, is to stop Chinese companies from leveraging U.S. technology to make their own semiconductors.",
      "The Biden administration has been expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls while encouraging an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of semiconductors in the U.S. and other Western countries.",
      "Washington also extended the restrictions on exports of advanced semiconductor technology to companies in other countries, though it excluded companies in key allies like Japan, South Korea and the Netherlands that are thought to have adequate export controls of their own.",
      "In a word: very. For the U.S., Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and other producers of advanced technology and components, access to materials with such properties as high conductivity is crucial: gallium and germanium increasingly are used in advanced semiconductors in place of silicon.",
      "The materials subject to Chinese export controls are among 50 the United States Geologic Survey has designated as \u201ccritical minerals\u201d \u2014 non-fuel minerals essential to U.S. economic or national security that have supply chains vulnerable to disruption.",
      "Gallium topped that list. It is needed to make the same high-bandwidth memory chips the U.S. wants to avoid allowing China to access for use in artificial intelligence and defense applications. It's used to make LEDs, lasers and magnets used in many products. Germanium is used for optical fiber and solar panels, among other uses.",
      "A USGS study recently estimated the likely total cost to the U.S. economy from disruptions to supplies of gallium and germanium alone at more than $3 billion. But the situation is complicated. China imposed licensing requirements on exports of both metals in July 2023. It has not exported either to the U.S. this year, according to Chinese customs data. Antimony exports also have plunged.",
      "China produces the lion's share of most critical minerals, but there are alternatives. Japan also imports nearly all of its gallium, for example, but it also extracts it by recycling scrap metal.",
      "Washington has been moving to tap sources other than China, forming a \"Minerals Security Partnership\" with the EU and 15 other countries. President Joe Biden's visit to Africa this week highlighted that effort. Potential supply disruptions also have spurred efforts to tap U.S. deposits of rare earths and other critical materials in southeastern Wyoming, Montana, Nevada, Minnesota and parts of the American Southwest.",
      "Germanium has been extracted from zinc mined in Alaska and Tennessee and the U.S. government has a stockpile. The Department of Defense has a recycling program that can extract scrap germanium from night vision lenses and tank turret windows.",
      "But China's dominance as a supplier gives it an overwhelming cost advantage, and U.S. resource companies face strong pressures over the potential environmental impact of mines and refineries.",
      "Since then-President Trump launched a trade war against Beijing that has ramped up over time, China has adopted a relatively constrained and cautious approach in responding to the U.S. limits on access to advanced technology.",
      "Much depends on the future course of overall relations. It is unclear if Trump will follow through on his vows to push tariffs sharply higher once he takes office or if such declarations are the opening gambits in future trade negotiations.",
      "China hit back with its own tariff hikes, but excluded many items crucial for its own economy. It sanctioned certain companies, especially defense contractors doing business with Taiwan, but refrained from outright bans on exports of vital materials to the U.S.",
      "This time may be different.",
      "Just after China's Commerce Ministry announced its export ban, various Chinese industry associations including automakers and the China Semiconductor Association issued statements denouncing Washington's moves to curb access to strategically sensitive technologies and declaring that U.S. computer chips are unreliable.",

      "Iran is poised to \u201cquite dramatically\u201d increase its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium",
      "MANAMA, Bahrain -- Iran is poised to \u201cquite dramatically\u201d increase its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium as it has started cascades of advanced centrifuges, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency warned Friday.",
      "The comments from Rafael Mariano Grossi came just hours after Iran said it conducted a successful space launch with its heaviest payload ever, the latest for its program that the West alleges improves Tehran\u2019s ballistic missile program.",
      "The launch of the Simorgh rocket comes as Iran\u2019s nuclear program now enriches uranium at 60%, a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels of 90%. While Iran maintains its program is peaceful, officials in the Islamic Republic increasingly threaten to potentially seek the bomb and an intercontinental ballistic missile that would allow Tehran to use the weapon against distant foes like the United States.",
      "The moves are likely to further raise tensions gripping the wider Middle East over Israel\u2019s continued war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip and as an uneasy ceasefire holds in Lebanon. However, Iran may as well be preparing the ground for possible talks with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump, who in his first term unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers.",
      "The U.S. intelligence community in a report released Thursday said that while \u201cIran is not building a nuclear weapon\u201d it has \u201cundertaken activities that better position it to produce one, if it so chooses.\u201d",
      "The Iranian debate over seeking the bomb \u201crisks emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran\u2019s decision-making apparatus and shifting the thinking of current and future Iranian elites about the utility of nuclear weapons,\u201d the report added.",
      "Grossi, speaking to journalists in Bahrain, on the sidelines of the International Institute of Strategic Studies\u2019 Manama Dialogue, said his inspectors planned to see just how many centrifuges Iran would be spinning after Tehran informed his agency of its plans.",
      "\u201cI think it is very concerning,\u201d Grossi said. \u201cThey were preparing and they have all of these facilities sort of in abeyance and now they are activating that. So we are going to see.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cIf they really make them turn \u2014 all of them \u2014 it's going to be a huge jump.\u201d",
      "An IAEA statement issued shortly after Grossi's remarks said Iran had begun feeding two cascades of advanced IR-6 centrifuges with uranium previously enriched up to 20% at its underground Fordo facility. That site is located under a mountain, protecting it from airstrikes.",
      "Cascades are a group of centrifuges that spin uranium gas together to more quickly enrich the uranium. The IR-6 centrifuges enrich uranium faster than Iran\u2019s baseline IR-1 centrifuges, which have been the workhorse of the country\u2019s atomic program. Adding 20% uranium, as opposed to 5% uranium previously planned, further speeds up that process.",
      "\u201cThe facility\u2019s updated design information showed that the effect of this change would be to significantly increase the rate of production,\u201d the IAEA statement said. Iran separately will start feeding natural uranium into eight other IR-6 cascades at Fordo as well to produce 5%-enriched uranium, it added.",
      "The IAEA warned in late November that Iran was preparing to begin enriching uranium with thousands of advanced centrifuges. That came as a response to the Board of Governors at the IAEA condemning Iran for failing to cooperate fully with the agency.",
      "Iran did not acknowledge the preparations. The Iranian mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Meanwhile, the launch Friday took place at Iran\u2019s Imam Khomeini Spaceport in rural Semnan province, some 220 kilometers (135 miles) east of Tehran. That\u2019s the site of Iran\u2019s civilian space program, which has suffered a series of failed Simorgh launches in the past.",
      "The Simorgh carried what Iran described as an \u201corbital propulsion system,\u201d as well as two research systems to a 400-kilometer (250-mile) orbit above the Earth. A system that could change the orbit of a spacecraft would allow Iran to geo-synchronize the orbits of its satellites, a capability Tehran has long sought.",
      "It also carried the Fakhr-1 satellite for Iran\u2019s military, the first time Iran\u2019s civilian program is known to have carried a military payload.",
      "Iran also put the payload of the Simorgh at 300 kilograms (660 pounds), heavier than all its previous successful launches within the country. State television carried footage of a correspondent discussing the payload just as the Simorgh lifted off into the sky, as people called out: \u201cGod is the greatest!\u201d",
      "The U.S. military referred questions about the launch to the country\u2019s Space Command, which did not respond. Space experts said tracking data appeared to show the launch successfully put objects in orbit.",
      "The United States has previously said Iran\u2019s satellite launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution and called on Tehran to undertake no activity involving ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. U.N. sanctions related to Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program expired in October 2023.",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s work on space-launch vehicles \u2014 including its Simorgh \u2014 probably would shorten the timeline to produce an intercontinental ballistic missile, if it decided to develop one, because the systems use similar technologies,\u201d a U.S. intelligence community report released in July said.",
      "Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons and says its space program, like its nuclear activities, is for purely civilian purposes. However, U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003.",
      "Under Iran\u2019s relatively moderate former President Hassan Rouhani, the Islamic Republic slowed its space program for fear of raising tensions with the West. The late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who came to power in 2021, pushed the program forward. Raisi died in a helicopter crash in May.",
      "Iran\u2019s reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, who has been signaling he wants to negotiate with the West over sanctions, has yet to offer a strategy when it comes to Iran\u2019s ambitions in space. The Simorgh launch represented the first for his administration from the country\u2019s civil space program. Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard conducted a successful launch of its parallel program in September.",

      "NEW YORK -- He\u2019s one of the most famous corporate leaders in the world, delivering products embraced by billions. But it\u2019s the haters that companies like Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta worry about.",
      "In an era when online anger and social tensions are increasingly directed at the businesses consumers count on, Meta last year spent $24.4 million on guards, alarms and other measures to keep Zuckerberg and the company\u2019s former chief operating officer safe.",
      "Some high-profile CEOs surround themselves with security. But the fatal shooting this week of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson while he walked alone on a New York City sidewalk has put a spotlight on the widely varied approaches companies take in protecting their leaders against threats.",
      "Thompson had no personal security and appeared unaware of the shooter lurking before he was gunned down.",
      "And today\u2019s political, economic and technological climate is only going to make the job of evaluating threats against executives and taking action to protect them even more difficult, experts say.",
      "\u201cWe are better today at collecting signals. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re any better at making sense of the signals we collect,\u201d says Fred Burton of Ontic, a provider of threat management software for companies.",
      "After Thompson's shooting, Burton said, \u201cI\u2019ve been on the phone all day with some organizations asking for consultation, saying, \u2019Am I doing enough?\u201d",
      "Since the killing, some health insurers have taken steps to safeguard their executives and rank-and-file workers.",
      "Medica, a Minnesota-based nonprofit health care firm, said Friday it is temporarily closing its six offices for security reasons and will have its employees work from home.",
      "\u201cAlthough we have received no specific threats related to our campuses, our office buildings will be temporarily closed out of an abundance of caution,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "A Medica spokesman said the company had also removed biographical information about its executives from its website as a precaution.",
      "UnitedHealth Group, parent of the insurer Thompson led, removed photos of its top executives from its website hours after the shooting, later removing their names and biographies.",
      "But well before the attack, some of the biggest U.S. companies, particularly those in the tech sector, were spending heavily on personal and residential security for their top executives.",
      "Meta, whose businesses include Facebook and Instagram, reported the highest spending on personal security for top executives last year, filings culled by research firm Equilar show.",
      "Zuckerberg \u201cis synonymous with Meta and, as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,\u201d the Menlo Park, California, company explained earlier this year in an annual shareholder disclosure.",
      "At Apple, the world\u2019s largest tech company by stock valuation, CEO Tim Cook was tormented by a stalker  who sent him sexually provocative emails and even showed up outside his Silicon Valley home at one point before the company\u2019s security team successfully took legal action against her in 2022.",
      "Cook is regularly accompanied by security personnel when he appears in public. Still, the company\u2019s $820,000 allotted last year to protect top executives is a fraction of what other tech giants spent for CEO security.",
      "Just over a quarter of the companies in the Fortune 500 reported spending money to protect their CEOs and other top executives. Of those that did, the median payment for personal security doubled over the last three years to about $98,000.",
      "In many companies, investor meetings like the one UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Thompson was walking to when he was shot are viewed as very risky because details on the location and who will be speaking are highly publicized.",
      "\u201cIt gives people an opportunity to arrive well in advance and take a look at the room, take a look at how people would probably come and go out of a location,\u201d said Dave Komendat, president of DSKomendat Risk Management Services, which is based in the greater Seattle area.",
      "Some firms respond by beefing up security. For example, tech companies routinely require everyone attending a major event, such as Apple\u2019s annual unveiling of the next iPhone or a shareholder meeting, to go through airport-style security checkpoints before entering.",
      "Others forgo in-person meetings with shareholders. Government health insurance provider Centene Corp. joined that group Thursday, citing the UnitedHealthcare executive's death in announcing that its upcoming Investor Day will be held online, rather than in-person as originally planned.",
      "\u201cBut there are also company cultures that really frown on that and want their leaders to be accessible to people, accessible to shareholders, employees,\u201d Komendat said.",
      "Depending on the company, such an approach may make sense. Many top executives are little known to the public, operating in industries and locations that make them far less prone to public exposure and to threats.",
      "\u201cDetermining the need for and appropriate level of an executive-level protection program is specific to each organization,\u201d says David Johnston, vice president of asset protection and retail operations at the National Retail Federation. \u201cThese safeguards should also include the constant monitoring of potential threats and the ability to adapt to maintain the appropriate level of security and safety.\u201d",
      "Some organizations have a protective intelligence group that uses digital tools such as machine learning or artificial intelligence to comb through online comments to detect threats not only on social media platforms such as X but also on the dark web, says Komendat. They look for what\u2019s being said about the company, its employees and its leadership to uncover risks.",
      "\u201cThere are always threats directed towards senior leaders at companies. Many of them are not credible,\u201d Komendat said. \u201cThe question always is trying to determine what is a real threat versus what is someone just venting with no intent to take any additional action.\u201d",
      "Burton, a former special agent with the U.S. Diplomatic Security Service, points out that despite the current climate, there is little in the way of organized groups that target companies.",
      "Today, one of the primary worries are loners whose rantings online are fed by others who are like-minded. It\u2019s up to corporate security analysts to zero in on such dialogue and decide whether or not it represents a real threat.",
      "And CEOs aren\u2019t the only targets of disgruntled customers. In the U.S., there were 525 workplace fatalities due to assault in 2022, according to the National Safety Council. Industries including healthcare, education and service providers are more prone to violence than others, and taxi drivers are more than 20 times more likely to be murdered on the job than other workers, the group said.",
      "But the ambush of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Thompson this week is bound to get some CEOs second-guessing.",
      "\u201cWhat invariably happen at moments like this in time is you will get additional ears listening\u201d to security professionals seeking money to beef up executive protection, Burton says.",
      "\u201cBecause I can guarantee you there\u2019s not a CEO in America who\u2019s not aware of this incident.\u201d",

      "Democrats in Michigan are pressing to pass reproductive health care legislation before the party loses its majority with the new legislative session next year",
      "LANSING, Mich. -- Michigan Democrats are pushing this month to pass legislation they say will improve reproductive health care, in particular the safety of digital health data, ahead of Republicans taking over the state House in 2025.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is backing a bill designed to protect reproductive health data including data logged on menstrual cycle tracking apps. Similar legislation that has passed in other states is aimed at keeping the data from being used to target people seeking abortions.",
      "\u201cThis feels like a very urgent need for us to get this done while we have a window in Michigan with the Democratic majority for the next few weeks,\u201d said state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, sponsor of the digital privacy bill.",
      "The rush is a reaction to expectations that it will be harder to pass the reproductive health care policies Democrats favor after Republicans take control of the state House in January. Democrats kept control of the state Senate in the November election.",
      "Republicans have opposed the digital privacy bill over a section they say will stifle anti-abortion advertising.",
      "Other reproductive health bills to be considered during the December session that began Tuesday include a package on Black maternal health and an expansion of access to birth control.",
      "After the overturn of Roe v. Wade, some women in states with strict abortion bans began to worry that their health information could be used to track their reproductive status. Apps that track menstrual cycles became a major focus point.",
      "Abortion is constitutionally protected in Michigan. But McMorrow does not trust President-elect Donald Trump's campaign promise to veto any possible national abortion ban nor his campaign's efforts to distance itself from Project 2025, which proposed a rollback on abortion and contraception access.",
      "Period tracking apps allow women to take detailed day-by-day notes about their health, from how heavy their period flow is to additional symptoms such as cramping. They can log pregnancies and miscarriages.",
      "\u201cThese tools are really valuable,\u201d McMorrow said. \u201cI just want to make sure that the guardrails are there when indications from the incoming federal administration is they would potentially weaponize the data in a way that is very dangerous.\u201d",
      "Federal law bars medical providers from sharing health data without a patient\u2019s consent but doesn\u2019t prevent digital tech companies from tracking menstrual cycles or an individual\u2019s location and selling it to data brokers. Legislation for federal bans have never gained momentum, largely because of opposition from the tech industry.",
      "How the legislation works varies from state to state. Washington state has digital privacy law that broadly covers all health-related data while Virginia has a law that explicitly prohibits the issuance of search warrants, subpoenas or court orders for electronic or digital menstrual health data.",
      "Michigan\u2019s proposal would require businesses or organizations to use reproductive health data only for the services it provides, and consumers must be informed of how the data is being used. In order to sell that data, an entity would need explicit, signed consent from the consumer. Consumers would also have the option to opt out from their data being sold at any time.",
      "It would also regulate retailers, who often compile data to target consumers with advertisements, and the use of geofencing, which allows marketers to target consumers with ads based on their location.",
      "The bill would prohibit identifying who is receiving reproductive health care by using location information and targeting them with advertisements. This would apply to people visiting fertility or abortion clinics.",
      "The geofencing provision of the bill has drawn objection from anti-abortion advocates. Genevieve Marnon, legislative director for Right to Life of Michigan, said in committee testimony Tuesday that the bill would prevent women visiting an abortion clinic from being reached by anti-abortion ads.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t safeguarding women\u2019s reproductive health data,\" she said. \u201cIt is limiting the options presented to women.\u201d",
      "Republican Sen. John Damoose, who voted against the bill in committee, believes the geofencing provision encroaches on freedom of speech and religion by preventing anti-abortion advertising.",
      "The bill was voted out of committee Tuesday on party lines and advanced Thursday toward a final vote in the Senate chamber.",
      "Kimya Forouzan, principal state policy director at the Guttmacher Institute, expects the topic to be taken up by other state legislatures next year. Guttmacher, which supports abortion rights, tracks reproductive health trends.",
      "Over the past two years, Michigan Democrats have passed bills repealing a number of anti-abortion laws, including the state\u2019s 1931 ban, and adding surrogacy protections to state law. Lawmakers are considering a number of others related to reproductive health this month.",
      "A group of bills focused on improving maternal health for Black women would create a doula scholarship, among other measures. The Senate voted its package on the topic through to the House on Tuesday.",
      "Rep. Jaime Churches, a Democrat from the downriver area of Detroit who lost her seat in November, is trying to gain traction for two bills that would require insurance to cover fertility treatments, including in vitro fertilization and intrauterine insemination.",
      "Three bills seeking to expand access to birth control through insurance have passed the state House. McMorrow also introduced a series of bills aimed at providing long-lasting reversible contraception, such an implants or intrauterine devices, to patients who have given birth before they are discharged from a hospital.",
      "There is competition among Democrats for time during this short, lame duck session. Advocates for economic development, infrastructure and gun control measures are among the many looking to push through bills in the month that is left. Major contention over new paid sick leave and minimum wage requirements is likely to garner attention. Those discussions could reduce the amount of time available to debate reproductive health measures.",

      "The most expensive dinosaur fossil ever discovered will be on view in New York starting this weekend",
      "NEW YORK -- The most expensive dinosaur fossil ever discovered will be on view in New York starting this weekend, American Museum of Natural History officials announced Wednesday.",
      "The giant stegosaurus fossil, dubbed \u201cApex,\u201d is 11 feet (3.3 meters) tall and 27 feet (8.2 meters) nose to tail. The display will start in a giant atrium at the museum\u2019s entrance before being moved to the museum's existing fossil halls next year.",
      "The museum also confirmed the identity of the philanthropist who purchased Apex. Billionaire hedge fund manager and longtime museum donor Ken Griffin bought it at an auction in July for $45 million, the most ever paid for dinosaur remains. Sean Decatur, president of the American Museum of Natural History, said that Griffin approved a long-term loan of Apex, as well as allowing scientists to take samples from the fossil for analysis.",
      "\u201cThis partnership allows Apex to have pride of place at a museum world-renowned for its dinosaur collection and for its longstanding leadership in paleontology and, even more exciting, enables us to pursue specialized Stegosaurus research centered around this extraordinary and scientifically important specimen,\u201d Decatur said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Of the more than 80 stegosauri made available to scientific institutions, very few are substantially complete, the statement said. Apex is the most complete specimen ever found, Decatur said. With about 80% of its 320 bones preserved, it is miraculous for creature that has been dead for 150 million years. The specimen is also prized by scientists because it is estimated to have died at a relatively old age, and it could reveal insights into stegosaurus metabolism and bone growth.",
      "Scientists will make CT scans of the internal structures of the dinosaur's skull and analyze a small sample extracted from one of its giant thigh bones, the statement said.",
      "\u201cAs exciting as is it is to have this dinosaur on display, it is even more exciting to have the opportunity to study it and make important scientific data available for research,\u201d said Roger Benson, who curates the American Museum of Natural History's fossil amphibians, reptiles, birds and plants.",
      "The museum\u2019s paleontologists have a long record of breaking ground in dinosaur research, including identifying the first dinosaur eggs and early evidence of dinosaur feathers, the statement said.",
      "Commercial paleontologist Jason Cooper discovered in Apex on his land near Dinosaur, Colorado, on the Utah border near Dinosaur National Monument.",
      "Griffin's successful $44.6 million bid for Apex over the summer set a record for dinosaur remains, beating out the $31.8 million paid for \u201cStan,\u201d the remains of a Tyrannosaurus rex sold in 2020. Like Apex, the Stan fossils were purchased by a private individual with plans to make it available to the public. The T. rex has been slated to be on display in Abu Dhabi, in United Arab Emirates, at a museum that opens in late 2025.",

      "\u201cTsunamis radiate outward in all directions from the point of origin and can move across entire ocean basins,\u201d the service says.",
      "When the waves reach land, they can cause coastal flooding, and the powerful currents can last several hours or days.",

      "Tsunamis can occur in any ocean, sea or large body of water. But certain areas are prone to tsunamis because of their proximity to the source and other factors, such as depth and the shape of the ocean floor.",
      "The database says between 1900 and 2015, there were 754 confirmed events. Of those, 78% were in the Pacific Ocean. According to the database, Japan has had the most tsunamis since 1900, followed by Russia and Indonesia.",

      "Administrator Bill Nelson said the next mission in the Artemis program -- flying four astronauts around the moon and back \u2013 is now targeted for April 2026. It had been on the books for September 2025, after slipping from this year.",

      "This bumps the third Artemis mission \u2014 a moon landing by two other astronauts \u2014 to at least 2027. NASA had been aiming for 2026.",
      "NASA\u2019s Artemis program, a follow-up to the Apollo moonshots of the late 1960s and early 1970s, has completed only one mission. An empty Orion capsule circled the moon in 2022 after blasting off on NASA\u2019s new Space Launch System rocket.",
      "Although the launch and lunar laps went well, the capsule returned with an excessively charred and eroded bottom heat shield, damaged from the heat of reentry. It took until recently for engineers to pinpoint the cause and come up with a plan.",
      "NASA will use the Orion capsule with its original heat shield for the next flight with four astronauts, according to Nelson, but make changes to the reentry path at flight's end. To rip off and replace the heat shield would have meant at least a full year's delay and stalled the moon landing even further, officials said.",
      "During the flight test, NASA had the capsule dip in and out of the atmosphere during reentry, and gases built up in the heat shield's outer layer, officials said. That resulted in cracking and uneven shedding of the outer material.",

      "The space agency has put all the Artemis contractors, including Elon Musk's SpaceX, on notice to \u201cdouble-down\u201d to meet the schedule deadlines, according to Nelson.

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 13:30:28 -0500",
    "summary": "Bitcoin burst on the scene after trust had withered in the financial system and Washington&rsquo;s ability to protect people from it",
    "story": [
      "Bitcoin burst on the scene after trust had withered in the financial system and Washington\u2019s ability to protect people from it",
      "NEW YORK -- Born from the ashes of the 2008 global financial crisis, bitcoin arrived after trust had withered in the financial system and in Washington's ability to protect those who must participate in it. Now, it's Washington's very embrace of bitcoin that's helping to send its price to records and lining the pockets of its believers.",
      "Bitcoin briefly surged above $103,000 after President-elect Donald Trump said he intends to nominate Paul Atkins, a former regulator who's seen as friendly to crypto, as the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He would replace Gary Gensler, who critics say has been overly aggressive in his oversight of crypto.",
      "It's the latest leg in an astonishing run for bitcoin, whose swings in price are already notoriously extreme.",
      "Bitcoin has more than doubled this year, with a particularly big jump coming after Election Day, when its price was sitting below $70,000. During his campaign, Trump called for making the United States \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet.\"",
      "The crypto industry, meanwhile, did its part to bring politicians friendly to digital currencies into Washington. Crypto corporations poured over $119 million into influencing federal elections in 2024, primarily into a political action committee dedicated to electing pro-crypto candidates and defeating crypto skeptics, according to a recent review by Public Citizen.",
      "It's a large amount. Crypto companies accounted for 44% of all the corporate money contributed during this year\u2019s elections, according to the consumer advocacy organization.",
      "Such a tight embrace marks an interesting twist from bitcoin's early days, when someone or a group of someones under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto created a kind of electronic cash that wouldn't be beholden to any government or financial institution.",
      "In the white paper announcing bitcoin, Namakoto said the traditional way of doing business on the internet \u201cworks well enough for most transactions.\u201d But, Nakamoto said, it \u201cstill suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model,\u201d where a third party like a bank needs to process payments.",
      "Instead, Nakamoto suggested harnessing computing power around the world as a way to create a digital currency that can\u2019t be double-spent. \u201cWhat is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.\u201d That is what became the bitcoin network.",
      "Since then, bitcoin has moved from the financial fringes toward the mainstream, in jagged fits and starts. While it hasn't taken off as a way to pay for groceries, it found popularity as a kind of \u201cdigital gold,\u201d or a way to store value in something that's not subject to the direct influence of a federal government or a central bank.",
      "In its early days, it had a reputation for use by drug dealers, scammers, crypto enthusiasts, libertarians and others who were looking to move money without oversight by the government. Now, it's also found its way into more investor portfolios. Earlier this year, the SEC approved exchange-traded funds that track the spot price of bitcoin. Such ETFs give investors a relatively easy way to buy bitcoin directly in their existing trading accounts.",
      "Through its life, bitcoin has soared through a series of manic bull runs as well as \u201ccrypto winters\u201d that brought extreme declines. It went from just over $5,000 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to nearly $69,000 by late 2021, before crashing below $17,000 following hikes to interest rates by the Federal Reserve and the 2022 collapse of crypto exchange FTX.",
      "With bitcoin in its latest bull run, the man who's about to roll into the White House seemed to take at least some credit.",
      "\u201cCONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!!\u201d Trump said in a post on his Truth Social network. \u201c$100,000!!! YOU\u2019RE WELCOME!!!\u201d"

The shooter arrived at the scene about five minutes before Thompson before shooting the victim in the chest around 6:40 a.m., police said. The suspect is believed to have left New York City following the shooting, police said.",

      "Another photo appeared to show the man walking by the window of a cab.",
      "Police found a backpack believed to belong to the suspected shooter in Central Park on Friday evening, police sources told ABC News. The backpack contained fake money from the game Monopoly and a Tommy Hilfiger jacket, sources said.",
      "The backpack was found after NYPD deployed an army of officers and drones to conduct a grid search, police sources said earlier.",
      "As of Saturday, three days after the shooting, sources close to the investigation told ABC News the New York Police Department is making progress toward identifying the gunman but, as of now, still has not done so.",
      "On Friday, police said they believed the gunman left New York City following the shooting -- ditching his bike on the Upper West Side and taking a taxi to a Port Authority bus facility at 178th Street. Police said they believe he boarded a bus there because they did not see him on video leaving the facility.",
      "The NYPD released on Thursday new photos of the suspect, seen without a mask, while asking for the public's help in identifying him. The images were taken from a surveillance camera at the HI New York City Hostel on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Police had obtained a warrant to search after coming to believe the suspect stayed there, sources told ABC News.",
      "Police were able to find an image of the suspect without his face mask because he was flirting with the woman who checked him into the hostel, police sources told ABC News.",
      "As he stood at the check-in desk, the sources said the woman asked to see his smile. The suspected shooter obliged, pulling down his mask long enough for the surveillance camera to capture his face.",
      "It appears the suspect shared a room with two other men, according to police sources.",
      "The suspect likely checked into the hostel on Nov. 24, checked out and then checked back in again on Nov. 30, according to sources. It's not clear when the surveillance image was captured.",
      "The suspected shooter checked into the hostel using a New Jersey license that wasn't his own, according to police sources. Detectives ran the name and found it did not resemble any known photos of the suspect or other evidence amassed so far, the sources said.",
      "The suspect came to New York City on Nov. 24 on a Greyhound bus, when a surveillance camera at Port Authority Bus Terminal caught his arrival at 9 p.m., law enforcement sources told ABC News.",
      "The inbound bus originated in Atlanta but it was not immediately clear where the suspect boarded. The sources said he was spotted on board in Washington, D.C., so he boarded there or somewhere between D.C. and Atlanta.",
      "Both Greyhound and the parent company of the hostel, Hostelling International USA, said in a statement that they are \"fully cooperating with the NYPD\" but cannot comment further due to the active investigation.",
      "The 10-day period has been the focus of investigative efforts. Police have collected a lot of video of the suspect all over the city -- in the subway, in cabs, in a McDonald's, according to sources. Each place he paid with cash and he made sure to keep his mask on, according to sources.",
      "Police have released photos of the suspect in a mask, captured at a Starbucks near the hotel before the shooting, according to New York ABC station WABC. He was described by police as wearing a light brown or cream-colored jacket, a black face mask, black and white sneakers and a \"very distinctive\" gray backpack.",
      "Sources told ABC News the suspected shooter was also seen on video much earlier, at 5 a.m. the day of the shooting, near the hostel carrying what appears to be an e-bike battery.",
      "New cleared CCTV video shows a man who appears to be the suspect walking west on 55th Street at 6:19 a.m. The video shows him stoop down as he appears to momentarily drop an object on the garbage before continuing to walk.",
      "Detectives later discovered writing on the shell casings found at the scene where Thompson was gunned down, police sources told ABC News.",
      "Detectives were working to determine whether the words were meant as a message from the shooter and a hint at his motive.",
      "Written on the shell casings were the words \"deny,\" \"defend\" and \"depose,\" according to sources.",
      "After the shooting, the suspect fled on foot into an alley, where a phone was recovered, according to Kenny. He then fled on an e-bike and he was last seen riding into Central Park at 6:48 a.m., police said.",
      "Police released photos of the suspect holding a firearm and on a bike.",
      "Detectives have also retrieved a water bottle and candy wrapper from the area where he was apparently waiting, law enforcement sources said. After analysis, NYPD investigators believe the cellphone, candy wrapper and water bottle are linked to the shooter, police sources said.",
      "Investigators believe they were able to score DNA samples from several pieces of the evidence, law enforcement sources told ABC News on Friday. The samples are currently at the NYC Office of the Chief Medical Examiner to be run through databases for a possible match, the sources said. That process could take a couple days.",
      "At the same time, NYPD detectives are working with the U.S. Marshals Service to try and track down the shooter along with the FBI, which has the most sophisticated technology for retrieving usable data from cellphones, sources said.",
      "The victim's hotel room has already been accessed by investigators, whose top priority is determining Thompson's most recent conversations and movements, sources said.",
      "The working theory among detectives right now is that the shooting was carried out by someone who is not a professional killer because too many \"mistakes\" were made, sources said. Hitmen typically don't carry cell phones to their hits and the shots were fired from a distance that would be considered \"too far\" away from the victim, the sources said.",
      "At this point, detectives are trying to determine whether Thompson was targeted because of some type of personal conflict or as a result of his work as an insurance executive, sources said. The killer apparently had some knowledge of Thompson's schedule on Wednesday and the fact that he would be arriving at the Hilton well before the company meeting was to begin, the sources said.",
      "Police are interviewing Thompson's colleagues and family about any potential specific threats, Kenny said.",
      "Thompson, 50, was in New York City for the UnitedHealthcare investors conference, which was scheduled to start at 8 a.m. The conference was being held at the Hilton outside of which he was shot, but he was not staying there, police said.",
      "UnitedHealthcare's parent company, UnitedHealth Group, the largest health insurer in the world, said in a statement, \"We are deeply saddened and shocked at the passing of our dear friend and colleague Brian Thompson.\"",
      "\"Brian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him,\" the company said. \"We are working closely with the New York Police Department and ask for your patience and understanding during this difficult time. Our hearts go out to Brian's family and all who were close to him.\"",

      "Trump has nominated several Project 2025 contributors to his team.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump distanced himself from Project 2025 on the campaign trail but has since nominated several authors or contributors from the controversial conservative presidential wish list to his administration.",
      "Trump called the Project 2025 policy proposals -- which include restrictions on abortion pills, birth control pills and Medicare access, as well as eliminating a couple of federal agencies -- \"extreme, seriously extreme\" in a July 20 rally.",
      "\"I don't know anything about it. I don't want to know anything about it,\" he previously said, despite having many connections to its authors and contributors.",
      "Democrats pounced on Trump for Project 2025 during the election season, calling it a warning of what is to come under a second Trump term.",
      "\"Project 2025 is the plan by Donald Trump's MAGA Republican allies to give Trump more power over your daily life, gut democratic checks and balances, and consolidate power in the Oval Office if he wins,\" the Biden campaign stated.",
      "Project 2025 is an over 900-page playbook of policy proposals created by conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation intended to guide the next conservative administration. The organization behind the document told ABC News in a past statement that it was not intended to speak for any candidate during the election.",
      "Project 2025 and Trump's Agenda47 share similarities -- including proposals to eliminate the Department of Education, increase fossil fuel energy production, and begin mass deportations.",
      "At the ABC News debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump reiterated his earlier sentiment on the project. \"This was a group of people that got together, they came up with some ideas, I guess some good, some bad, but it makes no difference. I have nothing to do [with it].\"",
      "Now, several Project 2025 authors and contributors are not just connected to Trump, but also nominated for roles in his administration.",
      "Here's a look at which Project 2025 contributors may have a place in the incoming Trump administration:",
      "Russ Vought",
      "Russ Vought, who is cited as authoring a chapter on \"Executive Office of the President\" for Project 2025's \"Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise,\" has been nominated to head the Office of Management and Budget. He was also the RNC platform committee's policy director.",
      "During Trump's first term, Vought led the Office of Management and Budget, a department meant to oversee the president\u2019s vision across the executive branch for everything from budgeting to managing certain agencies.",
      "He could return to the post after authoring an entire chapter of Project 2025, where he argues federal regulatory agencies that aren\u2019t under the control of the White House should have less autonomy: \u201cA President today assumes office to find a sprawling federal bureaucracy that all too often is carrying out its own policy plans and preferences \u2014 or, worse yet, the policy plans and preferences of a radical, supposedly 'woke' faction of the country,\" the chapter read.",
      "In the chapter, he outlined ways his office could help consolidate executive power by using existing tools to impose a crackdown on federal spending and work with Congress to pass policy and reforms that would rein in what he calls the \u201cadministrative state.\u201d",
      "In a November interview on the \"Tucker Carlson Show,\" Vought claimed he helped the president-elect to exert executive power during his first term: \u201cThe president wanted to fund the wall. We at OMB gave him a plan to be able to go and fund the wall through money that was Department of Defense and to use that because Congress wouldn\u2019t give him the ordinary money at the Department of Homeland Security.\u201d",
      "Pete Hoekstra",
      "Pete Hoekstra, who is listed as a contributor to Project 2025, has been tapped to be the ambassador to Canada.",
      "Most recently, Hoekstra served as chairman of the Michigan Republican Party. He previously served as the U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands during Trump's first term.",
      "Stephen Miller",
      "Stephen Miller, the former Trump aide, led an interest group that advised Project 2025 on policy. Trump has named Miller as his Deputy Chief of Staff for his second term.",
      "Miller told ABC News in July that he has \u201czero involvement\u201d with Project 2025, only making an advice video for students.",
      "America First Legal, founded by Miller, was previously listed as an advisory board member for the project.",
      "Brendan Carr",
      "Brendan Carr, Trump's nomination for chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, is credited as the author of Project 2025's FCC recommendations which include: a ban on TikTok, restrictions on social media moderation, and more.",
      "Carr would be tasked with regulating broadcasting, telecommunications and broadband. Trump has suggested that he would expand the White House's influence over the FCC and potentially punish TV networks that cover him in a way he doesn't like.",
      "Carr is a longtime member of the commission and served previously as the FCC's general counsel and as the senior Republican for the FCC. He has been unanimously confirmed by the Senate three times and was nominated by both Trump and President Joe Biden to the commission.",
      "John Ratcliffe",
      "Ratcliffe, listed as a contributor who assisted \"in the development and writing\" of Project 2025, has been nominated to serve as the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.",
      "Ratcliffe is a three-term Republican congressman from Texas and served as the director of national intelligence from mid-2020 until the end of Trump's first term.",
      "Project 2025's Intelligence Community chapter, credited to The Heritage Foundation's intelligence research fellow Dustin J. Carmack, notes that the \"CIA's success depends on firm direction from the President and solid internal CIA Director\u2013appointed leadership. Decisive senior leaders must commit to carrying out the President's agenda and be willing to take calculated risks.\"",
      "Tom Homan",
      "Former Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Tom Homan has been designated as Trump's \"border czar\" -- which is not an official Cabinet position.",
      "Homan, who is expected to be in charge of the mass deportations promised by the Trump campaign, is listed as a contributor to Project 2025 who assisted in its \"development and writing.\"",
      "Project 2025's Department of Homeland Security chapter, credited to Trump's former Acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli, calls for full use of ICE's \"expedited removal\" authority and further development of immigrant detention spaces. This all aligns with Trump's immigration proposals on mass deportations and funds for the construction of detention centers.",
      "Other links to Project 2025",
      "Christopher Miller is credited with the project's Department of Defense recommendations. Miller served as Acting Secretary of Defense and Special Assistant to the President under Trump from November 2020 to January 2021.",

      "Rebels are consolidating control after their lightning offensive took Damascus.",
      "LONDON -- The stunning collapse of President Bashar Assad's regime in Syria presents \"a moment of historic opportunity,\" President Joe Biden wrote on X on Sunday, as rebel fighters and Damascenes celebrated the end of their 14-year war against the authoritarian government.",
      "But, the president added, \"It is also a moment of risk and uncertainty.\"",
      "The uprising that began with a protest march in the southern city of Daraa in 2011 ended with celebratory gunfire in Damascus in 2024.",
      "The surprise rebel offensive that surged out of northwestern Idlib province last month showed the regime in Damascus to be hollow. Its backers in Moscow, Tehran and Beirut were unable or unwilling to respond, perhaps because their attention and resources having been sapped by wars in Ukraine, Lebanon, Gaza and elsewhere.",
      "The story of the fall of Damascus was -- arguably -- written in Donetsk and Dahiya. The coup de gr\u00e2ce, though, was inherently Syrian.",
      "The offensive that toppled Assad was led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist group with roots in al-Qaeda. The group is listed as a terrorist organization in the U.S. and European Union.",
      "White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said over the weekend that the group's background \"is a concern,\" noting that elements of the group are affiliated with organizations \"that have American blood on their hands.\"",
      "HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani has become the most recognizable face of the Syrian opposition. Speaking at Damascus' 8th-century Umayyad Mosque on Sunday, Jolani said the opposition victory is \"historic for the region\" and that \"Syria is being purified.\"",
      "It remains unclear whether and how Jolani -- who is increasingly using his real name of Ahmed al-Sharaa, rather than his nom de guerre -- will be able to exert control over the disparate groupings of rebel forces drawn from around the country.",
      "American officials are concerned that the power vacuum will allow ISIS to reconstitute. The U.S. launched 75 strikes against ISIS targets in central Syria on Sunday in a move that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said was designed \"to keep the pressure on ISIS.\"",
      "\"As this unfolds, there's a potential that elements in the area, such as ISIS, could try to take advantage of this opportunity and regain capability,\" Austin warned.",
      "The future shape of U.S.-Syrian relations will depend on the composition and direction of the next government in Damascus.",
      "The White House may be somewhat pleased by Jolani's speech at the Umayyad Mosque on Sunday, in which he lamented how Syria became \"a playground for Iranian ambitions.\"",
      "\"We will remain vigilant,\" Biden said on Sunday after Damascus fell. \"Make no mistake, some of the rebel groups that took down Assad have their own grim record of terrorism and human rights abuses.\" The president, however, added that the groups are \"saying the right things now.\"",
      "\"But as they take on greater responsibility, we will assess not just their words, but their actions,\" Biden added.",
      "Thomas S. Warrick -- a former deputy assistant secretary for counterterrorism policy in the Department of Homeland Security -- said the U.S. \"has a huge stake in what comes next,\" even if it was not directly involved in Assad's ousting.",
      "A more stable Syria \"that frees itself from Iranian and Russian dependence\" could, Warrick wrote, allow millions of refugees to return home, end its role as a Hezbollah conduit to threaten Israel and perhaps even join the Abraham Accords at some point in the future.",
      "\"All these unthinkable things are now possible,\" Warrick -- now a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative -- wrote. \"But this will not happen spontaneously, without outside help and support. Postwar planning for Syria needs to go into high gear.\"",
      "The incoming Trump administration will need to chart a policy approach to Syria. Some will be skeptical of success, but others -- Warrick wrote -- will note that \"weakening Iranian influence, supporting Israel's security, and peace in Lebanon are, collectively, one of the biggest wins that a Trump administration could hope to achieve.\"",
      "In a recent interview with CNN, Jolani said that Syrians should not fear HTS's brand of Islamism. \"People who fear Islamic governance either have seen incorrect implementations of it or do not understand it properly,\" he said.",
      "As the rebels reached Damascus, Assadist Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi al-Jalali said the outgoing regime would \"extend its hand\" to the opposition and assist with the transition of power. Jolani said on Sunday that Jalali will remain in his post to supervise state bodies during the transition.",
      "Jolani and his HTS will have competition for influence in the new Syria.",
      "The Turkish-backed Syrian National Army also took part in the offensive, with fighting still ongoing between the SNA and the Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces -- who are supported by the U.S. -- in the northeast of the country. Ankara enjoys significant control over the SNA and other groups and can be expected to seek influence over the future direction of its neighbor.",
      "\"The opposition is not a homogenous movement and there is a risk that internal fractures within the HTS-led umbrella movement -- which may become more salient in the weeks and months to come -- may lead to discord and threaten Syrian stability,\" Burcu Ozcelik of the Royal United Services Institute think tank in the U.K. told ABC News.",
      "\"A new transitional Syrian administration will soon need to take on the task of state-building, including the rebuilding of a national Syrian security force and a constitution-building process, as the Syrian state has been painfully hallowed out by the Assad regime,\" Ozcelik said.",
      "The next government will also need to address the question of Russian presence in Syria. Russian forces retain control of Khmeimim Air Base and Tartus naval base on Syria's Mediterranean coast, two key strategic facilities from which Moscow helped keep Assad in power.",
      "\"It is in Russia's interest to seek to maintain access, but its ability to project power in and through Syria is now severely debilitated,\" Ozcelik said.",
      "\"It will take time and negotiations with the new Syrian administration, a yet to be determined entity, before it is clear what Russia's stakes in Syria will be,\" Ozcelik added. \"But this is now a radically transformed Syria, and Russia has no good options.\"",
      "Moscow is in touch with the opposition factions, Russia's Foreign Ministry said in a Sunday statement. \"All necessary measures are being taken to ensure the safety of our citizens in Syria,\" it said. \"Russian military bases in Syria are on high alert. There is currently no serious threat to their security.\"",
      "For Tehran, \"there is no doubt that the fall of the Assad regime is a highly consequential defeat for Iran,\" Ozcelik said. \"Syria was the conduit for Iran's systematic support for Hezbollah in Lebanon, this supply chain has now been cut off.",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Tehran is concerned about the \"possibility of a renewed civil war or a sectarian war between different sects or the division of Syria and the collapse of Syria and its transformation into a haven for terrorists.\"",
      "Meanwhile, rebel-liberated territory is already being bombed by Israeli warplanes and occupied by Israeli soldiers. Israeli officials have said they intend to deny \"extremist\" elements access to the Assad regime's advanced military capabilities.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the regime's collapse \"is a direct result of the blows we have inflicted on Iran and Hezbollah, the main supporters of the Assad regime.\"",
      "\"The collapse of the Assad regime, the tyranny in Damascus, offers great opportunity but also is fraught with significant dangers,\" he added.",
      "Assad fled the country for Russia in the early hours of Sunday, state-owned Russian media said, having resigned the presidency following negotiations with opposition factions, per a Russian Foreign Ministry statement.",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov announced Monday that President Vladimir Putin would grant his longtime ally political asylum in the country.",
      "Assad's departure ended 24 years of his rule -- and 50 years of Assad family rule. Posters and statues of Assad, his brothers and his father, Hafez Assad, were being torn down by jubilant crowds around the country.",
      "More than a decade of civil war left at least 307,000 people dead by the end of 2022, per United Nations figures. The fighting forced around 12 million Syrians -- more than half of the country's 2011 population of around 22 million -- from their homes, around 5.4 million of whom were still living abroad as of late 2022.",
      "Assad's regime fought bitterly to retain control of much of the country during the hot phase of the civil war. But his victory proved a pyrrhic one.",
      "The northern city of Aleppo fell to the Idlib rebels on Nov. 29 -- a shocking development that helped spark renewed rebel uprisings all across the country.",
      "In Daraa -- known as the \"Cradle of the Syrian Revolution\" for its role in the 2011 unrest -- opposition groups rose anew and began their march on the capital.",
      "\"Damascus has been liberated and the tyrant Bashar Assad has been overthrown, and oppressed prisoners in regime prisons have been released,\" a rebel spokesperson said at the state television headquarters in Damascus after opposition forces seized the building.",

      "The field of candidates has been set for two special elections in Florida to replace members of Congress nominated for positions in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s new administration",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- The field of candidates has been set for two special elections in Florida to replace members of Congress nominated for positions in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s new administration. Two dozen candidates have filed to run for the seats of outgoing Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz and Mike Waltz, though Trump has already weighed in on his preferred successors.",
      "Trump's reliance on Florida lawmakers for his new Cabinet is setting off a political chain reaction that\u2019s opening up new possibilities in the state in 2026 and beyond. Multiple sitting elected officials have filed to run for the congressional seats, including the state's chief financial officer Jimmy Patronis, triggering other vacancies and electoral opportunities.",
      "Both GOP congressmen easily won reelection to their respective seats in November, Gaetz in a northwest Florida district known for its sugar-sand beaches and military installations, and Waltz in a stretch of the state south of Jacksonville that includes Daytona Beach.",
      "The special elections to replace them aren't expected to change Republicans' slim majority in the House, but could trigger another shuffle among the state's political hopefuls eyeing a run for governor in 2026, as Gov. Ron DeSantis' second term winds down.",
      "Patronis is among those who Republican insiders say are considering a bid for governor, and a term in Congress could help boost his profile. Trump recently voiced his support for Patronis in the race to replace Gaetz in Congressional District 1, though that didn't dissuade the 15 other candidates who qualified to run, even in a district where Trump is overwhelmingly popular.",
      "\u201cJimmy Patronis has my Complete and Total Endorsement,\u201d Trump posted on his social networking site Truth Social. \u201cRUN, JIMMY, RUN!\u201d",
      "Other candidates in the race include Republican State Rep. Joel Rudman, a physician who launched his political career by criticizing mask mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sole Democrat in the race is Gay Valimont, an activist for the gun control advocacy group Moms Demand Action who unsuccessfully challenged Gaetz in November.",
      "In the race for Waltz' seat in Congressional District 6, Republican State Rep. Randy Fine won Trump's endorsement. Fine is a self-described \u201cconservative firebrand\u201d who was investigated for allegations related to posting the phone number online of a school board member, which led to a wave of harassment and threats against her. No charges were filed against him.",
      "Eight other candidates have jumped in the race for the seat, including three Democrats and a candidate unaffiliated with a party \u2014 Randall Terry, an anti-abortion activist who ran as the Constitution Party's presidential nominee last month.",
      "Gaetz had been tapped to be Trump's attorney general, before stepping aside amid continued fallout over a federal sex trafficking investigation. Gaetz has vehemently denied the allegations. Though no longer under consideration, Gaetz had already resigned from his northwest Florida seat, a move that effectively ended a House Ethics Committee investigation into his alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.",
      "Trump named Waltz to be his national security advisor, though the three-term congressman and retired Army National Guard officer has also been floated as a nominee for defense secretary, as the president-elect considered possible replacements in the face of growing questions about former Fox News host Pete Hegseth's personal conduct and ability to win Senate confirmation.",

He also said members of the House Select Committee investigating Jan. 6, namely co-chairs Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and Rep. Liz Cheney, R. Wyo., should be punished.",

      "In his 2023 book, \"Government Gangsters: The Deep State, the Truth, and the Battle for Our Democracy,\" Patel included a 60-name list of people he alleges are members of the \"Deep State\" who \"must be held accountable and exposed\" -- including President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, current FBI Director Christopher Wray, Hilary Clinton, former Trump Attorney General Bill Barr and current Attorney General Merrick Garland.",
      "Trump said in the \"Meet the Press\" interview that he has no intention of instructing Patel or Bondi on whom they should investigate and prosecute.",
      "Last week, Biden granted his son, Hunter Biden, a pardon for federal convictions for failing to pay income taxes from 2016 to 2020 and for lying on a federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives form when he purchased a handgun in 2018 and said he was not using drugs at the time.",
      "Ornstein noted that the full pardon of Hunter Biden was not just for his recent convictions but covers any crime he may have committed over a nearly 11-year span: Jan. 1, 2014 to Dec. 1, 2024.",
      "He said Biden could craft a similar pardon for the House Select Committee members and others who could be targeted by Trump, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who Trump allies have accused of suppressing information on the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"It would be over a period of time, potentially going back to 2016, where he could pardon them for any potential offenses or real offenses that may have been committed or charged,\" Ornstein said.",
      "Orenstein said precedent had already been established by former President Gerald Ford when he granted a blanket pardon to President Richard Nixon in 1974 for any crimes committed while he was the commander in chief even though Nixon hadn't been charged with a crime when he resigned from office over the Watergate scandal.",
      "Biden and his senior aides are discussing possible preemptive pardons for people who might be targeted by the incoming Trump administration, a source close to the president told ABC News. Possible names include current and former officials such as Cheney, Fauci and retired Gen. Mark Milley -- the former chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Trump. Milley has long been a target of Republican attacks over the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.",
      "In September 2023, Trump accused Milley of treason, posting on his Truth Social platform, \"In times gone by, the punishment would have been DEATH!\u201d",
      "Under a section called the \"Commander-in-chief clause,\" Article II, Section 2 of the U.S. Constitution says the president \"shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.\"",
      "\"He does not need to wait until someone is charged, tried or convicted,\" said Jeffrey Crouch, an assistant professor of American politics at American University and author of the book \"The Presidential Pardon Power.\" \"The Supreme Court has recognized the president\u2019s flexibility in this area.\"",
      "But Crouch cautioned that the use of preemptive pardons can be a slippery slope.",
      "\"The clemency power was intended to give presidents the ability to dispense mercy and defuse societal tensions, such as a war or rebellion,\" Crouch told ABC News. \"Granting pardons under the current circumstances in the manner being discussed could weaponize clemency. A constitutional power designed to dispense official forgiveness will have evolved into a catch-all provision for shielding political cronies or critics. This is far from what the framers of the constitution had in mind for presidential pardons.\"",
      "Crouch said presidential pardons can't be overturned.",
      "During his first term, Trump granted pardons to his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was also convicted in special counsel Robert Muller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election; his former campaign manager Paul Manafort, who was convicted of bank and tax fraud; and his longtime friend and onetime campaign adviser Roger Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstruction of a proceeding also stemming from the Russian election interference inquiry.",
      "Trump also pardoned his son-in-law Jared Kushner's fathet, Charles Kushner, of tax evasion and witness tampering convictions. Charles Kushner has been selected by Trump to be his ambassador to France in his second term.",
      "Several Democrats have been urging Biden to issue preemptive pardons to foil Trump's possible attempts at seeking retribution. Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., said in a Dec. 4 statement, \"This is no hypothetical threat.\"",
      "\u201cBy choosing Kash Patel as his FBI Director, Trump has made it clear that he is more focused on settling personal scores than on protecting the American people or upholding the rule of law,\" Boyle said.",
      "Boyle added, \"The people they\u2019re targeting include law enforcement officers, military personnel, and others who have spent their lives protecting this country. These patriots shouldn\u2019t have to live in fear of political retribution for doing what\u2019s right. That\u2019s why I\u2019m urging President Biden to issue a blanket pardon for anyone unjustly targeted by this vindictive scheme.\"",
      "In a Nov. 26 interview on Boston Public Radio station WGBH, Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., also urged Biden to consider preemptive pardons.",
      "\u201cI think that without question, Trump is going to try to act in a dictatorial way, in a fascistic way, in a revengeful way his first year towards individuals who he believes harmed him,\u201d Markey said. \"If it\u2019s clear by Jan. 19 that is [Trump's] intention, then I would recommend to President Biden that he provide those preemptive pardons to people, because that\u2019s really what our country is going to need next year.\"",

      "Trump doubled down on one of them, vowing to pardon people jailed for their role on Jan. 6 on his first day in office.",
      "\"First day. Yeah, I'm looking for these pardons,\" Trump told NBC's Kristen Welker on \"Meet the Press.\"",
      "Criticizing the jail conditions, Trump argued the people who plead guilty did so because they had no other choice.",

      "As one of his campaign's main themes, Trump long promised to \"free\" those imprisoned for their participation on that day as one of his first acts as president, oftentimes honoring them at his campaign rallies.",
      "Trump's pardon promise comes as he offered fluctuating comments on the role his picks for attorney general and FBI director, Pam Bondi and Kash Patel, would play in his upcoming administration should they be confirmed.",
      "On the issue of retribution, which was a central theme in Trump's 2024 campaign, the president-elect repeatedly said he wouldn't direct them to go after his political rivals, but they could if they wanted to.",

      "Aside from attacking Biden and Smith, Trump also harshly criticized the House Select Committee investigating Jan. 6, calling for members to be jailed.",
      "\"[Former Rep. Liz] Cheney was behind it. So is Benny Thompson and everybody on that committe, honestly, they should go to jail.\"",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump could break the record for most failed Cabinet nominations to start a term.",
    "story": [
      "He could break the record for most failed Cabinet nominations to start a term.",
      "There's still more than a month until Inauguration Day, but President-elect Donald Trump's administration is already off to a rocky start. His first nominee for attorney general, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, had to drop out of consideration after a week amid allegations that he paid for sex with underage girls. And last week, reports surfaced that Trump may replace his nominee for secretary of defense, former Fox News host Pete Hegseth, amid swirling sexual-assault allegations and other concerns about his fitness for office.",
      "It's a throwback to the human-resources turmoil that marked Trump's previous stint in the White House. During his first four years, Trump had more failed Cabinet nominations than any president since at least Jimmy Carter \u2014 and this time around, he's already the fastest president(-elect) in decades to see a Cabinet nominee fail.",
      "Failed Cabinet nominations are a rite of initiation for presidents: Every president since Carter has had at least one of their Cabinet appointees fail to be confirmed by the Senate. (Most, like Gaetz, withdrew rather than face a tough confirmation fight, but one \u2014 former Sen. John Tower, former President George H.W. Bush's first choice for defense secretary \u2014 was actually voted down.)",
      "But Trump set a modern record in his first term when six* of his nominees for jobs that are currently at the Cabinet level** withdrew from consideration. Former President Bill Clinton is second with four failed nominations,*** while former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama had three each. All other presidents since Carter had exactly one.",
      "Of course, these numbers represent nominees who withdrew over the course of previous presidents' entire terms \u2014 and Trump's second term hasn't even started yet. As the chart above shows, it's normal for presidents to whiff on one Cabinet nominee at, or even before, the start of their presidency. Obama even had three: his initial pick for secretary of health and human services and his first two picks for commerce secretary. (For what it's worth, this didn't seem to have a negative impact on his presidency. Obama's average approval ratings stayed above 60 percent through May 2009, and the 2009-10 Congress was one of the most productive in history.)",
      "But Trump is already ahead of Obama's pace. Obama's first commerce secretary nominee, then-New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, dropped out on Jan. 4, 2009. Gaetz withdrew on Nov. 21, 2024. In fact, Gaetz withdrew quicker than any other Cabinet appointee has withdrawn in the last 50 years.",
      "And while we don't know for sure what will happen in the future, Trump appears to have a good chance to tie or break Obama's record of three failed nominees at the start of a presidency. There's plenty of time left, and plenty of controversial Cabinet appointees who could face difficult paths to confirmation, such as Hegseth, anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his nominee for secretary of health and human services, and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, his nominee for director of national intelligence.",
      "That may seem particularly embarrassing for Trump given that his party is set to hold a 53-47 majority in the next Senate. But historically, most failed Cabinet picks actually haven't been torpedoed by the opposite party; they've withdrawn in the face of (potential) resistance from their own side. Seventeen of the 21 failed Cabinet nominations since the Carter administration have happened when the Senate was controlled by the president's party.",
      "Instead, the vast majority of failed Cabinet nominations tanked because a scandal emerged about the nominee. It's a subjective exercise to try to boil down the failure of every past Cabinet appointment to a single reason, but by my reckoning, 14 of the 21 failed because some kind of scandal was swirling around them. Sexual misconduct allegations, like the ones dogging Gaetz and Hegseth, have been among the most common reasons, also dragging down Tower and Clinton veterans affairs secretary nominee Hershel Gober. But the most common genre of scandal that has doomed Cabinet nominees, interestingly, has been employing or housing an undocumented immigrant or someone who was not authorized to work in the U.S. Contemporary media reports cited that as the reason behind five Cabinet withdrawals.",
      "By contrast, I count only two Cabinet nominees who have withdrawn in the face of partisan attacks, and only one who was forced to step aside because of concerns he was unqualified. Two more withdrew because senators took issue with their prickly personalities: John Bolton, one of George W. Bush's nominees for ambassador to the United Nations, was undone by accusations that he was a difficult boss and motivated by ideology over facts,**** while President Joe Biden's first choice for director of the Office of Management and Budget, Neera Tanden, dropped out because she had sent too many mean tweets. One or two***** others withdrew because of apparent ideological differences with the administration that appointed them.",
      "This may actually bode well for Trump: Unlike Gaetz and Hegseth, Kennedy, Gabbard and Trump's other nominees so far haven't been accused of any illegal activities. Instead, senators have appeared lukewarm on them because of Kennedy's conspiratorial views and Gabbard's Russian sympathies. Of course, past presidents have never appointed people with such unusual baggage to their Cabinets before, so there isn't exactly a precedent for how they will be handled. As is so often the case, Trump is sailing us into uncharted waters with many of his Cabinet picks, so we don't know what will happen.",
      "Footnotes",
      "*Including former Rep. John Ratcliffe, who withdrew his nomination for director of national intelligence in August 2019 but was renominated in February 2020 and then successfully confirmed.",
      "**Different presidents have designated different offices to be in the Cabinet. In addition to the vice president and the heads of the 15 Cabinet departments, the current Cabinet includes the chief of staff, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, the director of national intelligence, the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the administrator of the Small Business Administration, the ambassador to the United Nations, the U.S. trade representative, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and the director of the Office of Management and Budget. In order to fairly compare the number of failed nominations across time, the data in this article includes all of these offices even if they weren't in the Cabinet during the period in question \u2014 and doesn't include offices that were in the Cabinet at the time but aren't anymore.",
      "***Not including Judge Kimba Wood, a reported Clinton nominee for attorney general. On Feb. 5, 1993, Clinton administration officials anonymously told reporters that Clinton would appoint Wood, but the following day, she took herself out of the running because she had employed an undocumented immigrant as a nanny. Because Clinton never explicitly announced Wood's appointment, we've excluded her from our data.",
      "****After Bolton's nomination stalled, Bush used a recess appointment to install him as U.N. ambassador. However, he needed to get confirmed by the Senate in order to stay on in the job, and when that didn't happen, Bolton stepped aside.",
      "*****We never got an official answer about why Trump homeland security secretary nominee Chad Wolf bowed out, but we can make a guess: His withdrawal came on Jan. 7, 2021, just hours after he issued a strongly worded statement condemning the Jan. 6 riot and saying, \"Any appearance of inciting violence by an elected official goes against who we are as Americans.\"",

      "GEORGETOWN, Guyana -- Guyana is revisiting a dark history nearly half a century after U.S. Rev. Jim Jones and more than 900 of his followers died in the rural interior of the South American country.",
      "It was the largest suicide-murder in recent history, and a government-backed tour operator wants to open the former commune now shrouded by lush vegetation to visitors, a proposal that is reopening old wounds, with critics saying it would disrespect victims and dig up a sordid past.",
      "Jordan Vilchez, who grew up in California and was moved into the Peoples Temple commune at age 14, told The Associated Press in a phone interview from the U.S. that she has mixed feelings about the tour.",
      "She was in Guyana\u2019s capital the day Jones ordered hundreds of his followers to drink a poisoned grape-flavored drink that was given to children first. Her two sisters and two nephews were among the victims.",
      "\u201cI just missed dying by one day,\u201d she recalled.",
      "Vilchez, 67, said Guyana has every right to profit from any plans related to Jonestown.",
      "\u201cThen on the other hand, I just feel like any situation where people were manipulated into their deaths should be treated with respect,\u201d she said.",
      "Vilchez added that she hopes the tour operator would provide context and explain why so many people went to Guyana trusting they would find a better life.",
      "The tour would ferry visitors to the far-flung village of Port Kaituma nestled in the lush jungles of northern Guyana. It\u2019s a trip available only by boat, helicopter or plane; rivers instead of roads connect Guyana\u2019s interior. Once there, it\u2019s another six miles via a rough and overgrown dirt trail to the abandoned commune and former agricultural settlement.",
      "Neville Bissember, a law professor at the University of Guyana, questioned the proposed tour, calling it a \u201cghoulish and bizarre\u201d idea in a recently published letter.",
      "\u201cWhat part of Guyana\u2019s nature and culture is represented in a place where death by mass suicide and other atrocities and human rights violations were perpetuated against a submissive group of American citizens, which had nothing to do with Guyana nor Guyanese?\u201d he wrote.",
      "Despite ongoing criticism, the tour has strong support from the government's Tourism Authority and Guyana\u2019s Tourism and Hospitality Association.",
      "Tourism Minister Oneidge Walrond told the AP the government is backing the effort at Jonestown but is aware \u201cof some level of push back\u201d from certain sectors of society.",
      "She said the government already has helped clear the area \u201cto ensure a better product can be marketed,\u201d adding that the tour might need Cabinet approval.",
      "\u201cIt certainly has my support,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is possible. After all, we have seen what Rwanda has done with that awful tragedy as an example.\u201d",
      "Rose Sewcharran, director of Wonderlust Adventures, the private tour operator who plans to take visitors to Jonestown, said she was buoyed by the support.",
      "\u201cWe think it is about time,\u201d she said. \u201cThis happens all over the world. We have multiple examples of dark, morbid tourism around the world, including Auschwitz and the Holocaust museum.\u201d",
      "The November 1978 mass suicide-murder was synonymous with Guyana for decades until huge amounts of oil and gas were discovered off the country\u2019s coast nearly a decade ago, making it one of the world\u2019s largest offshore oil producers.",
      "New roads, schools and hotels are being built across the capital, Georgetown, and beyond, and a country that rarely saw tourists is now hoping to attract more of them.",
      "An obvious attraction is Jonestown, argued Astill Paul, the co-pilot of a twin-engine plane that flew U.S. Rep. Leo J. Ryan of California and a U.S. news crew to a village near the commune a day before hundreds died on Nov. 18, 1978. He witnessed gunmen fatally shoot Ryan and four others as they tried to board the plane on Nov. 18 and fly back to the capital.",
      "Paul told the AP he believes the former commune should be developed as a heritage site.",
      "\u201cI sat on the tourism board years ago and did suggest we do this, but the minister at the time lashed the idea down because the government wanted nothing to do with morbid tourism,\u201d he recalled.",
      "Until recently, successive governments shunned Jonestown, arguing that the country\u2019s image was badly damaged by the mass murder-suicide, even though only a handful of Indigenous people died. The overwhelming majority of victims were Americans like Vilchez who flew to Guyana to follow Jones. Many endured beatings, forced labor, imprisonment and rehearsals for a mass suicide.",
      "Those in favor of a tour include Gerry Gouveia, a pilot who also flew when Jonestown was active.",
      "\u201cThe area should be reconstructed purely for tourists to get a first-hand understanding of its layout and what had happened,\" he said. \u201cWe should reconstruct the home of Jim Jones, the main pavilion and other buildings that were there.\u201d",
      "Today, all that is left is bits of a cassava mill, pieces of the main pavilion and a rusted tractor that once hauled a flatbed trailer to take temple members to the Port Kaituma airfield.",
      "Until now, most visitors to Jonestown have been reporters and family members of those who died.",
      "Organizing an expedition on one\u2019s own is daunting: the area is far from the capital and hard to access, and some consider the closest populated settlement dangerous.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still a very, very, very rough area,\u201d said Fielding McGehee, co-director of The Jonestown Institute, a nonprofit group. \u201cI don\u2019t see how this is going to be an economically feasible kind of project because of the vast amounts of money it would take to turn it into a viable place to visit.\u201d",
      "McGehee warned about relying on supposed witnesses who will be part of the tour. He said the memories and stories that have trickled down through generations might not be accurate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a game of telephone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does not help anyone understand what happened in Jonestown.\u201d",
      "He recalled how one survivor had proposed a personal project to develop the abandoned site, but those from the temple community said, \u2018Why do you want to do that?\u2019",
      "McGehee noted that dark tourism is popular, and that going to Jonestown means tourists could say they visited a place where more than 900 people died on the same day.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the prurient interest in tragedy,\u201d he said.",
      "If the tour eventually starts operating, not everything will be visible to tourists.",
      "When Vilchez returned to Guyana in 2018 for the first time since the mass suicide-murder, she made an offering to the land when she arrived in Jonestown.",
      "Among the things she buried in the abandoned commune where her sisters and nephews died were snippets of hair from her mother and father, who did not go to Jonestown.",
      "\u201cIt just felt like a gesture that honored the people that died,\u201d she said.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico\u2019s Senate has voted to charge cruise ship passengers $42 per head for port calls, drawing sharp criticism from the tourism industry.",
      "Mexican business chambers say the immigration charge \u2014 from which cruise passengers used to be exempt \u2014 may hurt the country\u2019s half-billion-dollar-per-year cruise industry.",
      "The measure approved late Tuesday has already been passed in the lower house and will go into effect in 2025. The changes were part of a bill that also increases airport immigration charges and entry fees for nature reserves.",
      "Mexico\u2019s Caribbean coast is home to Cozumel, the busiest port of call for cruise ships in the world. The National Confederation of Commerce, Service and Tourism Chambers said the $42 charges could make other countries\u2019 Caribbean ports more competitive than Mexico\u2019s.",
      "\u201cThis could result in a significant decrease in visitors,\u201d Octavio de la Torre, the president of the federation, said Monday.",
      "In the past, cruise ship passengers were exempted from the immigration fee, because they slept aboard the vessels and some didn\u2019t even get off the ship during port calls. Now, even those people would apparently be charged the $42 fee, according to the new law.",
      "There have been initiatives throughout the world to curb cruise ships for fear of over-tourism, but that train left the station long ago in the case of Mexico\u2019s Caribbean coast. Cozumel has been the world\u2019s busiest port of call for years, welcoming about four million cruise passengers per year.",
      "Two-thirds of the money raised would go to the Mexican army, not to improve port facilities.",
      "The Mexican Association of Shipping Agents cried foul last week.",
      "\u201cIf this measure is implemented, it would make Mexican ports of call among the most expensive in the world, severely affecting their competitiveness with other Caribbean destinations,\u201d the association said in a statement.",
      "Mexico\u2019s ruling Morena party is already running enormous budget deficits to fund its favorite building projects like railways and oil refineries \u2014 some of which are being built by the army. The government is desperate to find new revenue sources."

    "story": [
      "A U.S. Senate subcommittee has held a hearing to question the growing use of airline fees to charge passengers for things like early boarding and better seats",
      "Members of a U.S. Senate subcommittee took aim at airline executives Wednesday for using an expanding menu of fees to charge customers for early boarding, better seats and other comforts that used to be part of the ticket price.",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said he thinks the federal government should review and perhaps fine the airlines for their use of what he called junk fees.",
      "Blumenthal, the chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said seat fees were pure profit for the airlines because they don't have to create new seats or incur other expenses by allowing customers to pick where to sit.",
      "Some senators expressed frustration during Wednesday's hearing when airline executives could not explain how they set the amount of various fees. They said the vagaries of airline pricing make it hard for consumers to budget for trips.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all captives on your airplanes at a certain point. You just say, \u2018You want to pick seat? We\u2019re just going to charge you some random amount more,\u2019\u201d Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., said. \u201cIt would be good if you guys could be transparent about what you do and why.\u201d",
      "The fees don't seem to be discouraging anybody. Americans are flying more than ever.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration reported screening nearly 3.1 million travelers at airports around the country on Sunday, a new single-day record. The 15 busiest days in TSA history have all occurred this year, with traffic at airport checkpoints up 5% over 2023.",
      "Airline executives bristle at the term \u201cjunk fees,\u201d and argue they are merely giving consumers what they want: choices.",
      "\u201cOur customers who prioritize affordability have the option to choose a lower-fare product and, in doing so, opt out of paying for additional services that they do not want,\u201d Andrew Nocella, the chief commercial officer of United Airlines, said in testimony prepared for the panel's hearing. \u201cBut we also have customers who seek more services, and they retain the ability to choose the services they value, for an incremental fee, like a seat with extra legroom or checked bags.\u201d",
      "Airlines have been adding fees on desirable seats to take advantage of increasing demand.",
      "The airline executives took offense at the charge that they are gouging travelers.",
      "\u201cIt has never been more affordable to fly,\" said Steve Johnson, chief strategy officer for American Airlines.",
      "Transportation Department figures indicate that airfares have fallen by about one-third since 2000 when taking inflation into account. However, those figures do not include fees.",
      "Senators said fees should be described clearly during the ticket-buying process. The executives said their airlines do that.",
      "Some subcommittee members also criticized airlines for the way they enforce fees.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., sparred with executives of Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines, which paid employees $26 million in bonuses for spotting customers whose carry-on bags were too big to fit under a seat. The passengers were forced to pay a fee \u2014 up to $77 on Spirit and $99 on Frontier \u2014 to use an overhead bin.",
      "\u201cIf people want to know why it\u2019s such a terrible experience to fly, this is news for them today,\u201d Hawley told the airlines executives Wednesday. \u201cYour airlines are paying millions of dollars to your employees to harass people who have already paid!\u201d",
      "Frontier Chief Commercial Officer Robert Schroeter and his counterpart at Spirit, Matthew Klein, said ensuring that people follow the rules was a matter of fairness to all passengers.",
      "When Hawley asked why bag fees may vary from one customer to another, Schroeter said Frontier must cover its costs.",
      "\u201cOverall, our job is to generate the most revenue we can so we can keep profitable as an airline,\u201d he said.",
      "U.S. airlines raised more than $7 billion from fees on checked bags last year, with American Airlines and United Airlines leading the pack. They scooped up another $1 billion in ticket-change and cancellation fees, although that was about one-third of what they raised before the coronavirus pandemic, when the biggest airlines dropped change fees.",
      "Exact figures on other types of fees are hard to determine, but the Senate panel reported last week that United, American, Delta Air Lines, Frontier and Spirit collected a combined total of more than $12 billion in seat fees between 2018 and 2023. That included charges for things such as more legroom or an aisle seat near the front of the plane.",
      "Airline fees have been a frequent target of criticism by the Biden administration, all the way up to President Joe Biden.",
      "A Transportation Department rule that took effect in October requires airlines to make automatic cash refunds for tickets and fees when flights are canceled.",
      "The airline industry is suing to block another regulation requiring more prominent disclosure of baggage and cancellation fees. An appeals court has blocked that rule, and its fate is uncertain under President-elect Donald Trump. Blumenthal asked the five executives to drop the lawsuit. None agreed to do so.",
      "The airline industry and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg have continued to fight over fees and other regulations, even after the November election."

      "ALTOONA, Pa. -- After UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO was gunned down on a New York sidewalk, police searched for the masked gunman with dogs, drones and scuba divers. Officers used the city's muscular surveillance system. Investigators analyzed DNA samples, fingerprints and internet addresses. Police went door-to-door looking for witnesses.",
      "When an arrest came five days later, those sprawling investigative efforts shared credit with an alert civilian's instincts. A Pennsylvania McDonald's customer noticed another patron who resembled the man in the oblique security-camera photos that New York police had publicized.",
      "Luigi Nicholas Mangione, a 26-year-old Ivy League graduate from a prominent Maryland real estate family, was arrested Monday in the killing of Brian Thompson, who headed one of the United States\u2019 largest medical insurance companies.",
      "He remained jailed in Pennsylvania, where he was initially charged with possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police. By late evening, prosecutors in Manhattan had added a charge of murder, according to an online court docket. He's expected to be extradited to New York eventually.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether Mangione has an attorney who can comment on the allegations. Asked at Monday's arraignment whether he needed a public defender, Mangione asked whether he could \u201canswer that at a future date.\u201d",
      "Mangione was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after the McDonald's customer recognized him and notified an employee, authorities said. Police in Altoona, about 233 miles (375 kilometers) west of New York City, were soon summoned.",
      "They arrived to find Mangione sitting at a table in the back of the restaurant, wearing a blue medical mask and looking at a laptop, according to a Pennsylvania police criminal complaint.",
      "He initially gave them a fake ID, but when an officer asked Mangione whether he\u2019d been to New York recently, he \u201cbecame quiet and started to shake,\u201d the complaint says.",
      "When he pulled his mask down at officers' request, \u201cwe knew that was our guy,\u201d rookie Officer Tyler Frye said at a news conference in Hollidaysburg.",
      "New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at a Manhattan news conference that Mangione was carrying a gun like the one used to kill Thompson and the same fake ID the shooter had used to check into a New York hostel, along with a passport and other fraudulent IDs.",
      "NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said Mangione also had a three-page, handwritten document that shows \u201csome ill will toward corporate America.\"",
      "A law enforcement official who wasn\u2019t authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity said the document included a line in which Mangione claimed to have acted alone.",
      "\u201cTo the Feds, I\u2019ll keep this short, because I do respect what you do for our country. To save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly that I wasn\u2019t working with anyone,\u201d the document said, according to the official.",
      "It also had a line that said, \u201cI do apologize for any strife or traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites simply had it coming.\u201d",
      "Pennsylvania prosecutor Peter Weeks said in court that Mangione was found with a passport and $10,000 in cash \u2014 $2,000 of it in foreign currency. Mangione disputed the amount.",
      "Thompson, 50, was killed last Wednesday as he walked alone to a midtown Manhattan hotel for an investor conference. Police quickly came to see the shooting as a targeted attack by a gunman who appeared to wait for Thompson, came up behind him and fired a 9 mm pistol.",
      "Investigators have said \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were written on ammunition found near Thompson\u2019s body. The words mimic a phrase used to criticize the insurance industry.",
      "From surveillance video, New York investigators gathered that the shooter fled by bike into Central Park, emerged, then took a taxi to a northern Manhattan bus terminal.",
      "Once in Pennsylvania, he went from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, \u201ctrying to stay low-profile\u201d by avoiding cameras, Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said.",
      "A grandson of a wealthy, self-made real estate developer and philanthropist, Mangione is a cousin of a current Maryland state legislator. Mangione was valedictorian at his elite Baltimore prep school, where his 2016 graduation speech lauded his classmates\u2019 \u201cincredible courage to explore the unknown and try new things.\u201d",
      "He went on to earn undergraduate and graduate degrees in computer science in 2020 from the University of Pennsylvania, a spokesperson said.",

      "A federal appeals court is expected to hear arguments over whether Idaho should be prohibited from enforcing a strict abortion ban during medical emergencies when a pregnant patient\u2019s life or health is at risk",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- A federal appeals court is expected to hear arguments Tuesday afternoon over whether Idaho should be prohibited from enforcing a strict abortion ban during medical emergencies when a pregnant patient's life or health is at risk.",
      "The state law makes it a felony to perform an abortion unless the procedure is necessary to prevent the death of the patient. President Biden\u2019s administration sued Idaho two years ago, contending the law violates a federal rule called the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, or EMTALA, because it prevents doctors from performing abortions that save their patients from serious infections, organ loss or other major medical issues.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court heard the case earlier this year, but bounced it back to the lower court on a procedural issue, leaving unanswered questions about the legality of the state abortion ban.",
      "Idaho officials have argued in court filings that the state abortion ban doesn\u2019t violate EMTALA. Instead, they say the fetus or embryo should be considered a patient with protections under EMTALA as well. They also argue that doctors have enough wiggle room under the law to use their best judgment about when to treat pregnant people with life-threatening medical conditions.",
      "\u201cTaking EMTALA for what it actually says, there is no direct conflict with Idaho\u2019s Defense of Life Act,\u201d attorneys representing the Idaho Legislature wrote in court filings earlier this month. \u201cNothing in EMTALA requires physicians to violate state law. And nothing in Idaho law \u2014 whether in EMTALA-covered circumstances or beyond \u2014 denies medical care to pregnant women.\u201d",
      "About 50,000 people in the U.S. develop life-threatening complications during pregnancy each year. Those complications can include major blood loss, sepsis, or the loss of reproductive organs. In rare cases, doctors might need to terminate a pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant person, especially in cases where there is no chance for a fetus to survive.",
      "But some state abortion bans have made medical decisions that once seemed clear feel particularly fraught for emergency room physicians. Complaints that pregnant patients were turned away from U.S. emergency rooms spiked in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.",
      "\u201cThese harms are not hypothetical,\u201d Idaho's largest hospital system, St. Luke's Health System, wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief in October. \u201cIn all of 2023, before Idaho's law went into effect, only one pregnant patient presenting to St. Luke\u2019s with a medical emergency was airlifted out of state for care. Yet in the few months when Idaho\u2019s new abortion law was in effect, six pregnant St. Luke\u2019s patients with medical emergencies were transferred out of state for termination of their pregnancy.\u201d",
      "One of those patients had severe preeclampsia \u2014 a condition that causes dangerously high blood pressure that can be fatal if untreated \u2014 and the others had premature rupture of their membranes, putting them at risk of life-threatening infections, St. Luke's said.",
      "\u201cThe stakes could not be higher,\u201d ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project Deputy Director Alexa Kolbi-Molinas said Monday. She noted recent news reports in Texas about women who died after being denied appropriate treatments for incomplete miscarriages. \u201cThe reality is, exceptions don't work. They don't actually protect the health and rights of pregnant people regardless of what is written on the page, and that is just the reality when you threaten physicians with criminal penalties.\u201d"

      "The Onion's bid to buy conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars is back in a Texas courtroom",
      "A bankruptcy judge scrutinizing The Onion\u2019s bid for Alex Jones \u2019 Infowars platform was expected to hear a second day of testimony Tuesday after an auctioneer defended the satirical news outlet\u2019s winning offer in November.",
      "It is not clear how quickly U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez in Houston will decide whether to approve the bid. The Onion, which wants to turn Infowars\u2019 website and social media accounts into parodies, offered $1.75 million for Infowars\u2019 assets in the auction.",
      "Jones did not attend Monday\u2019s start of the key hearing and instead continued to broadcast from his studios in Austin.",
      "Jeff Tanenbaum, president of ThreeSixty Asset Advisors, was grilled by lawyers for Jones and the company in a Houston courtroom on Monday over how The Onion\u2019s bid came to be valued at $7 million and why a live auction was not held. He defended both the value of the bid and its selection after the two sealed offers were opened.",
      "Lopez could ultimately decide whether to void The Onion\u2019s bid, name the Jones-affiliated company the winner or hold another auction, among other possibilities.",
      "Jones and First United American Companies, which runs a website in Jones\u2019 name that sells nutritional supplements and submitted the other bid, are alleging fraud and collusion in the auction that concluded on Nov. 14. The trustee and The Onion deny the allegations, accusing Jones and the company of sour grapes. First United American Companies bid $3.5 million.",
      "The sale of Infowars is part of Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas filed by relatives of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut. Jones repeatedly called the 2012 shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors and aimed at increasing gun control.",
      "Most of the proceeds from the sale of Infowars, as well as many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, will go to the Sandy Hook families to help satisfy judgments issued by juries and judges in state courts in Connecticut and Texas. Some proceeds will go to Jones\u2019 other creditors.",
      "The Onion\u2019s bid also included a pledge by many of the Sandy Hook families to forgo some or all of the auction proceeds due to them to give other creditors a total of $100,000 more than they would receive under other bids.",
      "The trustee, Christopher Murray, chose The Onion, saying its proposal was better for creditors because they would receive more money. The Onion valued the bid, with the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer, at $7 million, because that amount was equal to a purchase price that would provide the same amount of money to the other creditors.",
      "Tanenbaum testified that he agreed with the $7 million valuation and believed The Onion\u2019s bid conformed to the auction rules.",
      "A lawyer for Jones, Ben Broocks, asked Tanenbaum how it was possible that the Sandy Hook families\u2019 offer boosted The Onion\u2019s offer to such a high amount.",
      "\u201cIt means the purchase price value has gone up because another purchase price would have to be higher than that value in order to provide the same net benefit to that group of creditors,\u201d Tanenbaum said.",
      "During his opening argument, Broocks said there was no way The Onion should have been chosen over First United American.",
      "\u201cHow does a $1.75 million bid beat a $3.5 million bid?\u201d he asked. \u201cHow is that $1.75 million greater? Well, it\u2019s voodoo economics to use a phrase.\u201d",
      "Joshua Wolfshohl, an attorney for Murray, told the judge Monday that no wrongdoing occurred during the auction. He called the complaints by Jones and First United American Companies unfounded.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of their complaints are just fantastic, imagined conspiracy theories that have no basis in reality,\u201d he said.",
      "Murray, The Onion and the Sandy families deny allegations of wrongdoing. In his own court filing, Murray called the allegations \u201ca disappointed bidder\u2019s improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open auction process.\u201d",
      "Up for sale at the auction were all the equipment and other assets in the Infowars studio in Austin, Texas, as well as its social media accounts, websites, video archive and product trademarks. Jones uses the studio to broadcast his far-right, conspiracy theory-filled shows on the Infowars website, his account on the social platform X and radio stations.",
      "Jones has set up another studio, websites and social media accounts in case The Onion wins approval to buy Infowars and kicks him out. Jones has said he could continue using the Infowars platforms if the auction winner is friendly to him.",
      "Jones is appealing the $1.5 billion in judgments citing free speech rights but has acknowledged that the school shooting happened."

      "NEW YORK -- Nikki Giovanni, the poet, author, educator and public speaker who rose from borrowing money to release her first book to decades as a literary celebrity sharing her blunt and conversational takes on everything from racism and love to space travel and mortality, has died. She was 81.",
      "Giovanni, subject of the prize-winning 2023 documentary \u201cGoing to Mars,\" died Monday with her life-long partner, Virginia (Ginney) Fowler, by her side, according to a statement from friend and author Ren\u00e9e Watson",
      "\u201cWe will forever feel blessed to have shared a legacy and love with our dear cousin,\u201d Allison (Pat) Ragan, Giovanni\u2019s cousin, said in a statement on behalf of the family.",
      "Author of more than 25 books, Giovanni was a born confessor and performer whom fans came to know well from her work, her readings and other live appearances and her years on the faculty of Virginia Tech among other schools. Poetry collections such as \"Black Judgement\" and \"Black Feeling Black Talk\" sold thousands of copies, led to invitations from \"The Tonight Show\" and other television programs and made her popular enough to fill a 3,000-seat concert hall at Lincoln Center for a celebration of her 30th birthday.",
      "In poetry, prose and the spoken word, she told her story. She looked back on her childhood in Tennessee and Ohio, championed the Black Power movement, addressed her battles with lung cancer, paid tribute to heroes from Nina Simone to Angela Davis and reflected on such personal passions as food, romance, family and rocketing into space, a journey she believed Black women uniquely qualified for, if only because of how much they had already survived. She also edited a groundbreaking anthology of Black women poets, \"Night Comes Softly,\" and helped found a publishing cooperative that promoted works by Gwendolyn Brooks and Margaret Walker among others.",
      "For a time, she was called \"The Princess of Black Poetry.\"",
      "\"All I know is the she is the most cowardly, bravest, least understanding, most sensitive, slowest to anger, most quixotic, lyingest, most honest woman I know,\" her friend Barbara Crosby wrote in the introduction to \"The Prosaic Soul of Nikki Giovanni,\" an anthology of nonfiction prose published in 2003. \"To love her is to love contradiction and conflict. To know her is to never understand but to be sure that all is life.\"",
      "Giovanni's admirers ranged from James Baldwin to Teena Marie, who name-checked her on the dance hit \u201cSquare Biz,\u201d to Oprah Winfrey, who invited the poet to her \"Living Legends\" summit in 2005, when other guests of honor included Rosa Parks and Toni Morrison. Giovanni was a National Book Award finalist in 1973 for a prose work about her life, \"Gemini.\" She also received a Grammy nomination for the spoken word album \"The Nikki Giovanni Poetry Collection.\"",

      "I'll make the butter",
      "Then clean the churn\"",
      "____",
      "Giovanni had a son, Thomas Watson Giovanni, in 1969. She never married the father, because, she told Ebony magazine, \"I didn\u2019t want to get married, and I could afford not to get married.\" Over the latter part of her life she lived with her partner, Virginia Fowler, a fellow faculty member at Virginia Tech.",
      "She was born Yolande Cornelia Giovanni Jr. in Knoxville, Tennessee, and was soon called \"Nikki\" by her older sister. She was 4 when her family moved to Ohio and eventually settled in the Black community of Lincoln Heights, outside of Cincinnati. She would travel often between Tennessee and Ohio, bound to her parents and to her maternal grandparents in her \"spiritual home\" in Knoxville.",
      "As a girl, she read everything from history books to Ayn Rand and was accepted to Fisk University, the historically Black school in Nashville, after her junior year of high school. College was a time for achievement, and for trouble. Her grades were strong, she edited the Fisk literary magazine and helped start the campus branch of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee. But she rebelled against school curfews and other rules and was kicked out for a time because her \u201cattitudes did not fit those of a Fisk woman,\u201d she later wrote. After the school changed the dean of women, Giovanni returned and graduated with honors in history in 1967.",
      "Giovanni relied on support from friends to publish her debut collection, \"Black Poetry Black Talk,\" which came out in 1968, and in the same year she self-published \"Black Judgement.\" The radical Black Arts Movement was at its height and early Giovanni poems such as \"A Short Essay of Affirmation Explaining Why,\" \"Of Liberation\" and \"A Litany for Peppe\" were militant calls to overthrow white power. (\"The worst junkie or black businessman is more humane/than the best honkie\").",
      "\"I have been considered a writer who writes from rage and it confuses me. What else do writers write from?\" she wrote in a biographical sketch for Contemporary Writers. \"A poem has to say something. It has to make some sort of sense; be lyrical; to the point; and still able to be read by whatever reader is kind enough to pick up the book.\"",
      "Her opposition to the political system moderated over time, although she never stopped advocating for change and self-empowerment, or remembering martyrs of the past. In 2020, she was featured in an ad for presidential candidate Joe Biden, in which she urged young people to \u201cvote because someone died for you to have the right to vote.\u201d",
      "Her best known work came early in her career; the 1968 poem \"Nikki-Rosa.\" It was a declaration of her right to define herself, a warning to others (including obituary writers) against telling her story and a brief meditation on her poverty as a girl and the blessings, from holiday gatherings to bathing in \"one of those big tubs that folk in chicago barbecue in,\" which transcended it.",

      "A proposed western railroad expansion aimed at boosting crude oil production in Utah is coming before the Supreme Court in a case that could have wider effects on federal environmental regulation",
      "WASHINGTON -- A proposed western railroad expansion aimed at boosting crude oil production in Utah is coming before the Supreme Court Tuesday in a case that could have wider impact on federal environmental regulation. Here's a look at the case, which includes a recusal by one justice and arguments about how far the government should go in considering potential harm to the environment against the backdrop of climate change.",
      "Only eight of the nine justices will hear the arguments. Justice Neil Gorsuch recused himself last week, citing the court\u2019s new code of ethics. He didn\u2019t offer further explanation, but he was facing calls to step aside over past ties to a Colorado billionaire who could benefit from boosted oil production in the region.",
      "Philip Anschutz isn't a party to the case, but he owns oil wells in the area and his company filed a friend-of-the-court brief arguing that broader interpretation of the environmental law at the center of the case stymies development.",
      "Gorsuch represented Anschutz before becoming a judge, and recused himself from cases involving him when he sat on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, according to the group Accountable.us, which first called attention to the ties between the two men. A dozen Democratic lawmakers also urged him to step aside from the case in a letter last month.",
      "The case centers on the Uinta Basin Railway, a proposed 88-mile (142-kilometer) expansion through hills of sandstone and sagebrush. The multibillion-dollar project would connect oil and gas producers to the broader rail network, allowing them to access larger markets and potentially quadrupling production.",
      "The project won approval from regulators on the Surface Transportation Board under the National Environmental Policy Act. But environmental groups and a Colorado county said in a lawsuit that regulators should have considered broader potential environmental impacts, like increased wildfire risk and a potential train derailment that could dump oil into the headwaters of the Colorado River.",
      "A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., agreed last year and overturned the approval. Backers of the project appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that regulators should only be considering more direct impacts and the project should get back on track.",
      "The case turns on how federal agencies consider potential harm to the environment when they\u2019re deciding whether to approve development projects.",
      "Developers say that process can create years of delay, but environmental groups say it's a key protection for air and water quality.",
      "The Biden administration falls somewhere in the middle. They're defending regulators' decision to approve the Utah project, but say the railway supporters would go too far in limiting the scope of environmental law.",
      "The court's conservative-majority court has taken other steps to curtail the power of federal regulators, including striking down a decades-old decision known as Chevron that made it easier for the federal government to set a wide range of regulations."

      "The great-granddaughter of the last Alaska Native chief of a remote island in the Bering Sea believes Japan should pay more restitution for what its soldiers did to the residents of Attu Island during World War II",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Helena Pagano's great-grandfather was the last Alaska Native chief of a remote island in the Bering Sea, closer to Russia than North America. He died starving as a prisoner of war after Japanese troops invaded during World War II, wresting the few dozen residents from their village, never to return.",
      "Pagano has long believed Japan should pay more restitution for what its soldiers did to her great-grandfather and the other residents of Attu Island.",
      "But her demand was sparked anew this summer by her first visit to the island. She went alongside Japanese officials who, as part of a redoubled effort to recover the remains of World War II soldiers killed abroad, unearthed the bones of two people from the tundra.",
      "The Attuans \"lost their homeland, they lost their family members,\u201d Pagano said. \u201cThis story was never told, and the Japanese have never really helped us in that regard.\u201d",
      "Attu Island is the most westerly of Alaska\u2019s Aleutian chain. It was one of the few U.S. territories, including Guam, the Philippines and the nearby island of Kiska, to be captured during the war.",
      "Japanese landed on Attu on June 7, 1942, killing the radio operator. The residents were kept in their homes for three months, then taken to Japan.",
      "U.S. forces waged a bloody campaign amid hurricane-force winds, rain and dense fog in 1943 to retake Attu Island in what became known as the war\u2019s \u201cforgotten battle.\u201d More than 2,500 Japanese soldiers died in combat or by suicide, and American forces lost about 550 soldiers.",
      "Of the 41 residents interned on Japan\u2019s Hokkaido Island, 22 died from malnutrition, starvation, tuberculosis or other ailments over the next two-plus years, including Pagano\u2019s great-grandfather, Mike Hodikoff, the last chief. Hodikoff and his son both died in 1945, suffering from food poisoning after being reduced to scrounging through rotting garbage for sustenance.",
      "After the war, surviving Attuans were not allowed to return to the island because the U.S. military said it would be too expensive to rebuild. Most were sent to Atka Island, about 200 miles (322 kilometers) away. The last surviving Attu residents that were held in captivity died last year.",
      "In 1951, six years after the end of the war, Japan did offer the Attuans who survived about $4,000 a year \u2014 more than the average U.S. annual salary at the time \u2014 for three years, Pagano said. Nearly all accepted, but her grandmother refused, suggesting the treatment the POWs endured was too awful to be compensated with money.",
      "The Japanese never compensated the families for the deaths of prisoners or for the loss of land and damage to Attuan culture and language, said Pagano, who runs Atux Forever, a nonprofit devoted to Attuan culture. The historical trauma still weighs on the 300 or so Attuan descendants remaining in the U.S., she said.",
      "Besides restitution, she'd like to see the Japanese government invest in a cultural center for Attuans somewhere in mainland Alaska and to work with the U.S. government on an environmental cleanup of Attu Island, including the removal of old anti-aircraft guns and steel planking that was used for temporary air strips, along with a peace memorial she said Japan erected there without the input of Attuans or U.S. veterans who served in the battle.",
      "Officials at Japan\u2019s Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry and the Foreign Ministry said they have not received requests for additional restitution from Attuans.",
      "There have been compensation demands for brutality against POWs, wartime Korean forced laborers and \u201ccomfort women\u201d from across Asia who were forced into prostitution for Japanese soldiers. But the Japanese government has insisted that all compensation issues were settled under a 1951 treaty in San Francisco, whose signatory members had waived their rights, or other treaties, said Yoshitaka Sato, an official at the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry. Japan had set up funds for the women in 1995 and 2015 as exceptions.",
      "Pagano says the 1951 treaty would not bar additional restitution.",
      "The island is part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. In August, Pagano made her first trip to Attu, on a ship operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages the refuge.",
      "She said she didn't know ahead of time that the Japanese officials would be exhuming any remains, and she considered it disrespectful, saying the bones could have been those of Attu residents or U.S. soldiers.",
      "Jeff Williams, deputy manager of the refuge, said the exhumation plans weren't approved until just before the trip.",
      "The former Attu village site, where the bones were unearthed, is owned by the Aleut Corp. \u2014 one of several regional, for-profit corporations set up to benefit Alaska Natives. In an email, spokesperson Kate Gilling said the Aleut Corp. \u201crecognizes the significant historical trauma endured by the Attuan people during and after World War II\u201d and that it was aware of Atux Forever\u2019s call for reparations.",
      "\"We believe greater partnership between all entities in the Aleutian and Pribilof Island region will help advance solutions that are comprehensive and inclusive,\u201d she said.",
      "As war veterans and their relatives age, the Japanese government has faced growing calls to speed the recovery of remains and has done so, including more use of DNA testing. Of about 2.4 million Japanese troops who died in the war outside Japan, the remains of a little more than half have been recovered.",

      "Sato, the Japanese government official, said the U.S. government controls what areas Japan can survey for remains and requires Japan to take necessary environmental protection measures.",
      "Japanese efforts to recover remains on Attu had long been on hold, largely due to U.S. environmental concerns, Sato said. In 2009, the U.S government required environmental assessment that led to further delay of more than a decade.",
      "Prior to the August visit to Attu, the U.S. proposed a survey without digging, but later allowed shoveling inside of a small piece of land, Sato said. Under the supervision of U.S. officials, the remains of two suspected Japanese soldiers were unearthed.",

      "While others returned to the ship to sleep at night, she camped out \u2014 likely the first Attuan to spend a night on the island since the residents were forcibly removed 82 years ago.",

      "The grinding war pitting Ukraine against its Russian invaders has escalated ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration",
      "WASHINGTON -- The grinding war between Ukraine and its Russian invaders has escalated ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration, with President Joe Biden rushing out billions of dollars more in military aid before U.S. support for Kyiv\u2019s defenses is thrown into question under the new administration.",
      "Russia, Ukraine and their global allies are scrambling to put their side in the best possible position for any changes that Trump may bring to American policy in the nearly 3-year-old war. The president-elect insisted in recent days that Russia and Ukraine immediately reach a ceasefire and said Ukraine should likely prepare to receive less U.S. military aid.",
      "On the war's front lines, Ukraine's forces are mindful of Trump's fast-approaching presidency and the risk of losing their biggest backer.",
      "If that happens, \u201cthose people who are with me, my unit, we are not going to retreat,\" a Ukrainian strike-drone company commander, fighting in Russia's Kursk region with the 47th Brigade, told The Associated Press by phone.",
      "\u201cAs long as we have ammunition, as long as we have weapons, as long as we have some means to defeat the enemy, we will fight,\u201d said the commander, who goes by his military call sign, Hummer. He spoke on condition he not be identified by name, citing Ukrainian military rules and security concerns.",
      "\u201cBut, when all means run out, you must understand, we will be destroyed very quickly,\u201d he said.",
      "The Biden administration is pushing every available dollar out the door to shore up Ukraine's defenses before leaving office in six weeks, announcing more than $2 billion in additional support since Trump won the presidential election last month.",
      "The U.S. has sent a total of $62 billion in military aid since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. And more help is on the way.",
      "The administration is on track to disperse the U.S. portion of a $50 billion loan to Ukraine, backed by frozen Russian assets, before Biden leaves the White House, U.S. officials said. They said the U.S. and Ukraine are in \u201cadvanced stages\u201d of discussing terms of the loan and close to executing the $20 billion of the larger loan that the U.S. is backing.",
      "Biden also has eased limits on Ukraine using American longer-range missiles against military targets deeper inside Russia, following months of refusing those appeals over fears of provoking Russia into nuclear war or attacks on the West. He's also newly allowed Ukraine to employ antipersonnel mines, which are banned by many countries.",
      "Biden and his senior advisers, however, are skeptical that allowing freer use of the longer-range missiles will change the broader trajectory of the war, according to two senior administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.",
      "But the administration has at least a measure of confidence that its scramble, combined with continued strong European support, means it will leave office having given Ukraine the tools it needs to sustain its fight against Russia for some time, the officials said.",
      "Enough to hold on, but not enough to defeat Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces, according to Ukraine and some of its allies.",
      "Even now, \u201cthe Biden administration has been very careful not to run up against the possibility of a defeated Putin or a defeated Russia\u201d for fear of the tumult that could bring, said retired Gen. Philip Breedlove, a former supreme allied commander of NATO. He is critical of Biden\u2019s cautious pace of military support for Ukraine.",
      "Events far from the front lines this past weekend demonstrated the war's impact on Russia\u2019s military.",
      "In Syria, rebels seized the country\u2019s capital and toppled Russia-allied President Bashar Assad. Russian forces in Syria had propped up Assad for years, but they moved out of the way of the rebels\u2019 assault, unwilling to take losses to defend their ally.",
      "Biden said it was further evidence that U.S. support for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was wearing down Russia\u2019s military.",
      "Trump, who has long spoken favorably of Putin and described Zelenskyy as a \u201cshowman\" wheedling money from the U.S., used that moment to call for an immediate ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia.",
      "And asked in a TV interview \u2014 taped before he met with Zelenskyy over the weekend in Paris \u2014 if Ukraine should prepare for the possibility of reduced aid, Trump said, \u201cYeah. Probably. Sure.\u201d",
      "Trump's supporters call that pre-negotiation maneuvering by an avowed deal-maker. His critics say they fear it shows he is in Putin's sway.",
      "Zelenskyy said Monday that Russian forces\u2019 retrenchment from outposts worldwide demonstrates that \u201cthe entire army of this great pseudo-empire is fighting against the Ukrainian people today.\u201d",
      "\u201cForcing Putin to end the war requires Ukraine to be strong on the battlefield before it can be strong diplomatically,\u201d Zelenskyy wrote on social media, repeating near-daily appeals for more longer-range missiles from the U.S. and Europe.",
      "In Kursk, Hummer, the Ukrainian commander, said he notices Russian artillery strikes and shelling easing up since the U.S. and its European allies loosened limits on use of longer-range missiles.",
      "But Moscow has been escalating its offensives in other ways in the past six months, burning through men and materiel in infantry assaults and other attacks far faster than it can replace them, according to the Institute for the Study of War.",
      "In Kursk, that includes Russia sending waves of soldiers on motorcycles and golf carts to storm Ukrainian positions, Hummer said. The Ukrainian drone commander and his comrades defend the ground they have seized from Russia with firearms, tanks and armored vehicles provided by the U.S. and other allies.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s supporters fear that the kind of immediate ceasefire Trump is urging would be mostly on Putin\u2019s terms and allow the Russian leader to resume the war when his military has recovered.",
      "\u201cPutin is sacrificing his own soldiers at a grotesque rate to take whatever territory he can on the assumption that the U.S. will tell Ukraine that U.S. aid is over unless Russia gets to keep what it has taken,\u201d Phillips O\u2019Brien, a professor of strategic studies at Scotland\u2019s University of St. Andrews, wrote on his Substack channel.",
      "Putin's need for troops led him to bring in North Korean forces. Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to use longer-range missiles more broadly in Russia was partly in response, intended to discourage North Korea from deeper involvement in the war, one of the senior administration officials said.",
      "Since 2022, Russia already had been pulling forces and other military assets from Syria, Central Asia and elsewhere to throw into the Ukraine fight, said George Burros, an expert on the Russia-Ukraine conflict at the Institute for the Study of War.",
      "Any combat power that Russia has left in Syria that it could deploy to Ukraine is unlikely to change battlefield momentum, Burros said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Massive U.S. airstrikes on Islamic State militants in Syria were meant in part as a message to the group and a move to ensure that it doesn't try to take advantage of the chaos following the overthrow of President Bashar Assad's government.",
      "The U.S. and its partners want to make sure the Islamic State group, which still has a presence in Syria, can't step into the leadership void and once again exert control over wide swaths of the country, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said Monday. The U.S. on Sunday struck about 75 IS targets in the Syrian desert.",
      "The U.S. has had troops in Syria for the last decade to battle IS. The tumult following a rebel offensive that toppled Assad has raised fears of an Islamic State resurgence.",
      "\u201cISIS will try to use this period to reestablish its capabilities, to create safe havens,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday, using another acronym for the group. \"As our precision strikes over the weekend demonstrate, we are determined not to let that happen.\u201d",
      "So far, U.S. officials are saying that they do not plan an increase in American forces in Syria but are focused on making sure those already there are safe.",
      "Here's a look at the U.S. fight against the Islamic State group:",
      "The U.S. has about 900 troops and an undisclosed number of contractors in Syria, largely at small bases in the north and east, with a small number farther south at the al-Tanf garrison closer to the Iraq and Jordan borders.",
      "U.S. special operations forces also routinely move in and out of the country but are usually in small teams and are not included in the official count.",
      "Islamic State militants seized large parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014, declaring a caliphate. The U.S. gathered a coalition of allies and was able to defeat IS in Iraq in 2017. The U.S. partnered with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, and after fierce fighting, ultimately declared an end to the caliphate in Syria in 2019.",
      "Remnants of the militant group remain, including as many as 10,000 fighters held in SDF-run detention facilities in Syria and tens of thousands of their family members living in refugee camps.",
      "And IS fighters have been more active over the past year or so, including in attacks against U.S. and Kurdish forces in Syria.",
      "The country has been wracked by violence and competing interests. Russia has a naval port in the north, and while there have been fewer Russian forces in the area since the onset of the war in Ukraine, the U.S. maintains a deconfliction phoneline with Moscow to avoid any troop miscalculations on the ground or in the air.",
      "Iran also has had a significant presence, often using Syria as a transit route to move weapons into Lebanon for use by Hezbollah militants against Israel.",
      "The al-Tanf garrison in southeastern Syria is located on a vital road that can link Iranian-backed forces from Tehran all the way to southern Lebanon and Israel\u2019s doorstep. So troops at the U.S. garrison can try and disrupt those shipments.",
      "The U.S. has, over the past decade, routinely targeted IS leaders, camps and weapons in Syria to keep the group at bay and prevent it from coalescing.",
      "In the past year, as Israel's war with Hamas widened into a broader conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon, attacks by Iran-backed militias in Iraq and Syria as well as by the Islamic State group have escalated.",
      "As a result, the U.S. has kept up a steady drumbeat of counterattacks against all the groups, including against IS camps in the desert, where fighters found safe haven.",
      "Officials say that while the group is vastly weaker than in 2014, it still maintains thousands of militants in Syria.",
      "On Sunday, the U.S. launched one of its larger, more expansive assaults against IS camps and operatives in the desert, taking advantage of the Assad government's downfall. The U.S. bombed at least 75 targets in about five locations using B-52 bombers, A-10 attack aircraft and F-15 fighter jets.",
      "\u201cDoes it send a message? I mean, I think it absolutely sends a message that we use B-52s, A-10s and F-15s,\u201d Singh told reporters. She had no other details on the result of the strikes.",
      "The Biden administration insists the U.S. will not get involved in Syria's war or the overthrow of the Assad government. But the U.S. and its allies have deep interests in Syria, including the efforts to defeat IS, disrupt Iran-backed groups and contain the remnants of al-Qaida and other terror groups that have found sanctuary.",
      "\u201cI think it is a harbinger of more instability and the potential for more political violence,\u201d Chris Costa, former senior director for counterterrorism in the first Trump administration, said last week before the fall of Damascus. Costa spent decades in the U.S. Army and ran special operations in combat zones. \u201cI think there\u2019s the potential for ISIS again to make trouble not just for the Iraqis but also be emboldened in the region.\u201d",
      "Alex Younger, who led Britain\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, MI6, between 2014 and 2020, said a big concern is the \"very large number of ISIS detainees left over from the destruction of the caliphate.\u201d",
      "Younger told the BBC that IS remnants are \u201ccurrently contained by the Kurdish groups in the east, but if they go off the job, you can expect a serious spike in the threat posed to Europe by ISIS.\u201d",
      "Another problem is figuring out who's in charge.",
      "The opposition forces that stormed into Damascus and sent Assad fleeing to Russia are led by a group called Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, that originally was part of al-Qaida, but split a number of years ago. HTS is considered a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. and the United Nations.",
      "Its leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, has sought to reassure Syrians that the group is more moderate. U.S. officials say that while he may be saying some of the right things, they are adopting a wait-and-see attitude for now.",
      "White House national security spokesman, John Kirby, told CNN News Central on Monday that while HTS \u201cwas the vanguard\u201d they aren't the only opposition group involved.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to be working through all the processes we can, including at the U.N., to make sure that there is adequate communication with these opposition groups and that we are all working together,\" he said.",
      "Singh said she is not aware of any formal U.S. channel of communications with the group. But, she said, \u201cWe have other ways of getting messages through, you know, groups and other allies in the region.\u201d",

      "RENO, Nev. -- A probate commissioner has ruled against Rupert Murdoch\u2019s effort to change his family\u2019s trust to give one of his sons control of his media empire and ensure Fox News maintains its conservative editorial slant, according to a sealed document obtained by The New York Times.",
      "In a decision filed on Saturday, a probate commissioner in Nevada concluded that Murdoch, 93, and his son, Lachlan Murdoch, had acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d in their endeavor to amend the irrevocable trust, The New York Times reported on Monday.",
      "The trust divides control of the company equally among four of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s children \u2014 Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan and James \u2014 after he dies. Lachlan Murdoch has been the head of Fox News and News Corp since late last year, when his father stepped down.",
      "The elder Murdoch has argued that to preserve his businesses\u2019 commercial value for all his heirs, the trust must be changed to allow Lachlan Murdoch to maintain Fox News' conservative bent. James and Elisabeth Murdoch are both known to have less-conservative political views than their father or brother, potentially complicating efforts to ensure that Fox News remains conservative.",
      "In his 96-page opinion, Nevada Probate Commissioner Edmund J. Gorman Jr. of the Second Judicial District Court characterized the plan to change the trust as a \u201ccarefully crafted charade\u201d to \u201cpermanently cement Lachlan Murdoch\u2019s executive roles\u201d inside the empire \u201cregardless of the impacts such control would have over the companies or the beneficiaries\u201d of the family trust.",
      "Adam Streisand, a lawyer for Rupert Murdoch, told the newspaper that his client and his client's son were disappointed with the ruling and intended to appeal.",
      "A spokesperson for Prudence, Elisabeth and James Murdoch said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press that they welcome the ruling and hope that their family can \u201cmove beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members.\u201d",
      "Gorman in his conclusion said: \u201cThe effort was an attempt to stack the deck in Lachlan Murdoch\u2019s favor after Rupert Murdoch\u2019s passing so that his succession would be immutable. The play might have worked; but an evidentiary hearing, like a showdown in a game of poker, is where gamesmanship collides with the facts and at its conclusion, all the bluffs are called and the cards lie face up.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThe court, after considering the facts of this case in the light of the law, sees the cards for what they are and concludes this raw deal will not, over the signature of this probate commissioner, prevail.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The Biden administration has given approval for the sale of oil and gas leases in Alaska, leaving the door open for drilling in a portion of the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- The Biden administration has approved plans for a sale of oil and gas leases in Alaska that leaves open the door for drilling in a portion of the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.",
      "The sale will be held Jan. 9, less than two weeks before President Joe Biden leaves office. It will include a fraction of the land total that was available for bidding roughly four years ago in a sale held during the Trump administration.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump pledged during his latest run for the White House to expand oil drilling in the U.S., and he\u2019s pointed to the passage of a 2017 law that enabled Monday's announcement as a highlight when it comes to Alaska policy.",
      "The 2017 law mandated two lease sales by late 2024, but major oil companies sat out the first sale. The Biden administration reviewed the leasing program, and seven leases from the first sale ultimately were canceled.",
      "It\u2019s unclear. A lease sale is one step in a long process \u2014 one that can often get mired in litigation. There are ongoing lawsuits surrounding the first lease sale, and environmentalists have vowed to go to court to keep drilling out of the refuge.",
      "There are other examples, too: the Biden administration's approval of the large Willow oil project in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, west of the refuge, has yet to be settled in the courts, nearly two years after it got the green light to proceed. The company behind Willow, ConocoPhillips Alaska, has been continuing work on the project in the meantime.",
      "Once any leases are issued for the refuge, potential exploration or development plans would still have to undergo environmental review, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management has said.",
      "The law called for lease sales in the refuge's coastal plain, a roughly 1.5-million acre (more than 6 million hectare) swath of the vast, wild refuge that borders the Beaufort Sea. The coastal plain accounts for a small part of the refuge, which boasts an array of landscapes and provides habitat for wildlife including polar bears, caribou, musk ox and birds. Debate over whether to open the coastal plain to drilling has gone on for decades.",
      "Indigenous Gwich\u2019in leaders consider the coastal plain sacred, and caribou the Gwich\u2019in rely on calve there. Meanwhile, leaders of the I\u00f1upiaq community of Kaktovik, which is within the refuge, have supported drilling.",
      "The Bureau of Land Management said the area that would be available for lease next month calls for the smallest footprint of potential surface disturbance and avoids key polar bear denning and caribou calving areas. It would involve 400,000 acres (nearly 162,000 hectares), the minimum required by the 2017 law, the agency said. That compares to about 1.1 million acres (4.4 million hectares) included in the first sale.",
      "Bids in the first sale covered nearly 553,000 acres (about 224,000 hectares) the agency said at the time. Two of the leases were later given up by the small companies that held them amid legal wrangling and uncertainty over the drilling program. Seven leases that were acquired by a state corporation were canceled by the Biden administration. Litigation surrounding the lease cancellation is pending.",

      "Speaking at an event put on by the Halifax Chamber of Commerce, Trudeau also said dealing with Trump will be \u201ca little more challenging\u201d than the last time because Trump\u2019s team is coming in with a much clearer set of ideas of what they want to do right away than after his first election win in 2016.",
      "The U.S. president-elect has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs.",
      "\u201cTrump got elected on a commitment to make life better and more affordable for Americans, and I think people south of the border are beginning to wake up to the real reality that tariffs on everything from Canada would make life a lot more expensive,\" Trudeau said.",

      "\u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves in any way, shape or form, 25% tariffs on everything going to the United States would be devastating for the Canadian economy,\" Trudeau said.",
      "\u201cIt would also, however, mean real hardship for Americans as well. Americans import 65% of their crude oil from Canada, significant amounts of electricity. Just about all the natural gas exported from Canada goes to the United States. They rely on us for steel and aluminum. They rely on us for a range of agriculture imports. All of those things would get more expensive.\u201d",

      "Many of the U.S. products were chosen for their political rather than economic impact. For example, Canada imports just $3 million worth of yogurt from the U.S. annually and most of it comes from one plant in Wisconsin, the home state of then-Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan. That product was hit with a 10% duty.",
      "\u201cIt was the fact that we put tariffs on bourbon and Harley-Davidsons and playing cards and Heinz ketchup and cherries and a number of other things that were very carefully targeted because they were politically impactful to the president\u2019s party and colleagues,\u201d Trudeau said.",
      "Trudeau said when Trump says things he means them but they also know Trump is trying to insert uncertainty and \u201ca bit of chaos\u201d into democracies.",

Two dozen candidates have filed to run for the seats of outgoing Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz and Mike Waltz, though Trump has already weighed in on his preferred successors.",
      "Trump's reliance on Florida lawmakers for his new Cabinet is setting off a political chain reaction that\u2019s opening up new possibilities in the state in 2026 and beyond. Multiple sitting elected officials have filed to run for the congressional seats, including the state's chief financial officer Jimmy Patronis, triggering other vacancies and electoral opportunities.",
      "Both GOP congressmen easily won reelection to their respective seats in November, Gaetz in a northwest Florida district known for its sugar-sand beaches and military installations, and Waltz in a stretch of the state south of Jacksonville that includes Daytona Beach.",
      "The special elections to replace them aren't expected to change Republicans' slim majority in the House, but could trigger another shuffle among the state's political hopefuls eyeing a run for governor in 2026, as Gov. Ron DeSantis' second term winds down.",
      "Patronis is among those who Republican insiders say are considering a bid for governor, and a term in Congress could help boost his profile. Trump recently voiced his support for Patronis in the race to replace Gaetz in Congressional District 1, though that didn't dissuade the 15 other candidates who qualified to run, even in a district where Trump is overwhelmingly popular.",

The sole Democrat in the race is Gay Valimont, an activist for the gun control advocacy group Moms Demand Action who unsuccessfully challenged Gaetz in November.",
      "In the race for Waltz' seat in Congressional District 6, Republican State Rep. Randy Fine won Trump's endorsement. Fine is a self-described \u201cconservative firebrand\u201d who was investigated for allegations related to posting the phone number online of a school board member, which led to a wave of harassment and threats against her. No charges were filed against him.",
      "Eight other candidates have jumped in the race for the seat, including three Democrats and a candidate unaffiliated with a party \u2014 Randall Terry, an anti-abortion activist who ran as the Constitution Party's presidential nominee last month.",
      "Gaetz had been tapped to be Trump's attorney general, before stepping aside amid continued fallout over a federal sex trafficking investigation. Gaetz has vehemently denied the allegations. Though no longer under consideration, Gaetz had already resigned from his northwest Florida seat, a move that effectively ended a House Ethics Committee investigation into his alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.",
      "Trump named Waltz to be his national security advisor, though the three-term congressman and retired Army National Guard officer has also been floated as a nominee for defense secretary, as the president-elect considered possible replacements in the face of growing questions about former Fox News host Pete Hegseth's personal conduct and ability to win Senate confirmation.",

    "story": [
      "George Soros' philanthropy, Open Society Foundations, will continue to fund human rights movements around the world",
      "NEW YORK -- Despite years of internal turmoil and changes, Open Society Foundations wants those in the human rights sector to know their movements will still receive support from the organization, its president Binaifer Nowrojee said Tuesday.",
      "The foundations, founded by billionaire investor George Soros and now led by one of his sons, Alex Soros, have historically been one of the largest funders of human rights groups. But since 2021, they closed some of their programs and reduced their staff as part of a major internal reorganization.",
      "In the process, many grantees and others in the human rights movement have waited anxiously to see where the chips would fall.",
      "\u201cA reimagination has taken place under the leadership of the new board chair at Open Society Foundations,\u201d Nowrojee said, referring to Alex Soros.",
      "\u201cOne of the reasons that we wanted to really reiterate in a large way, with balloons, et cetera, that we are still committed to human rights, is because of this fear that\u2019s permeated with the changes that somehow Open Society Foundations is no longer going to be working on rights or equity or justice,\u201d she said in advance of Human Rights Day, which the United Nations observes on Dec. 10.",
      "Nowrojee offered few new details about OSF's specific funding priorities, though earlier this year, the foundations committed $400 million toward green jobs and economic development.",
      "Another new program focuses on protecting environmental defenders that will work in a few countries, like Colombia and the Democratic Republic of Congo and end after five years, said Sharan Srinvias, a director of programs at OSF.",
      "\u201cWe did a survey of what other donors are supporting and in general, we saw that this is where the gap is,\u201d he said of people who come under attack for defending land, water or other resources. \u201cEspecially bilateral donors find it much easier to support global organizations, who in turn are able to support prominent rights defenders in capital cities who are well known.\u201d",
      "One benefit of the limited time horizon, Srinvias said, is his team will mostly make grants of three or five years \u2014 longer than OSF's typical grants \u2014 and offer grantees more flexibility. It will also have some funds to respond to emergencies for human rights defenders all over the world.",
      "In 2020, OSF was the largest global human rights funder, giving out the most money overall and making the largest number of grants. That's according to the Human Rights Funders Network, a membership organization of grantmakers that tracks philanthropic funding for human rights groups.",
      "\u201cWhen major funders adjust their priorities, it can have a ripple effect. Their decisions can dramatically impact the human rights movements they once supported, especially in regions where they\u2019ve been a long-time champion,\u201d HRFN wrote in its most recent Advancing Human Rights report from September.",
      "To add to the atmosphere of uncertainty, another major human rights funder, Wellspring Philanthropic Fund, announced earlier this year that it would end its work by 2028.",
      "OSF's board aims to employ 600 people in total around the world, Nowrojee said, which is down from a reported 800 in 2021.",
      "Some of the changes OSF made in the last three years include winding down its global public health program and significantly diminishing its programs in the European Union. It spun off its area of work focused on Roma communities into a new organization and issued final grants to many of its partners.",
      "\u201cYou never want philanthropy to just be doing the same thing. You want philanthropy to be getting out of stuff,\u201d Nowrojee said. \u201cAnd so there\u2019s large areas of work where huge achievements were made, which we have retreated from, not because we don\u2019t think that there\u2019s value in them, but the movements themselves have strengthened.\u201d",
      "People who worked for OSF's public health program and some of their grantees have spoken about its impacts over almost three decades through an oral history project led by University of Southern California Institute on Inequalities in Global Health and funded by OSF.",
      "Jonathan Cohen, who led the OSF public health program and now holds positions at USC, told an interviewer with the oral history project about a decision in 2020 by OSF's leadership to take funding from its programs and reallocate it to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cThat claw-back in April should have been a sign, I think, to all of us that we were not long for this world,\u201d Cohen said, of the public health program. \"But of course, you don\u2019t accept that. You fight. You resist. You try to keep your program, which is what we did until we couldn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Among the movements that OSF had supported under its public health program was the the Network of Sex Work Projects, a global coalition of sex worker groups. It formed in 1992 in part in response to the killing of sex workers who had HIV, said Ruth Morgan Thomas, who was NSWP's global coordinator for many years, as part of the oral history project. She said she was saddened to see the closure of OSF's public health work.",
      "\u201cI hope as it reemerges and its global strategy reemerges, it will retain its stance and support for promoting the realization of sex workers\u2019 rights and inclusion in our societies,\u201d she said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. prosecutors are accusing two senior Syrian officials of overseeing a notorious prison that tortured peaceful protesters and other political prisoners, including a 26-year-old American woman who was later believed to have been executed.",
      "The indictment was unsealed Monday, two days after a shock rebel offensive overthrew Syrian President Bashar Assad. The U.S., U.N. and others accuse him of widespread human rights abuses in a 13-year battle to crush opposition forces seeking his removal from power.",
      "The war, which began as a largely nonviolent popular uprising in 2011, has killed half a million people.",
      "The indictment, filed Nov. 18 in federal court in Chicago, is believed to be the U.S. government's first against what officials say were networks of Assad intelligence services and military branches and other allied groups that detained, tortured and killed thousands of perceived enemies.",
      "It names Jamil Hassan, director of the Syrian air force's intelligence branch, who prosecutors say oversaw a prison and torture center at the Mezzeh air force base in the capital, Damascus, and Abdul Salam Mahmoud, who prosecutors say ran the prison.",
      "The indictment charges the two with conspiring to commit cruel and inhuman treatment of civilian detainees during the course of the Syrian civil war. Detainees at the prison were whipped, kicked, electrocuted, burned and subjected to other mental and physical abuse, including being housed in cells alongside corpses of dead detainees, prosecutors allege.",
      "Victims included Syrians, Americans and dual citizens, the indictment said. The U.S.-based Syrian Emergency Task Force has long pushed federal prosecutors for action on the cases, including that of 26-year-old American aid worker Layla Shweikani.",
      "The group presented witnesses who testified of Shweikani's 2016 torture at the prison. Syrian rights groups believe she was later executed at the Saydnaya military prison in the Damascus suburbs.",
      "\u201cNow it is our time to capture these criminals and bring them to the United States for trial,\u201d the Syrian Emergency Task Force said in a statement Monday. The group's leader, Mouaz Moustafa, said his relatives were among those tortured at the prison.",
      "Federal prosecutors said they had issued arrest warrants for the two officials, who remain at large.",
      "Prospects of bringing them to trial were unclear. Assad's toppling by the rebels over the weekend has scattered his government and left citizens searching prison torture centers around the country for survivors and evidence."

      "One of England's top-rated water companies is using an accounting trick to artificially inflate its balance sheet by more than a billion pounds, BBC Panorama has discovered.",
      "Severn Trent Water claims that an investment is worth \u00a31.68bn in its accounts, when in reality it has no value to the overall business.",
      "The made-up money makes the company appear more financially robust and helps to support its bumper payouts to shareholders.",
      "Severn Trent denies the accounts are misleading and says Panorama's allegations are \"completely inaccurate\".",
      "The water company - which is regulated by Ofwat - is part of a complex web of companies in the wider Severn Trent plc group.",
      "It serves more than eight million people across central England and mid-Wales and has been awarded the Environment Agency's top four-star rating for environmental performance for a record five consecutive years. Its ultimate parent company, Severn Trent plc, is popular with investors, as it has consistently paid large dividends to shareholders.",
      "But some of Severn Trent's customers are unhappy. The Shrewsbury-based campaign group Up Sewage Creek wants more of the company's earnings to be used to combat pollution in local rivers. \"They've not updated the infrastructure, they've used our money to enrich themselves and enrich their shareholders,\" one of the campaigners told us.",
      "The complex accounting trick started in March 2017 when a shell company, with no money or assets, called Severn Trent Trimpley was set up as part of the group. Another Severn Trent company called Severn Trent Draycote - which owns the water company - agreed to buy Trimpley for \u00a32.",
      "Trimpley then issued additional shares and Draycote bought them for a staggering \u00a33bn.",
      "No money actually changed hands, however, as Draycote paid Trimpley with a \u00a33bn loan note - effectively an IOU. But, on paper, Trimpley immediately appeared to be worth \u00a33bn because it had the IOU.",
      "Severn Trent Water then acquired 49% of Trimpley - and that investment was valued in the water company's accounts at \u00a31.47bn. A hugely valuable asset appears to have been created for Severn Trent Water out of thin air.",
      "Panorama discovered the Trimpley investment through the work of retired auditor Stanley Root.",
      "He told the programme: \"This is as near to an unreal transaction as you can get - that has just been made up and put into the accounts to make the accounts look better.",
      "\"I think it misleads the reader to think that the net assets of Severn Trent Water Limited are higher than they are and that the company is in a much healthier position than it really is. So I think the balance sheet, the financial statements, are misleading.\"",
      "Since 2017, the made-up money on Severn Trent Water's books has grown in value because of interest payments.",
      "Draycote has agreed to pay Trimpley interest on the \u00a33bn IOU, which means the IOU gets bigger each year.",
      "As the value of the IOU goes up, so does the paper value of Trimpley. And that means Severn Trent Water's investment in Trimpley rises every year too.",
      "The Trimpley investment is now valued at \u00a31.68bn in the regulated water company's 2023/24 accounts.",
      "Those accounts were audited and signed off by Severn Trent Water's directors. When referring to the Trimpley investment, the accounts say: \"In the opinion of the directors the fair value of the company's investments are not less than the amount at which they are stated in the balance sheet.\"",
      "While that may be technically correct, the \u00a31.68bn value is based on an IOU that is ultimately backed up by Severn Trent Water itself.",
      "In the wider group accounts the made-up money is cancelled out by the IOU that Draycote issued, so it is only the balance sheet of the regulated water company, Severn Trent Water, that is inflated.",
      "So why do it? Severn Trent told the BBC that Trimpley was set up to allow the water company to legitimately account for future earnings, but that it has never been used for that purpose.",
      "Another possible explanation is that Trimpley helps support increased dividends.",
      "As well as bolstering the balance sheet, the made-up \u00a31.68bn has also been added to Severn Trent Water's retained earnings - that is the pot of money from which cash can be paid out to shareholders. The more money there is in that pot, the easier it is to justify large dividends.",
      "Since Trimpley was added to the accounts in 2017, Severn Trent Water Ltd has paid out \u00a31.615bn in dividends.",
      "Profits over the same period were \u00a31.246bn, so Severn Trent Water has paid out \u00a3369m more than it made in profit during that period. It looks like cash is being drained from the regulated water company.",
      "Auditor Stanley Root says water companies are under great pressure to pay substantial dividends and the Trimpley scheme helps Severn Trent Water deliver.",
      "\"It makes the company's balance sheet look more stable than it really is. It gives them the appearance of financial resilience. It helps to support the dividend payments they're making.\"",
      "Severn Trent denies that Trimpley has supported shareholder payouts: \"All dividends paid by Severn Trent are justified by earnings and any assertion otherwise is unjustified and wrong.\"",
      "However, it is clear that Trimpley is having a dramatic effect on the pot of money from which shareholders can be paid.",
      "Severn Trent Water's 2023/24 accounts - which include the \u00a31.68bn investment - report the company has very healthy retained earnings of \u00a31.84bn.",
      "But the accounts for the wider Severn Trent Group, where all the creative accounting is cancelled out, show retained earnings of just \u00a37.9m.",
      "Severn Trent says: \"Trimpley is an entirely legitimate, legal and transparent structure.\"",
      "Its accounts are independently audited and \"any suggestion that we have misled our investors, regulators and customers on the company's finances is false\".",
      "It says the IOU is \"very much a real asset\" as it is backed up by other group companies.",

    "story": [
      "A real-life \"Succession\" battle for Rupert Murdoch's media empire has ended with a Nevada court commissioner denying the billionaire's bid to change a family trust and give control to his eldest son.",
      "The case pitted the 93-year-old against three of his children over who would gain the power to control News Corp and Fox News when he dies.",
      "It has been reported that Mr Murdoch wanted to amend a family trust created in 1999 to allow his son Lachlan to take control without \"interference\" from his siblings Prudence, Elisabeth and James.",
      "A Nevada commissioner ruled Mr Murdoch and Lachlan had acted in \"bad faith\" and called the efforts a \"carefully crafted charade\", according to the New York Times.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for Prudence, Elisabeth and James said: \"We welcome Commissioner Gorman's decision and hope that we can move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members.\"",
      "Adam Streisand, a lawyer for Mr Murdoch, told the New York Times they were disappointed and planned to appeal.",
      "A spokesperson for Mr Murdoch declined to comment to the BBC. Mr Streisand did not immediately respond to inquiries.",
      "The famous family was one of the inspirations behind the hugely popular TV series Succession - something the Murdochs have always refused to comment on.",
      "But according to the New York Times report, which is based on a copy of the sealed court ruling, the billionaire's children had started discussing their father's death and how they would handle it after an episode of the HBO series where \"the patriarch of the family dies, leaving his family and business in chaos\".",
      "The episode led to Elisabeth's representative to the trust writing a \"'Succession' memo\" that sought to prevent this from happening in real life, said reports.",
      "The case has played out behind closed doors in Nevada, a state that offers one of the most confidential legal settings for matters including family trust disputes.",
      "It has a \"close on demand\" statute that allows parties involved in certain sensitive cases to request that court proceedings be sealed from public access, ensuring complete privacy.",
      "Mr Murdoch, who has been married five times, also has two younger children, Grace and Chloe, who do not have any voting rights under the trust agreement.",
      "The case was launched after Mr Murdoch decided to change the trust over worries about a \"lack of consensus\" among the children, the Times reported.",
      "Lachan is thought to be more conservative than his siblings and would preserve the legacy of his media brands.",
      "From the 1960s, Mr Murdoch built a global media giant with major political and public influence.",
      "His two companies are News Corporation, which owns newspapers including the Times and the Sun in the UK and the Wall Street Journal in the US, and Fox, which broadcasts Fox News.",
      "Mr Murdoch had been preparing his two sons to follow in his footsteps, beginning when they were teenagers, journalist Andrew Neil told the 2020 BBC documentary The Rise of the Murdoch Dynasty.",
      "\"Family has always been very important to Rupert Murdoch, particularly from the point of view of forming a dynasty,\" the former Sunday Times editor said.",
      "In 1999, the Murdoch Family Trust, which owns the media companies, was supposed to largely settle the succession plans.",
      "It led to Mr Murdoch giving his eldest children various jobs within his companies.",
      "The trust gives the family eight votes, which it can use to have a say on the board of News Corp and Fox News. Mr Murdoch currently controls four of those votes, with his eldest children being in charge of one each.",
      "The trust agreement said that once Mr Murdoch died, his votes would be passed on to his four eldest children equally.",
      "However, differences in opinions and political views were said to lead to a family rift.",
      "The battle over changes to the trust was not about money, but rather power and control over the future of the Murdoch empire.",
      "The commissioner's ruling is not final. The court filing acts as a recommended resolution but a district judge will still weigh in and could choose to rule differently.",

      "In prior cases when the US has imposed export controls, it has only delayed not stopped the other country's ability to gain access to the technology, Mr Lewis said, adding that he was skeptical that the AI at the heart of the dispute was as game-changing as the two sides contend.",

      "Lenders and dealers have been accused of hiding commission payments made when cars were bought on finance deals.",

      "As MPs prepare to quiz the boss of the financial regulator over its role, there seems to be an industry consensus that only the highest court in the land should settle this affair.",
      "That, were it to happen, could put payouts in greater doubt, or at least delay them for many months.",
      "Mr Johnson from Cwmbran, Torfaen in south Wales was aged 27 when he was on the lookout for his first car in 2017.",
      "He had been cycling to and from his job as a factory supervisor. He and his fiancee, now wife, Kirsty, were taking buses and taxis to visit family and friends after they had moved home.",
      "Buying a car made sense. So too did going to a dealership whose advert he \"heard 10 to 15 times every day\" on the radio at work.",
      "He took the Suzuki for a test drive, decided to buy it and paid a deposit.",
      "\"I thought it was a financially sound decision to get a newer car, so it would have fewer problems,\" he says.",
      "'Ridiculous' commission",
      "Mr Johnson earned just over \u00a313,000 a year, so finance involved a hire-purchase agreement and an extra personal loan.",
      "He was unaware that the finance provider would pay the dealer a commission of \u00a31,650 - about a quarter of the amount he borrowed.",
      "\"I had always thought that car dealerships made their money by making a profit on the cars that they sell rather than by arranging finance,\" he said in his witness statement.",
      "Later, he spotted a post on Facebook prompting him to fill in a claim form about such a deal. After discussion with a lawyer, he says he realised that that commission was \"ridiculous\".",
      "\"I had no idea before then. Commission as part of the industry is not necessarily a bad thing,\" he says. \"But it was kept out of sight. If they are deceiving customers then, to me, that's disgusting.\"",
      "His case went to court. He says he almost missed the date after the notification went into his email junk folder. He lost.",

      "What's behind car finance mis-selling complaints?",
      "Motorists who bought cars on finance could share in billions",

      "\"And lots of people who did not have the money to buy a car were ripped off,\" he says.",
      "Wider impact",
      "The judges' decision was a win for the trio, but - more significantly - opened the door for claims from many, many more motorists.",
      "In the conclusions of a clear, 46-page judgement are three even clearer words: \"fully informed consent\".",
      "They ruled it would be illegal for the lender to pay any commission to the dealer without the fully informed consent of the buyer.",
      "In other words, customers should be told clearly how much commission would be paid, and agree to it, without those details being buried in the terms and conditions of the loan.",
      "Bearing in mind that something like 80% or 90% of cars are bought on finance - that is about two million vehicles a year, then the potential for many deals past and present failing that test is high.",
      "Analysts have suggested millions of buyers could each receive hundreds of pounds in compensation. Estimates of the total bill are up to \u00a330bn.",

      "Did the FCA go far enough?",
      "In 2021, the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender, based on the interest rate charged to the customer. It said this provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a rate that was higher than necessary.",
      "By banning these so-called discretionary commission arrangements, it declared it would save drivers \u00a3165m a year.",
      "Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.",
      "However, it didn't decide to ban commissions or fees on a wider scale, or stipulate how dealers should disclose they were receiving payments from lenders.",
      "It may now face the ire of motorists who say it should have done more to protect them, as well as lenders and dealers who feel the regulator gave them the green light to carry on paying commission in the same way.",
      "It is planning to extend the time dealers have to deal with complaints.",
      "It wants any mass compensation, should that come to pass, to be administered in an orderly fashion. The nature of any such redress is currently uncertain.",

      "Hartmut Neven leads Google's Quantum AI lab that created Willow and describes himself as the project's \"chief optimist.\"",
      "He told the BBC that Willow would be used in some practical applications - but declined, for now, to provide more detail.",
      "But a chip able to perform commercial applications would not appear before the end of the decade, he said.",
      "Initially these applications would be the simulation of systems where quantum effects are important",

      "What is quantum computing?",

      "Mr Neven told the BBC Willow's performance meant it was the \"best quantum processor built to date\".",

      "He warns against overstating the importance of Willow's achievement in a single test.",
      "\"One has to be careful not to compare apples and oranges\" he told the BBC.",

      "In very simple terms the more useful a quantum computer is, the more qubits it has.",
      "However a major problem with the technology is that it is prone to errors - a tendency that has previously increased the more qubits a chip has.",
      "But Google researchers say they have reversed this and managed to engineer and program the new chip so the error rate fell across the whole system as the number of qubits increased.",
      "It was a major \"breakthrough\" that cracked a key challenge that the field had pursued \"for almost 30 years\", Mr Neven believes.",
      "He told the BBC it was comparable to \"if you had an airplane with just one engine -  that will work, but two engines are safer, four engines is yet safer\".",
      "Errors are a significant obstacle in creating more powerful quantum computers and the development was \"encouraging for everyone striving to build a practical quantum computer\" Prof Woodward said.",

      "They wrote asking for my help, as they knew I had investigated a similar case.",
      "I managed to track down Sandie, Carole's cousin.",
      "Together we paid a visit to Carole's care home in the Hertfordshire town of Rickmansworth.",
      "Carole told us she was desperate to leave, but was stuck there. She said she had been introduced to Ron Hiller at the care home, and he had convinced her to grant him lasting power of attorney over her finances.",
      "Most people appoint family members to be their attorney but for Carole, this had not been an option. Her closest relative was Sandie - however, she lived about a 100-mile drive away and suffered from serious health problems.",
      "A property and finance LPA can be activated as soon as it is registered. Carole told us she had been in a lot of pain when she arrived at the care home, and her LPA shows\u00a0she agreed to grant these powers to Mr Hiller straight away.",
      "Since that point, she had been without her bank cards and had received no statements. She was also in the dark about how much she was paying Mr Hiller to manage her finances.",
      "She had wanted to call Hazel and Bert, but Mr Hiller had given her a new phone that didn't contain any of her old contacts.",
      "Carole told us he had advised her to sell her house in order to pay the care home fees, then later told her it had fetched a low price because nobody had wanted to buy in her area.",
      "As we sat talking, Sandie looked at her phone and discovered the house was on the market again. This time, the asking price was almost \u00a3100,000 more than when Mr Hiller had sold it for Carole.",
      "After meeting Carole in the care home, Sandie asked for detailed accounts from Craybeck Law.",
      "What came was a slow drip-feed of bank statements, with no real explanation of Mr Hiller's charges and hardly any receipts.",
      "However, they did show that large sums of money had been taken from Carole's account. Her bank card had been used to make a series of \u00a3300 cash withdrawals from ATMs in the Essex town of South Benfleet, near Mr Hiller's office.",
      "He told Sandie that Carole had authorised the withdrawals - but later, when Carole asked to see invoices, they were not produced.",
      "The statements also showed a charge for arranging for Carole's house to be cleared. I later discovered the work was given to Silverback Commerical Removals, and that the director of this firm was David James Hiller - the son of Ron Hiller.",
      "Craybeck Law denied there was any conflict of interest and said the decision to use Silverback was reached after quotes were sought from alternative providers. Carole has no record of these.",
      "I heard a similar story about house sales a few miles away in Watford.",
      "Ron Hiller was appointed to oversee the finances of an elderly woman called Elizabeth - her house had been sold for \u00a3350,000 after she went to live in a care home.",
      "It was then left empty and sold on a few months later for \u00a3525,000 - without any signs that improvements had taken place.",
      "Craybeck Law said it would not comment on individual cases but told us that the properties it handled were often in poor condition and that sometimes they needed to be sold quickly to cover care home fees, and \"to avoid the risk of a sale falling through\".",
      "Under pressure?",
      "Many of the people I spoke to, felt Ron Hiller had put them under pressure to appoint him as attorney.",
      "Some also told me they had been introduced to him by care professionals, who had led them to believe he was a qualified solicitor.",
      "On the website for Craybeck Law, Ron Hiller is described as a partner in the firm's elder client division. However, the letters after his name - MCICM - denote a diploma in credit management and debt collection.",
      "There is no mention of Ron Hiller on the official register of qualified solicitors either.",
      "A spokesperson for Craybeck Law denied Mr Hiller had ever given the impression he was a qualified solicitor. They added that changes to the law in 2008 meant that individuals who were not qualified solicitors were permitted to become partners in law firms.",
      "In the Hertfordshire town of Letchworth, a woman called Petra told me how an NHS social worker called Margaret Falegan had brought Mr Hiller to her house during a professional visit.",
      "Petra suffers from anxiety and had previously told Ms Falegan - whom she described as her mental health nurse - that she was having trouble with her bills.",
      "She felt she was being put \"very much\" under pressure to grant Mr Hiller power of attorney, even though she felt uneasy about him.",
      "The next day, she went to her local Citizens Advice Bureau and - with the help of the staff there - suspended the process.",
      "A few weeks later, she received a letter from Mr Hiller. It read: \"I've informed the mental health team, Stevenage, of your decision, as this may impact on the level of support they may have planned to provide you in the future.\"",
      "Whatever Mr Hiller had meant by this, Petra read it as a threat. She told me she was still upset about the letter months later, and it had destroyed her trust in the mental health team.",
      "I have heard of other cases where Margaret Falegan introduced Mr Hiller to potential clients in the course of her professional duties. In one, the appointment was made in spite of objections from the man's relatives that he had dementia and did not understand what he was signing.",
      "When I approached Ms Falegan for a response, she denied putting pressure on her clients to sign with Mr Hiller. However, she did not say whether her employer, Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (HPUFT), knew that he had accompanied her on client visits.",
      "In response to my findings, HPUFT said it had now launched an investigation into Ms Falegan, as well as other social workers who had introduced Ron Hiller to clients. The trust said it had also raised the matter with the appropriate professional bodies and the police.",
      "\"If an NHS or care worker is making introductions between their clients and potential attorneys that is very concerning,\" says consultant psychiatrist James Warner.",
      "\"If [elderly or vulnerable people] don't have the ability to decide who they want to appoint as their attorneys, they shouldn't be appointing attorneys.\"",
      "Craybeck Law said that when a potential client was introduced to the firm, a qualified individual - usually a social worker - would have a discussion with that person, to ensure they had the mental capacity to make the decision to appoint the firm as their attorney.",
      "They said this would take place without a Craybeck Law representative present.",
      "It also said the firm had processes to ensure that no individual felt coerced into signing powers of attorney.",
      "Wills",
      "In several of the cases I looked at, Craybeck Law - and chiefly Ron Hiller - not only acted as attorney but also executor of clients' wills.",
      "An executor is legally responsible for carrying out the instructions in a person's will and handling their estate.",
      "However, in at least two cases, Mr Hiller seems to have ignored the instructions he was given. One client was surprised when I told her that the will he had drawn up for her split her estate between four charities - including one she had never heard of.",
      "Another client told me he had not seen a copy of a will Mr Hiller had drawn up for him, and did not understand its contents.",
      "Valerie in Borehamwood also appointed Mr Hiller as attorney and executor of her will. After she died in 2022, it emerged that her family had been left out of her will and her entire estate - estimated at about \u00a3220,000 - was left to a police charity.",
      "Her brother and sister-in-law, John and Kaye, live in Australia and were not well-placed to challenge the will. The fact that family members were no longer beneficiaries also meant they were not entitled to any financial information.",
      "\"We couldn't see how much [Ron Hiller] was charging for probate or how much he charged every year for being her power of attorney,\" Kaye told me.",
      "Ann Stanyer, a leading lawyer in this field, told me that if an attorney is also the executor of a will, there is much less scope for proper scrutiny: \"They can both operate the powers of attorney during their lifetime and take fees through that, but they can then take big fees from the estate as well.\"",
      "Craybeck Law said that the firm was governed by the Solicitors Regulation Authority's (SRA) rules and principles, including strict conduct and ethical guidelines that it upheld.",
      "It said that much of what had been put to it was inaccurate and based on second- or third-hand hearsay and that it fully refuted the insinuations made about the way it supported its clients.",
      "The SRA has now confirmed it is looking into allegations made in this article.",
      "Moving on",
      "Carole has now moved out of the care home in Rickmansworth, and into a small flat in Folkestone near her cousin Sandy.",
      "She has the added work and expense of buying all the basics for her new home, because Ron Hiller disposed of all her furniture and most of her possessions.",
      "However, she is happy to be making a fresh start.",
      "Her story, and the others in this article, were only a few of those I heard about Ron Hiller. He has acted as attorney for scores of people - a fact that Ann Stanyer finds odd.",
      "\"You've got to run [LPA] properly and you can't possibly do that if you've got volumes of these things,\" she says. \"I have four or five which are active and that's more than enough.\"",
      "The Office of the Public Guardian doesn't appear to track when an attorney has an unusually large number of clients. A former senior judge at the Court of Protection, Denzil Lush, is concerned that the OPG is not designed to spot potential problems with the system.",
      "For instance, if an attorney's powers are revoked by more than one of their clients, the OPG does not automatically look at why this is happening.",
      "The issue has caught the attention of Parliament - a private members bill, which has gone to its second reading, proposes greater safeguards.",
      "Many MPs feel it is an urgent problem because of the sheer numbers involved. More than eight million people in England and Wales have now registered an attorney to act for them.",
      "The system was designed to protect elderly and vulnerable people, but the danger is that without better safeguards, it could be leaving them open to harm.",

      "It effectively keeps NI inside the EU's single market for goods.",
      "That means that the goods trade across the border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU country, has remained undisturbed by Brexit.",
      "The flipside is that goods arriving from elsewhere in the UK are subject to controls and checks\u2014what is known as the Irish Sea border.",
      "Michael and Lesley Cairnduff, who run a County Down-based pet food business, said the paperwork needed was \"crucifying\" small business like theirs.",
      "Border control post",
      "At Larne Harbour the sea border continues to take physical form, with a new border control post under construction.",
      "Before Brexit, livestock arriving from other parts of the UK was checked here, but this new facility, built to EU specifications, is much bigger.",
      "Businesses have been dealing with new checks and their related bureaucracy since 2021, when the original version of the framework, the Northern Ireland Protocol, began to be implemented.",
      "For many larger firms, the impacts have now mostly been digested.",
      "They have, at a cost, hired the people and put the processes in place to ensure goods keep flowing from GB.",
      "The major UK supermarkets are all still in NI and some continue to expand.",
      "A chief executive of one large agrifood firm told the BBC that the sea border now rarely features in discussions within the business.",
      "However, for smaller firms with fewer resources the sea border remains an unpredictable challenge.",
      "The BBC first spoke to Michael and Lesley Cairnduff at their pet food business in Newcastle, County Down, in 2021.",
      "At that time they had gone around four months without being able to get their supplies across from GB in the normal way, on a commercially shipped pallet.",
      "Their supplier adapted and the goods were able to flow again.",
      "\"We were lucky they were supportive,\" said Mr Cairnduff. \"They put all the necessary measures in place.\"",
      "However, dealing with sea border issues still consumes a huge amount of time.",
      "\"We're just not getting the support from the system nor the politicians that was promised,\" he said.",
      "Ms Cairnduff added: \"Yesterday I spent two hours working on problems for a pallet coming in. I shouldn't have to do that. We should be spending our time helping customers, not doing paperwork for pallets.\"",
      "Supply chains",
      "In the early days of the sea border's operation, there were some apocalyptic predictions of collapsing supply chains.",
      "That didn't happen, partially because the deal as originally agreed was never implemented.",
      "The EU eventually accepted that the arrangements for moving food and medicines were going to be unworkable and that NI would have to stay closer to some UK rules.",
      "If there was no sea border bust, then there has been no sea border boom either.",
      "The Windsor Framework means NI has unique dual market access: NI-based manufacturers have better access to the EU single market than firms based in GB, while also retaining full access to the UK market.",
      "It is this arrangement which led the former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to describe NI as having an \"unbelievably special position\" and being \"the world's most exciting economic zone\".",
      "The theory is that any international manufacturer that wants to serve both the UK and EU should set up in NI.",
      "However, the chief executive of NI's inward investment agency, Invest NI, says that hasn't happened yet.",
      "Speaking at Stormont in October, Kieran Donoghue said: \"There is still a relatively low level of awareness of the opportunities presented by dual market access.",
      "\"There will, in time, be foreign direct investment opportunities.\"",
      "Stuart Anderson from the NI Chamber of Commerce said it was important to remember that the framework is protecting supply chains which cross the land border, particularly in the highly integrated agrifood sector.",
      "He points to the Department of Economy projections in 2019, which suggested a no-deal Brexit would mean \"a material and sustained disruption\" to those supply chains.",
      "\"Four years on, that's not where we are. The framework has brought the certainty and stability to allow that free flow of trade,\" he said.",
      "\"Some of our members who are exporting to the Republic and further into Europe are taking advantage.\"",
      "Last week a senior executive at one of NI's biggest manufacturing exporters told Newstalk radio that the Windsor Framework had helped protect access to EU markets.",
      "Robin Black, head of strategic development at Brett Martin, said it meant that \"in most regards nothing has changed for us as an exporter which is fantastic news, particularly with all our European markets\".",
      "However, Mr Anderson said that while surveys of his members suggest that most are now finding it manageable, a \"significant minority\" are saying the arrangements remain \"an acute challenge\".",
      "It can be hard to see the impact of the sea border in Northern Ireland's economic statistics.",
      "It is most obvious in the trade data, which shows business between the two parts of the island at a record high.",
      "This suggests that some products which NI businesses or consumers were getting from GB are now coming from Ireland or the wider EU.",
      "Official data suggests that NI has had a significantly better recovery from the pandemic than the UK average.",
      "However, that growth has come almost entirely from the services sector, which is not covered by the Windsor Framework.",
      "By contrast, manufacturing output has been flat, with energy costs, skills shortages, and disruptions to global trade seemingly more significant than the benefits of dual market access.",
      "If, as seems likely, the assembly votes for the Windsor Framework to remain, businesses will continue to grapple with the sea border.",
      "At the end of this week we will see that a border is not a fixed and stable set of arrangements.",
      "An update in EU product safety rules, which apply in NI, means some businesses in GB face new rules when selling to Northern Ireland.",

      "\"Jaguar has no desire to be loved by everybody,\" said Gerry McGovern as he strode across the stage on a slightly chilly evening in Miami last week. It was a bold statement from Jaguar Land Rover's creative director, but it summed up the aura around the relaunch of one of the UK's most famous brands.",
      "On 18 November, a short teaser ad was released that ignited social media. Lasting just 30 seconds, it showed models in bizarre and brightly coloured outfits but did not feature a single car.",
      "The New York Post described it as \"the latest example of idiotic and woke corporate virtue signalling\". Elon Musk took a dig on X, asking Jaguar's official account: \"Do you sell cars?\"",
      "Then came the actual launch at a Miami art fair. Mr McGovern stood on stage beside two cars, resplendent in \"Miami Pink\" and \"London Blue\" shades. Both were examples of Jaguar's new Type 00 \u2013 a concept car that won't ever go on sale, but is meant to showcase the brand's plans for the future. Angular, aggressive, with a huge bonnet and more than a hint of Batmobile, the new design also polarised opinions.",
      "\"Even Gen Z hate the new 'woke' Jaguar!\" declared the Daily Mail. \"Mark my words, Jaguar will go bust,\" Reform Party leader Nigel Farage predicted on X. But the former Top Gear presenter James May told the BBC that the fact the ad was being talked about so widely has \"got to be a bit of a result for Jaguar, hasn't it\"?",
      "Jaguar's managing director Rawdon Glover also hit back, insisting the company needed to be \"bold and disruptive\" in order to get its message across.",
      "But some insiders argue that Jaguar's problems run deeper than a five-minute frenzy on social media.",
      "A 'steady road to nowhere'",
      "Even before the furore over the advert, \"the brand was on a steady road to nowhere\", argues Matthias Schmidt, founder of industry intelligence firm Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "\"The traditional Jaguar demographic was slowly being diluted through natural attrition and customers jumping ship to other brands.\"",
      "So, the publicity that the ad and the launch have drawn appear to have been welcomed within the business.",
      "As Gerry McGovern drily quipped from the stage: \"We're delighted to have your attention.\"",
      "Controversy, he added, had always surrounded British creativity when it was at its best.",
      "Behind all the noise, what is happening at Jaguar is pretty simple. It is being re-launched as an all-electric brand as part of a major restructuring at JLR, instigated by its parent company, the Indian conglomerate Tata.",
      "Jaguar's current models, including the I-Pace, the E-Pace and the F-Type, are no longer being sold in the UK. Instead, the first of a new generation of cars will hit the road in 2026.",
      "Alongside this transition to battery power comes a move upmarket, with the new models expected to cost upwards of \u00a3100,000.",
      "The reasons for doing all this are twofold. Firstly, Jaguar has been struggling to sell enough cars or to make enough money. Secondly, JLR needs to build more electric cars to satisfy regulators, who are working to phase out the sale of new petrol and diesel models.",
      "Steve McQueen and the glory days",
      "It's a far cry from the brand's glory days, when the E-Type placed Jaguar firmly at the heart of swinging-sixties British cool. Steve McQueen owned one. So did Frank Sinatra. Peter Sellers gave one to his wife, Swedish superstar Britt Ekland. George Best, who knew a thing or two about fast cars and a fast lifestyle, had several.",
      "But for decades, the stereotype of a Jaguar buyer has been a well-to-do company boss - almost certainly male, with expensive cufflinks and a set of golf clubs in the boot. Not so long ago he might have been seen smoking a cigar as well.",
      "That might be a little unfair on Jaguar. It has has clearly tried to appeal to female buyers and to families, with offerings such as the F-Pace. Nicknamed the \"She-Type\", this was praised by Good Housekeeping magazine after its launch for its seats designed with women in mind.",
      "But Jaguar continues to be perceived by many as a supplier of upmarket exec-mobiles - and this is a segment of the market where competition is fierce.",
      "\"They've been chasing BMW and Audi sales for years and despite some decent cars have struggled to be profitable,\" explains Rachel Burgess, magazine editor at Autocar.",
      "\"Now, they're trying to target the likes of Bentley and Porsche, looking at high net-worth individuals, who would be spending far more on a car than the level at which Jaguars used to be priced.\"",
      "A long-brewing reinvention",
      "The reinvention of Jaguar has been brewing for many years. Tata bought the brand from Ford in 2008, following nearly two decades under American ownership. During that period, Ford invested significant sums and overhauled its manufacturing and quality control processes. But it failed to make the business profitable and, at the height of the global financial crisis, put Jaguar up for sale.",
      "After taking control of both Jaguar and Land Rover, Tata merged the two into JLR: that brought stability and removed immediate doubts over Jaguar's future.",
      "But while JLR has performed relatively well over the past decade, despite the downturn caused by the Covid pandemic, it is the part of the business that used to be Land Rover that has been driving recent growth.",
      "This has been largely thanks to strong demand for luxury SUVs in markets such as North America and China, as well as in the UK.",
      "In April, the company reported an increase in annual sales across its Range Rover, Defender and Discovery brands of nearly 25%, helping to drive revenues and profits up across the business. Jaguar's sales did rise as well \u2013 by 7%. But that came after five years of steady decline.",
      "In the 2018-19 financial year, Jaguar sold more than 180,000 vehicles. In 2023-24, the figure was 66,866 \u2013 a relatively small proportion of JLRs overall sales of 431,737.",
      "By 2021, other pressures were mounting on JLR, not least the introduction of increasingly stringent environmental rules in the UK and the EU. At the time, JLR had only one electric model in its line-up, the I-Pace.",
      "In February 2021, JLR's chief executive Thierry Bollor\u00e9 announced a new strategy: a wholesale revamp of its range, with all models to become available in electric form by the end of the decade. But crucially, he said Jaguar would be \"re-imagined\" as an all-electric brand.",
      "Although Mr Bollor\u00e9 would leave at the end of the following year, his plan was picked up by his successor, Adrian Mardell \u2013 who promised the company would invest \u00a315bn to turn it into reality.",
      "Within JLR, there is widespread recognition that something had to change.",
      "Fewer cars, bigger profit margins",
      "\"Jaguar's performance over the past 10 years has been challenging,\" Rawdon Glover admitted in a previous BBC interview. He pointed out that Jaguar had been trying to succeed in a high-volume market, where the bigger players can keep their costs down through economies of scale.",
      "\"While our vehicles were highly competent, and critically acclaimed, actually the ability to commercially succeed in that environment was challenging,\" he said.",
      "The move upmarket, in theory at least, gives Jaguar the opportunity to sell fewer cars, but with much bigger profit margins.",
      "\"I'm fully in agreement that they had to do something,\" says Andy Palmer, an industry veteran and former CEO of Aston Martin who has also been a leading executive at Nissan.",
      "\"But it's very brave to be planning to walk away from 85% of your customer base. They are going to have to find new customers to replace them. And acquisition of new customers is always more expensive than retaining existing ones.\"",
      "The big question, though, is whether the changes being made are the correct ones.",
      "'Like a luxury hotel that doesn't refurbish'",
      "Arguably, one of the reasons why Jaguar's rebrand has attracted such attention is because although relatively few people buy the actual cars, the name itself still resonates with cultural significance, thanks to a heritage going back more than seven decades.",
      "In its early days, under founder Sir William Lyons, Jaguar was truly innovative, and it knew how to grab attention. In 1948, it launched the XK120, an elegant two-seater sports car with swooping lines and a powerful six-cylinder engine. As the name implied, it had a top speed of 120mph, making it the world's fastest production car at the time.",
      "In a country still recovering from the ravages of World War Two, this was a revelation. Jaguar had originally planned to build just 200, but demand was so high, it ended up making more than 12,000.",
      "Victories in motorsport put Jaguar's name in lights, especially at the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans - but the company continued to produce striking machines off track as well.",
      "A number of these have stood the test of time, not least the Mark II and its successor, the S-Type. First produced in 1959, this was a luxury saloon that happened to have plenty of bad-boy appeal.",
      "Arguably Jaguar's greatest moment, however, came with the launch of the E-Type in 1961, which came with 150mph performance, and movie-star cachet. It was the car to be seen in and gave the Jaguar badge a lustre that lasted for decades.",
      "But nostalgia alone will not sell cars. Jaguar has been harking back to former glories for a long time.",
      "\"I would certainly say they've been trading off nostalgia for decades,\" says Matthias Schmidt.",
      "Prior to the relaunch, he says Jaguar has been \"like a luxury hotel that doesn't feel the need to refurbish its brand\". He adds: \"The failure to look over one's shoulders and see what the competition is doing can be fatal.\"",
      "Genius or risky?",
      "This week's relaunch seems designed to get the brand out of a comfortable rut and attempt to make it edgy again, while retaining at least some of its past cachet. Or, as Gerry McGovern put it from the Miami stage, \"recapture the essence of Jaguar's original creative conviction\".",
      "Under normal circumstances, the debut of a new car might gain a certain amount of attention in motoring magazines and websites, but it would rarely, if ever, get onto the front pages.",
      "The company has not said who was behind the teaser ad that went viral - generating more than three million views on YouTube - but JLR has been working with Accenture's creative marketing arm, Accenture Song, for three years.",
      "Accenture has not commented.",
      "Branding experts have mixed views about the campaign.",
      "\"What we had was a really bold advertising campaign, that has now been followed through seamlessly with a concept car that completely matches the campaign,\" says Mark Beaumont, founder of branding agency Dinosaur.",
      "\"It is potentially a masterclass in advertising awareness\".",
      "But Tim Parker, strategy director at Conran Design Group, thinks it is a risky strategy. \"They have indeed copied nothing that has come before in the brand's rich heritage, but at what cost?",
      "\"Few brands ever succeed by alienating their traditional customer base over the longer term,\" he continues. \"If the goal is to build relevance in a crowded luxury EV market, then differentiation makes sense \u2013 but only if the underlying strategy is coherent.\"",
      "'Does the world need the Jaguar brand?'",
      "What we have not seen yet, however, or at least in any detail, is an actual road-going car. The concept is just that \u2013 an idea.",
      "Jaguar is in the process of developing three new models, the first of which is unlikely to go on sale until late 2026. All we have been told is that it will be powerful, with more than 575hp, and have a range of more than 430 miles.",
      "It has begun road-testing, and a handful of leaked photos show a large boxy machine that is both similar to the concept \u2013 and very different.",
      "Why these Israeli men volunteered to fight - but now refuse to return to Gaza",
      "'I spent 30 years as a therapist to killers - and no-one is born evil'",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",

    "title": "Planning reforms will end development chaos, says Rayner",
    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 10:34:22 GMT",
    "summary": "Officials will be able to rubberstamp development plans without local authority permission under the changes.",
    "story": [
      "Housing Secretary Angela Rayner has said overhauling planning rules to bypass local authorities will remove \"chaos and subjectiveness\" from the system.",
      "The planned changes will give local authority planning officers the power to rubberstamp development proposals without permission from council committees, as long as they comply with locally agreed plans and national regulations on standards.",
      "House builders have broadly welcomed the streamlining but the Conservatives have accused Labour of \"ignoring\" communities.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Rayner told councils to \"get your plans in order\" as the government targets its manifesto pledge to build 1.5 million new homes.",
      "The deputy prime minister said the government will require all councils to formalise developments' plans, the absence of which has caused developments to \"get stuck in the system\".",
      "Rayner continued: \"Because we haven't had these compulsory plans locally, we've seen speculative development where greenbelt land has been developed on... we've told councils they've got to have those plans.",
      "\"If developers follow the national framework, which protects the environment and looks at other elements, then they shouldn't be stuck in the system for years.\"",
      "She pushed back on the suggestion the government is riding roughshod over councils, saying the changes were necessary to bring about what would be the biggest increase in house building since the 1950s.",
      "\"It's going to take a lot of change to deliver that,\" Rayner added.",
      "Tory shadow Treasury minister Richard Fuller said the government's building target is \"reasonable\", but added: \"If you want to achieve that, you've got to bring the people with you, and, unfortunately, Labour seem to be saying that Angela [Rayner] is best and local people can be ignored.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer restated his pledge to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029 despite accepting it could be \"a little too ambitious\".",
      "The fast-track planning process would apply to housing proposals and associated infrastructure such as schools, if they had already been broadly agreed as part of local development plans where councils set out a strategy for land use in their areas.",
      "If the proposals \"comply\" with these plans, the government has said, they could \"bypass planning committees entirely to tackle chronic uncertainty, unacceptable delays and unnecessary waste of time and resources\".",
      "According to government planning statistics, between January and March 2024 only 19% of major applications were determined within the statutory 13-week period and only 38% of minor applications were determined in the statutory eight-week period.",
      "Judge Labour on six targets, Starmer says in major speech",
      "Starmer seeks to take control after bumpy start",
      "Will Keir Starmer be able to meet his new pledges?",
      "The push for more homes may be popular among those voters struggling to get on the housing ladder.",
      "But even small housing projects are often opposed by people living nearby for a variety of reasons, including concerns about the impact on local schools, doctors, roads and parking.",
      "Rayner said ministers across government had been instructed to ensure new infrastructure projects are targeted at areas which will see new housing development.",
      "She added: \"Many people will say, 'I don't mind housing but we don't have the roads, we're already struggling to get a GP appointment'. Fixing those foundations at the same time is crucial to get the buy-in from those local areas.\"",
      "Taking away the option for local people to prevent a development by making a case at a planning committee may result in a political backlash, particularly in rural areas.",
      "Labour has already angered farmers by bringing agricultural land within the scope of inheritance tax, and needs to nurture support outside cities if it is to maintain political strength.",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA) said that, far from planning delays being to blame for holding up house building, a million proposed homes had in fact been agreed in principle by councils in their local strategies but developers had not brought forward plans.",
      "Councillor Adam Hug, housing spokesperson for the association representing councils, said local authorities and communities \"need to be full partners in tackling the housing crisis together\".",
      "He added this could be achieved with \"new development supported by the infrastructure needed to make communities thrive and proper consultation and engagement that can help ensure local people are able to benefit\".",
      "The Home Builders Federation (HBF) said that while \"democratic involvement and oversight of planning\" was a \"fundamental element of the process\" it could be \"very frustrating for applicants to have the principle of development debated over and over again\".",
      "The housing ministry also hopes to streamline the strategic planning process and introduce a requirement for better training for members of planning committees. A Planning and Infrastructure Bill will be introduced next month.",
      "Many in local government and the housebuilding industry believe the now-mandatory target of 1.5 million new homes by 2029 will be impossible to meet.",
      "A Conservative spokesman said the government had \"set a house building 'target' that the OBR has already said they can't achieve because of their own Budget\".",
      "The HBF agreed with the LGA that councils needed more planning resources and also called for more financial help for young home buyers.",
      "Kate Henderson, the National Housing Federation's chief executive, told the BBC reforms were needed to meet the \"massive challenge\" of hitting the government's \"really ambitious\" house-building target.",
      "She said local authorities have to \"plan for the population now and for the population in the future\", and called on government to facilitate coordination across council areas to ensure social and affordable housing is provided as part of any increase in house-building.",
      "Next week the government will announce further reforms by updating England's planning rulebook, the National Planning Policy Framework."

      "Figures show that almost one million Canadian tourists visited Cuba last year, the top country of origin for visitors by some margin.",
      "As such, a recent decision by the Canadian tour operator, Sunwing Vacations Group \u2013 one of Cuba\u2019s leading travel partners \u2013 to remove 26 hotels from its Cuba portfolio is a blow to the island\u2019s struggling tourism industry.",
      "Sunwing took the decision after Cuba endured a four-day nationwide blackout at the end of October, caused by failures with the country's aging energy infrastructure.",
      "This was followed by another national power cut last month, when Hurricane Rafael barrelled its way across the island, worsening an already-acute electricity crisis.",
      "A third countrywide blackout then happened on Wednesday, 4 Dec, after Cuba's largest power plant broke down.",
      "\u201cCuba has had some volatility in the last few weeks and that may shake consumer confidence,\u201d Sunwing\u2019s chief marketing officer, Samantha Taylor told the Pax News travel website last month.",
      "\u201cThere are incredible places to go in Cuba,\u201d she stressed, keen to emphasise that the company isn\u2019t pulling out of Cuba altogether. \u201cBut we also recognise that if clients are a little uncomfortable, we need to give them options.\u201d",
      "Specifically, that involved drawing up a list of what they called \u201chidden gems\u201d \u2013 alternative holiday destinations in the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and Colombia.",
      "The implications for Cuba are clear.",
      "With tourism now the island\u2019s principal economic motor, and the main source of foreign currency earnings after remittances, that an important tour operator is pointing its customers towards other countries\u2019 beaches over crumbling energy infrastructure is a real concern.",
      "\u201cOur message to Canadians is that tourism is one of the economy\u2019s priorities,\u201d said Lessner G\u00f3mez, director of the Cuban Tourism Board in Toronto in a statement. \u201cThe Ministry of Tourism has been preparing for the winter season to deliver better services, uninterrupted supplies, a better airport experience, and more and new car rentals.\u201d",
      "While Cuba\u2019s tourism agency tries to ease fears about the extent of the electricity blackouts, few can deny that these have been extremely difficult months on the island. Hurricane Rafael was only the latest storm to hit Cuba in a frenetic Atlantic hurricane season in which more powerful and more frequent storms are the new normal.",
      "Of course, severe weather is a problem across the Caribbean. But for Cuba, there are other complications in play.",
      "Donald Trump\u2019s re-election to the White House and his choice for Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, stand to make life even more complicated for Cubans than it already is.",
      "\u201cThis is probably the Cuban Revolution\u2019s hardest moment,\u201d says former Cuban diplomat, Jes\u00fas Arboleya. \u201cAnd unfortunately, I see nothing on the horizon whatsoever which allows for an optimistic view of the future of US-Cuba relations.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump has handed US policy towards Cuba to those sectors of the Cuban American right who have essentially lived off anti-Castro policies since their origins.\u201d",
      "Mr Arboleya adds that Marco Rubio, currently a US Senator for Florida, is the leading voice among them. He is a Cuban American long opposed to the communist government in Havana.",
      "His parents were Cubans who moved to the US in 1956, three years before Fidel Castro seized power, but his grandfather fled the Castro-led turn to communism on the island.",
      "\u201cPeople are horrified by the idea of another Donald Trump presidency. It spells real trouble,\u201d echoes Cuban political commentator and editor of Temas magazine, Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez.",
      "Current US policy towards Cuba is \u201csomewhat schizophrenic\u201d, he argues.",
      "\u201cOn the one hand, the State Department facilitates support to the private sector, and [pushes for] economic changes in Cuba. But on the other hand, Congress and Senate seem to freeze any advances on those reforms.\u201d",
      "The expectation is, however, that a future Secretary of State Rubio will coalesce the US\u2019s Cuba policy around a single idea - maximum pressure on the island by tightening the already-harsh sanctions.",
      "Cubans fear that could mean the suspension of commercial flights to Cuba, or even the closure of the US Embassy in Havana, which was officially reopened in 2015 after decades of frosty relations.",
      "If implemented, such steps would be deliberately designed to further harm Cuba\u2019s floundering tourism trade, the aim to hit the communist-run nation when it\u2019s down. Tourist numbers to Cuba have almost halved since the high point of nearly five million visitors during the Obama-era d\u00e9tente with Cuba.",
      "Between 2015-2017 US visitors flocked to the island under more relaxed travel restrictions, keen to experience a country that had long been denied them. Around the same time, the Cuban government embarked on a major hotel-building spree, confident that demand would remain strong over the next decade.",
      "However, there followed a double blow to Cuban tourism from which it hasn\u2019t fully recovered. First, the Trump Administration rolled back President Obama\u2019s engagement policies, and then the Covid-19 pandemic sent the industry into freefall.",
      "With many of those hotels now registering much lower occupancy rates than originally predicted, and real difficulties in providing the five-star customer experience as advertised amid the blackouts and shortages, some question the strategy of putting so many eggs in the tourism basket in the first place.",
      "\u201cWhy has Cuba invested 38% [of government funds] on average over the past decade in hotels and infrastructure connected to international tourism, but only 8 to 9% on energy infrastructure?\u201d asks economist Ricardo Torres at the American University in Washington DC. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. The hotels run on electricity.\u201d",
      "Even with all the current challenges, most visitors agree that Cuba remains a unique travel experience. The cliches \u2013 classic cars, cigars and mojitos \u2013 still appeal to many, while others prefer to travel the island absorbing its history, culture and music.",
      "Yet as tour operator Sunwings\u2019 decision to step back shows, some tourists are finding it hard to appreciate Cuba during its energy crisis, especially if it\u2019s about to be exacerbated by a hostile administration \u2013 and Secretary of State \u2013 in Washington."

    "summary": "Sweden has a reputation for strong gender equality, but some young women are giving up their jobs.",
    "story": [
      "Sweden has a global reputation for championing gender equality, so why are young women embracing a social media trend that celebrates quitting work?",
      "Vilma Larsson, 25, previously had jobs in a grocery store, a care home and a factory. But she quit work a year ago to become a stay-at-home-girlfriend, and says she\u2019s never been happier.",
      "\u201cMy life is softer. I am not struggling. I am not very stressed.\u201d",
      "Her boyfriend works remotely in finance, and while he spends his days on his laptop, she\u2019s at the gym, out for coffee, or cooking. The couple grew up in small towns in central Sweden, but now travel a lot, and are spending the winter in Cyprus.",
      "\u201cEvery month he gives me a salary from his money that he made. But if I need more, I'll ask him. Or if I need less, I don't - I just save the rest,\u201d explains Ms Larsson.",
      "She shares her lifestyle on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok, where she\u2019s amassed 11,000 followers. Some of her posts have had almost 400,000 likes, although she says she\u2019s not making an income from her content.",
      "She uses the hashtags \u201chemmaflickv\u00e4n\u201d and \u201chemmafru\u201d (Swedish for stay-at-home girlfriend and housewife) and describes herself as a \u201csoft girl\u201d \u2013 an identity that embraces a softer, more feminine way of living rather than focussing on a career.",
      "The soft girl lifestyle has been a microtrend on social media in different parts of the world since the late 2010s. But in Sweden \u2013 with five decades of policies designed to promote dual income households behind it \u2013 the concept\u2019s recent popularity has sparked both surprise and division.",
      "Ungdomsbarometern \u2013  Sweden\u2019s largest annual survey of young people \u2013 first put the national spotlight on Swedes embracing the soft girl trend a year ago, after it became a popular choice when 15 to 24-year-olds were asked to predict trends for 2024.",
      "Another study released by Ungdomsbaromatern this August suggested it was even becoming an aspiration among younger schoolgirls, with 14% of seven to 14-year-olds identifying as soft girls.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about leaning away from this \u2018girl boss\u2019 ideal that we've seen for a lot of years, where there are very, very high demands for success in every aspect of life,\u201d explains Johanna G\u00f6ransson, a researcher for Ungdomsbarometern.",
      "There is no official data on the number of young \u201csoft girls\u201d quitting work altogether and living off their partners like Ms Larsson, and Ms G\u00f6ransson says it is likely to be a small proportion.",
      "But it\u2019s nevertheless become a major talking point in Sweden, from opinion pieces in broadsheet newspapers, to panel discussions at Almedalen \u2013 a huge annual cross-party political event \u2013 and on Swedish public service television.",
      "Gudrun Schyman \u2013 the co-founder and former leader of Sweden\u2019s feminist party Feministiskt initiativ - says she\u2019s taken part in recent debates on the issue. She believes women living off their partners wealth is \u201cvery dangerous\u201d, and \u201ca step backwards\u201d for gender equality.",
      "Ms Schyman argues that young Swedes have been influenced by the country\u2019s right-wing coalition government, which collaborates with the nationalist Sweden Democrats party, as well as the \u201cbroader development\u201d of populism in Europe and the United States.",
      "She also thinks there\u2019s a lack of awareness about life in Sweden before it embraced policies designed to promote gender equality, such as heavily subsidised childcare and shared parental leave. \u201cYoung women today don't carry the history of how women had to fight for their rights - the right to work, the right to have a salary, and the right to economic independence.\u201d",
      "At the other end of the political spectrum, the Sweden Democrats party has been positive towards the soft girls trend.",
      "\u201cI think that people should get to decide over their own life,\u201d says Denice Westerberg, national spokesperson for the party\u2019s youth wing. \u201cAnd if you have that economic possibility to do that [live off a partner] then good for you.",
      "\u201cWe still live in a country with all the opportunities to have a career. We still have all the rights, but we have the right to choose to live more traditionally.\u201d",
      "Aside from ideological debates, discussions have focussed on the social and cultural factors that could be influencing young women to quit work - or at least aspire to a softer lifestyle.",
      "Sweden has a reputation for work life balance - most employees get six-weeks holiday a year, and less than 1% work more than 50 hours a week.",
      "Still, Ungdomsbaromatern\u2019s research suggests rising stress levels amongst young people, and Ms G\u00f6ransson believes soft girls trend may be an extension of recent global work trends such as \u201cquiet quitting\u201d, which encourages employees not to overextend themselves.",
      "Meanwhile, the Generation Z age group (the cohort born between 1997 and 2012) are making, and being influenced by, social media content that celebrates leisure time rather than career goals.",
      "Business Daily: Sweden\u2019s #softgirls trend",
      "\u201cWork doesn't really feature that much if you look at lifestyle content on social media today, it's much more about exercise and wellness,\u201d explains Ms G\u00f6ransson. \u201cAnd if that's the picture young people have of what a normal life looks like, then, of course, maybe you're not so excited about spending eight hours in an office a day.\u201d",
      "But perhaps the biggest talking point is whether the trend is a response to the limitations of Sweden\u2019s pioneering gender equality policies.",
      "Alongside Slovenia, Sweden has the highest proportion of working mothers in Europe, yet government statistics suggest women in heterosexual couples still do a larger share of housework and childcare than men.",
      "They also take 70% of state-funded parental leave, and are more likely to go on sick leave for stress. Meanwhile, although the income gap between men and women remains lower than the EU average of 12.7%, it has stalled at around 10%  since 2019.",
      "Ms Larsson \u2013 who wants to have children in the future \u2013 says her decision to become a stay-at-home girlfriend is partly due to watching older women struggle to juggle a career and homelife.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of women feel burned out from their work,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I just think of my mother and her mother, my grandma, and my sister, everyone. They're always so stressed.\u201d",
      "At Sweden\u2019s state-funded Gender Equality Agency, Peter Wickstr\u00f6m, head of the department for policy analysis and monitoring, also believes the soft girl trend can be viewed as a \u201crational reaction\u201d to the perceived \u201cdemands\u201d experienced by young women.",
      "Shoka \u00c5hrman, an economist at one of Sweden\u2019s largest pension funds, SPP, says she does not believe enough Swedish girlfriends or wives will quit work for it to have an impact on the country\u2019s economy.",
      "However, she is working to raise awareness amongst Swedish women that leaving the labour force (as well as going part time) could impact their personal finances, from savings and pensions, to salary levels if they return to work.",
      "Ms \u00c5hrman hopes the current soft girl debates will serve as a wake-up call to both politicians and businesses alike that there is still work to be done to address ongoing structural inequalities in Sweden.",
      "\u201cI think the source of it, which is mental health issues, burnouts and all that, is what's more worrying, because that affects not only the few younger girls today that want to stay home as soft girls,\u201d she says.",

      "Speaking to BBC West, Mr McNeillie warned persistent absence deprives children not just of a good education but of the opportunity to build social skills.",
      "He said lockdowns had damaged the \"sense of social contract\" that children must go to school every single day they are well enough to do so.",
      "\"Not being in school means they are not getting access to good quality education,\" he said.",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 00:43:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The government has pledged to determine the evidence - and establish whether the benefits outweigh any potential harms of prescribing puberty blockers to children questioning their gender",
    "story": [
      "It is among the most delicate and controversial challenges in modern medicine - how to determine whether the benefits of puberty blockers (or drugs that delay puberty) outweigh the potential harms.",
      "This question came to the fore in June 2023 when NHS England proposed that in the future, these drugs would only be prescribed to children questioning their gender as part of clinical research.",
      "Since then, a new government has arrived in Westminster and Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he is committed to \"setting up a clinical trial\" to establish the evidence on puberty blockers. The National Institute for Health and Care Research is expected to confirm soon that funding is in place for a trial.",
      "The dilemma that remains is, how will such a trial work?",
      "Eighteen months since the announcement there is still a lack of consensus around how the trial should be conducted. It will also need to be approved by a committee of experts who have to decide, among other things, whether what's being tested might cause undue physical or psychological harm.",
      "But there is a second unanswered question that some, but by no means all, scientists have that is more pressing than the first: is it right to perform this particular trial on children and young people at all?",
      "A rapid rise in referrals",
      "When the Gender and Identity Development Service (GIDS) was established at London's Tavistock Clinic in 1989, it was the only NHS specialist gender clinic for children in England, and those referred there were typically offered psychological and social support.",
      "Over the last 10 years, however, there has been a rapid increase in referrals - with the greatest increase being people registered female at birth. In a separate development, around the same time the approach of typically offering psychological and social support moved to one of onward referrals to services that prescribed hormone drugs, such as puberty blockers.",
      "Known scientifically as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, puberty blockers work on the brain to stop the rise in sex hormones - oestrogen and testosterone - that accompany puberty. For years, they were prescribed to young patients with gender dysphoria (those who feel their gender identity is different from their biological sex). But in March 2024, NHS England stopped the routine prescribing of puberty blockers to under 18s, as part of an overhaul of children's gender identity services.",
      "NHS England said in a policy statement: \"There is not enough evidence to support the safety or clinical effectiveness of PSH [puberty suppressing hormones] to make the treatment routinely available at this time.\"",
      "The ban was later tightened to apply to private clinics as well.",
      "In April 2024, a review of gender identity services for children and young people, led by Dr Hilary Cass, a past president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, published its final report, which called out the \"field of gender care\" for not taking a cautious and careful approach.",
      "She also reported that the change in practice at GIDS away from one primarily relying on psychological and social support was largely based on a single study that looked at the effect of medical interventions such as puberty blockers on a very narrowly defined group of children and there was a lack of follow up in the longer term.",
      "Elsewhere, some other countries were re-examining puberty blockers too. Scotland paused the use of them while Finland, Sweden, France, Norway, and Denmark have all re-evaluated their positions on medical intervention for under 18s - including puberty blockers - to differing degrees. In other places there is still support for the use of puberty blockers.",
      "In medicine, when there is genuine uncertainty as to whether the benefits of a treatment outweigh the harms - called equipoise - some ethicists argue there's a moral obligation to scientifically study such treatments. But there are some from across the debate who don't think there is equipoise in this case.",
      "The ethical dilemma at the heart of the trial",
      "The BBC has learned details about the arguments going on around the concept of a trial and how it could look. Some argue that there is already evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health, and that in light of this it would be unethical to perform a trial at all because this would mean some young people experiencing gender distress would not be given them.",
      "The World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH) has expressed their concern about the trial for this reason. They support the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgery. WPATH, who have faced increasing criticism of their guidelines from some clinicians, say that it is ethically problematic to make participation in a trial the only way to access a type of care that is \"evidence based, widely recognised as medically necessary, and often reported as lifesaving.\"",
      "Meanwhile other clinicians believe there is no good evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health at all. They also point to research that questions the negative impact that the drugs might have on brain development among teenagers, as well as evidence around the negative impact on bone density.",
      "Dr Louise Irvine is a GP and co-chair of the Clinical Advisory Network on Sex and Gender which says it is cautious about using medical pathways in gender dysphoric children. She says: \"Given that puberty blockers by definition disrupt a crucial natural phase of human development, the anticipated benefits must be tangible and significant to justify the risk to children.",
      "\"In pushing ahead with a puberty blockers trial, we are concerned that political interests are being prioritised over clinical, ethical and scientific concerns, and over the health and wellbeing of children.\"",
      "The NHS adult gender services holds data that tracks 9,000 young people from the youth service. Some argue that this should be scrutinised before any trial goes ahead as it could provide evidence on, among other things, the potential risks of taking puberty blockers.",
      "But there is a third view held by some others, including Gordon Guyatt, a professor at McMaster University in Canada, who points out that randomised trials are done in \"life-threatening stuff all the time\" where no-one can be sure of the long-term effects of a treatment. In his view it would be \"unethical not to do it\".",
      "\"With only low quality evidence, people's philosophies, their attitudes or their politics, will continue to dominate the discussion,\" he argues. \"If we do not generate better evidence, the destructive, polarised debate will continue.\"",
      "- Dr Cass found the existing research in the field was poor quality and that there was not a reliable enough evidence base to base clinical decisions on. Young people involved in many of the existing studies may have also had interventions including psychological support and other medical treatments and so it was not always possible to disentangle the effect of each different treatment.",
      "- When it comes to suppressing puberty by using drugs, the rationale for doing so \"remains unclear\", Dr Cass said.  One of the original reasons given was to allow time to think by delaying the onset of puberty. But the evidence suggests the vast majority who start on puberty blockers go on to take cross-sex hormones - oestrogen or testosterone. It is not clear why but one theory, the Cass report suggests, is that puberty blockers may, in their own right, change the \"trajectory\" of gender identity development.",
      "- Clinicians \"are unable to determine with any certainty\" which young people \"will go on to have an enduring trans identity\", Dr Cass wrote. In other words, there's a lack of clarity about which young people might benefit in the long term and which may be harmed overall by the process.",
      "How the trial could look",
      "Recruitment for the trial is due to start in 2025, months later than originally anticipated. Young people will likely be referred after a full assessment by specialist clinicians. A lot is still to be determined, including how many participants there will be.",
      "Ultimately the scientists running the trials will need to establish whether people who get an intervention are better off than those who do not. In this case, do the puberty blocking drugs and their effect make the young people better off?",
      "\"Better off\" in this instance includes the extent to which a young person's mental health may be improved if they are happy with their body. Quality of life is determined by various factors including self-confidence and self-esteem. As well as getting the personal views from the young people and parents, the trial could measure actual real life changes, such as time spent in education and time spent with family and friends.",
      "But there are potential harms to study too, such as the possibility of reduced bone density. Some scientists suggest examining the impact on learning using a form of IQ test.",
      "Normal brain development is influenced by both puberty and chronological age, which usually act in tandem during adolescence. It's not clear how this is affected when puberty is suppressed. Brain scans are one way of understanding any effect.",
      "Some scientists believe it may be possible to simply randomly assign trial participants into two groups where one gets puberty blockers, the other gets a placebo and nobody is aware which group they're in.",
      "But others believe a placebo group is impossible. They say the placebo group would go through puberty, realise they weren't on puberty blockers and potentially drop out of the trial or even find other ways to obtain puberty blockers. Either scenario would reduce the validity of the results.",
      "Professor Gordon Guyatt and others have outlined a potential trial where the group of patients not receiving drugs would be made up entirely of children who are keen to socially transition, such as by changing how they dress and altering their name and pronouns. Researchers could then monitor the difference between the groups.",
      "A second possibility is that both trial groups are given puberty blockers but one group gets them after a delay, during which time they receive psychological and emotional support. This would help researchers determine, among other things, whether their gender-related distress subsides during that delay while receiving the support.",
      "Alongside this there would be a \"matched\" control group that doesn't take a placebo or puberty blockers, whether for health reasons or because they don't want to, that get similar tests and scans.",
      "Puberty occurs in stages when different bodily changes occur. A third proposal could involve a second group being given drugs at a later stage in puberty than the first.",
      "This would allow researchers to explore when the right time to give puberty blockers might be. For example, it would enable the researchers to see if starting the drugs early improves wellbeing by reducing gender-specific body changes. They would also be able to see whether starting the drugs earlier has a greater negative impact on bone density and brain development.",
      "Children referred to GIDS also experienced higher rates of anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and autism compared to the general child population. Trial participants would continue to receive treatment related to these conditions but - so we know any differences in the results from the groups are down to the drug - they will need to be balanced for the above conditions.",
      "All these considerations demonstrate the complexity of trying to obtain evidence in this area that is reliable and definitive.",
      "What parents say",
      "Many parents are watching closely to see how it will play out. Annabel (not her real name) is one of them. She is part of the Bayswater Group, a collection of parents with children who are questioning their gender who say they are \"wary of medical solutions to gender dysphoria\". She began looking into puberty blockers when her own daughter began questioning her gender in her early teens, an option put on the table by GIDS.",
      "Ultimately her daughter decided not to take them. Annabel was not convinced there was enough evidence to show they were beneficial and she was unsure what it would mean for her daughter's long-term physical and psychological health.",
      "Today, she still has unanswered questions - including some further ones around the trial. \"A big concern for me is will this new trial, if it gets approval, give us the evidence that we want? Or will we end up with more weak data that Dr Cass said undermined decision making in this area?\"",
      "Natacha Kennedy, a lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London who researches transgender issues, has examined the results of a survey of 97 parents of young people with gender-related distress that took place following the puberty blockers ban. She believes that puberty blockers should be an option available for young people questioning their gender and that many will not accept being part of a placebo group in a trial.",
      "\"These parents are desperate and if [they] get to a trial and it turns out their child is not being given the actual puberty blockers, then there is no point in them being there,\" she says.",
      "\"There may be some parents who would\u2026 find another way [to obtain the drugs].\"",

      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Whatever trial format is settled on, more scrutiny will follow. And there will no doubt be fierce debate about the merits of the trial and what it can tell us, as many scientists around the world are watching to see what happens in the UK.",
      "But inevitably, there will be a long wait to fully understand the longer term effects on physical and mental health of those who take puberty blockers - and the long-term effects on those with gender-related distress who don't. Nor do we know how many people detransition, though the Cass report says, \"there is suggestion that numbers are increasing\".",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 13:39:34 GMT",
    "summary": "Keir Starmer is going to announce measurable targets to judge his government's progress on its key missions.",
    "story": [
      "Keir Starmer has outlined a \"plan for change\" in a speech and set targets in key areas.",
      "He said they were \"measurable milestones that will also give the British people the power to hold our feet to the fire\".",
      "BBC Verify looks at whether the government can meet these pledges.",
      "The NHS",
      "The prime minister highlighted an existing target for the NHS in England that 92% of patients waiting for planned treatment should be seen within 18 weeks of being referred.",
      "It was a manifesto pledge and the government has pledged to achieve it by 2029.",
      "The latest NHS data shows that in September 2024 only 58.5% of operations, or other procedures people were waiting for, occurred within 18 weeks.",
      "When Labour took power in July, the share was 58.8%, so it has barely changed.",
      "The last time the 92% target was hit was in November 2015.",
      "In order to meet this goal, the government has said it wants the NHS in England to get through an additional 40,000 appointments and operations each week.",
      "To help fund this, Chancellor Rachel Reeves increased the inflation-adjusted day-to-day cash resources of the health department by 3.8% in both 2024-25 and 2025-26 in her Autumn Budget.",
      "However, Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents managers, has warned that achieving the 40,000 appointments and operations target will not be enough, on its own, to hit the broader 92% waiting list target.",
      "\u201cThe NHS needs reform, not just ever more activity,\u201d Mr Taylor said.",
      "Is Starmer speech a \u2018plan for change\u2019 or \u2018emergency relaunch\u2019?",
      "The economy",
      "Starmer made a new pledge to increase the amount of money that households have.",
      "The government will use two measures to track this.",
      "The first is real household disposable income (RHDI) per person. This is what people have left of their pay and benefits once they have paid tax.",
      "In October, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which does the government's forecasts, predicted that RHDI per person would rise by around 0.5% per year over this Parliament.",
      "According to calculations by the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focused on living standards, that would be a slightly better performance than the 0.3% average growth in RHDI per person in the previous Parliament.",
      "But it would be worse than just about every other Parliament for decades.",
      "The second measure is GDP (a measure of the size of the economy) divided by the size of the population, which the prime minister says will rise for every region of the UK.",
      "In the last Parliament, overall GDP per capita fell in the UK.",
      "Starmer also mentioned the manifesto pledge to deliver the highest sustained growth in the G7, which would mean having stronger growth than the US, Canada, Italy, France, Japan and Germany.",
      "The latest forecasts from the IMF from October suggest that Canada and the US will have stronger average growth than the UK between 2024 and 2029.",
      "However, it should be stressed that these are only forecasts - and forecasts related to economic growth and incomes are subject to considerable uncertainty.",
      "Crime",
      "The government has re-committed to its manifesto pledge to hire 13,000 additional neighbourhood police officers, volunteer special constables and Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs), who work with officers but do not have all the same powers.",
      "BBC Verify has asked the Home Office for the breakdown of these 13,000 officers - and how many will be new - but they have not yet responded and the government document does not set it out.",
      "Tiff Lynch, the acting national chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, the staff association for officers, has welcomed the government\u2019s recruitment drive.",
      "But she also warned that morale in the force is low due to real terms pay cuts in recent years and pointed out that in the federation's last survey 22% of respondents said they were planning to leave within the next two years.",
      "Education",
      "The government pledged to raise the proportion of children in England who are \u201cready for school\u201d at the age of five, to 75%.",
      "Official data from the Department for Education suggests that in 2023-24, 67.7% of children in England had a \u201cgood level of development\u201d.",
      "This is based on teacher assessments of children\u2019s development at age five.",
      "This was up slightly from 67.2% in the previous year.",
      "The government is in the middle of a major expansion of state-funded childcare.",
      "From September 2025, the government is pledging to deliver 30 hours of government funded childcare a week for under-fives in England, taking on the commitment of the previous government.",
      "However, the Early Years Alliance, which represents nurseries in England, estimates that the increase in employer National Insurance Contributions announced in the Budget will result in additional annual costs averaging more than \u00a318,600 per provider. That is based on a survey of its members.",
      "The childcare sector warns that, without extra funding to make up for the tax rise, nurseries might withdraw from the free childcare scheme, or some could go out of business.",
      "Housebuilding",
      "Also in line with Labour\u2019s manifesto, Starmer has recommitted to building 1.5 million net additional dwellings in England over the course of the Parliament.",
      "At a constant annual rate, that would equate to 300,000 per year,",
      "The most recent official data shows that 221,070 net additional dwellings were delivered in 2023-24, a decline of 6% on the previous year.",
      "The government is bringing in new housing targets for local councils in England, which the previous administration dropped and is reforming planning laws to try to accelerate building.",
      "But many housing experts remain sceptical about the feasibility of Labour\u2019s target given the lack of affordability of new housing, which has put off many buyers and deterred private developers from investing.",
      "Official data also shows that the number of housing projects given the go-ahead by councils in England reached a record low in the final months of the last government, mainly because of a decline in applications from builders.",
      "Clean power",
      "In November 2023, a Labour press release talked about \"leading the world with 100% clean power by 2030\".",
      "The party's election manifesto pledged \"zero-carbon electricity by 2030\".",
      "Starmer now says the government will achieve at least 95% clean power by 2030.",
      "The prime minister was questioned repeatedly about whether this represented a change in the target but denied this.",
      "The National Energy System Operator (NESO), the government\u2019s independent system planner and operator for the energy transition, last month defined clean power as including less than 5% of generation from gas in a typical year.",
      "It recently concluded that \u201cit is possible to build, connect and operate a clean power system for Great Britain by 2030, while maintaining security of supply\".",
      "However, it added that achieving this would be \u201cat the limit of what is feasible\u201d.",

    "story": [
      "The couple who run PinkNews, the world's largest LGBT news website, have been accused by staff of multiple incidents of sexual misconduct.",
      "Several former staff members told the BBC they saw Anthony James, a director at the UK-based company and husband of its founder, kissing and touching a junior colleague who they say appeared too drunk to consent.",
      "And more than 30 current and former members of staff said a culture of heavy drinking led to instances when founder Benjamin Cohen and his husband behaved inappropriately towards younger male employees.",
      "Representatives for Mr Cohen and Dr James told the BBC they were not able to provide a statement at this time, but that their position is that the allegations are false.",
      "Run by family members of Mr Cohen - his husband and former GP Dr James is chief operating officer, and his father Richard is the chief lawyer - PinkNews says its mission is \"to inform, inspire change and empower people to be themselves\".",
      "It played an influential role in the campaign for marriage equality in the UK and its annual awards ceremony has attracted prime ministers and other politicians.",
      "Away from the cameras and red carpets, however, multiple former staff members have told the BBC they had experienced bullying and sexual misconduct which made some of them feel unsafe to be alone around Mr Cohen and Dr James. Allegations of misogyny have also emerged and several people told us that some young female members of staff had been asked to act as the couple's surrogates.",
      "As well as interviewing 33 people who worked at PinkNews between 2017 and 2024, we have also seen a variety of evidence including official written complaints, private emails and WhatsApp messages sharing staff members\u2019 concerns, plus doctors\u2019 records referring to stress and mental health struggles attributed to the work environment at PinkNews.",
      "'They weren\u2019t capable of consenting'",
      "Five former members of staff told the BBC they had witnessed Dr James groping and kissing a junior member of staff, who they said was \"too drunk to stand or talk\" and \"unable to consent\".",
      "The alleged incident happened outside a central London pub, where staff had gathered after a PinkNews event.",
      "A former PinkNews staff member, who we are calling Gary, said Dr James had led the junior colleague behind a tree. \"Anthony was just forcing himself on somebody who wasn\u2019t able to make that decision for themselves because of how intoxicated they were,\" he said.",
      "People at the event said they helped the alleged victim get home in a taxi.",
      "But several former members of staff who said they witnessed the incident told us they were too scared to complain. One person said: \"It\u2019s the CEO\u2019s husband, what are you going to do? Lose your job?\"",
      "A complaint about the incident was made later by a staff member, and was shared with several members of the senior leadership team at PinkNews. The BBC has been shown multiple copies of the complaint but has been unable to establish whether any action was taken as a result.",
      "Many of the former employees said staff socials or awaydays often involved drinking until the early hours of the morning and that \"Prosecco Friday\" - where staff would be given free wine and crisps - was introduced in the office in an effort to boost staff morale.",
      "Another former staff member we are calling Damian said he personally experienced inappropriate behaviour from Mr Cohen during an evening at the pub after work.",
      "\"Ben was extremely drunk to the point he fell off his chair, and then asked me out of earshot of my other colleagues whether I wanted to go back to his [\u2026] because Anthony his husband wasn\u2019t there,\" Damian said.",
      "\"He said something along the lines of 'Anthony is always getting with other men' and the suggestion was we would do something sexually. I was extremely uncomfortable.\"",
      "Damian said after that night, he avoided being alone with Mr Cohen for the rest of his time at PinkNews.",
      "\"I never heard about it again, no apology,\" he said. \"It put me on alert because it made me realise it was a boundary he thought he could cross.\"",
      "Stephan Kyriacou, who worked at PinkNews between 2019 and 2021, said the job had started as a \"dream come true\" where he did not have to \"hide who I was or pretend\", but the dream was soon \"shattered\".",
      "During a Christmas party, Mr Kyriacou said, Mr Cohen had slapped him on the bottom in front of everyone else.",
      "\"I just shut down for a minute. I didn\u2019t know what to say. I was in shock. I remember turning to my friends and saying, 'What the hell just happened?'\"",
      "Mr Kyriacou said he no longer felt comfortable enough to be alone around his boss.",
      "He said: \"That just made me completely avoid him. I don\u2019t remember ever speaking to him one-on-one after that.\"",
      "Other staff also voiced their concerns about Mr Cohen, Mr Kyriacou said, with several messages in a group chat describing him as a \"creep\" and staff saying they did not feel comfortable around him.",
      "\"None of us really felt like we could complain because we didn\u2019t know what was going to happen to us. Ben is very well-known and we didn\u2019t know whether he was going to badmouth us to people,\" Mr Kyriacou said.",
      "'Creepy and sleazy'",
      "Staff have told us they were shouted at and belittled by Mr Cohen, and that there was a \"toxic\" culture at the company.",
      "\"He can be quite brutal in the way he speaks to you,\" said Damian. \"When things go wrong he\u2019d come down on you like a tonne of bricks and so you were just in this constant state of emotional flux.",
      "\"He put extreme pressures on me to the point I would go home and cry. It caused issues in my own personal relationship with my partner, and then [Benjamin] would love-bomb me and I would think everything was alright.\"",
      "Cai Wilshaw, former head of external affairs at PinkNews, said: \"You had this sort of dark cloud in the office sometimes when Ben was there, that made it really difficult to actually enjoy working there.",
      "\"We worked together quite well, but it is clear that he is a very, very difficult character, and sometimes overly so in a way that really impacted people who worked with him.\"",
      "Some staff members also said they had witnessed what they called \"misogynistic\" behaviour.",
      "Several people said that on occasions young, female members of staff had been asked to act as a surrogate for Mr Cohen and Dr James.",
      "They say that often the request was delivered as a joke, but that it had made people feel \"awkward and uncomfortable\".",
      "One anonymous staff member called it \"creepy and sleazy\", while another called it \"part and parcel\" of how \"misogynistic\" PinkNews was.",
      "Many of the staff who spoke to the BBC said they hope the culture at PinkNews can change so it can continue to tell stories relevant to the LGBT community.",
      "\"It\u2019s important because the mainstream media doesn\u2019t often report on whatever\u2019s happening to trans or queer people,\" said Stephan Kyriacou. \"I think if it can be overhauled, that will make a massive difference.\"",
      "Gary said there was a need for \"authentic queer-led journalism and queer-led stories\" but said \"unfortunately PinkNews has kind of lost its credibility in that arena\".",
      "Damian told us he believed PinkNews\u2019 future could only be secured if Mr Cohen and Dr James took a step back.",
      "\"The fact you cannot separate the two is extremely problematic,\" he said. \"Ben needs to be held to account. Until the day that happens, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a future for PinkNews.\"",
      "The BBC was informed that Mr Cohen and Dr James were not able to provide a statement at this time, but we understand that their position is that the allegations made against them are false."

      "In a statement, a spokesperson for Prudence, Elisabeth and James said: \"We welcome Commissioner Gorman's decision and hope that we can move beyond this litigation to focus on strengthening and rebuilding relationships among all family members.\"",
      "Adam Streisand, a lawyer for Mr Murdoch, told the New York Times they were disappointed and planned to appeal.",
      "A spokesperson for Mr Murdoch declined to comment to the BBC. Mr Streisand did not immediately respond to inquiries.",
      "The famous family was one of the inspirations behind the hugely popular TV series Succession - something the Murdochs have always refused to comment on.",
      "But according to the New York Times report, which is based on a copy of the sealed court ruling, the billionaire's children had started discussing their father's death and how they would handle it after an episode of the HBO series where \"the patriarch of the family dies, leaving his family and business in chaos\".",
      "The episode led to Elisabeth's representative to the trust writing a \"'Succession' memo\" that sought to prevent this from happening in real life, said reports.",
      "The case has played out behind closed doors in Nevada, a state that offers one of the most confidential legal settings for matters including family trust disputes.",
      "It has a \"close on demand\" statute that allows parties involved in certain sensitive cases to request that court proceedings be sealed from public access, ensuring complete privacy.",
      "Mr Murdoch, who has been married five times, also has two younger children, Grace and Chloe, who do not have any voting rights under the trust agreement.",
      "The case was launched after Mr Murdoch decided to change the trust over worries about a \"lack of consensus\" among the children, the Times reported.",
      "Lachan is thought to be more conservative than his siblings and would preserve the legacy of his media brands.",
      "From the 1960s, Mr Murdoch built a global media giant with major political and public influence.",
      "His two companies are News Corporation, which owns newspapers including the Times and the Sun in the UK and the Wall Street Journal in the US, and Fox, which broadcasts Fox News.",
      "Mr Murdoch had been preparing his two sons to follow in his footsteps, beginning when they were teenagers, journalist Andrew Neil told the 2020 BBC documentary The Rise of the Murdoch Dynasty.",
      "\"Family has always been very important to Rupert Murdoch, particularly from the point of view of forming a dynasty,\" the former Sunday Times editor said.",
      "In 1999, the Murdoch Family Trust, which owns the media companies, was supposed to largely settle the succession plans.",
      "It led to Mr Murdoch giving his eldest children various jobs within his companies.",
      "The trust gives the family eight votes, which it can use to have a say on the board of News Corp and Fox News. Mr Murdoch currently controls four of those votes, with his eldest children being in charge of one each.",
      "The trust agreement said that once Mr Murdoch died, his votes would be passed on to his four eldest children equally.",
      "However, differences in opinions and political views were said to lead to a family rift.",
      "The battle over changes to the trust was not about money, but rather power and control over the future of the Murdoch empire.",
      "The commissioner's ruling is not final. The court filing acts as a recommended resolution but a district judge will still weigh in and could choose to rule differently.",
      "The judge could take weeks or months to make a decision, which will not be available to the public.",

    "story": [
      "A nail artist said she cried after seeing the nails she created for Cynthia Erivo for the Wicked movie on the big screen.",
      "Shei Osei, 33 from Basildon, Essex, worked alongside the actress to create nail designs for her character Elphaba, having known each other for 15 years.",
      "She was also asked to do Erivo's nails for the green carpet when London's Southbank became the Emerald City for the premiere.",
      "\"I was able to watch it amongst everyone else... I cried. There are many bits that I cried at,\" she said.",
      "\"I'm very hard on myself when it comes to my work and what I do. I was checking to see if I had put it on properly, did I shape it properly and was the ombre good.\"",

      "She has built up a celebrity client base including Candice Brathwaite and Maya Jama and has worked on Erivo's nails before for Netflix film, Luther: The Fallen Sun.",
      "She received the call from Erivo in 2022 and soon started creating designs.",
      "\"As the story starts, Elphaba comes across a bit shy and a bit timid and not as out there, but she was able to have these subtle green ombr\u00e9 nails which were still daring,\" she said.",
      "\"When Elphaba comes into her own and she becomes more confident in who is she when she gets to the Emerald City... she has that confidence and her nails tell that story too. It's more of a daring design and more 'this is me, this is who I am and you will accept me for who I want to be'.\"",
      "'Authentically herself'",
      "She created more than 35 sets of press on nails, making sure they were all similar in style, colour, shape and design with each set taking up to 90 minutes.",
      "\"Cynthia outside of Elphaba is someone who enjoys getting her nails done... in the movie I feel like it tells the story of Elphaba but Cynthia can still feel authentically herself throughout the whole movie,\" she said.",
      "\"We always knew we wanted the nails to be a part of the film... she's touching the broom, she's putting her hat on. You would want your nails to match and look good on camera.\"",
      "Since working on the film, she has received an \"outpouring of love\" and global recognition.",
      "\"Everyone says they don't pay attention to nails, but in Wicked they paid attention to the nails. I'm grateful that my talent is being seen and I hope this can bring hope to other nail techs and other beauticians.",

      "Taylor Swift thanked her fans for making the Eras Tour \"the most exciting, powerful, electrifying, intense, most challenging\" experience of her life, as she played the closing show in Vancouver on Sunday.",
      "Prior to playing All Too Well, Swift told the audience in Canada that she had been \"touring since I was 15 years old\", but the experiences of the past 21 months had been \"completely unrecognisable\" from anything she'd ever done before.",
      "\"I never thought that writing one line about friendship bracelets would have you guys all making friendship bracelets, making friends and bringing joy to each other.",
      "\"That is the lasting legacy of this tour,\" she added. \"I couldn't be more proud of you.\"",
      "The lyric about friendship bracelets, from the song You're On Your Own Kid, spawned a cottage industry of hand-crafted accessories, which were swapped and traded by the millions of fans who attended the tour - including, at one London show, Sir Paul McCartney.",
      "Swift said the community her fans had created would always be \"what I think about when I think about this tour\".",
      "They responded by serenading Swift with a chorus of Happy Birthday - ahead of her turning 35 next Friday.",
      "\"You guys even sang a happy early birthday to Taylor?\" noted the tour's official social media account. \"We love you so much!\"",
      "Taylor Swift: As the Eras Tour bows out, what will she do next?",
      "Eras Tour reviewed: Pop's heartbreak princess dazzles in Edinburgh",
      "Why is Taylor Swift so big? 'She wants it more than anyone'",
      "The Eras Tour kicked off in Arizona in March 2023 with an epic, 44-song setlist that lasted more than three hours.",
      "The appetite for tickets was so great that Ticketmaster's systems broke down, prompting a hearing into the company in the US Senate.",
      "Despite that, more than 10.1 million tickets were sold for the tour's 149 shows, spanning five continents, over almost two years.",
      "Last December, it became the first tour in history to surpass $1bn (\u00a3786m) in ticket sales. At its conclusion, that figure totalled $2,077,618,725 (\u00a31.63 billion), said  Taylor Swift Touring, the star\u2019s production company.",
      "Merchandise has also proven to be a lucrative source of revenue, with estimates that it has brought in an extra $400m (\u00a3314m).",
      "The final stop was watched by more than 60,000 fans in Vancouver's BC Place stadium. One fan-hosted live-stream from the venue was followed by another 389,000 people on YouTube.",
      "Swift was in a nostalgic mood throughout, calling the show \"one last grand adventure\" with her fans.",
      "As she played Cardigan, from her pandemic-era album Folklore, the reality of the situation started to sink in.",
      "\"It's just crazy to think I'm going to sing the last song I ever sing in the Folklore cabin,\" she said. \"That's wild. Oh my God!\"",
      "And she paid tribute to her band, dancers and crew, \"who all left their families\" behind and \"performed when they were sick [or] anything was going on in their lives\" to keep the show on the road.",
      "Sentimental acoustic set",
      "For the acoustic set - which showcases songs missing from the standard setlist - the star said she had tried to choose tracks that \"really encapsulate how I feel\" about the final show.",
      "On guitar, she played a mash-up of A Place In This World, from her debut album, and 1989's New Romantics, with the apposite lyric: \"Heartbreak is the national anthem / We sing it proudly.\"",
      "Moving to the piano, she played Long Live, tweaking the words from \"It was the end of a decade\" to \"It was the end of an era\" - prompting a huge cheer from the audience.",
      "Continuing the theme, she added elements of New Year's Day, a song about holding on to memories, and The Manuscript, whose story of heartbreak became a metaphor for the tour coming to an end.",
      "\"Now and then I re-read the manuscript / But the story isn't mine anymore.\"",
      "Fans noted that the selection meant the acoustic sets had kicked off in 2023 with Tim McGraw, the first song in her discography, and ended with The Manuscript, the most recent.",
      "Only six songs from her 11 studio albums were not performed on the tour: That's When, Bye Bye Baby, Girl At Home, Ronan, Forever Winter and Soon You'll Get Better.",
      "Swift was watched from the audience by her mother Andrea - but her boyfriend, American football player Travis Kelce, had to miss the show to play (and win) a home game with his team, the Kansas City Chiefs.",
      "Fans had predicted she would use the last concert to announce her next career move. Top of their wish-list was the reveal of Reputation (Taylor's Version) - the latest in the star's plan to re-record the first six albums in her discography.",
      "In the end, there were no big surprises or special guests.",
      "Instead, the Eras Tour got to bow out on its own terms - celebrating 18 years of music that has united people around the world.",
      "As she cued up the set-closer, Karma, Swift thanked her fans one last time.",
      "\"I want to thank every single one of you for being a part of the most thrilling chapter of my entire life to date - my beloved Eras Tour.\"",
      "She dedicated the song to Kelce, changing the lyrics to \"Karma is the guy on The Chiefs coming straight home to me\", as she has done several times since they started dating last year.",
      "Over the dying notes of the song, Swift shared an emotional hug with her dancers and backing singers. And rather than making her traditional exit of being lowered beneath the stage, she opted to walk out with her team.",
      "It was, quite literally, the end of an era. We're unlikely to see another tour on this scale for a long time."

      "She said they gave a \"fascinating insight\" into events inside and outside the courtroom.",
      "The friction began with the death of Brian Epstein in 1967, which left a management vacuum.",
      "Klein, who had been the manager of the Rolling Stones, began to court Lennon in 1968, and George Harrison and Ringo Starr were soon on board.",
      "Once Klein was in, he brought in Spector to give the as yet unreleased Get Back sessions recordings his signature 'Wall of Sound' treatment - a radical departure from the pared back, as-live sound McCartney had wanted the album to have when The Beatles set about the project in January 1969.",
      "In April 1970, upon hearing the lush orchestral treatment given to The Long And Winding Road, McCartney wrote a terse letter to Klein in which he said he had considered orchestrating the song, but decided against it.",
      "He demanded many of the orchestral instruments be lowered in volume and the harp at the end of the song be removed completely.",
      "\"Don't ever do it again,\" he wrote.",
      "It would be another four years before the legal wrangles to finally break up the Beatles were complete.",
      "\u201cThe old saying in pop is 'where there is hit there\u2019s a writ',\" said litigation public relations expert Jonathan Coad.",
      "\"As Holly Johnson once said, 'The real kings of rock and roll are the lawyers',\" he added.",
      "High earners such as The Beatles were subject to a higher tax rate of about 90% in the mid-1960s, a situation that prompted George Harrison to write Taxman.",
      "But after Epstein's death it became clear that contrary to the sentiments of Harrison's Revolver album opening track, the taxman was not getting his hands on as much as he might have been.",
      "Kelly said the newly discovered documents show money was unaccounted for and the band\u2019s taxes had not been paid for years, which meant HMRC was chasing them without them even knowing it.",
      "Just a few months after Epstein's death from an accidental sleeping pills overdose, The Beatles formed Apple Corps, which they hoped would protect their financial interests.",
      "And Lennon wanted a strong figure at the helm. According to Klein himself, Lennon wanted \"a real shark - someone to keep the other sharks away\".",
      "McCartney was dubious about the man the New York Times called \"the toughest wheeler-dealer in the pop jungle\" and man who had said: \"Don't talk to me about ethics. Every man makes his own. It's like a war.\"",
      "Instead, McCartney wanted to draft in respected New York entertainment lawyer Lee Eastman, who in March 1969 had become his father-in-law.",
      "But under The Beatles' one-member one-vote democratic system, McCartney was outvoted: Klein was in, and on 10 April McCartney walked out and found himself \"suing [his] mates\".",
      "Kelly said the bundles from the bitter High Court battle showed the difficulties faced by the lawyers who represented both parties as they unravelled the complex finances.",
      "They showed many questions the legal teams raised during numerous meetings, such as, why was a written agreement not made and filed when Pete Best left the group and Starr joined?",
      "Others included how to approach Ringo Starr\u2019s disagreements over The White Album, and how to manage the growing tensions and disputes between The Beatles over film rights and clips used for Hey Jude, Revolution and Magical Mystery Tour.",
      "\"Most worrying of all to the lawyers at the time,\" said Kelly, \"was the 'chronic failure of Allen Klein and his company ABKO Music and Records Inc. to produce accounts going back to 1966, now being demanded by the Inland Revenue'.\"",
      "She added: \"Even though John, Paul, George, and Ringo had grown tired of being The Beatles, and wanted to record and perform as individual artists, this must have been a difficult time for each of them, especially having had such a close friendship and successful partnership.",
      "\"One of the lawyers even suggested during one meeting when they had gone round and round and round in circles, \u2018Would it be easier if The Beatles just retired?\u2019\"",
      "The lawsuit was a tricky balancing act for McCartney according to litigation PR expert Coad.",
      "\u201cWhen striking a deal, keeping your reputation is as important as the financial deal. The last thing Paul McCartney would have wanted was to lose his image as a loveable Beatle.\"",
      "He added: \"Lots of bands were ripped off in the '60s and '70s.",
      "\u201cBands made their money with song-writing royalties so who got the song-writing credit was very important. Take Queen for example: Brian May Freddie Mercury and Roger Taylor were concerned that John Deacon was missing out because he had not written songs.",
      "\u201cVery early on, and very wisely, all songs written by John Lennon or Paul McCartney were known as Lennon / McCartney songs to avoid arguments.\"",
      "However the break-up ruined the harmony between Lennon and McCartney.",
      "On McCartney's second post-split album Ram (1971) the song \"Too Many People\" included a swipe at Lennon and his partner Yoko Ono, whose presence was resented by the band.",
      "The line \"You took your lucky break and you broke it in two\" was interpreted as a dig by McCartney, who later said stunts like Lennon and Ono's \"bed-in for peace\" protest in Amsterdam \"got up his nose\".",
      "Lennon riposte was How Do You Sleep? on the Imagine album, with its barb \"The only thing you done was yesterday / And since you've gone you're just another day.\"",
      "Harrison had already written about Klein, the break-up and its aftermath in his song Beware of the Darkness, from his hugely successful and critically acclaimed first solo album, the prophetically titled All Things Must Pass.",
      "Beatles historian and writer Spencer Leigh said he believed talk of civil war within the band had been over-egged, and that Peter Jackson's 2021 documentary The Beatles: Get Back had shown \"that this period wasn\u2019t as acrimonious as some people have described it\".",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think Allen Klein was up to no good,\" he said. \"He was just looking after himself.\"",
      "But not only did Epstein's death on the August Bank Holiday weekend in 1967 come as the so-called Summer of Love was fading, in some ways it marked the start of what Harrison would figuratively describe in Here Comes The Sun as \"the long, cold lonely winter\".",
      "It would be a winter that would end in a cold, frosty legal battle.",
      "If the break-up were to happen today, Coad said, there would be larger legal teams and an army of forensic accountants, with both sides seeking to win the media war.",
      "But in a way, it might not ended so catastrophically for the Fab Four.",
      "\u201cThe big difference is that today bands might split for a few years and then get back together again, such as Oasis or The Eagles,\" said Coad.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 00:37:07 GMT",
    "summary": "The Chvrches singer on going solo, and the loneliness of being the only woman in a touring band.",
    "story": [
      "Lauren Mayberry is a peacemaker.",
      "Since 2011, she's been frontwoman of the Glaswegian band Chvrches, topping festival bills and the album charts with a trademark barrage of distorted synths and razor-sharp melodies.",
      "Mayberry was the baby of the band - just 23 when she joined, and years younger than her bandmates, Iain Cook and Martin Doherty.",
      "But their chemistry was instant. Chvrches' debut single, The Mother We Share, was written and recorded in 48 hours, using the only three synths they owned - but it became a word of mouth hit, earning them airplay on BBC Radio 1 and support slots with Passion Pit and Depeche Mode.",
      "In the press, they carefully presented themselves as a band, with each member receiving equal billing. But Mayberry says she worried about being the junior partner.",
      "\"I was always conscious that I was younger than the other guys, and they had a lot more experience,\" she says.",
      "\"They\u2019d been to music school, and I hadn't. So I always felt like I was on the back foot, in terms of where I sat in the hierarchy.\"",
      "That feeling was amplified during a 2019 tour of Australia.",
      "The itinerary gave the band a four-day break in Melbourne, and Mayberry was looking forward to spending the downtime with her bandmates and the crew - until she discovered they'd made separate plans and she was stranded in her hotel room.",
      "\"I remember being very upset and hurt by that because I was always worrying about everyone else and taking care of everybody, and it was a humbling moment,\" she says.",
      "\"In the end, I hired a little car and drove to an Australian spa town and had a wee cry listening to Taylor Swift\u2019s Cruel Summer.\"",
      "Looking back, she thinks that being the only woman in the touring party left her carrying the \"emotional labour\" of keeping the show on the road.",
      "\"I feel like I twisted myself into a pretzel sometimes to make everyone happy.",
      "\"Then I\u2019d look back and think, \u2018And were you happy?'",
      "\"Not really, but I was keeping the peace.\"",
      "She considered leaving the band after that Australian incident. Then Covid struck, and Chvrches ended up making a fourth album, 2021's Screen Violence, remotely.",
      "She finally took the plunge a year later, but not before signing a new record deal with her bandmates, assuring the future of the project.",
      "\"I was conscious it would give people a sense of security, that I\u2019d made a commitment,\" she says.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s how it actually works, but that was my hope.\"",
      "She\u2019s keen to stress there\u2019s no bad blood: Doherty and Cook have given her their full support. Still, it\u2019s natural for someone leaving a band to define themselves in opposition to that music - otherwise what\u2019s the point?",
      "As Mayberry succinctly puts it: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make a crap knock-off Chvrches record.\u201d",
      "In recording sessions, she'd flinch when anyone pulled out a vintage synth. Instead, she pursued a more organic, lyrics-first approach.",
      "But after a decade in a trio, the instinct to compromise was hard-wired.",
      "\u201cI'm very used to arguing my point, then trying to see other people's point of view,\" she says.",
      "\"So it was a real learning curve to be like, \u2018No, this is my opinion, and if I don't think it's right, then it's not right, and that's the end of the conversation'.\u201d",
      "Crying wolf",
      "The result is Vicious Creature, an album that showcases new depths to Mayberry\u2018s voice, which fluctuates between vulnerability and venom, while paying homage to her pop heroines.",
      "She channels the spirit of All Saints on the album opener Something In The Air; and borrows the choppy, sampled strings of Annie Lennox's Walking On Broken Glass to power the single Crocodile Tears.",
      "The latter is a furious riposte to an emotionally manipulative man, where Mayberry snarls: \u201cWhat a man will say just to get his way / Always crying wolf, so I\u2019m sad to say / I don\u2019t really wanna hear it from you, babe\".",
      "The singer says she's role-playing in that song, inspired by the dark, subversive femininity of Velma Kelly in the musical Chicago, or Cabaret's Sally Bowles.",
      "It's one of several songs that survived the first incarnation of the album - tentatively titled Fiction - that would be \"dark, theatrical and character driven\".",
      "Slowly, over time, more personal songs started to creep into the mix.",
      "The syncopated pulse of Change Shapes is a condemnation of music industry sexism (\"I'm a doll inside a box, with a ball and a chain\"). Sorry, Etc tells a similar story over a chaotic hybrid of garage rock and drum & bass.",
      "\"There were definitely a few songs where it was at best expressing frustrations and at worst [feeling] kind of hurt,\" about her life in music, Mayberry says.",
      "The album's most intimate moment is a muted piano ballad called Oh, Mother.",
      "Over three verses, Mayberry documents the shifting relationship with her mother - from the unquestioning love of childhood to adolescent disgust and, finally, the realisation that their time together is limited.",
      "\"It kills me to know you won't be around,\" she sings gently. \"Oh mother, what will I do without you?\"",
      "The last song written for the record, the words poured out after Mayberry's friend and co-writer Dan McDougall sketched out the chords in the studio.",
      "Discussing the lyrics, which were inspired by a family illness, the singer becomes a little emotional.",
      "\"When you're living in the shadow of things like that, it's on your mind all the time,\" she says.",
      "\"I think about it all the time. When I go away on tour, I always think, \u2018Oh, is this the tour where I'm gone and I miss it\u2019.",
      "\"So that last afternoon in the studio was quite a weepy one... But then we went to Nando's. So it's all about balance.\"",
      "Oh, Mother is the sort of song she could never have written in Chvrches, Mayberry says.",
      "\"It's not a place that we would go emotionally or sonically,\" she says.",
      "\"I think the best songs happen when the lyrics and the meaning and the sonics interlink but [with Chvrches] I was writing things in my notebooks and thinking, \u2018This is never going to fit with what the band have built\u2019.\"",
      "Change is never easy, though. While some reviews have called the album a \"masterclass in pop alchemy\", others have said Mayberry \"still sounds like someone finding their feet\".",
      "Fans of Chvrches' industrial sound have expressed disappointment too, but the singer has learned to distance herself from criticism.",
      "\"When people are like, \u2018Screw you\u2019, I rationalise it like this: You\u2019re mad at me, but you're mad at me because life is hard, and our music made your life a bit easier for a minute. And now you're like, \u2018Please don't take that away.\u2019",
      "\"When I was 24, that was overwhelming, but it made sense once I could compartmentalise it.",
      "\"You are the representative of something that means so much to this person - so when you do something else, it threatens the idea of that existing.\"",
      "The flipside of that equation comes in concert. When Mayberry plays a song like Asking For A Friend, with its reassuring mantra, \"you still matter\", she often sees \"someone in the audience having a wee dance-cry\".",
      "\"And when people cry, I cry. Everyone's like, 'Are you ok?' but I'm just caught up in the moment.",
      "\"But I hope that\u2019s why I\u2019m good at my job, because I have some kind of empathy.",
      "\"It\u2019s inconvenient for my life, but hopefully good for the crowd.\""

      "\"Just because Dave's passed it doesn't stop him being my best mate,\" says TV chef Si King. \"That's not how that works. You know, you're mates for life and death.\"",
      "It's been over nine months since Si's best friend and Hairy Bikers co-star, Dave Myers, died at the age of 66 from cancer.",
      "\"I'm always talking to him. I'll go, 'What do you think of that dude?' I mean, people will think I've lost my mind,\" says Si.",
      "Their brotherhood first began over a love of motorcycles, curry, poppadoms, beer, and a game of pool, says Si. They went on to become the nation's favourite hairy cooking duo, dressed in leathers and throwing away the rule book when it came to TV cooking shows. With not one Michelin Star between them, their approach to cooking was refreshingly down-to-earth.",
      "\"It took us two series to work out that we probably should be using Pyrex bowls so people could see what we were putting in them,\" laughs Si.",
      "With 25 years of memories in their back catalogue, he says it is his duty to look after Dave's memory and \"to look after the legacy that he built,\" and \"the legacy of the Hairy Bikers that [they] both built.\"",
      "Si is honouring Dave's life in a special one-off documentary due to air before Christmas on BBC Two.",
      "\"It is about a celebration of my best mate and so it should be, because he was wonderful, and remains to be wonderful, because his energy's still about, that's for sure.\"",
      "In June this year, biking groups from across the UK headed in a procession from London to Dave's hometown in Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria to mark his life and raise money for charity. The idea for the event, dubbed Dave Day, came from a drunken conversation after Dave's funeral with Lili, Dave's widow, says Si.",
      "\"Lil picked up on a social media post that somebody said, 'I'm having a Dave Day, so instead of having a good day, just say have a Dave Day, because Dave was always positive, even right to the very end.\"",
      "There are no superlatives in the English language that can describe the event, says Si. He was overwhelmed by the sense of fellowship and community, but \"there's a frustration in it as well that I just wish he'd been there\", he says.",
      "Si and Dave started their TV careers behind the camera - Si as an assistant director and Dave as a makeup artist. They turned their love of cooking, eating and riding their bikes into a successful cooking travelogue.",
      "\"We were very lucky that the BBC let two\u2026 hippies out on the Great British public,\" says Si.",
      "\"It was a wonderful opportunity for two relatively ordinary blokes to be in extraordinary circumstances, being a conduit of other people's stories from around the world,\" he adds.",
      "But typically with the hairy bikers, not everything always went to plan -  like the time they filmed the pilot episode of their show and were meant to fly off together in a glider - but couldn't get off the ground because they were too heavy. Or the time Si put chips on blue tissue paper to dry and it dyed them blue.",
      "Throughout their travels they wanted to shine a light on different cultures and the foods of that region. In Japan, the duo even tried their hand at sumo wrestling and Si remembers Dave had gone the extra mile to make sure he looked good in his loincloth.",
      "\"This is what he was like, right,\" says Si, \"He'd done his bikini line, I remember, and I went, 'You've done your\u2026 What! A born makeup artist.",
      "\"'No, it's got to look aesthetically pleasing,' Si remembers Dave saying.",
      "Growing up in the north \u2013 Dave in the north-west and Si in the north-east \u2013 they both came from working class backgrounds. Dave's mum was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) when he was young and Dave became a carer for her early on. He was just eight years old when he cooked his first meal for the family of cheese and potato pie.",
      "\"On top of all of that, during his adolescence, he had alopecia and I think the way that Dave approached his life was indicative of his childhood really,\" says Si. \"He wore those scars a little bit, of course he did, as everybody would, but it never stopped his enthusiasm for life though.\"",
      "The bikers' strong bond was even apparent on Dave's wedding day to his wife Lili.",
      "\"I mean [Lili] finds it funny, but I'm sure at the time she found it pretty irritating. Dave would always go, 'Kingy, come on man, get in man, we're having a photograph'. I'm going, 'Dude, it's your wedding day, I'm in every photograph. Lil's going to go mad when she sees them.' He was like, 'No, no, no, come in.'\"",
      "Si says he even spent Valentine's Day with the couple. Right from the very beginning, they were like \"two old slippers\" says Si, albeit that they were very different people. Dave was comedic and Si says he fell into the role of playing off Dave's daftness.",
      "One egg is never an oeuf - was just one of the jokes Si heard Dave repeat - over and over again. The similes were also never-ending, says Si.",
      "\"Oh, look at that, Kingy,\" Dave would say, \"It's lighter than a hummingbird's toenail clippings.\"",
      "Or \"the onion is now more transparent than a bank manager's smile\".",
      "But the Hairy Bikers' main mission was to empower people to get back into the kitchen and cook, says Si, as food is the glue that binds us together - something that has been made even harder today with the stress and time pressures facing working families trying to earn a living.",
      "\"I understood, as did Dave, the importance of actually sitting round a table when we were little, because that's what formed us as adults,\" says Si. \"And it was important, because you could see if your mum wasn't very well, or dad was a bit grumpy.\"",
      "A second Dave Day event has been planned for June 2025. But as for what the future holds for Si, he says if he worked on another cookery programme, it would have to be \"a marked change\" from the shows he created with Dave.",
      "Si says he knows his best mate would want him to continue to work on new projects, however.",
      "\"I think in the spirit of the bikers, Dave would want me to continue to have fun and to educate, to inform, to enlighten, to be slightly edgy,\" he says.",

      "Clara Bow, a track from her latest album The Tortured Poets Department, is a barbed commentary on the industry's lust for new blood.",
      "Other songs find her daydreaming about wedding rings and \"pushin' strollers\" - so there's every possibility Swift will take a year off to focus on her romance with American football star Travis Kelce.",
      "\"She probably will take a break,\" says West, \"but she's not one that necessarily sits still. She's always creating. She's always coming up with new projects.\"",
      "If Swift does head back to the studio, singer-songwriter Self Esteem hopes she'll spend the cultural (and financial) capital she's built up over the last two years to do something unexpected.",
      "\"If I was her, I'd indulge myself in making music in all the different genres and styles I hadn't been able to explore because of branding and expectations,\" she says.",

      "Anna Wintour walks into our interview with her trademark dark glasses firmly on.",
      "I\u2019m meeting the woman who has been editor-in-chief of Vogue magazine since 1988 at VOGUE: Inventing the Runway, the show dreamt up by Wintour about the history of the catwalk.",
      "Our rendezvous is in a large underground space and we\u2019re surrounded by three vast screens. It\u2019s fairly dark inside but the sunglasses remain in place during our conversation.",
      "I tentatively ask what they\u2019re for. Are they a shield or for something more prosaic, short-sightedness perhaps?",
      "\u201cThey help me see and they help me not see,\u201d Wintour tells me, somewhat enigmatically. \u201cThey help me be seen and not be seen. They are a prop, I would say\u201d.",
      "The Lightroom in London uses digital projection and audio technology in a high-walled space to generate an immersive experience for visitors.",
      "It has previously hosted a blockbuster David Hockney show and Tom Hanks\u2019s exhibition on the history of space travel.",
      "Now the exhibition space gives audiences a front-row seat at some of the most spectacular fashion shows in history, tapping into Vogue\u2019s archive and contributor network.",
      "Wintour admits that \u201cfor someone who goes to so many shows, you get a little, not jaded, but you get used to the experience\".",
      "Since most visitors to the exhibition will not have had the chance to attend such events, she says they were keen to make sure it felt as though they were actually there.",
      "As the reigning queen of the fashion world, Wintour has had a real front-row seat for decades - often on a delicate gold chair, the kind of furniture that is ubiquitous at the high end catwalk viewings where her invitation is always a dead cert.",
      "In the blurb to the exhibition, Wintour writes that she has \u201cprobably spent a year of my life waiting for fashion shows, which are famously tardy, to begin\u201d.",
      "She tells me the American designer Marc Jacobs once held a runway show that was an hour and a half late, but \u201cwe all yelled at him so much after that, the next season, he not only started the show on time, he actually started five minutes early\u201d.",
      "The Italian designer Gianni Versace, though, was \u201calways on time\u201d,",
      "\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter who wasn\u2019t there, it could have been the Pope, he didn\u2019t care\u201d.",
      "That would have suited Wintour, who is \u201chorribly punctual, usually early\u201d.",
      "She arrives early for our interview. Fortunately, I\u2019d been warned it was a character trait and we were ready.",
      "The Vogue show offers audiences a series of vibrant chapters, narrated by Cate Blanchett, which tell the story of fashion and the runway.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite nostalgic to sit in the space and look at the incredible changes that have happened in fashion,\" Wintour tells me.",
      "We\u2019re treated to a series of the magazine's front covers from the early days, black and white footage of the first catwalk shows and images of the couture salons of the early twentieth century.",
      "Fashion then was \u201cvery elitist - you had to be invited and it was a very tight little world,\u201d says Wintour.",
      "Contrast that with the debut show by the musician and entrepreneur Pharrell Williams for Louis Vuitton in 2023. A pop-culture event, it was held on the Pont Neuf in Paris, with the likes of Beyonce, Rihanna and of course Wintour in attendance, and got one billion views online.",
      "The democratisation of fashion means, as Wintour puts it, \u201cnow everyone can come to the party, which is as it should be\u201d.",
      "The exhibition also takes us back to 2017 when Karl Lagerfeld devised a space-station inspired runway set, complete with a rocket blasting off as models stood beside it decked in Chanel. Wintour told me it was \u201cextraordinary\u2026 and you couldn't wait to see what he was going to come up with next\u201d.",
      "Lagerfeld had form. Ten years earlier for Fendi, he had broken new ground, using the Great Wall of China as a catwalk, his models parading along the stone. Fashion designers of his stature clearly don\u2019t do things by halves.",
      "To insiders, Wintour has been one of the most significant players in fashion for the best part of 40 years - a maker of careers, an advocate for the power of fashion to meld with the A-list of entertainment.",
      "She\u2019s the driving force behind the annual Met Gala in New York, which sees the worlds of fashion and fame collide and go viral in a spectacle of outrageous outfits and celebrity appearances on the first Monday of every May.",
      "Those not on the inside are more likely to wonder just how closely Wintour resembles Miranda Priestly, the fictional tyrannical magazine boss from the film The Devil Wears Prada, whose portrayal by Meryl Streep is seared into the memories of fans.",
      "\u201cIs there some reason that my coffee isn\u2019t here? Has she died or something?\u201d Priestly inquires dismissively about her assistant.",
      "\u201cDetails of your incompetence do not interest me,\u201d she later tells her.",
      "On Wintour\u2019s trip to London, she leant in to the comparison, attending the gala performance of the new musical version of the film. There, she told the BBC that it was \"for the audience and for the people I work with to decide if there are any similarities between me and Miranda Priestly\u201d.",
      "When we spoke, I wanted to know if she finds the public persona of Anna Wintour - the sharp, bobbed hair, the meticulous outfits, the glasses - a role she feels she has to perform.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really think about it,\" she says. \"What I\u2019m really interested in is the creative aspect of my job.\"",
      "Wintour tells me she only brought one or two suitcases with her to London and she won\u2019t be drawn on whether she dresses down when she\u2019s at home in the US. \"It\u2019s really about respect in how you present yourself.\"",
      "More than one person has told me that nobody ever says 'no' to Wintour. Donatella Versace says the same in the recent Disney documentary, In Vogue: The 90s.",
      "Wintour demurs. \u201cThat is absolutely untrue. They often say no, but that\u2019s a good thing. No is a wonderful word\u201d.",
      "Do you think people are frightened of you, I ask her. \u201cI hope not,\u201d she replies.",
      "Under her leadership, through talent, force of personality and an eye for what sells, Wintour has tried to future proof Vogue, turning it into a global brand. She is also global content advisor for Conde Nast, the magazine's publisher.",
      "In the modern era, when influencers can take photos of fashion moments and pump them out immediately, Wintour has successfully positioned Vogue as an arbiter of taste and style.",
      "Fashion and advertising are entwined in Vogue's content but Wintour doesn\u2019t accept my premise that fashion journalism can be sycophantic.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s simply not true and it\u2019s sometimes, I think, frustrating to us that work in fashion, that there is an outside perception fashion is frivolous and superficial.",
      "\"In fact, it\u2019s a huge business. We give employment to millions of people around the world.\"",
      "I take that answer to mean that Wintour, the daughter of a former editor of the Evening Standard newspaper, sees herself more as a fashion ambassador than a journalist.",
      "But of course she is also a journalist, arguably one of the most famous journalistic faces on the planet - and one that has no obvious successor.",
      "I ask her, at 75, how much longer she plans to stay in her role.",
      "\u201cI have no plans to leave my job,\u201d she says, adding: \u201cCurrently.\u201d",

    "summary": "Culture editor Katie Razzall explores what the allegations against the MasterChef host mean for the corporation.",
    "story": [
      "Presenter Gregg Wallace is a national figure, who has been in people\u2019s living rooms several times a week for 20 years.",
      "His programmes, most prominently MasterChef, are made by independent production companies.",
      "But his name and face are associated with the BBC, and, as allegations continue to emerge, the corporation is under fire.",
      "It\u2019s the last thing it needs, so soon after other high profile scandals including the disgraced BBC News presenter Huw Edwards.",
      "The BBC has questions to answer about the allegations over what it knew about Wallace\u2019s behaviour on and off set, and - if it was alerted to these types of allegations - what it did about them.",
      "BBC News has been made aware of two occasions when complaints were made. One, by the radio host Aasmah Mir, related to Celebrity MasterChef in 2017.",
      "She says she complained to the production company behind the show and later spoke to the BBC\u2019s Kate Phillips who was then controller for entertainment commissioning. I understand Phillips was later assured that the issue had been addressed.",
      "Another complaint, just a year afterwards, concerned Impossible Celebrities, made by a different production company.",
      "In a letter from 2018 seen by BBC News, Phillips wrote that she had spoken to Wallace for 90 minutes to make clear what the BBC expected of him. She also confirmed in the letter that many aspects of his behaviour were unacceptable and unprofessional.",
      "Six years on, the emerging allegations about Wallace\u2019s conduct raise questions about whether executives - at the production company Banijay and the BBC - reacted appropriately.",
      "But BBC News has not been told whether the BBC executives involved in Wallace\u2019s shows were made aware of any complaints about him after 2018 and the conversation between him and Phillips. If they weren\u2019t, there is some plausible deniability that they thought the issues raised had been sorted.",
      "Then again, that defence may only go so far. There are wider questions about how much a TV executive should probe, if they are aware that rumours have begun to swirl.",
      "Popbitch, the weekly celebrity newsletter that makes its way into the inboxes of most media executives, had run stories involving allegations about Wallace\u2019s language and behaviour in the past, for example. When does the odd gossipy claim about talent misbehaviour become an issue bosses should take a look at?",
      "Should more questions have been asked by the BBC after 2018?",
      "Some have made the point that these types of scandals involving high profile TV presenters only seem to emerge when the media shines a light on them.",
      "It\u2019s only then, it is argued, that executives take action and launch an investigation. The claim is that before journalists get involved, the executives are more concerned with protecting the star, the show and their bottom line.",
      "In light of Huw Edwards, the BBC launched a workplace review into preventing abuses of power. At the time, the BBC chair Samir Shah said there \"continues to be a sense that powerful people 'get away with it'.\"",
      "But for me, how the Wallace claims may have been handled isn\u2019t entirely comparable to the Edwards scandal.",
      "Huw Edwards was employed directly by the BBC, Wallace is contracted by production companies that make his shows and sell them to the BBC.",
      "To put this in context, 326 independent companies made programmes for the BBC in the year 2023/4, accounting for 55% of the BBC\u2019s TV hours.",
      "I have picked up some frustration on the corporate side of the BBC that the corporation is taking criticism for a programme that it doesn't make.",
      "A BBC insider told me it essentially bought a product from a third party and is now being held to account for the actions of staff in a different organisation.",
      "My assessment is that if there were complaints - or claims of bad behaviour on set - the first port of call would have been the production company.",
      "But that defence - that the BBC is at arm's length on this one - only goes so far. Audiences don\u2019t make that distinction. In the end, they associate Wallace with the BBC, not a production company.",
      "The damage rests at the BBC\u2019s door.",

      "The workplace review will aim to look at how to ensure that junior people with less power feel able to speak up, when a presenter is behaving badly. The director general Tim Davie has already said he\u2019d like to ban the word \"talent\" for the BBC\u2019s stars, to help end the hierarchies that can be a part of programme making when powerful, highly paid people with audience recognition are involved.",
      "But, understandably, the review won\u2019t have oversight of the independent sector. These are independent companies responsible for their own codes.",
      "It would however be useful for the review to lay out what BBC processes are triggered when rumours begin to emerge about a particular star and what the BBC expects from its executives and indeed the production companies it buys programmes from.",
      "Philippa Childs, the head of union Bectu, told Radio 4 on Wednesday \"the time has come for the whole industry to come together and accept that there does need to be some independent scrutiny of how broadcasters [and] production companies work, to try and address this endemic problem\".",

      "In the hours before his death, he was left naked in a room with CCTV cameras, but his family said the alarm was only raised after he was found unresponsive by staff.",
      "His parents, Graeme and Sam Morrison, are now calling for answers about what went wrong with their son's care.",
      "Mrs Morrison said: \"He was left to his own devices in a surrounding that he couldn't understand, with no stimuli, bright lights and bare walls.\"",
      "In March 2022, Declan spent 10 days in the Section 136 mental health assessment suite, as there were no beds available across the UK.",
      "But he could not cope with the austere, clinical environment which, under the Mental Health Act, should be used for a maximum of 24 hours.",
      "The suite was described by coroner Simon Milburn as \"wholly inappropriate\" for Declan's needs.",
      "Mr Morrison believed the decision to rely on CCTV and not interact with Declan might have \"exacerbated the situation\".",
      "The coroner said staff in the facility had not been appropriately trained to care for patients with learning disabilities.",
      "Mrs Morrison said she only found out something was wrong with Declan on 18 March 2022 when he was in the ambulance.",
      "\u201cTo find out actually your son now needs a brain operation to live - it was horrifying,\u201d she said.",
      "Declan underwent emergency surgery but never recovered. He died on 2 April 2022.",
      "From 2014 to 2021, Declan lived in Sunndach House near Peterborough, run by Kisimul, a company owned by a Luxembourg-based investment fund.",
      "In 2019, following a review of Declan's needs, it was concluded the facility could no longer provide the appropriate level of care to protect him.",
      "Yet in 2021 Declan was still living in Sunndach House.",
      "Declan's family said his behaviour had worsened after some of his carers left to work at a nearby Amazon warehouse for an extra 50p an hour.",
      "\"Something as simple as 50p is making a difference, and it's affecting our children,\" Mrs Morrison said.",
      "At the same time Declan was struggling to understand the loss of familiar carers, his family said his medication was also changed.",
      "In evidence given by an independent psychiatrist at his inquest in October, the jury heard how side effects to the new drugs could have made his behaviour worse.",
      "In May 2021, Declan was moved to Yewdale Farm in Willingham, Cambridgeshire, a residential care home run by CareTech Community Services.",
      "A safeguarding report entitled Something has to Change, which was compiled by the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Safeguarding Partnership after Declan's death, noted there was a high level of agency staff caring for him.",
      "Yet his father said Declan had \"spent most of his time on his own as they [staff] couldn't interact with him.\"",
      "CareTech said when Declan had been \"responsive\" to staff's engagement, they would directly support him. If he did not want to interact, staff would sit in an adjoining room and observe him through a window.",
      "At Yewdale Farm Declan had jumped over fences and assaulted a staff member.",
      "In February 2022, CareTech said that it could no longer meet Declan's needs and he needed clinical care.",
      "Sixty-seven facilities across the UK were approached to care for Declan, but none were able to offer him a placement, according to the family's lawyer.",
      "In a letter to the government and the NHS, the coroner said: \"Demand for such placements outstrips supply \u2013 providers are effectively able to \u2018pick and choose\u2019 who they offer placements to.\"",

      "\"It can't just be as simple as 'we can't keep your son or daughter safe'.\u201d",
      "Caretech said it did not \"pick and choose\" its residents.",
      "In March 2022 Declan suffered an episode of heightened anxiety and he was detained by police officers under the Mental Health Act.",
      "He was taken to an emergency \"place of safety\", known as Section 136 suite, on the site of Fulbourn Hospital in Cambridgeshire.",
      "The suite is designed for patients awaiting a mental health assessment. Declan  stayed there for 10 days instead of the stipulated 24 hours.",

      "To hit the target, the NHS needs to see 95% of patients within four hours of them arriving. Figures for October shows just 73% are.",
      "Unprecedented demand",
      "Speaking after the meeting, which was attended by 700 health leaders either in person or remotely, Streeting said: \"We inherited a broken NHS that saw annual winter crisis as the norm. This year, we're seeing record pressures on services as we move into December.",
      "\"I want to see patient safety prioritised as we brace ourselves for the coming months. I'm asking trusts to focus on ambulance delays, handovers and the longest A&E waits.\"",
      "NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard, who hosted the meeting, said the health service was facing \"unprecedented demand\" heading into winter.",
      "\"Patient safety must be paramount and speaking to local leaders today, the message was clear: we need every part of the NHS and social care partners, working together to manage demand and ensure patients with the most urgent needs are prioritised,\" she said.",
      "Dr Tim Cooksley, of the Society for Acute Medicine, said it was \"concerning\" the health secretary felt the need to spell out what the priorities should be for staff on the frontline.",
      "\"The stark reality is not that hospitals and staff on the frontline are manipulating targets, but that they are simply unable to deliver safe care even when trying their utmost to do so given the impossible situations they are in.\"",
      "He also accused the government of lacking a coherent strategy to tackle the pressures in the emergency care system, pointing to the fact the government has made it one of the key missions to deliver the 18-week target for non-urgent care this parliament, while not making the same commitment for the four-hour A&E target.",
      "Last year in opposition Labour said they would hit all the key NHS performance targets including A&E, but this was not in the manifesto and has not been repeated since the election with ministers saying they cannot guarantee that the four-hour target will be hit."

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 00:43:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The government has pledged to determine the evidence - and establish whether the benefits outweigh any potential harms of prescribing puberty blockers to children questioning their gender",
    "story": [
      "It is among the most delicate and controversial challenges in modern medicine - how to determine whether the benefits of puberty blockers (or drugs that delay puberty) outweigh the potential harms.",
      "This question came to the fore in June 2023 when NHS England proposed that in the future, these drugs would only be prescribed to children questioning their gender as part of clinical research.",
      "Since then, a new government has arrived in Westminster and Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he is committed to \"setting up a clinical trial\" to establish the evidence on puberty blockers. The National Institute for Health and Care Research is expected to confirm soon that funding is in place for a trial.",
      "The dilemma that remains is, how will such a trial work?",
      "Eighteen months since the announcement there is still a lack of consensus around how the trial should be conducted. It will also need to be approved by a committee of experts who have to decide, among other things, whether what's being tested might cause undue physical or psychological harm.",
      "But there is a second unanswered question that some, but by no means all, scientists have that is more pressing than the first: is it right to perform this particular trial on children and young people at all?",
      "A rapid rise in referrals",
      "When the Gender and Identity Development Service (GIDS) was established at London's Tavistock Clinic in 1989, it was the only NHS specialist gender clinic for children in England, and those referred there were typically offered psychological and social support.",
      "Over the last 10 years, however, there has been a rapid increase in referrals - with the greatest increase being people registered female at birth. In a separate development, around the same time the approach of typically offering psychological and social support moved to one of onward referrals to services that prescribed hormone drugs, such as puberty blockers.",
      "Known scientifically as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, puberty blockers work on the brain to stop the rise in sex hormones - oestrogen and testosterone - that accompany puberty. For years, they were prescribed to young patients with gender dysphoria (those who feel their gender identity is different from their biological sex). But in March 2024, NHS England stopped the routine prescribing of puberty blockers to under 18s, as part of an overhaul of children's gender identity services.",
      "NHS England said in a policy statement: \"There is not enough evidence to support the safety or clinical effectiveness of PSH [puberty suppressing hormones] to make the treatment routinely available at this time.\"",
      "The ban was later tightened to apply to private clinics as well.",
      "In April 2024, a review of gender identity services for children and young people, led by Dr Hilary Cass, a past president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, published its final report, which called out the \"field of gender care\" for not taking a cautious and careful approach.",
      "She also reported that the change in practice at GIDS away from one primarily relying on psychological and social support was largely based on a single study that looked at the effect of medical interventions such as puberty blockers on a very narrowly defined group of children and there was a lack of follow up in the longer term.",
      "Elsewhere, some other countries were re-examining puberty blockers too. Scotland paused the use of them while Finland, Sweden, France, Norway, and Denmark have all re-evaluated their positions on medical intervention for under 18s - including puberty blockers - to differing degrees. In other places there is still support for the use of puberty blockers.",
      "In medicine, when there is genuine uncertainty as to whether the benefits of a treatment outweigh the harms - called equipoise - some ethicists argue there's a moral obligation to scientifically study such treatments. But there are some from across the debate who don't think there is equipoise in this case.",
      "The ethical dilemma at the heart of the trial",
      "The BBC has learned details about the arguments going on around the concept of a trial and how it could look. Some argue that there is already evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health, and that in light of this it would be unethical to perform a trial at all because this would mean some young people experiencing gender distress would not be given them.",
      "The World Professional Association of Transgender Health (WPATH) has expressed their concern about the trial for this reason. They support the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgery. WPATH, who have faced increasing criticism of their guidelines from some clinicians, say that it is ethically problematic to make participation in a trial the only way to access a type of care that is \"evidence based, widely recognised as medically necessary, and often reported as lifesaving.\"",
      "Meanwhile other clinicians believe there is no good evidence that puberty blockers can help with mental health at all. They also point to research that questions the negative impact that the drugs might have on brain development among teenagers, as well as evidence around the negative impact on bone density.",
      "Dr Louise Irvine is a GP and co-chair of the Clinical Advisory Network on Sex and Gender which says it is cautious about using medical pathways in gender dysphoric children. She says: \"Given that puberty blockers by definition disrupt a crucial natural phase of human development, the anticipated benefits must be tangible and significant to justify the risk to children.",
      "\"In pushing ahead with a puberty blockers trial, we are concerned that political interests are being prioritised over clinical, ethical and scientific concerns, and over the health and wellbeing of children.\"",
      "The NHS adult gender services holds data that tracks 9,000 young people from the youth service. Some argue that this should be scrutinised before any trial goes ahead as it could provide evidence on, among other things, the potential risks of taking puberty blockers.",
      "But there is a third view held by some others, including Gordon Guyatt, a professor at McMaster University in Canada, who points out that randomised trials are done in \"life-threatening stuff all the time\" where no-one can be sure of the long-term effects of a treatment. In his view it would be \"unethical not to do it\".",
      "\"With only low quality evidence, people's philosophies, their attitudes or their politics, will continue to dominate the discussion,\" he argues. \"If we do not generate better evidence, the destructive, polarised debate will continue.\"",
      "- Dr Cass found the existing research in the field was poor quality and that there was not a reliable enough evidence base to base clinical decisions on. Young people involved in many of the existing studies may have also had interventions including psychological support and other medical treatments and so it was not always possible to disentangle the effect of each different treatment.",
      "- When it comes to suppressing puberty by using drugs, the rationale for doing so \"remains unclear\", Dr Cass said.  One of the original reasons given was to allow time to think by delaying the onset of puberty. But the evidence suggests the vast majority who start on puberty blockers go on to take cross-sex hormones - oestrogen or testosterone. It is not clear why but one theory, the Cass report suggests, is that puberty blockers may, in their own right, change the \"trajectory\" of gender identity development.",
      "- Clinicians \"are unable to determine with any certainty\" which young people \"will go on to have an enduring trans identity\", Dr Cass wrote. In other words, there's a lack of clarity about which young people might benefit in the long term and which may be harmed overall by the process.",
      "How the trial could look",
      "Recruitment for the trial is due to start in 2025, months later than originally anticipated. Young people will likely be referred after a full assessment by specialist clinicians. A lot is still to be determined, including how many participants there will be.",
      "Ultimately the scientists running the trials will need to establish whether people who get an intervention are better off than those who do not. In this case, do the puberty blocking drugs and their effect make the young people better off?",
      "\"Better off\" in this instance includes the extent to which a young person's mental health may be improved if they are happy with their body. Quality of life is determined by various factors including self-confidence and self-esteem. As well as getting the personal views from the young people and parents, the trial could measure actual real life changes, such as time spent in education and time spent with family and friends.",
      "But there are potential harms to study too, such as the possibility of reduced bone density. Some scientists suggest examining the impact on learning using a form of IQ test.",
      "Normal brain development is influenced by both puberty and chronological age, which usually act in tandem during adolescence. It's not clear how this is affected when puberty is suppressed. Brain scans are one way of understanding any effect.",
      "Some scientists believe it may be possible to simply randomly assign trial participants into two groups where one gets puberty blockers, the other gets a placebo and nobody is aware which group they're in.",
      "But others believe a placebo group is impossible. They say the placebo group would go through puberty, realise they weren't on puberty blockers and potentially drop out of the trial or even find other ways to obtain puberty blockers. Either scenario would reduce the validity of the results.",
      "Professor Gordon Guyatt and others have outlined a potential trial where the group of patients not receiving drugs would be made up entirely of children who are keen to socially transition, such as by changing how they dress and altering their name and pronouns. Researchers could then monitor the difference between the groups.",
      "A second possibility is that both trial groups are given puberty blockers but one group gets them after a delay, during which time they receive psychological and emotional support. This would help researchers determine, among other things, whether their gender-related distress subsides during that delay while receiving the support.",
      "Alongside this there would be a \"matched\" control group that doesn't take a placebo or puberty blockers, whether for health reasons or because they don't want to, that get similar tests and scans.",
      "Puberty occurs in stages when different bodily changes occur. A third proposal could involve a second group being given drugs at a later stage in puberty than the first.",
      "This would allow researchers to explore when the right time to give puberty blockers might be. For example, it would enable the researchers to see if starting the drugs early improves wellbeing by reducing gender-specific body changes. They would also be able to see whether starting the drugs earlier has a greater negative impact on bone density and brain development.",
      "Children referred to GIDS also experienced higher rates of anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and autism compared to the general child population. Trial participants would continue to receive treatment related to these conditions but - so we know any differences in the results from the groups are down to the drug - they will need to be balanced for the above conditions.",
      "All these considerations demonstrate the complexity of trying to obtain evidence in this area that is reliable and definitive.",
      "What parents say",
      "Many parents are watching closely to see how it will play out. Annabel (not her real name) is one of them. She is part of the Bayswater Group, a collection of parents with children who are questioning their gender who say they are \"wary of medical solutions to gender dysphoria\". She began looking into puberty blockers when her own daughter began questioning her gender in her early teens, an option put on the table by GIDS.",
      "Ultimately her daughter decided not to take them. Annabel was not convinced there was enough evidence to show they were beneficial and she was unsure what it would mean for her daughter's long-term physical and psychological health.",
      "Today, she still has unanswered questions - including some further ones around the trial. \"A big concern for me is will this new trial, if it gets approval, give us the evidence that we want? Or will we end up with more weak data that Dr Cass said undermined decision making in this area?\"",
      "Natacha Kennedy, a lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London who researches transgender issues, has examined the results of a survey of 97 parents of young people with gender-related distress that took place following the puberty blockers ban. She believes that puberty blockers should be an option available for young people questioning their gender and that many will not accept being part of a placebo group in a trial.",
      "\"These parents are desperate and if [they] get to a trial and it turns out their child is not being given the actual puberty blockers, then there is no point in them being there,\" she says.",
      "\"There may be some parents who would\u2026 find another way [to obtain the drugs].\"",
      "Why these Israeli men volunteered to fight - but now refuse to return to Gaza",
      "'I spent 30 years as a therapist to killers - and no-one is born evil'",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Whatever trial format is settled on, more scrutiny will follow. And there will no doubt be fierce debate about the merits of the trial and what it can tell us, as many scientists around the world are watching to see what happens in the UK.",
      "But inevitably, there will be a long wait to fully understand the longer term effects on physical and mental health of those who take puberty blockers - and the long-term effects on those with gender-related distress who don't. Nor do we know how many people detransition, though the Cass report says, \"there is suggestion that numbers are increasing\".",
      "\"We really need to have long-term follow up,\" argues Annabel. \"Can a child possibly understand what that means to their fertility and a loss of sexual function and what that will mean for their future life?\"",
      "For now, she and the scores of parents, carers and young people, can only watch and wait for the trial to begin and for its verdict - and what that means for whether puberty blockers will be prescribed to children once again in the future.",

      "After all, Labour figures acknowledge they were nowhere near as ready for government as they needed to be. That was in part the reason for the rapid departure of Sue Gray, Sir Keir\u2019s initial chief of staff, after just three months in post.",
      "Certainly even among those civil servants who are alive to Whitehall\u2019s systemic flaws there is a view that the prime minister himself needs to be much more active in driving the machine if he wants to achieve results.",
      "\u201cStarmer appears to confuse process with outcomes,\u201d one said.",
      "\u201cYou can set up a child poverty taskforce, OK. But what do you want to do about the two-child benefit cap? You still have to make political choices and officials can\u2019t do that for you.\u201d",

      "Stocktaking",
      "But the principal way in which the prime minister will seek to drive his agenda is via \u201cstock takes\u201d. These are meetings where Sir Keir brings those responsible for each mission into Downing Street to hold them accountable for what the data is showing in their area and asking them how they propose to improve. It\u2019s an idea which was pioneered by Sir Tony Blair on the advice of Michael Barber, his delivery adviser, who recently returned to government.",
      "The frequency of these stocktakes will soon increase, a senior government source said, adding: \u201cIf we are saying that this is the mission of the government and this is how people should judge its success and failure then it is clearly something you need the PM driving through.\u201d",

      "The appointment was received with open contempt by Cummings, who sarcastically described it as a \u201ctruly beautiful, artistic\u201d decision which should serve as a \u201cwake up call\u201d that \u201cthe Westminster system is totally determined to resist any change\u201d.",

    "story": [
      "Google has unveiled a new chip which it claims takes five minutes to solve a problem that would currently take the world's fastest super computers ten septillion \u2013 or 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years \u2013 to complete.",
      "The chip is the latest development in a field known as quantum computing - which is attempting to use the principles of particle physics to create a new type of mind-bogglingly powerful computer.",
      "Google says its new quantum chip, dubbed \"Willow\", incorporates key \"breakthroughs\" and \"paves the way to a useful, large-scale quantum computer.\"",
      "However experts say Willow is, for now, a largely experimental device, meaning a quantum computer powerful enough to solve a wide range of real-world problems is still years - and billions of dollars - away.",
      "The quantum quandary",
      "Quantum computers work in a fundamentally different way to the computer in your phone or laptop.",
      "They harness quantum mechanics - the strange behaviour of ultra-tiny particles - to crack problems far faster than traditional computers.",
      "It's hoped quantum computers might eventually be able to use that ability to vastly speed up complex processes, such as creating new medicines.",
      "There are also fears it could be used for ill -  for example to break some types of encryption used to protect sensitive data.",
      "In February Apple announced that the encryption that protects iMessage chats is being made \"quantum proof\" to stop them being read by powerful future quantum computers.",
      "Hartmut Neven leads Google's Quantum AI lab that created Willow and describes himself as the project's \"chief optimist.\"",
      "He told the BBC that Willow would be used in some practical applications - but declined, for now, to provide more detail.",
      "But a chip able to perform commercial applications would not appear before the end of the decade, he said.",
      "Initially these applications would be the simulation of systems where quantum effects are important",
      "\"For example, relevant when it comes to the design of nuclear fusion reactors to understand the functioning of drugs and pharmaceutical development, it would be relevant for developing better car batteries and another long list of such tasks\".",
      "What is quantum computing?",
      "Apples and oranges",
      "Mr Neven told the BBC Willow's performance meant it was the \"best quantum processor built to date\".",
      "But Professor Alan Woodward, a computing expert at Surrey University, says quantum computers will be better at a range of tasks than current \"classical\" computers, but they will not replace them.",
      "He warns against overstating the importance of Willow's achievement in a single test.",
      "\"One has to be careful not to compare apples and oranges\" he told the BBC.",
      "Google had chosen a problem to use as a benchmark of performance that was, \"tailor-made for a quantum computer\" and this didn't demonstrate \"a universal speeding up when compared to classical computers\".",
      "Nonetheless, he said Willow represented significant progress, in particular in what's known as error correction.",
      "In very simple terms the more useful a quantum computer is, the more qubits it has.",
      "However a major problem with the technology is that it is prone to errors - a tendency that has previously increased the more qubits a chip has.",
      "But Google researchers say they have reversed this and managed to engineer and program the new chip so the error rate fell across the whole system as the number of qubits increased.",
      "It was a major \"breakthrough\" that cracked a key challenge that the field had pursued \"for almost 30 years\", Mr Neven believes.",
      "He told the BBC it was comparable to \"if you had an airplane with just one engine -  that will work, but two engines are safer, four engines is yet safer\".",
      "Errors are a significant obstacle in creating more powerful quantum computers and the development was \"encouraging for everyone striving to build a practical quantum computer\" Prof Woodward said.",
      "But Google itself notes that to develop practically useful quantum computers the error rate will still need to go much lower than that displayed by Willow.",
      "Willow was made in Google's new, purpose-built manufacturing plant in California.",
      "Countries around the world are investing in quantum computing.",
      "The UK recently launched the National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC).",
      "Its director, Michael Cuthbert, told the BBC he was wary of language that fuelled the \"hype cycle\" and thought Willow was more a \"milestone rather than a breakthrough\".",
      "Nevertheless, it was \"clearly a highly impressive piece of work\".",
      "Eventually quantum computers would help with a range of tasks including \"logistics problems such as cargo freight distribution on aircraft or routing of telecoms signals or stored energy throughout the national grid\", he said.",
      "And there were already 50 quantum businesses in the UK, attracting \u00a3800m in funding and employing 1300 people.",
      "On Friday, researchers from Oxford University and Osaka University in Japan published a paper showcasing the very low error rate in a trapped-ion qubit.",
      "Theirs is a different approach to making a quantum computer that's capable of working at room temperature - whereas Google's chip has to be stored at ultra low temperatures to be effective.",

      "Bitcoin's price has blasted through the much-anticipated threshold of $100,000, raising questions about how much higher it could go - and whether it can shake off its notorious volatility.",
      "The world's largest cryptocurrency rose to around $103,400 shortly after 04:00 GMT on Thursday, before falling slightly.",
      "Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, described it as a \"magic moment\" for the cryptocurrency and said it had a \"clear link\" to Donald Trump's election victory.",
      "Trump took to social media to celebrate the milestone, posting \"congratulations Bitcoiners\" and \"you're welcome!\"",

      "However, Bitcoin has a history of sharp falls as well as rapid rises - and some analysts have cautioned that is unlikely to change.",

      "During the US presidential election campaign, Trump sought to appeal to cryptocurrency investors with a promise to sack Gary Gensler - chair of the US financial regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) - on \"day one\" of his presidency.",
      "Mr Gensler's approach to the cryptocurrency sector has been decidedly less friendly than Trump's.",
      "He told the BBC in September it was an industry \u201crife with fraud and hucksters and grifters\u201d.",
      "Under his leadership, the SEC brought a record 46 crypto-related enforcement actions against firms in 2023.",
      "Mr Gensler said in November he would step down on 20 January - the day of Trump's inauguration.",
      "The choice of Paul Atkins to replace him at the helm of the SEC has been welcomed by crypto advocates.",
      "Mike Novogratz, founder and chief executive of US crypto firm Galaxy Digital said he hoped the \"clearer regulatory path\" would now accelerate the digital currency ecosystem's entry into \"the financial mainstream.\"",
      "Bitcoin has seen fewer drastic falls in value during 2024 than in previous years.",
      "In 2022 its price fell sharply below $16,000 after crypto exchange FTX collapsed into bankruptcy.",
      "A number of key events besides Trump's victory in the election have helped boost investor confidence that its value will keep going up.",
      "The SEC approved several spot Bitcoin exchange traded funds (ETFs) allowing giant investment firms like Blackrock, Fidelity and Grayscale to sell products based on the price of Bitcoin.",
      "Some of these products have seen billions of dollars in cash inflows.",
      "But its potential to suddenly plummet in value serves as a reminder that it is not like orthodox currencies - and investors have no protection or recourse if they lose money on Bitcoin investments.",
      "Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University, told BBC News that fear of missing out (FOMO) among younger people will see Bitcoin's price continue to rise.",
      "But she added that while this could spark a rise in other cryptocurrencies, many of the younger investors investing in meme coins are losing money.",
      "Kathleen Breitman, co-founder of another cryptocurrency - Tezos - also had a word of caution for those tempted to invest in Bitcoin.",
      "\"These are markets that tend to move on momentum so you need to be extraordinarily cautious with it,\" she told the BBC."

    "summary": "The deal, which creates the UK's biggest mobile network, has had to overcome competition concerns.",
    "story": [
      "The boss of Vodafone has insisted the telecom company's merger with rival Three - which has finally been approved by the regulator - will not result in higher prices.",
      "The \u00a316.5bn tie-up will create the UK's biggest mobile network, with 27 million customers.",
      "It has been given the go-ahead conditional on the merged companies agreeing to invest billions in the country's 5G network and to cap certain mobile tariffs for three years.",
      "Vodafone's chief executive Margherita Della Valle told the Today programme, on BBC Radio Four, the deal would be \"self-funded\", which meant \"no extra costs from public funding and no extra cost for our customers\".",
      "The regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had previously raised concerns that the deal could drive up people's bills.",
      "But Stuart McIntosh, who led the watchdog's probe into the merger, said it had now concluded it was \"likely to boost competition\" in the mobile sector and should be allowed to proceed.",
      "The CMA said there would be legally binding commitments on Vodafone and Three to invest in the UK mobile network infrastructure for eight years, while selected mobile tariffs and data plans would be capped for three years to \"protect large numbers\" of customers from short-term price rises.",
      "The CMA has not outlined which specific price plans would be protected. It is understood this detail will be in a full report into the merger, which has not been published yet.",
      "A Vodafone spokesman told BBC News that it had also not yet seen the CMA's full report, but there should be more details on the affected tariffs \"in the coming days\".",
      "The rising cost of mobile phone contracts and other digital services has been an issue of concern for regulators as has the slow pace of the UK's 5G roll out.",
      "'Waiting game'",
      "Kester Mann, an analyst from CCS Insight, said it was a landmark moment.",
      "\"This mega-merger marks one of the most significant moments in the history of UK mobile,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He added it appeared to \"largely strike a good balance between nurturing competition and encouraging investment\".",
      "Industry analyst Paolo Pescatore told BBC News it was still a \"waiting game\" in terms of assessing the impact of the tie-up.",
      "\"The bottom line is it will take many years before the full merits of the deal are realised, and there\u2019s a lot of tough decisions to come,\" he said.",
      "Mr Pescatore also said \"it\u2019s now up to both parties to deliver on their promises\", but  \"that should mean wins for UK plc \u2013 bringing much needed investment in the network \u2013 and for consumers in the form of better services\".",
      "This is the latest example of consolidation in the UK mobile market.",
      "In 2010, Orange and T-Mobile emerged to create EE, which itself was taken over by BT in 2016.",
      "Then, in 2021, the CMA approved a \u00a331bn merger of Virgin Media and O2.",
      "Those deals were followed by job cuts. EE axed 1,200 roles in the months following the merger of Orange and T-Mobile, then an additional 550 jobs the following year.",
      "Vodafone and Three have previously claimed their merger will create thousands of new jobs.",
      "But the union Unite has warned in the past that the deal could add an extra \u00a3300 a year to customers' bills, and lead to \"up to 1,600 jobs\" being lost."

      "The $100,000 milestone prompted celebrations from cryptocurrency fans around the world.",

      "So here's the BBC's list of the seven wildest moments - so far - in Bitcoin's tumultuous history.",
      "1. The mysterious creator of Bitcoin",
      "Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto.",
      "They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email.",
      "Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers.",
      "But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out.",
      "In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be a false lead caused by some mistranslated information.",
      "Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi.",
      "Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him.",
      "2. Making history... with pizza",
      "Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza.",
      "On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas.",
      "A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day.",
      "A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online.",
      "Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin.",
      "The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars!",
      "3. Becoming legal tender",
      "In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender.",
      "Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar.",
      "Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country.",
      "While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped.",
      "He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country.",
      "As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years.",
      "The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country.",
      "It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value.",
      "A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value.",
      "4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust",
      "In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions.",
      "These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part.",
      "Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves.",
      "At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment.",
      "But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts.",
      "Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth.",
      "Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact.",
      "5. Bitcoins in the rubbish dump",
      "Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (\u00a378m) - and then  accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details.",
      "That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him",
      "The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline.",
      "Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling.\"",
      "6. Crypto King fraudster",
      "No-one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community.",
      "FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days.",
      "Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research.",
      "Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: \"I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.\"",
      "After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years.",
      "7. Investment bank boom",
      "Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies.",
      "In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any.",
      "Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs.",
      "It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined.",
      "Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold."

      "The partnership with the IWF appears to be the latest step in that process.",
      "The IWF is one of a few organisations in the world that is legally able to search for child sexual content to get it taken down.",

      "Telegram says that before becoming a member of IWF it removed hundreds of thousands of pieces of abuse material each month using its own systems. The IWF membership will strengthen its mechanisms, the company said.",
      "The app is marketed as a fully end-to-end encrypted messaging service - meaning only the sender and recipient of a message can read it - like WhatsApp and Signal.",
      "But in fact the majority of communication is done with standard encryption, raising questions about how secure from hacking and interception it is.",
      "Mr Durov, who was born in Russia and now lives in Dubai, has citizenship in Russia, France, the United Arab Emirates and the Caribbean island nation of St Kitts and Nevis.",

      "The Assad family ruled Syria for more than 50 years with an iron fist. Now that has come to an end.",
      "Bashar al-Assad became president after the death in 2000 of his father Hafez, who had ruled for almost three decades.",
      "In 2011, he brutally crushed a peaceful, pro-democracy uprising, sparking a devastating civil war in which more than half a million people have been killed and 12 million others have been forced to flee their homes.",
      "Thirteen days ago, the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and allied rebel factions launched a major offensive in north-western Syria.",
      "The rebels quickly captured the country's second-largest city, Aleppo, then swept southwards down the highway to the capital, Damascus, as the military collapsed.",
      "Russia announced that Assad had stepped down and left Syria on Sunday, hours after the rebels entered Damascus and crowds gathered on the streets to celebrate. It later emerged that Assad had flown to Moscow and been granted asylum.",
      "HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani meanwhile arrived in Damascus and told Syrians: \"The future is ours.\"",
      "How did the takeover unfold?",
      "For the past four years, it had felt like the civil war was effectively over.",
      "Assad's government had regained control over most of Syria's cities with the help of Russia, Iran and Iranian-backed militias like Hezbollah, and the front lines were largely frozen.",
      "However, large parts of the country were still out of the government's control.",
      "The rebels' last stronghold was in Aleppo and Idlib provinces, which border Turkey and where more than four million people were living, many of them displaced. It was dominated by HTS, but a number of allied rebel groups and jihadist groups were also based there. Turkish-backed rebel factions also controlled territory with the support of Turkish troops.",
      "On 27 November, HTS and its allies launched their surprise offensive.",
      "After three days, they took control of most of Aleppo - Syria's second-largest city. They said they faced little resistance on the ground after the government rapidly withdrew its troops and security forces.",

      "End of Assad rule will reshape region's balance of power",
      "The Turkish-backed rebel factions meanwhile capitalised on the government's retreat by launching a separate offensive on territory north of Aleppo controlled by a Kurdish-led militia alliance supported by the United States, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).",
      "Assad vowed to \"crush\" the rebels with the help of his allies. Russian warplanes intensified strikes on rebel-held areas and Iran-backed militias sent reinforcements to help the military near Hama - the next city south on the way to Damascus.",
      "But Hama fell to the rebels on Thursday, after several days of fierce battles that eventually prompted the military to withdraw.",
      "The rebels declared their next goal was to take Homs, Syria's third-largest city, and achieved that on Saturday night after only a day of fighting. At the same time, other rebel factions reached the suburbs of Damascus.",
      "Early on Sunday, HTS-led rebels announced they had entered Damascus and released detainees at the country's most notorious military prison, Saydnaya.",
      "Less than two hours later, they declared: \"The tyrant Bashar al-Assad has fled.\"",
      "The rebels also promised to build a \"homeland for all, including all sects and social classes\".",
      "The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported that at least 910 people had been killed, including 138 civilians, since the start of the rebel offensive.",
      "What is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham?",
      "The Islamist militant group that led the offensive against Assad was set up in 2012 under a different name, al-Nusra Front.",
      "Al-Nusra Front, which pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda the following year, was regarded as one of the most effective and deadly groups fighting President Assad.",
      "But it was feared for its jihadist ideology, and was seen as being at odds with the largely secular main rebel coalition - the Free Syrian Army.",
      "In 2016, Al-Nusra broke ties with al-Qaeda and took the name Hayat Tahrir al-Sham when it merged with other factions a year later.",
      "However, the UN, US, UK and a number of other countries continue to consider HTS as an al-Qaeda affiliate and frequently refer to it as al-Nusra Front. The US named Abu Mohammed al-Jolani as a specially designated global terrorist and offered a $10m reward for information that led to his capture.",
      "HTS consolidated its power in Idlib and Aleppo provinces by crushing its rivals, including al-Qaeda and Islamic State (IS) group cells. It set up the so-called Syrian Salvation Government to administer the territory according to Islamic law.",
      "Why did the rebels succeed?",
      "For several years, Idlib remained a battleground as Syrian government forces tried to regain control.",
      "But in 2020, Turkey and Russia brokered a ceasefire to halt a push by the government to retake Idlib. The ceasefire largely held despite sporadic fighting.",
      "HTS and its allies said on 27 November that they had launched an offensive to \"deter aggression\", accusing the government and allied Iran-backed militias of escalating attacks on civilians.",
      "But it came at a time when the government had been weakened by years of war, sanctions and corruption - with allies Russia and Iran preoccupied by other conflicts.",
      "The Iran-backed group Hezbollah had recently suffered from Israel's offensive in Lebanon. Israeli strikes had eliminated Iranian military commanders in Syria, and Russia was distracted by the war in Ukraine.",
      "Without them, Assad's forces were left exposed.",
      "What happens next?",
      "Outgoing prime minister Mohammed al-Jalili said on Monday that most members of his former cabinet were working with the rebels \"so that the transitional period is quick and smooth\".",
      "The rebels said in a brief statement that their forces were close to establishing complete control of Damascus and preserving public property. They also said Syria's new government would begin its work as soon as it was formed.",
      "The National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, which represents now-former opposition groups, said on Sunday that it was committed to \"completing the transfer of power to a transitional governing body with full executive powers, paving the way for a free, democratic and pluralistic Syria\".",
      "The statement made no mention of HTS, but its vice-president, Dima Moussa, told the BBC that the \"transition requires coming together of all Syrian people, including those who are carrying arms\".",
      "Meanwhile, the war continued in other parts of Syria.",
      "HTS and its allies said their forces were advancing in the western countryside of Deir al-Zour, the largest city in eastern Syria.",
      "Turkish-backed rebel factions fighting under the banner of the Syrian National Army were also advancing north-west of Aleppo into territory held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.",
      "Israel confirmed it was attacking suspected government chemical weapon and missile sites in Syria, saying this was to stop them falling into the hands of extremists. It also said it would keep a \"limited\" troop presence in what had been a demilitarised buffer zone in part of the Golan Heights because Syrian troops had abandoned their posts there.",
      "Former Assad loyalists also appeared to be still in control of the Mediterranean coast and mountains in the west of the country. The region is a stronghold of Assad's minority Alawite sect and also the location of two key Russian military bases - Hmeimim airbase and the naval base in Tartous.",
      "How have world and regional powers reacted?",
      "Russian media said Bashar al-Assad and his family had been granted asylum. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia had been as \"surprised\" as everyone else by what had happened and that Syria was \"going through a very difficult period now, due to instability\".",
      "Iran expressed a hope for \"the swift end of military conflicts, the prevention of terrorist actions, and the commencement of national dialogue\" with all parts of Syrian society.",
      "Turkey said Syria was now at a stage \"where the Syrian people will shape the future of their own country\". Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the new government \"must be established in an orderly manner\" and warned that \"the principle of inclusiveness must never be compromised\".",
      "US President Joe Biden said the collapse of the Assad government was a \"fundamental act of justice\" after decades of repression, but cautioned that the takeover by Islamist rebels created a moment of \"risk and uncertainty\".",
      "Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the collapse of the Assad government was the \"direct result\" of his country's action against Hezbollah and Iran.",
      "Iraq, where powerful Iran-backed militias sent fighters to support the Syrian military in the civil war, said it supported efforts to open a dialogue in Syria \"leading to the adoption of a pluralistic constitution that preserves the human and civil rights of Syrians\".",
      "Jordan's King Abdullah, whose country backed rebel factions at the start of the war, said Jordan respected the will and choices of the Syrian people. He stressed the importance of avoiding \"any conflict that could lead to chaos\".",
      "The European Union's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, called Assad's fall \"a positive and long-awaited development\", and said the bloc's priority was to ensure security in the region.",

      "ADMSP also described how \"salt chambers\" were constructed to serve as primitive mortuaries to store bodies before they were transferred to Tishreen Military Hospital in Damascus for registration and burial in graves on military land. The detainees' families were never given their bodies, it said.",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 21:45:49 GMT",
    "summary": "The worst scenario for Syrians is that their country will spin into violent chaos, writes the BBC's Jeremy Bowen.",
    "story": [
      "In the end the Assad regime was so hollow, corrupt and decayed that it collapsed in less than a fortnight.",
      "No one I have spoken to has been anything other than astonished by the speed with which the regime turned to dust.",
      "In the spring of 2011, the year of the Arab uprisings, it was different, when Syrians tried to grab some of the revolutionary magic that had swept away the presidents of Tunisia and Egypt and was threatening the veteran strongmen of Libya and Yemen.",
      "By 2011, the regime created by Hafez al-Assad and passed to his son Bashar on his death in 2000 was already corrupt and decadent.",
      "But the system that Hafez built still had much of the brutal, ruthless strength that he believed was necessary to control Syria. Assad senior had seized power in a country that was prone to coups and delivered it to his son and heir without a significant challenge.",
      "Bashar al-Assad went back to his father's playbook in 2011.",
      "It is hard to imagine now, but back then he had more legitimacy among some of Syria's population than the old dictators swept away by crowds chanting the slogan of that year - \"The people want the fall of the regime\".",
      "Bashar al-Assad was a vocal supporter of the Palestinians and of Hezbollah during its successful fight against Israel in the 2006 Lebanon war. He was younger than the ex and soon to be former Arab leaders.",
      "Since his father's death he had been promising reform. Some Syrians still wanted to believe him in 2011, hoping demonstrations were the spur he needed for the change that he had promised, until he ordered his men to shoot peaceful demonstrators dead in the streets.",
      "A British ambassador in Syria once told me that the way to understand the Assad regime was to watch Mafia films like The Godfather. The obedient could be rewarded.",
      "Anyone who went against the head of the family or his closest lieutenants would be eliminated. In Syria's case that could mean the gallows, or a firing squad, or indefinite incarceration in some underground cell.",
      "We're seeing them now, emaciated and pale, blinking into the light, filmed on the mobiles of the rebel fighters who have freed thousands of them from years behind bars.",

      "Syria in maps: How did anti-Assad rebels take control?",
      "The weakness of the regime, to the point that it collapsed like a soggy paper bag, was disguised by the fearsome and repressive gulag it still maintained.",
      "The international consensus was that Bashar al-Assad was weak, dependent on Russia and Iran, and presiding over a country he had fractured to preserve his family's rule \u2013 but still strong enough to be regarded as a fact of Middle Eastern life, who could even be useful.",
      "In the last days before rebels burst out of Idlib, it was widely reported that the US, Israel and the United Arab Emirates were trying to detach Assad's Syria from Iran.",
      "Israel had been launching increasingly heavy airstrikes against targets inside Syria it said were part of the supply chain Iran used to get weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon.",
      "Israel's offensive in Lebanon had dealt severe blows to Hezbollah, but the idea was to stop it regenerating. At the same time the UAE and the US were trying to find incentives for him to break the alliance with Tehran, relaxing sanctions and allowing Assad to continue his international rehabilitation.",
      "Both Benjamin Netanyahu and Joe Biden have claimed credit for the fall of the Assad regime. There is something in that.",
      "The damage Israel inflicted on Hezbollah and Iran with US weapons and constant support, and Biden's supply of arms for Ukraine, made it impossible, even undesirable, for Assad's closest allies to save him.",
      "But the fact that they saw Assad as part of their strategy to contain and damage Iran until days before his fall indicates clearly that they did not for a moment believe him to be days away from a midnight flit to Russia.",
      "They did contribute to his end, more by accident than design.",
      "The fall of the regime might have ended Iran's supply chain, if Syria's new rulers decide their deals with others are more useful than the Iranian alliance.",
      "All sides are thinking hard and thinking again about what comes next, and it is too soon to draw definite conclusions. Syrians, their neighbours, and the wider world are now confronted by another geopolitical earthquake, the biggest of the series that has followed the Hamas attacks on Israel in October last year. It might not be the last.",
      "Iran is seeing the final collapse of the main planks of the network it called the axis of resistance. Its most important components have been transformed; Hezbollah badly damaged and the Assad regime gone.",
      "Iran's rulers might want to follow up on hints of talks on a deal with Donald Trump once he takes office. Or its new strategic nakedness might push it into a fateful decision to turn its highly enriched uranium into a nuclear weapon.",
      "Syrians have every reason to rejoice. In the years after 2011, for all the repression and brutality of the regime, Assad and his acolytes could still find men who would fight. Many of the troops I met on front lines told me that Assad was a better option than the jihadist extremists of Islamic State group.",
      "In 2024, faced by a well-organised rebel force that insisted it was nationalist, Islamist but no longer jihadist, the army's reluctant conscripts refused to fight, stripped off their uniforms and went home.",
      "The best scenario is that Syrians, helped by the big players in the region, will find a way to create a postwar mood of national reconciliation, not a wave of looting and revenge that will drag the country into a new war. Abu Mohammad al Joulani, the leader of victorious HTS, has called for his men and all of Syria's sects to respect each other.",
      "His men have removed the regime, and he is the closest Syria has to a de facto leader.",
      "Syria, though, has dozens of armed groups that do not necessarily agree with him and will want to grab power in their own areas. In southern Syria, tribal militias did not recognise the writ of the Assads. They will not follow orders they don't like from the new set up in Damascus.",
      "In the eastern desert, the US saw a big enough threat from remnants of the Islamic State group to launch waves of air strikes. The Israelis, alarmed by the prospect of an Islamist state on their border, are pounding the military infrastructure of Syria's armed forces.",
      "It might be better to find a way to make a reformed Syrian Arab Army part of the solution in a country without much law or order. The reckless decision by the US in 2003 to dissolve the Iraqi armed forces had disastrous consequences.",
      "In Turkey, President Erdogan must be satisfied by what he sees.",
      "Erdogan's Turkey did more than any other power to preserve the autonomy of Idlib province, where HTS was transforming itself into a fighting force when Syria seemed to be in the deep freeze.",
      "Erdogan might see his influence lapping Israel's borders, at a time when Israel-Turkey relations have been poisoned by the war in Gaza.",
      "The worst scenario for Syrians is that their country will follow the example of two Arab dictatorships that spun into violent chaos after the fall of their regimes.",
      "Colonel Gaddafi of Libya and Saddam Hussein of Iraq were removed without a ready-made replacement waiting in the wings. Ill-considered foreign intervention did much to create two catastrophes.",
      "The vacuum left by the dictators was filled by waves of looting, revenge, power grabs and civil war.",
      "Syrians have not been in charge of their own destiny for generations. Individuals were robbed of it by the two Assad presidents and their followers. The country lost it after war left it so weakened that bigger foreign powers used it to increase and preserve their own power.",
      "Syrians still do not have agency over their lives. They might have a chance of creating a new and better country if they did."

      "Rebel forces have swept across Syria, freeing prisoners from government jails as they went.",
      "Throughout the civil war, which began in 2011, government forces held hundreds of thousands of people in detention camps, where human rights groups say torture was common.",
      "On Saturday, the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) said it had freed more than 3,500 detainees from Homs Military Prison as the group took over the city.",
      "The group was set up in 2012 under the name al-Nusra Front. It was allied to al-Qaeda but later severed ties - though the US, the UK and a number of other countries continue to see it as an affiliate of the jihadist organisation.",
      "In 2016, the group took its current name, HTS, and later merged with other rebel factions. It is the most significant of several opposition groups taking part in this latest offensive.",
      "As the rebels entered the capital hours later early on Sunday, HTS announced an \"end of the era of tyranny in the prison of Saydnaya\", which has become a by-word for the darkest abuses of Assad's era.",
      "In a 2022 report, ADMSP said Saydnaya \"effectively became a death camp\" after the start of the civil war.",
      "It estimated that more than 30,000 detainees had either been executed or died as a result of torture, lack of medical care or starvation between 2011 and 2018. Citing accounts from the few released inmates, at least another 500 detainees had been executed between 2018 and 2021, it said.",
      "In 2017, Amnesty International described Saydnaya as a \"human slaughterhouse\", in a report that alleged that executions had been authorised at the highest levels of the Assad government.",
      "The government at that time dismissed Amnesty's claims as \"baseless\" and \"devoid of truth\", insisting that all executions in Syria followed due process.",

      "\"We toppled the regime,\" they respond, eliciting an excited laugh from the former prisoner.",
      "Of all the symbols of the repressive nature of the Assad regime, the network of prisons into which those expressing any form of dissent were disappeared cast the longest and darkest shadow.",
      "In Saydnaya, torture, sexual assault and mass execution were the fate of thousands. Many never re-emerged, with their families often not knowing for many years whether they were alive or dead.",
      "One of those who survived the ordeal, Omar al-Shogre, told the BBC on Sunday about what he endured during three years of incarceration as a teenager.",
      "\"I know the pain, I know the loneliness and also the hopelessness you feel because the world let you suffer and did nothing about it,\" he said.",

      "A Syrian human rights network estimates that more than 130,000 people have been subjected to detention in these conditions since 2011. But the history of these intentionally terrifying institutions goes back much further.",
      "Even in neighbouring Lebanon, the fear of being disappeared to a Syrian dungeon was pervasive during the many years that Damascus was the dominant foreign power.",
      "The deep hatred of the Assad regime - both father and son - that simmered under the surface in Syria  was due in large part to this industrial-scale mechanism of torture, death and humiliation that was intended to frighten the population into submission.",
      "For that reason, rebel factions in their lightning drive through Syria that toppled President Assad made sure in each city they captured to go to the central prison in each one and release the thousands held there.",

      "The Adani Group is slated to contribute to a tenth of that capacity.",
      "The legal troubles in the US could temporarily delay the group's expansion plans but will not affect the government's overall targets, analysts say.",

      "The country is growing at the \"fastest rate among major economies\" in adding renewables capacity, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Installed clean energy capacity has grown five-fold, with some 45% of the country's power-generation capacity - of nearly 200GW - coming from non-fossil fuel sources.",
      "Charges against the Adani Group - crucial to India's clean energy ambitions - are \"like a passing dark cloud\", and will not meaningfully impact this momentum, a former CEO of a rival firm said, wanting to remain anonymous.",
      "Gautam Adani has vowed to invest $100bn (\u00a378.3bn) in India's energy transition. Its green energy arm is the country's largest renewable energy company, producing nearly 11GW of clean energy through a diverse portfolio of wind and solar projects.",
      "Adani has a target to scale that to 50GW BY 2030, which will make up nearly 10% of the country's own installed capacity.",
      "Over half of that, or 30GW, will be produced at Khavda, in the western Indian state of Gujarat. It is the world's biggest clean energy plant, touted to be five times the size of Paris and the centrepiece in Adani's renewables crown.",
      "But Khavda and Adani's other renewables facilities are now at the very centre of the charges filed by US prosecutors - they allege that the company won contracts to supply power to state distribution companies from these facilities, in exchange for bribes to Indian officials. The group has denied this.",
      "But the fallout at the company level is already visible.",
      "When the indictment became public, Adani Green Energy immediately cancelled a $600m bond offering in the US.",
      "France's TotalEnergies, which owns 20% of Adani Green Energy and has a joint venture to develop several renewables projects with the conglomerate, said it will halt fresh capital infusion into the company.",
      "Major credit ratings agencies - Moody's, Fitch and S&P - have since changed their outlook on Adani group companies, including Adani Green Energy, to negative. This will impact the company's capacity to access funds and make it more expensive to raise capital.",
      "Analysts have also raised concerns about Adani Green Energy's ability to refinance its debt, as international lenders grow weary of adding exposure to the group.",
      "Global lenders like Jeffries and Barclays are already said to be reviewing their ties with Adani even as the group's reliance on global banks and international and local bond issues for long-term debt has grown from barely 14% in financial year 2016 to nearly 60% as of date, according to a note from Bernstein.",
      "Japanese brokerage Nomura says new financing might dry up in the short term but should \"gradually resume in the long term\". Meanwhile, Japanese banks like MUFG, SMBC, Mizuho are likely to continue their relationship with the group.",
      "The \"reputational and sentimental impact\" will fade away in a few months, as Adani is building \"solid, strategic assets and creating long-term value\", the unnamed CEO said.",
      "A spokesperson for the Adani Group told the BBC that it was \"committed to its 2030 targets and confident of delivering 50 GW of renewable energy capacity\".",
      "Adani stocks have recovered sharply from the lows they hit post the US court indictment.",
      "Some analysts told the BBC that a possible slowdown in funding for Adani could in fact end up benefitting its competitors.",
      "While Adani's financial influence has allowed it to rapidly expand in the sector, its competitors such as Tata Power, Goldman Sachs-backed ReNew Power, Greenko and state-run NTPC Ltd are also significantly ramping up manufacturing and generation capacity.",
      "\"It's not that Adani is a green energy champion. It is a big player that has walked both sides of the street, being the biggest private developer of coal plants in the world,\" said Tim Buckley, director at Climate Energy Finance.",
      "A large entity, \"perceived to be corrupt\" possibly slowing its expansion, could mean \"more money will start flowing into other green energy companies\", he said.",
      "According to Vibhuti Garg, South Asia director at Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), market fundamentals also continue to remain strong with demand for renewable energy outpacing supply in India - which is likely to keep the appetite for big investments intact.",
      "What could in fact slow the pace of India's clean energy ambitions is its own bureaucracy.",
      "\"Companies we track are very upbeat. Finance isn't a problem for them. If anything, it is state-level regulations that act as a kind of deterrent,\" says Ms Garg.",
      "Most state-run power distribution companies continue to face financial constraints, opting for cheaper fossil fuels, while dragging their feet on signing purchase agreements.",
      "According to Reuters, the controversial tender won by Adani was the first major contract issued by state-run Solar Energy Corp of India (SECI) without a guaranteed purchase agreement from distributors.",
      "SECI's chairman told Reuters that there are 30GW of operational green energy projects in the market without buyers.",
      "Experts say the 8GW solar contract at the heart of Adani's US indictment also sheds light on the messy tendering process, which required solar power generation companies to manufacture modules as well - limiting the number of bidders and leading to higher power costs.",
      "The court indictment will certainly lead to a \"tightening of bidding and tendering rules\", says Ms Garg.",

      "Warning: This story contains descriptions of alleged sexual offences.",
      "There was a moment, a few weeks into the trial, when Gis\u00e8le Pelicot decided it was time to remove her sunglasses.",
      "It wasn't just an acknowledgment of the fading autumn sunshine in the medieval southern French city of Avignon. It was also an indication that she'd passed a milestone \u2013 one of many that have marked her slow, painful journey from serene grandmother, to anguished and shame-haunted rape victim, to fearful courtroom witness, to global icon of courage and defiance.",
      "\"She had these sunglasses she used to hide her eyes\u2026 to protect her intimacy,\" said St\u00e9phane Babonneau, the youthful criminal lawyer who for two years has guided Mrs Pelicot through the case against her ex-husband, Dominique, and fifty other men now on trial for allegedly raping her.",
      "\"But there was a point when she felt she no longer needed to protect herself. She didn't need [the glasses],\" Mr Babonneau explained, seizing on that moment as a way to illustrate the slow transformation of a \"sincere\u2026 very humble person\", who had begun the trial \"extremely worried\", shocked by the blaze of publicity, and still feeling \"very ashamed of what had happened to her\".",
      "Over the course of the trial, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, 72, has said almost nothing about her ordeal, beyond the occasional and brief comment to supporters gathered in Avignon's Palais de Justice.",
      "But Mr Babonneau, speaking now with his client's blessing, has begun giving us insights into the way she's handled herself in court, and the way she has slowly and methodically sought to rebuild her life and, to a limited extent, her peace of mind.",
      "Another moment - and milestone - sticks out.",
      "It was earlier this year, in May. Mr Babonneau and his colleague Antoine Camus had been trawling through some of the 20,000 grotesquely explicit videos and photographs that police discovered back in 2020 on Dominique Pelicot's computer hard drive.",
      "A grim task. The videos were \"absolutely disgusting,\" said Mr Babonneau. But it was the audio that was almost more shocking.",
      "\"It's possible to hear Mrs Pelicot snoring\u2026 to hear her breathing. It's even more disturbing to listen to her choking when some of the men are abusing her. The sound was very important [evidence].\"",

      "Mrs Pelicot understood that too, but could easily and understandably have decided, for her own sanity, to avoid watching any of the footage herself.",
      "Instead, Mr Babonneau remembers, she simply announced one day: \"I'm ready now.\"",
      "So, she sat down beside the two men, in their office, as they introduced a carefully selected portion of each video, explaining who the men were, and what she would be seeing them do to her. Then Mr Babonneau pressed play and images of the Pelicots' bedroom, in their bungalow in the village Mazan, flashed up on the screen.",
      "Gis\u00e8le remained still, watching intently.",
      "\"How could he?\" she eventually asked, in her quiet voice. It was a phrase she would keep repeating over the coming days.",
      "Then a little later, she noted the date on one of the videos.",
      "\"That was my birthday evening.\"",
      "\"That happened in [my] daughter's bed. In her beach house.\"",
      "Mr Babonneau remembers Mrs Pelicot's sustained indignation, but noted too that she never cried, and that with the help of experts, she'd managed \"to put an impressive distance between what she was seeing and her mental health.\"",
      "The lawyers saw this moment as a \"final test\" that showed their client had regained \"some kind of equilibrium\" in the four years since 4 November 2020, when she'd been informed about her husband's actions and \"her world was destroyed.\"",
      "She was now ready to face the rigours of a public trial.",
      "Mrs Pelicot had wanted to watch the footage in order to understand who all these men were, and to help fill in the gaps in her memory, caused by the years of being drugged by her husband.",
      "\"She has entire pieces of her existence that don't exist in her mind,\" explained Mr Babonneau.",
      "The same practical concerns first shaped her decision to opt for a public trial, and to push for the videos to be shown in open court.",
      "She was beyond angry, for sure. But at that stage she wasn't looking to change the world. She was simply nervous about the idea of spending months inside a closed courtroom packed with dozens of her abusers. A public trial would, she thought, feel less intimidating.",
      "The first day of the trial was still traumatic. Sunglasses on, Mrs Pelicot was revealing herself in public for the very first time. And it got worse. Walking beside her up the steps towards the courthouse, Mr Babonneau noticed and recognised some of the accused men, in masks.",
      "But Mrs Pelicot only slowly became aware that she was now surrounded by them, elbows bumping as they jostled to get through the same security barriers.",
      "\"It was stressful for her. She was surprised how casual everything seemed to be,\" recalled Mr Babonneau.",
      "And then came the moment \u2013 the first in four years \u2013 when Gis\u00e8le and Dominique Pelicot's eyes met across the crowded courtroom. Their chairs were arranged as if to make such contact unavoidable.",
      "\"I saw sometimes that they exchanged looks,\" Mr Babonneau noted. Gis\u00e8le had spoken repeatedly to her team of her concern about how she might react in that first encounter.",
      "In stifled sobs and fierce accusations, family falls apart at mass rape trial",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot condemns rape accused and says French society must change",
      "Women moved by defiant Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in France mass rape trial",
      "We know now, of course, that while giving evidence in court Dominique Pelicot confessed to everything and that he begged his family for forgiveness. We also know that Gis\u00e8le Pelicot has not forgiven him.",
      "\"For sure, no. She cannot forgive him,\" said Mr Babonneau.",
      "And yet, the couple were once deeply in love. They were married for fifty years. And in the courtroom, Mr Babonneau could tell, the former couple were not able to ignore their shared past entirely. So, what did the lawyer see in those glances they exchanged?",
      "It was like they were saying \"look at us,\" said Mr Babonneau.",
      "He felt they were communicating to each other a shared sense of disbelief. Almost as if they were, briefly, spectators watching the agonies of two strangers.",
      "\"How did we end up here?\"",
      "During the trial, defence lawyers for various accused men tried to suggest that Gis\u00e8le's composure, her lack of tears, somehow implied that she was complicit in her own abuse. Or that she felt sympathy for Dominique Pelicot.",
      "\"When a victim doesn't cry, or cries too much, there is always something to criticise,\" said Mr Babonneau, with a flicker of contempt.",
      "But while the attacks clearly rattled Mrs Pelicot, she also told her legal team not to worry.",
      "There was a simple reason for that. Nothing that the lawyers could throw at her in court could ever compare with the very worst moment of her life, that day in November 2020, when an officer had sat her down at Carpentras Police Station and showed her the first grim images that investigators had extracted from her husband's hard drive.",
      "\"You know I survived 2 November 2020, so I'm ready for everything now,\" Babonneau remembers her saying.",
      "As the trial went on, Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was surprised to find that public and media interest was not drifting away, as she and her team had imagined it would. Instead, she began receiving letters and gifts and applause from cheering crowds.",
      "\"When she started receiving these letters, she felt some kind of responsibility for victims who had suffered similar things,\" said Babonneau.",
      "She came to understand the uniqueness of her case \u2013 that the video evidence meant it was not simply \"the word of the victim against the word of the suspect\", and that she now had a rare opportunity \"to change society\".",
      "\"I'm lucky to have the evidence. I have the proof, which is very rare. So, I have to go through [all this] to stand for all the victims,\" she told Mr Babonneau.",
      "Her lawyer noticed, again, his client's \"simple,\" practical nature. She has no interest in being \"an activist\", but is simply thinking of how her experience of being drugged without realising it, could now help make other women aware of the issue, and look out for possible signs of similar abuse.",
      "Had she known then what all of France knows now, perhaps she could have put an end to her ordeal.",
      "And maybe other women can now do the same.",
      "As for the future, Mrs Pelicot may, perhaps, break her silence with a few interviews in the months ahead. But she's made it clear she wants \"to remain an individual\u2026 she wants to live a very simple life.\"",
      "And while she may never forgive her once \"perfect\" ex-husband, she has found a way to manage her memories of him and to cling on to the \"happy moments\" they once shared.",
      "Some psychiatrists argue that Dominique Pelicot is a relatively typical psychopath \u2013 a high-functioning narcissist with no capacity for empathy who weaved between his sordid hidden life and the self-gratifying role of playing of a family man. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot sees things more simply, embracing the idea, put forward at the trial, of a split personality.",
      "As Mr Babonneau puts it, \"there were two men in Dominique Pelicot and she only knew one of them.\"",

      "At least 110 mostly elderly people have been brutally murdered by gang members in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, according to a human rights group.",
      "The National Human Rights Defence Network (RNDDH) said a local gang leader had targeted them after his son fell ill and subsequently died.",
      "The gang leader reportedly consulted a voodoo priest who blamed elderly locals practising \"witchcraft\" for the boy's mystery illness.",
      "The United Nations said the number of people killed in Haiti so far this year in spiralling gang violence had reached \"a staggering 5,000\".",
      "Warning: This story contains details some readers may find upsetting",
      "While details from the massacre are still emerging, the UN's human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk on Monday put the number of people killed over the weekend \"in violence orchestrated by the leader of a powerful gang\" at 184.",
      "The killings happened in the Cit\u00e9 Soleil neighbourhood of the capital.",
      "According to reports, gang members seized scores of residents aged over 60 from their homes in the Wharf J\u00e9r\u00e9mie area, rounded them up and then shot or stabbed them to death with knives and machetes.",
      "Residents reported seeing mutilated bodies being burned in the streets.",
      "RNDDH estimated 60 were killed on Friday while another 50 were rounded up and murdered on Saturday, after the gang leader's son had died of his illness.",
      "While RNDDH said that all the victims were over 60, another rights group said some younger people who had tried to protect the elderly had also been killed.",
      "Local media said that elderly people believed to be practitioners of voodoo had been singled out because the gang leader had been told his son's illness had been caused by them.",
      "Rights groups said the man who had ordered the killings was Monel Felix, also known as Mikano.",
      "Mikano is known to control Wharf J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, a strategic area in the port of the capital.",
      "According to Romain Le Cour Grandmaison, a Haiti expert at the Global Initiative against Transnational Crime (GI-TOC), the area is small but hard for the security forces to penetrate.",
      "Local media said that residents had been prevented from leaving Wharf J\u00e9r\u00e9mie by Mikano's gang, so news of the deadly killings was slow to spread.",
      "The group forms part of the Viv Ansanm gang alliance, which controls much of the Haitian capital.",
      "Haiti has been engulfed in a wave of gang violence since the assassination in 2021 of the then-president, Jovenel Mo\u00efse.",
      "Data gathered by GI-TOC shows there was a decline in the murder rate between  May and September of this year, after rival gangs had reached an uneasy truce.",
      "But attempts by the gangs to expand their territory beyond their strongholds in the capital have led to particularly bloody incidents in the past two months, with ordinary residents rather than rival gang members being increasingly targeted.",
      "On 3 October, 115 locals were killed in the small town of Pont-Sond\u00e9 in the Artibonite department.",
      "That massacre was reportedly carried out by the Gran Grif gang in retaliation for some residents joining a vigilante group to resist attempts by Gran Grif to extort locals.",
      "If confirmed, the death toll given by the UN for this weekend's killings in Cit\u00e9 Soleil, would make it the deadliest incident so far this year.",
      "With gangs in control of an estimated 85% of Port-au-Prince and increasingly large swathes of the countryside, hundreds of thousands of Haitians have been forced to flee their homes.",
      "According to the International Organization for Migration, more than 700,000 people - half of them children - are internally displaced across the country.",
      "Gang members often use sexual abuse, including gang rape, to sow terror among the local population.",

      "He declined to provide any further details on the investigation while it continued.",

      "\"The whole thing took off pretty quickly,\" synagogue board member Benjamin Klein, who spoke to witnesses, told The Age newspaper.",

    "story": [
      "Not long after buying and publicly consuming a $6.2m banana as part of an artworld stunt, Chinese crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun made another eye-catching purchase, investing $30m ($23.5m) into a cryptocurrency firm called World Liberty Financial.",
      "The company had foundered since its October launch, investors seemingly leery of its prospects and its terms.",
      "But it boasted a potentially enticing feature: the chance to do business with a firm partnering with and promoted by none other than Donald Trump.",
      "Mr Sun's investment tipped the company over the threshold that allowed the president-elect to begin profiting from the venture. Trump and his family are now in the position to collect roughly $20m - and potentially far more.",
      "Mr Sun, who is currently fighting fraud charges in the US related to his own crypto business, did not respond to questions about what prompted his interest in the tokens, which cannot be traded.",
      "But the episode set off alarm bells among government ethics experts, who see it as an indication that Trump's expanding business ventures have made it easier than ever for those hoping to influence US policy to steer money his way.",
      "\"The conflicts have grown substantially with the scope of his business empire,\" said Richard Painter, who served as the White House's chief ethics lawyer during the George W Bush administration.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, Trump's team shrugged off the worries.",
      "In his first term, \"President Trump removed himself from his multi-billion-dollar real estate empire to run for office and forewent his government salary,\" Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said.",
      "\"Unlike most politicians, President Trump didn't get into politics for profit \u2013 he's fighting because he loves the people of this country and wants to make America great again.\"",
      "But Trump has taken little action in response to concerns about the potential for corruption, or appearance of it, as he prepares for a return to the White House.",
      "New opportunities",
      "Trump has faced questions about conflicts of interest before.",
      "During his first term as president, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC became a symbol of the issue, as a go-to place for lobbyists, foreign diplomats, and allies to stay and spend.",
      "Critics argued that the hotel created a way for Trump to profit indirectly from his office. He faced accusations and lawsuits alleging he violated the US Constitution's ban on presidents receiving foreign emoluments \u2013 or profiting from their office.",
      "But experts said the growth of his business empire, which now includes a publicly traded social media company, a cryptocurrency firm, and ties to a Saudi-backed golf league, makes it possible for anyone hoping to curry favour to move money more quietly and in much greater sums.",
      "\"The scale has increased and the ease has increased,\" said Michael Ohlrogge, a law professor at New York University, who has studied Trump Media, which operates Truth Social and currently represents the bulk of Trump's $6bn fortune. \"You can only book so many hotel rooms.\"",
      "On Truth Social, for example, Prof Ohlrogge said a foreign government or business could purchase ads convincing investors the firm was gaining traction, prompting a pop in its share price.",
      "Though Trump Media commands a market value of more than $7bn, there has been little sign of such activity so far. The company reported less than $5m in ad sales this year.",
      "But given the stock market's \"amplifying\" effect, Prof Ohlrogge said it would not require a lot of spending to lead to potentially significant gains for Trump, who owns more than half the shares of the company.",
      "\"His pro-crypto stance\"",
      "Nowhere is the entanglement between Trump's business interests and his public duties as stark as in the crypto industry, where he has deepened his personal involvement, while simultaneously promising to champion it while in the White House.",
      "His plans include regulatory rollback and ideas such as a national Bitcoin reserve, in which the government would stockpile the cryptocurrency.",
      "\"One of the most important issues to be determined over the next couple years is how crypto is regulated,\" said Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel at the nonpartisan Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \"Well now, he's an active player in the crypto market. How it could be regulated [could] affect his personal wealth, what kind of position he takes.\"",
      "Nik Bhatia, founder of Bitcoin Layer, a firm that advocates investments in Bitcoin, said it would be a mistake to dismiss Trump's stance on crypto as driven only by his own financial interests.",
      "\"I don't see these moves motivated by self-interest - I see them representing the electorate,\" he said.",
      "But still, he said: \"I think there probably is a conflict of interest in that his pro-crypto stance will benefit his company.\"",
      "This week, Trump said he would nominate Paul Atkins, who has lobbied for the industry, to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).",
      "He is widely expected to dial back enforcement at the agency, which polices publicly traded firms such as Trump Media for issues such as fraud and insider trading. The SEC oversaw a crackdown on the crypto industry under President Joe Biden.",
      "Mr Sun, the World Liberty Financial investor, was caught up in the SEC crackdown last year, after the agency charged him and his company with failing to properly register with the government while selling certain digital assets, among other charges.",
      "Under new leadership, the agency could very well drop the case, said John Coffee, a professor at Columbia Law School and an expert in securities law.",
      "\"The leading characteristic of Mr Atkins is that he does not like enforcement and wants to greatly restrict the range of cases the SEC will bring,\" he said.",
      "In announcing his investment last month, Mr Sun did not mention the SEC complaint - which he has said lacks merit - but did cite Trump's views on crypto.",

    "story": [
      "The \"brazen and targeted\" killing of health insurance executive Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare, outside a New York hotel this week shocked America. The reaction to the crime also exposed a simmering rage against a trillion-dollar industry.",
      "\"Prior authorisation\" does not seem like a phrase that would generate much passion.",
      "But on a hot day this past July, more than 100 people gathered outside the Minnesota headquarters of UnitedHealthcare to protest against the insurance firm's policies and denial of patient claims.",
      "\"Prior authorisation\" allows companies to review suggested treatments before agreeing to pay for them.",
      "Eleven people were arrested for blocking a road during the protest.",
      "Police records indicate they came from around the country, including Maine, New York, Texas and West Virginia, to the rally organised by the People's Action Institute.",
      "Unai Montes-Irueste, media strategy director of the Chicago-based advocacy group, said those protesting had personal experience with denied claims and other problems with the healthcare system.",
      "\"They are denied care, then they have to go through an appeals process that's incredibly difficult to win,\" he told the BBC.",
      "The latent anger felt by many Americans at the healthcare system - a dizzying array of providers, for profit and not-for-profit companies, insurance giants, and government programmes - burst into the open following the apparent targeted killing of Thompson in New York City on Wednesday.",
      "Thompson was the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, the insurance unit of health services provider UnitedHealth Group. The company is the largest insurer in the US.",
      "Police are still on the hunt for the suspected killer, whose motivation is unknown, but authorities have revealed messages written on shell casings found at the scene.",
      "The words \"deny\", \"defend\", and \"depose\" were discovered on the casings, which investigators believe could refer to tactics which critics say insurance companies use to avoid payouts and to increase profits.",
      "A scroll through Thompson's LinkedIn history reveals that many were angry about denied claims.",
      "One woman responded to a post the executive had made boasting of his firm's work on making drugs more affordable.",
      "\"I have stage 4 metastatic lung cancer,\" she wrote. \"We've just left [UnitedHealthcare] because of all the denials for my meds. Every month there is a different reason for the denial.\"",
      "Thompson's wife told US broadcaster NBC that he had received threatening messages before.",
      "\"There had been some threats,\" Paulette Thompson said. \"Basically, I don't know, a lack of [medical] coverage? I don't know details.\"",
      "\"I just know that he said there were some people that had been threatening him.\"",
      "A security expert says that frustration at high costs across a range of industries inevitably results in threats against corporate leaders.",
      "Philip Klein, who runs the Texas-based Klein Investigations, which protected Thompson when he gave a speech in the early 2000s, says that he's astonished the executive didn't have security for his trip to New York City.",
      "\"There's lot of anger in the United States of America right now,\" Mr Klein said.",
      "\"Companies need to wake up and realise that their executives could be hunted down anywhere.\"",
      "Mr Klein says he's been inundated with calls since Thompson was killed. Top US firms typically spend millions of dollars on personal security for high-level executives.",
      "In the wake of the shooting, a number of politicians and industry officials expressed shock and sympathy.",
      "Michael Tuffin, president of insurance industry organistion Ahip, said he was \"heartbroken and horrified by the loss of my friend Brian Thompson\".",
      "\"He was a devoted father, a good friend to many and a refreshingly candid colleague and leader.\"",
      "In a statement, UnitedHealth Group said it had received many messages of support  from \"patients, consumers, health care professionals, associations, government officials and other caring people\".",
      "But online many people, including UnitedHealthcare customers and users of other insurance services, reacted differently.",
      "Those reactions ranged from acerbic jokes (one common quip was \"thoughts and prior authorisations\", a play on the phrase \"thoughts and prayers\") to commentary on the number of insurance claims rejected by UnitedHealthcare and other firms.",
      "At the extreme end, critics of the industry pointedly said they had no pity for Thompson. Some even celebrated his death.",
      "The online anger seemed to bridge the political divide.",
      "Animosity was expressed from avowed socialists to right-wing activists suspicious of the so-called \"deep state\" and corporate power. It also came from ordinary people sharing stories about insurance firms denying their claims for medical treatments.",
      "Mr Montes-Irueste of People's Action said he was shocked by the news of the killing.",
      "He said his group campaigned in a \"nonviolent, democratic\" way - but he added he understood the bitterness online.",
      "\"We have a balkanised and broken healthcare system, which is why there are very strong feelings being expressed right now by folks who are experiencing that broken system in various different ways,\" he said.",
      "Mr Tuffin, head of the health insurance trade association, condemned any threats made against his colleagues, describing them as \"mission-driven professionals working to make coverage and care as affordable as possible\".",
      "The posts underlined the deep frustration many Americans feel towards health insurers and the system in general.",
      "\"The system is incredibly complicated,\" said Sara Collins, a senior scholar at The Commonwealth Fund, a healthcare research foundation.",
      "\"Just navigating and understanding how you get covered can be challenging for people,\" she said. \"And everything might seem fine until you get sick and need your plan.\"",
      "Recent Commonwealth Fund research found that 45% of insured working-age adults were charged for something they thought should have been free or covered by insurance, and less than half of those who reported suspected billing errors challenged them. And 17% of respondents said their insurer denied coverage for care that was recommended by their doctor.",
      "Not only is the US health system complicated, it's expensive, and huge costs can often fall directly on individuals.",
      "Prices are negotiated between providers and insurers, Ms Collins says, meaning that what's charged to patients or insurance companies often bears little resemblance to the actual costs of providing medical services.",
      "\"We find high rates of people saying that their healthcare costs are unaffordable, across all insurance types, even (government-funded) Medicaid and Medicare,\" she said.",
      "\"People accumulate medical debt because they can't pay their bills. This is unique to the United States. We truly have a medical debt crisis.\"",
      "A survey by researchers at health policy foundation KFF found that around two-thirds of Americans said insurance companies deserve \"a lot\" of blame for high healthcare costs. Most insured adults, 81%, still rated their health insurance as \"excellent\" or \"good\".",
      "Christine Eibner, a senior economist at the nonprofit think tank the RAND Corporation, said that in recent years insurers have been increasingly issuing denials for treatment coverage and making use of prior authorisations to decline coverage.",
      "She said premiums are about $25,000 (\u00a319,600) per family.",
      "\"On top of that, people face out-of-pocket costs, which could easily be in the thousands of dollars,\" she said.",
      "UnitedHealthcare and other insurance providers have faced lawsuits, media investigations and government probes over their practices.",
      "Last year, UnitedHealthcare settled a lawsuit brought by a chronically ill college student whose story was covered by news site ProPublica, which says he was saddled with $800,000 of medical bills when his doctor-prescribed drugs were denied.",

      "By 3pm, most of the protesters had converged in front of the National Assembly. The main thoroughfare was packed with people sitting in neat rows, as police officers lined the street.",
      "Protest flags fluttered in the cold winter breeze, while in the side streets vendors sold waffles and pastries stuffed with red-bean paste to hungry protesters.",
      "It was a diverse crowd made up of young students, office workers and retirees. Police estimated around 100,000 people showed up.",
      "With rock bands, large screens and crane cameras, South Korean protest rallies tend to resemble outdoor music festivals, and this one was no different. Throughout the afternoon, the crowd was entertained by jolly acapella tunes, sentimental folk songs, and protest anthems.",

      "\"Impeach! Impeach!\" the crowd chanted back.",

      "But there were ominous signs. Kim told reporters that he had in fact voted against impeachment. And for hours, nobody else from the PPP joined.",
      "Finally, at about 9pm, the Speaker said he would close the vote early. Immediately, the festive mood evaporated. The impeachment bill needed just five more votes to proceed, but they were nowhere in sight - and time was running out.",
      "The crowd pressed closer to the gates. \"Go in, go in!\" they pleaded, urging PPP lawmakers to re-enter the chamber to vote.",
      "At 9.20pm, the speaker closed the vote. The crowd went silent as they watched parliamentary officials sift through the ballots.",
      "Some let out disappointed groans, while a few screamed angrily at the screens. The usual chant of \"impeach, impeach\" floated through the air, but it seemed to have lost its vigour.",
      "The speaker announced the bill could not pass. It did not meet the quorum of 200 votes for counting. In the crowd, a woman let out a pained cry and buried her face in her partner's chest, sobbing.",

They have the public on their side: three quarters of South Koreans want an impeachment, according to the latest polls, while Yoon's approval rating has slid even further to just 13%.",
      "In an attempt to end on a high note, the protest leaders played All I Want for Christmas as a send-off. \"Don't forget your belongings, and please take your rubbish with you,\" they urged the dispersing crowd, as Mariah Carey's voice echoed down the rapidly emptying avenue.",

    "title": "From Syrian jihadist leader to rebel politician: How Abu Mohammed al-Jolani reinvented himself",
    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 00:35:14 GMT",
    "summary": "The HTS chief has evolved from jihadist leader to rebel statesman while fighting to overthrow Bashar al-Assad.",
    "story": [
      "Syrian rebel leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani has dropped that nom de guerre associated with his jihadist past, and been using his real name, Ahmed al-Sharaa, in official communiques issued since Thursday, ahead of the fall of President Bashar al-Assad.",
      "This move is part of Jolani's effort to bolster his legitimacy in a new context, as his Islamist militant group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), leading other rebel factions, announces the capture of the Syrian capital, Damascus, solidifying its control over much of the country.",
      "Jolani's transformation is not recent, but has been carefully cultivated over the years, evident not only in his public statements and interviews with international outlets but also in his evolving appearance.",
      "Once clad in traditional jihadist militant attire, he has adopted a more Western-style wardrobe in the past years. Now, as he leads the offensive, he has donned military fatigues, symbolising his role as the commander of the operations room.",
      "But who is Jolani - or Ahmed al-Sharaa - and why and how has he changed?",

      "Listen to BBC Monitoring's podcast The Global Jigsaw: The rebels who retook Aleppo",
      "The IS-Iraq link",
      "A 2021 PBS interview with Jolani revealed that he was born in 1982 in Saudi Arabia, where his father worked as an oil engineer until 1989.",
      "In that year, the Jolani family returned to Syria, where he grew up and lived in the Mezzeh neighbourhood of Damascus.",
      "Jolani's journey as a jihadist began in Iraq, linked to al-Qaeda through the Islamic State (IS) group's precursor - al-Qaeda in Iraq and, later, the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI).",
      "After the 2003 US-led invasion, he joined other foreign fighters in Iraq and, in 2005, was imprisoned at Camp Bucca, where he enhanced his jihadist affiliations and later on was introduced to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the quiet scholar who would later go on to lead IS.",
      "In 2011, Baghdadi sent Jolani to Syria with funding to establish al-Nusra Front, a covert faction tied to ISI. By 2012, Nusra had become a prominent Syrian fighting force, hiding its IS and al-Qaeda ties.",
      "Tensions arose in 2013 when Baghdadi's group in Iraq unilaterally declared the merger of the two groups (ISI and Nusra), declaring the creation of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS), and publicly revealing for the first time the links between them.",
      "Jolani resisted, as he wanted to distance his group from ISI's violent tactics, leading to a split.",
      "To get out of that sticky situation, Jolani pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda, making Nusra Front its Syrian branch.",
      "From the start, he prioritised winning Syrian support, distancing himself from IS's brutality and emphasising a more pragmatic approach to jihad.",
      "Syria's Assad falls - follow live updates",
      "Syria's Assad falls - follow live updates",
      "Joining al-Qaeda",
      "In April 2013, al-Nusra Front became al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate, putting it at odds with IS.",
      "While Jolani's move was partly an attempt to maintain local support and avoid alienating Syrians and rebel factions, the al-Qaeda affiliation ultimately did little to benefit this effort.",
      "It became a pressing challenge in 2015 when Nusra and other factions captured Idlib province, forcing them to co-operate in its administration.",
      "In 2016, Jolani severed ties with al-Qaeda, rebranding the group as Jabhat Fatah al-Sham and later as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in 2017.",
      "While initially appearing superficial, the split revealed deeper divisions. Al-Qaeda accused Jolani of betrayal, leading to defections and the formation of Hurras al-Din, a new al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria, which HTS later crushed in 2020. Members of Hurras al-Din, however, have remained cautiously present in the region.",
      "HTS also targeted IS operatives and foreign fighters in Idlib, dismantling their networks and forcing some to undergo \"deradicalisation\" programmes.",
      "These moves, justified as efforts to unify militant forces and reduce infighting, signalled Jolani's strategy to position HTS as a dominant and politically viable force in Syria.",
      "Despite the public split from al-Qaeda and name changes, HTS continued to be designated by the UN, US, UK and other countries as a terrorist organisation, and the US maintained a $10m reward for information about Jolani's whereabouts. Western powers considered the break-up to be a fa\u00e7ade.",
      "Forming a 'government' in Idlib",
      "Under Jolani, HTS became the dominant force in Idlib, north-west Syria's largest rebel stronghold and home to about four million people, many of whom were displaced from other Syrian provinces.",
      "To address concerns about a militant group governing the area, HTS established a civilian front, the so-called \"Syrian Salvation Government\" (SG) in 2017 as its political and administrative arm.",
      "The SG functioned like a state, with a prime minister, ministries and local departments overseeing sectors such as education, health and reconstruction, while maintaining a religious council guided by Sharia, or Islamic law.",
      "To reshape his image, Jolani actively engaged with the public, visiting displacement camps, attending events, and overseeing aid efforts, particularly during crises like the 2023 earthquakes.",
      "HTS highlighted achievements in governance and infrastructure to legitimise its rule and demonstrate its ability to provide stability and services.",
      "It has previously praised the Taliban, upon their return to power in 2021, lauding them as an inspiration and a model for effectively balancing jihadist efforts with political aspirations, including making tactical compromises to achieve their goals.",
      "Jolani's efforts in Idlib reflected his broader strategy to demonstrate HTS's ability not only to wage jihad but also to govern effectively.",
      "By prioritising stability, public services and reconstruction, he aimed to showcase Idlib as a model of success under HTS rule, enhancing both his group's legitimacy and his own political aspirations.",
      "But under his leadership, HTS has crushed and marginalised other militant factions, both jihadists and rebel ones, in its effort to consolidate its power and dominate the scene.",
      "Anti-HTS protests",
      "For over a year leading up to the HTS-led rebel offensive on 27 November, Jolani faced protests in Idlib from hardline Islamists as well as Syrian activists.",
      "Critics compared his rule to Assad's, accusing HTS of authoritarianism, suppressing dissent and silencing critics. Protesters labelled HTS's security forces as \"Shabbiha\", a term used to describe Assad's loyalist henchmen.",
      "They further alleged that HTS deliberately avoided meaningful combat against government forces and marginalised jihadists and foreign fighters in Idlib to prevent them from engaging in such actions, all to appease international actors.",
      "Even during the latest offensive, activists have persistently urged HTS to release individuals imprisoned in Idlib allegedly for expressing dissent.",
      "In response to these criticisms, HTS initiated several reforms over the past year. It disbanded or rebranded a controversial security force accused of human rights violations and established a \"Department of Grievances\" to allow citizens to lodge complaints against the group. Its critics said these measures were just a show to contain dissent.",
      "To justify its consolidation of power in Idlib and the suppression of plurality among militant groups, HTS argued that unifying under a single leadership was crucial for making progress and ultimately overthrowing the Syrian government.",
      "HTS and its civilian arm, the SG, walked a tightrope, striving to project a modern, moderate image to win over both the local population and the international community, while simultaneously maintaining their Islamist identity to satisfy hardliners within rebel-held areas and HTS's own ranks.",
      "For instance, in December 2023, HTS and the SG faced a backlash after a \"festival\" held at a glossy new shopping mall was criticised by hardliners as \"immoral\".",
      "And this August, a Paralympic Games-inspired ceremony drew sharp criticism from hardliners, prompting the SG to review the organisation of such events.",
      "These incidents illustrate the challenges HTS faces in reconciling the expectations of its Islamist base with the broader demands of the Syrian population, who are seeking freedom and coexistence after years of authoritarian rule under Assad.",
      "Leading a new path?",
      "As the latest offensive unfolded, global media focused on Jolani's jihadist past, prompting some rebel supporters to call for him to step back, viewing him as a liability.",
      "Although he previously expressed willingness to dissolve his group and step aside, his recent actions and public appearances tell a different story.",
      "HTS's success in uniting rebels and nearly capturing the whole country in under two weeks has strengthened Jolani's position, quieting hardline critics and accusations of opportunism.",
      "Jolani and the SG have since reassured domestic and international audiences.",
      "To Syrians, including minorities, they promised safety; to neighbours and powers like Russia, they pledged peaceful relations. Jolani even assured Russia its Syrian bases would remain unharmed if attacks ceased.",
      "This shift reflects HTS's \"moderate jihad\" strategy since 2017, emphasising pragmatism over rigid ideology.",
      "Jolani's approach could signal the decline of global jihad movements like IS and al-Qaeda, whose inflexibility is increasingly seen as ineffective and unsustainable.",
      "His trajectory might inspire other groups to adapt, marking either a new era of localised, politically flexible \"jihadism\" or just a temporary divergence from the traditional path in order to make political and territorial gains."

      "\"They look like chocolate truffles, just don't eat them,\" jokes Jean Mason, the curator of the Cook Islands Library and Museum as she reaches into a display cabinet and pulls out a black, knobbly rock.",
      "The \"rock\" she is holding may well determine the future of this Pacific nation.",
      "It is what scientists call a polymetallic nodule, created over millennia as minerals accumulate on the seabed.",
      "Packed full of cobalt, nickel and manganese, these ancient formations are now  valuable: the metals go into batteries that power modern life, from electric cars to mobile phones.",
      "They have become a source of friction in the low-lying Pacific Islands, which are among the nations most vulnerable to climate change.",
      "With rising sea levels, the ocean - or Moana, as it's called in M\u0101ori and many other Polynesian languages - remains their greatest threat, but it is also their biggest provider.",
      "They fish in it and they live off the tourists drawn to their turquoise waters, but now the Cook Islands wants to dig deeper, up to 6,000m (19,685 ft), where the nodules lie.",
      "It's a pet project for Prime Minister Mark Brown, who believes it will reshape this country of 15 volcanic islands in the southern Pacific.",
      "The hope is that the income from these metals could lead to more prosperity than the islanders had ever imagined.",
      "Except the promise of deep sea mining may carry an environmental price.",
      "Proponents say that harvesting these nodules for use in renewables will help the world transition from fossil fuels. They also believe that it is less invasive than mining on land.",
      "But critics argue so much is still unknown about the impact of extracting what is one of the last untouched parts of the planet. They say there should be a pause on deep sea mining until there is more research on its effects on marine life and the oceanic ecosystem.",
      "When Jean was growing up, she says, the nodules were only thought to be useful for making knife blades.",
      "\"We had no idea that cell phones were going to come, and wind turbines and electric cars.\"",
      "Nodules are a family conversation here and Jean is firmly in favour of mining them. Her husband is a lawyer for one of the companies given exploration licences by the government.",
      "The library where she works is stacked full of holiday reads left or donated by tourists  \u2013 tourism is the country's biggest earner, accounting for more than 70% of its GDP.",

      "The gold in the oceans",
      "The Pacific Ocean covers close to a third of the planet. And the nodules buried in it have been known about since the 19th Century.",
      "But in the 1960s, American geologist John L Mero published a book setting out the case that the seabed could provide many of the world's mineral needs.",
      "It's not an easy process \u2013 nor a cheap one. But when prices of metals like nickel soared in 2008, it looked more appealing.",
      "Then Covid hit. Tourists left and the money dried up.",
      "Together with the impact of climate change - rising sea levels and unpredictable weather patterns - the country quickly realised it needed something else to rely on.",
      "The Cook Islands' Seabeds Minerals Authority estimates there are 12 billion wet tonnes of polymetallic nodules in their waters.",
      "Some people argue mining the seabed is not financially viable. With technology moving so fast, these metals may not even be in demand by the time it gets going.",
      "But there are takers. And in 2022, the Cook Islands gave out three licences to companies to start exploring the possibility of deep-sea mining.",
      "They're now working with scientists in researching the environmental impact.",
      "\"Nothing we do in life is risk-free. So, if you want zero risk you need to go and sit in a little room with cotton wool around you,\" says Hans Smit, who runs Moana Minerals, one of the firms that has an exploration licence.",
      "\"We have this lifestyle, this lifestyle has a price. If we don't want mining and we don't want to get all these metals, we need to stop doing just about everything we're doing.\"",
      "Hans is from South Africa and moved here to be part of the community. To him, the deep-sea metals are an \"incredible resource\" that could benefit the islanders.",
      "While there's a growing call to delay deep-sea mining until regulations by the International Seabed Authority are drawn up, this only applies to international waters.",
      "The Cook Islands still have huge reserves of their own in their national waters - their Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) - so, they can crack on regardless.",
      "\"We're known as small-island developing states, but we like to call ourselves large ocean states,\" says Rima Brown, a young Cook Islander with a geography degree who jokingly calls herself the poster child for deep-sea mining.",
      "Rima works for the Seabed Minerals Authority and much of her time is spent mapping the sea bed.",
      "\"While we're only about 200 square kilometers in land mass, we have an exclusive economic zone of almost 2 million square kilometres,\" she says.",
      "That's the equivalent of Mexico.",
      "\"It's the only resource we've got,\" Jean says.",
      "\"[Industrialised nations] destroy our atmosphere and then they've got a nerve to tell us, let's leave your stuff in the seabed. How dare they tell us we can't touch our resources?\"",

      "\"We're seeing infrastructure being put up here on Rarotonga, accommodation for offshore mining companies to reside here, we've got draft mining regulations already in place. Actions are speaking a lot louder than words at the moment.\"",
      "Prime Minister Mark Brown, who is driving this, also happens to be the tourism minister and the seabed minerals minister. He's made it clear he wants the Cook Islands to be a leader in the industry.",
      "\"It provides the opportunity for our kids to be able to study at any university in the world without having to incur a student loan,\" says Brown, who has a vision of following the lead of Norway in establishing a sovereign wealth fund.",
      "\"It allows us to have the type of health care that our people have to go to New Zealand or Australia for. It allows our young people the opportunity to live fulfilling lives here in our country, without having to go to other countries to ply their trade in an industry that doesn't exist here.\"",
      "To those who say a country threatened by climate change risks becoming part of the problem, he argues he's trying to find solutions.",
      "\"We know that for the last 20 years we haven't been able to get the financing from the larger emitting countries, so we've got to look for ways to protect ourselves.\"",
      "But activist June Hosking isn't convinced.",
      "She's from one of the outer islands, Mauke, with a population of just 300 people.",
      "While the government has organised consultations with residents across the islands as well as the large diaspora in New Zealand, she says the potential downsides of the industry are not being discussed.",
      "\"People don't like to rock the boat in the outer islands,\" she says. \"So, when we have these consultations, there's only maybe three of us who would speak up.\"",

      "The federal environment ministry has said that only 130 sq km or 14% of the total area of the island will be cleared for the project \u2013 but that's still about 964,000 trees. Experts warn the actual number could be much higher.",
      "\u201cThe government always claims only a part of the forest will be cleared. But the infrastructure you're building would lead to more pollution, which in turn would impact the entire habitat,\" says Madhav Gadgil, an ecologist.",
      "The environment ministry did not respond to BBC's request for comment.",
      "But Environment Minister Bhupendra Yadav in August had said that the project \u201cwill not disturb or displace\u201d tribespeople and that it had received environmental clearances based on the \u201crigour of environmental scrutiny and after incorporating consequent safeguards\u201d.",
      "Yet, not everyone is convinced.",
      "Earlier this year, 39 international experts from different fields of social sciences had warned that the development project would be a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d for the Shompen as it would destroy their habitat.",
      "It's a fear that haunts Mr Justin too: \"The Shompen people do not have the knowledge or the means to survive in an industrial world,\" he says.",
      "He worries the group could meet the same fate as the Nicobarese, the biggest tribal group on the island, which suffered displacement in 2004, when a massive tsunami in the Indian Ocean wiped out their villages.",
      "Over the years, the government made efforts to resettle the people to a different area - but that too came at a price.",
      "\u201cMost Nicobarese here are now manual labourers and stay in a settlement instead of their ancestral lands,\u201d Mr Justin says. \"They have no place to grow crops or keep animals.\u201d",
      "There are fears that the project could also expose the Shompen to diseases.",
      "\u201cUncontacted peoples have little to no immunity to outside diseases like flu and measles which can and do wipe them out - they typically lose around two thirds of their population after contact,\u201d says Callum Russell, an official at Survival International, a conservation group.",
      "There are other wider environmental concerns as well, especially about the marine life of the region.",
      "Ecologists warn of the effect on the Galathea Bay on the south-eastern side of the island, which has been the nesting place for giant leatherback sea turtles for centuries.",
      "Dr Manish Chandi, a social ecologist, says the project is proposed in an area which is home to saltwater crocodiles and the island's water monitors, fish and avifauna.",
      "A government statement has said the nesting and breeding grounds of these species would not be altered.",
      "But Mr Chandi points out that there are several other species that nest in the area - such as the Leatherback sea turtles, corals and giant robber crabs - which might get displaced.",
      "Even though the project would take 30 long years to finish, people can't help but feel anxious about how it will irreversibly alter the delicate balance of both the environment and the lives of the island's indigenous people.",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 07:16:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Cuba's hotels, already hit by power cuts, are now worried about Donald Trump's re-election.",
    "story": [
      "With winter nights drawing in across North America, Canadian \u201csnowbirds\u201d \u2013 citizens who flee their freezing temperatures for sunnier climes every year \u2013 are planning their annual trips to Florida or the Caribbean.",
      "Traditionally, Cuba has been hugely popular among Canadians, drawn to the pristine white sands of beach resorts like Varadero.",
      "They fill the void left by Americans wary of the travel restrictions imposed on them under the continuing US economic embargo of the largest island in the Caribbean.",
      "Figures show that almost one million Canadian tourists visited Cuba last year, the top country of origin for visitors by some margin.",
      "As such, a recent decision by the Canadian tour operator, Sunwing Vacations Group \u2013 one of Cuba\u2019s leading travel partners \u2013 to remove 26 hotels from its Cuba portfolio is a blow to the island\u2019s struggling tourism industry.",
      "Sunwing took the decision after Cuba endured a four-day nationwide blackout at the end of October, caused by failures with the country's aging energy infrastructure.",
      "This was followed by another national power cut last month, when Hurricane Rafael barrelled its way across the island, worsening an already-acute electricity crisis.",
      "A third countrywide blackout then happened on Wednesday, 4 Dec, after Cuba's largest power plant broke down.",
      "\u201cCuba has had some volatility in the last few weeks and that may shake consumer confidence,\u201d Sunwing\u2019s chief marketing officer, Samantha Taylor told the Pax News travel website last month.",
      "\u201cThere are incredible places to go in Cuba,\u201d she stressed, keen to emphasise that the company isn\u2019t pulling out of Cuba altogether. \u201cBut we also recognise that if clients are a little uncomfortable, we need to give them options.\u201d",
      "Specifically, that involved drawing up a list of what they called \u201chidden gems\u201d \u2013 alternative holiday destinations in the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and Colombia.",
      "The implications for Cuba are clear.",
      "With tourism now the island\u2019s principal economic motor, and the main source of foreign currency earnings after remittances, that an important tour operator is pointing its customers towards other countries\u2019 beaches over crumbling energy infrastructure is a real concern.",
      "\u201cOur message to Canadians is that tourism is one of the economy\u2019s priorities,\u201d said Lessner G\u00f3mez, director of the Cuban Tourism Board in Toronto in a statement. \u201cThe Ministry of Tourism has been preparing for the winter season to deliver better services, uninterrupted supplies, a better airport experience, and more and new car rentals.\u201d",
      "While Cuba\u2019s tourism agency tries to ease fears about the extent of the electricity blackouts, few can deny that these have been extremely difficult months on the island. Hurricane Rafael was only the latest storm to hit Cuba in a frenetic Atlantic hurricane season in which more powerful and more frequent storms are the new normal.",
      "Of course, severe weather is a problem across the Caribbean. But for Cuba, there are other complications in play.",
      "Donald Trump\u2019s re-election to the White House and his choice for Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, stand to make life even more complicated for Cubans than it already is.",
      "\u201cThis is probably the Cuban Revolution\u2019s hardest moment,\u201d says former Cuban diplomat, Jes\u00fas Arboleya. \u201cAnd unfortunately, I see nothing on the horizon whatsoever which allows for an optimistic view of the future of US-Cuba relations.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump has handed US policy towards Cuba to those sectors of the Cuban American right who have essentially lived off anti-Castro policies since their origins.\u201d",
      "Mr Arboleya adds that Marco Rubio, currently a US Senator for Florida, is the leading voice among them. He is a Cuban American long opposed to the communist government in Havana.",
      "His parents were Cubans who moved to the US in 1956, three years before Fidel Castro seized power, but his grandfather fled the Castro-led turn to communism on the island.",
      "\u201cPeople are horrified by the idea of another Donald Trump presidency. It spells real trouble,\u201d echoes Cuban political commentator and editor of Temas magazine, Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez.",
      "Current US policy towards Cuba is \u201csomewhat schizophrenic\u201d, he argues.",
      "\u201cOn the one hand, the State Department facilitates support to the private sector, and [pushes for] economic changes in Cuba. But on the other hand, Congress and Senate seem to freeze any advances on those reforms.\u201d",
      "The expectation is, however, that a future Secretary of State Rubio will coalesce the US\u2019s Cuba policy around a single idea - maximum pressure on the island by tightening the already-harsh sanctions.",
      "Cubans fear that could mean the suspension of commercial flights to Cuba, or even the closure of the US Embassy in Havana, which was officially reopened in 2015 after decades of frosty relations.",
      "If implemented, such steps would be deliberately designed to further harm Cuba\u2019s floundering tourism trade, the aim to hit the communist-run nation when it\u2019s down. Tourist numbers to Cuba have almost halved since the high point of nearly five million visitors during the Obama-era d\u00e9tente with Cuba.",
      "Between 2015-2017 US visitors flocked to the island under more relaxed travel restrictions, keen to experience a country that had long been denied them. Around the same time, the Cuban government embarked on a major hotel-building spree, confident that demand would remain strong over the next decade.",
      "However, there followed a double blow to Cuban tourism from which it hasn\u2019t fully recovered. First, the Trump Administration rolled back President Obama\u2019s engagement policies, and then the Covid-19 pandemic sent the industry into freefall.",
      "With many of those hotels now registering much lower occupancy rates than originally predicted, and real difficulties in providing the five-star customer experience as advertised amid the blackouts and shortages, some question the strategy of putting so many eggs in the tourism basket in the first place.",
      "\u201cWhy has Cuba invested 38% [of government funds] on average over the past decade in hotels and infrastructure connected to international tourism, but only 8 to 9% on energy infrastructure?\u201d asks economist Ricardo Torres at the American University in Washington DC. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. The hotels run on electricity.\u201d",
      "Even with all the current challenges, most visitors agree that Cuba remains a unique travel experience. The cliches \u2013 classic cars, cigars and mojitos \u2013 still appeal to many, while others prefer to travel the island absorbing its history, culture and music.",
      "Yet as tour operator Sunwings\u2019 decision to step back shows, some tourists are finding it hard to appreciate Cuba during its energy crisis, especially if it\u2019s about to be exacerbated by a hostile administration \u2013 and Secretary of State \u2013 in Washington."

    "title": "How a uranium mine became a pawn in the row between Niger and France",
    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 01:56:57 GMT",
    "summary": "France's nuclear giant has lost control of its uranium mining operations in the West African state.",
    "story": [
      "In the latest sign of a dramatic deterioration in relations, Niger's military rulers appear increasingly determined to drive France out of any significant sector in their economy - and particularly uranium mining.",
      "This week the French state nuclear company Orano announced that the junta - which deposed France's ally, President Mohamed Bazoum, in a coup in July 2023 - had taken operational control of its local mining firm, Soma\u00efr.",
      "The company's efforts to resume exports have for months been blocked by the regime and it is being pushed into financial crisis.",
      "And the impact could be felt more widely - although Niger accounts for less than 5% of the uranium produced globally, in 2022 it accounted for a quarter of the supply to nuclear power plants across Europe.",
      "So the timing could hardly be more awkward, as Western countries struggle to meet the challenge of climate change and cut their carbon emissions from electricity generation.",
      "For French President Emmanuel Macron, already wrestling with political crisis at home, the potential departure of Orano from Niger is certainly awkward in image terms.",
      "For it coincides with bruising news from other long-standing African partners - Chad has suddenly announced the ending of a defence agreement with Paris, while Senegal has confirmed its insistence on the eventual closure of the French military base in Dakar.",
      "But in any case, the crisis facing Orano in Niger represents a significant practical challenge for French energy supply.",
      "With 18 nuclear plants, totalling 56 reactors, which generate almost 65% of its electricity, France has been ahead of the game in containing carbon emissions from the power sector.",
      "But the country's own limited production of uranium ended more than 20 years ago.",
      "So, over the past decade or so, it has imported almost 90,000 tonnes - a fifth of which has come from Niger. Only Kazakhstan - which accounts for 45% of global output - was a more important source of supply.",
      "The continuing paralysis, or the definitive shutdown, of Orano's operations in Niger would certainly force France to look elsewhere.",
      "This should be achievable, as alternative supplies can be obtained from countries including Uzbekistan, Australia and Namibia.",
      "Last year, as West African neighbours responded to the coup in Niger by imposing a trade blockade that paralysed uranium exports, other suppliers readily stepped into the breach.",
      "The European Union's imports of the mineral from the country plunged by a third, but these were largely replaced by Canada.",
      "But there was also a politically awkward price to pay. EU imports of uranium from Russia rose by more than 70%, despite the heavy sanctions imposed on Moscow because of its invasion of Ukraine.",
      "And of course, it is Russia which has become the new best friend of the military leaders who have seized power in Niger and its allied neighbours, Burkina Faso and Mali, since 2020.",
      "Russian military contractors fight alongside the Malian army in its campaign against jihadists and ethnic Tuareg separatists, while they also help to protect the senior leadership of the juntas in Niger and Burkina Faso.",
      "So although France, and Europe more generally, would be able to find ways to cope with a definitive loss of Niger's uranium supply, the shift would not be entirely comfortable.",
      "In the short-term at least, EU states would probably become more reliant on Russia and its central Asian neighbours, thus undermining their own effort to maintain economic pressure on President Vladimir Putin during a potentially crucial period in the Ukraine crisis.",
      "Moreover, Niger's regime, whose attitude towards the EU as a whole has become almost as mistrustful as its broken relationship with France, continues to seek alternatives to its old Western partnerships.",
      "And Iran - a potential customer, of course, for uranium - has emerged as an option.",
      "Contacts between the two governments have deepened, with Niger's Prime Minister Ali Mahamane Lamine Zeine visiting Tehran in January. Rumours of a possible deal for the supply of uranium \"yellowcake\" (concentrate) briefly circulated a few months ago.",
      "Meanwhile, the outlook for Orano's hopes of restoring normal uranium operations and exports from Niger look dim, given the hostile attitude of the military regime in Niamey.",
      "That antipathy is partly explained by Macron's vocal condemnation of the July 2023 overthrow of Bazoum, who had been one of his closest African political and security partners.",
      "Paris firmly endorsed the tough stance of the West African regional grouping Ecowas, and there were even rumours that it might have been ready to provide tacit support had the bloc ever gone ahead with its short-lived threat to intervene militarily in Niger to reinstate Bazoum.",
      "In this poisonous atmosphere of hostility and mistrust, Orano was an obvious and convenient target for junta retaliation.",
      "The French company's predominant role in the uranium sector had for years fuelled resentment among many Nig\u00e9riens, amidst claims that the French company was buying their uranium on the cheap, despite periodic renegotiations of the export deal. Although the mining operations only started years after independence, they were seen as emblematic of France's ongoing post-colonial influence.",
      "After last year's coup, Orano itself tried to stay out of the diplomatic row, keep a low profile and carry on operating normally.",
      "But the Ecowas trade blockade prevented it from exporting the output from the Soma\u00efr mine, near Arlit, in the Sahara Desert.",
      "And even after the sanctions were lifted in late February, the usual uranium export route, via Benin's port of Cotonou, remained blocked, because the junta kept the border closed in an ongoing political row with Benin.",
      "Orano offered to fly the uranium out, but the regime shunned this suggestion.",
      "In June the junta cancelled the French company's rights to develop a new mine at the large Imouraren deposit, which had been seen as the uranium sector's principal new hope for future growth.",
      "Meanwhile, the export blockage was pushing Soma\u00efr, which by November was sitting on 1,150 tonnes of blockaded stocks of uranium concentrate worth $210m (\u00a3165m), into financial crisis.",
      "And when Orano decided to halt further production and prioritise the payment of workforce salaries, relations with the government deteriorated further into this week's almost total breakdown.",
      "Of course, it is not just the company but also Niger's economy that pays a price for this situation, in lost export earnings and risking hundreds of jobs.",
      "For Arlit and other communities in the desert north, this would be a devastating blow, despite talk of revived activity at a Chinese mining project in the region and some interest in the sector among other potential partners.",
      "But Niger's junta feels no need to make concessions to Orano because it is now buoyed by a sharp rise in oil exports, thanks to a new Chinese-built pipeline.",
      "With that financial cushion, the regime appears prepared to bear the cost of paralysing and probably dismantling the traditional uranium partnership with France - now its main international opponent.",

    "summary": "Shanthi tried her best to create a sense of normality for her children on the remote British island Diego Garcia.",
    "story": [
      "It's morning in a makeshift camp on the remote British island of Diego Garcia, and Shanthi's husband has just awoken to find their young children staring through a security fence.",
      "As the children watch an officer and guard dog patrol the secretive island, home to a strategic UK-US military base in the middle of the Indian Ocean, they make a stark remark: \"Even the dogs have more freedom than us.\"",
      "\"When I heard that I felt heartbroken,\" he says.",
      "It was a scene that captured their family's predicament - they were stranded on a mysterious military fortress by accident, yet had a son and daughter, aged five and nine, to raise.",
      "In an effort to find normality in the tiny camp they were housed in under constant surveillance, the family found ways to entertain themselves, to study, grow food and celebrate special occasions.",
      "Shanthi, not her real name, says they had paid $5,000 (\u00a33,900) in savings and given all of her gold jewellery to smugglers for an ambitious journey to Canada, more than 12,000 km away, with dozens of other Sri Lankan Tamils.",
      "They all said they were fleeing persecution in Sri Lanka and India, some because of links with the former Tamil Tiger rebels who were defeated in the civil war that ended in 2009.",
      "The fishing boat they were in leaked in rough seas, prompting their rescue by the Royal Navy who took them in October 2021 to Diego Garcia - and they were placed in the fenced-off migrant camp. Shanthi remembers her son asking if they had arrived in Canada.",
      "Her young children received no formal education on the island for the first six months there so, as a trained teacher, Shanthi began giving English lessons to the children in the camp.",
      "\"We started with the basics - the alphabet, nouns, verbs, present continuous,\" she says.",
      "Shanthi's husband later built a writing desk out of wooden pallets so the children could do homework in the tent.",
      "The children soon began to complain of boredom in the evenings so Shanthi - who had trained in Bharatanatyam, an Indian classical dance - began giving dance lessons, too, playing music downloaded from her phone.",
      "Three years after the family first arrived in the camp, they were finally sent to the UK this week in what the government described as a \"one off\" case in the interests of their welfare.",
      "\"It's like an open prison - we were not allowed to go outside, we were just living in a fence and in a tent,\" Shanthi, aged in her early 30s, says in an interview on the outskirts of London.",
      "\"Every day our life was the same.\"",
      "It was like living \"in a cage,\" she adds.",
      "While guards watched and military jets occasionally roared overhead, Shanthi and the other Tamils approached British forces on the island with a letter asking to be sent to a safe country. It marked the first time that asylum claims had ever been filed in the territory.",
      "This sparked a lengthy legal battle 6,000 miles away in the UK, and while that took its course, Shanthi and the others stuck there, took matters into her own hands.",
      "While the Tamils were not allowed to cook their own food, the camp was full of coconut trees, and Shanthi and others used the husks to line planters in which they grew their own vegetables - chilli, garlic and cucumber.",
      "\"They would sometimes give us red chilis so we dried them in the sun and collected the seeds and then grew them. In the salad sometimes we'd get cucumber so we collected the seeds and kept them in the sunlight and after they dried they would grow,\" she says.",
      "Every day, they would make sambol - a popular Sri Lankan side dish - by mashing the coconut and chilli.",
      "They struggled to eat the American food served to them from the base, and would put the vegetables in hot water with garlic and chilli to try to make curries.",
      "With limited access to clothing, particularly for the 16 children in the camp, Shanthi and other women stitched dresses from bed sheets. Come Christmas time, they turned paper napkins into flowers, and cut moon and star shapes out of food containers to decorate a tree.",
      "Relations with the guards that watched over them were often tense, but at Diwali, Shanthi says an \"officer with a good heart brought us a biryani\". On another occasion, a guard brought a cake for her son, who had been counting down the days to his birthday.",
      "But as time went on, Shanthi says, the feelings of helplessness grew.",
      "Life in the camp was to exist in a bubble - news of major wars breaking out in Ukraine and the Middle East trickled through from the guards watching over the migrants, but they were kept away from the base and consumed by their own lives.",
      "Access to the island, part of the Chagos Archipelago, is heavily restricted. It has officially had no resident population since the early 1970s when the UK evicted all the people living there so it could develop the strategic base.",
      "\"From day one until we left, every day we were living with rats,\" Shanthi says. \"Sometimes the rats would bite our children - their legs, fingers and hands. They stole our food. At nights sometimes they would crawl over our blankets and our heads.\"",
      "Giant coconut crabs and tropical fire ants would also crawl into the camp.",
      "During storms, rain water would pour in through holes in the tents, which had previously been used for Covid patients in the pandemic.",
      "When United Nations investigators visited the camp late last year, the children told them they dreamed of going for a picnic, riding a bike or eating an ice cream.",
      "At one point earlier this year, a medical official described the camp as being in \"complete crisis\", with mass self-harming and incidents of attempted suicide.",
      "\"My daughter was watching everything that happened. She'd say 'mum they've cut themselves. Should I cut myself?' So I'd say 'no, no. You can't do anything. I'll protect you. Come and listen to some music, come and take some paper and just draw,'\" she recalls through tears.",
      "Both she and her husband sob as they talk about the two times their daughter self-harmed.",
      "\"Both times I felt really bad and couldn't process it. When she did this, she told me she did it because she hoped if she died her parents and her brother would go to a safe third country,\" Shanthi says.",
      "There were also cases and allegations of sexual assault and harassment within the camp by other migrants, including against children.",
      "\"Over three years we suffered so much. I don't know how we survived,\" Shanthi says.",
      "Throughout the Tamils' time on the island, British authorities acknowledged that it was not a suitable place for them, and said they were looking for long-term solutions. The government said the group's wellbeing and safety was the \"top priority\".",
      "Shanthi says the happiest moment in the camp came recently when officials announced that they would be brought to the UK, where they would be given the right to remain for six months. Shanthi says no one in the camp slept that night.",
      "Upon arriving in the UK, Shanthi says she was struck by \"the cold\" - and it felt like waking from a coma. She had forgotten how to download apps, send WhatsApp messages or pay in shops.",
      "Her children talk of starting school, making friends and riding a double-decker bus.",
      "But the family's long-term future remains uncertain. They have now filed asylum claims in the UK in hopes of remaining. If unsuccessful, they will likely be returned to Sri Lanka.",
      "The UK agreed earlier this year to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius in a historic move. Under the deal, which has still to be signed, Diego Garcia would continue to operate as a UK-US military base but Mauritius would take responsibility for any future migrant arrivals.",

      "Last month, Rishabh Pant became the most expensive player in the history of the Indian Premier League (IPL) as he was signed by Lucknow SuperGiants for 27 crore rupees (\u00a32.54m) at the mega auction in Saudi Arabia.",
      "But it was the news of Prithvi Shaw - Pant's Delhi Capitals teammate - going unsold that grabbed more attention.",
      "Among those seated in the auction in positions to make bids were Sourav Ganguly and Ricky Ponting, who had been closely associated with Shaw in his years with Capitals, as also Rahul Dravid, who was coach when India won the under-19 World Cup under Shaw in 2018.",
      "Their disinterest was telling. Shaw found no takers.",
      "Ironically, just nine months earlier, before the start of the 2024 IPL season, it was Pant whose career looked in jeopardy.",
      "A horrific car crash in December 2022 had left him with multiple life-threatening injuries. But showing iron will, great determination and self-discipline, Pant fought his way back from what seemed a dead-end to his career.",
      "Pant faced the challenges of IPL 2024 head-on and excelled, earning a rapid recall to international cricket. He was part of the T20 World Cup-winning squad. Dominating the domestic season, he impressed in the domestic Duleep Trophy, paving the way for a sensational return to Test cricket. Against Bangladesh, he lit up the field with a scorching century.",
      "Shaw, meanwhile, under pressure after a couple of poor IPL seasons, has lurched from one crisis to another.",
      "His indifferent form in IPL 2024 saw him lose his place in the playing XI mid-season. A spate of low scores in the current domestic season saw him lose his place in the Mumbai Ranji Trophy team too. And an outright rejection in the IPL mega auction has brought his career to the precipice of a premature end.",
      "It's been a mighty tumble for the 25-year-old, who not too long ago, was touted as the 'next big thing\u2019 in Indian cricket.",
      "Shaw hit the headlines in November 2013 as a 14-year-old when he smashed 546 runs for Rizvi Springfield in the Harris Shield, a prestigious school cricket tournament. It was the highest score in the world in minor cricket then.",
      "Sachin Tendulkar, India\u2019s most celebrated cricketer, had retired only a week earlier, and Shaw earned an instant comparison with the maestro.",
      "Tendulkar's spectacular rise to eminence following his world record 664-runs partnership with Vinod Kambli in a school game way back in 1987, had inspired quite a few batting prodigies, especially from Mumbai. Shaw was one of them.",
      "A short and stocky opening batsman, Shaw did not have the technical virtuosity Tendulkar had even as a teenager. But he had a gift of timing, and took the attack to the bowlers with such panache that selectors were instantly enamoured.",
      "He was fast-tracked into first-class cricket, like Tendulkar, scoring a century on debut in the domestic Ranji and Duleep Trophy, which hardened comparisons between the two.",
      "In late 2018, he got a Test call-up against the West Indies. Shaw hit 134 off just 154 deliveries, studded with rifle-shot drives, cuts and pulls. He was barely 19. Only Tendulkar among Indians had scored his maiden Test century at a younger age.",
      "Touted as a worthy successor to Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, Shaw had the world at his feet. But he's been on a slippery slope since.",
      "Six years after his sensational debut he played in only four more Tests. Add six ODIs and a solitary T20i, it still makes for a dismal aggregate of international appearances for a batsman whose precocity had promised a long, dazzling career.",
      "An unfortunate foot injury, which saw him being sent back from the tour of Australia in 2020 was the start of Shaw's problems. Later that year, he tested positive for a banned substance and was lucky to get away with a light sentence. Thereafter his batting form started declining steadily, touching excellence agonisingly infrequently to impress selectors.",
      "Meanwhile stories of Shaw getting embroiled in wild parties and brawls started to spread. By the middle of IPL 2024, he was on notice, as it were. After the IPL 2025 mega auction, his career seems engulfed in uncertainty.",
      "Injury, illness, and poor form can derail even the best, but those close to Shaw reveal that misfortune has played only a minor role in his precarious downfall.",
      "Ricky Ponting, who as Delhi Capitals coach worked closely with Shaw, says: \"There's only so much [advice] you can give and only so many times you can try [to sort him out] .\"",
      "Former India batsman Praveen Amre, who was assistant coach with Delhi Capitals was more direct. \"Prithvi\u2019s inability to handle IPL fame and money has been his undoing. I\u2019ve talked to him several times, giving him the example of Vinod Kambli who frittered away his career for the lack of discipline,\u2019\u2019 Amre told a national daily.",
      "The IPL has revolutionised young players\u2019 lives, offering a platform for talent and livelihood. Yet, the challenges of early success, instant fame,and rapid wealth remain pressing. Rahul Dravid, drawing on his experience as U-19 and India A coach, has emphasised the need for stronger junior-level mentoring to keep players on track. Shaw\u2019s struggles underscore the importance of his insight.",
      "What the future holds for Shaw time will tell.",
      "At 25, he still has age on his side. But Indian cricket is overflowing with talent, and competition for places is intense. The path from here is all uphill.",
      "\"Some of the greatest sports stories are comeback stories, If Prithvi Shaw has decent people around him who care about his long term success, they\u2019d sit him down, tell him to get off social media & train his absolute backside off in getting super fit. It\u2019ll get him back into the correct path where past success can return. Too talented to throw it all away,\" Former England captain Kevin Pietersen posted on X.",
      "The message to Shaw is clear. Redemption lies in his own hands.",

    "published": "Sat, 07 Dec 2024 01:18:02 GMT",
    "summary": "President Yoon Suk-yeol's martial law announcement left many Koreans with one thought: not again.",
    "story": [
      "Koh Jae-hak can still vividly remember when he saw policemen gunning down a group of young women in cold blood.",
      "It was April 1960. Students had launched protests calling for the resignation of the dictatorial president Syngman Rhee. Mr Koh was working in a government building when he looked out of the window and saw protesters clashing with police.",
      "\"There were demonstrations from various universities, and they all gathered in front\u2026 that's when shots were fired,\" the 87-year-old said. Days later, martial law was declared.",
      "South Korea is widely considered a peaceful beacon of democracy in Asia, but that wasn't always the case. This is a country that saw 16 bouts of martial law during its first four decades ruled largely by dictators.",
      "It is why democracy is now deeply treasured by South Koreans as a hard-won right. It is also why President Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration of martial law this week \u2013 the first to happen in 45 years and during democratic rule - was particularly triggering and prompted such a visceral response.",
      "Almost immediately, lawmakers jumped out of bed and rushed to the national assembly, clambering over fences to reverse martial law.",
      "Hundreds of ordinary citizens gathered to hold back troops who had been ordered to throw out MPs.",
      "Some soldiers, apparently unwilling to carry out their orders, reportedly dragged their feet in clearing the crowd and entering the building.",
      "When Yoon declared martial law on Tuesday night, he said it was necessary to get rid of \"pro-North anti-state\" forces. Initially, it caused confusion with some South Koreans who believed there was a genuine threat from the North.",
      "But as they continued watching Yoon's televised announcement, many grew sceptical. He gave no evidence of such forces at work, nor explained who they were. As Yoon had previously used similar language to describe the opposition that had been stymying his reforms, the public concluded he was actually trying to crush his political foes.",
      "Previous periods of martial law had also been justified by leaders as necessary to stabilise the country, and sometimes stamp out what they alleged were communist subversives planted by North Korea.",
      "They curtailed freedom of press and freedom of movement. Night curfews and arrests were common.",
      "Violent clashes sometimes took place, most indelibly in 1980, when then President Chun Doo-hwan extended martial law to deal with student protesters calling for democracy in the southern city of Gwangju. A brutal military crackdown was launched, and it has since been labelled a massacre \u2013 while the official death toll is 193, some experts believe hundreds more died.",
      "South Korea eventually transitioned to democracy in 1988, when the government held its first free and fair presidential election following mounting public pressure. But the preceding decades had permanently and profoundly shaped the nation's consciousness.",
      "\"Most Koreans have trauma, deep trauma, about martial law,\" said Kelly Kim, 53, an environmental activist. \"We don't want to repeat the same thing over and over.\"",
      "Ms Kim was a young child when martial law was last in place and has little memory of it. Still, she shudders at the thought of it returning.",
      "\"The government would control all the media, our normal activities. I'm working in civil society, so all our activities, like criticising the government, would not be possible under the martial law. So that's really horrible.\"",
      "Fear, fury and triumph: Six hours that shook South Korea",
      "'We had to stop this': Woman who grabbed South Korean soldier's gun speaks to BBC",
      "Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea's scandal-hit president who declared martial law",
      "The freedoms afforded by democracy have not just led to a thriving civil society.",
      "In the more than 35 years since that first democratic election, South Korea's creative industries have flourished, with its dramas, TV shows, music and literature becoming world famous. Those creative industries have turned their own lenses onto the country's past, bringing history to life for those too young to remember.",
      "The country has seen a proliferation of shows about its dictatorship past, immortalising incidents such as the Gwangju uprising in popular culture.",
      "Some were blockbusters featuring South Korea's biggest stars, such as last year's 12.12 The Day, a historical drama starring popular actor Hwang Jung-min. The movie depicts the political chaos that took place in 1979 as martial law was declared following the assassination of then president Park Chung-hee.",
      "\"As soon as I saw the images [of Yoon's declaration of martial law], it reminded me of that movie\u2026 it made me question, are we about to repeat that history now?\" said Marina Kang, a 37-year-old web designer.",
      "\"Korea's got a wealth of visual representational works [of that era] in films and documentaries. Though we only have indirect experience of the horrific past through these works\u2026 that still makes me feel very strongly that such events should not happen again.\"",
      "Among younger citizens, there is a sense of disbelief that it could have returned. Despite never knowing life under martial law, they have been taught by their parents and older relatives to fear it.",
      "\"At first [when I heard Yoon's announcement], I was excited at the thought of getting a day off from school. But that joy was fleeting, and I was overwhelmed by the fear of daily life collapsing. I couldn't sleep,\" said 15-year-old Kwon Hoo.",
      "\"My father was concerned that under martial law, he wouldn't be able to stay out late even though his work required him to\u2026 when he heard the news about the possibility of a curfew being imposed again, he started swearing while watching the news.\"",
      "Not all South Koreans feel this way about their past.",
      "\"The vast majority of Koreans appreciate democracy enormously and regret the authoritarianism of the post-war period,\" said Mason Richey, associate professor of international politics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul.",
      "But, he added, \"the country remains very divided regarding numerous aspects of the authoritarian past, notably how justified certain repressive measures were in order to prevent communist subversion.\"",
      "There is the view among a significant portion of the population, especially among older folk, that martial law was necessary in the past for stability and democracy.",
      "\"Back then, it was a time defined by ideological warfare between democracy and communist socialism,\" said Kang Hyo-san, 83. He was sitting next to his friend Mr Koh in a cafe at Gwanghwamun, Seoul's main square and focal point for the city's protest rallies.",
      "The competing ideologies would lead to clashes and \"when the military intervened, the situation would stabilise\u2026 it was a process to restore order and properly establish free democracy.",
      "\"Given the circumstances, we couldn't help but view it positively,\" he said, adding that he felt each period of martial law left the country in a more \"favourable\" position. Martial law in South Korea \"fundamentally differed\" from other nations, where it \"wasn't about killing people or senseless violence\", he insisted.",
      "But this time, it's different. Both octogenarians felt that Yoon's declaration of martial law was unacceptable. \"Even though we've experienced martial law many times throughout our lives, this time there's no justification for its declaration,\" said Mr Koh.",
      "Like them, Ms Kim, the environmental activist, was glad Yoon did not succeed and democracy prevailed in the end. \"Because we fought so hard to get it, right? We don't want to lose it again.",
      "\"Without democracy and freedom of living, what is life?\"",

    "published": "Sat, 07 Dec 2024 05:02:32 GMT",
    "summary": "Fans of CID, one of India's longest-running TV shows, are thrilled about its much-anticipated comeback.",
    "story": [
      "\"Daya, darwaaza tod do.\" (Daya, break down the door)",
      "Most Indians will instantly recognise this dialogue from the popular detective show CID, which ran from 1998 to 2018, making it one of India's longest-running television shows.",
      "The whodunnit featured three intrepid policemen - ACP Pradyuman, inspector Daya and inspector Abhijeet - solving case after case, as no criminal was ever a match for them. The low-budget episodes had comically simple plots, iffy acting, and all it took for a suspect to confess was a good slap from ACP Pradyuman.",
      "But over the years, the show has achieved cult status, and its characters and dialogues have spawned a wealth of jokes, memes and reels.",
      "CID is set to return later this month, sparking mixed reactions among its fans. Some are eager to see the three policemen back in action but others say that the show's old-world charm might not fit in with the gritty realism of modern-day crime shows.",
      "Over the past few days, the creators of the show have been releasing teasers for upcoming episodes on Instagram, each garnering hundreds of thousands of likes and comments.",
      "Apart from the three main characters, the teasers feature familiar tropes and dialogues. These include Inspector Daya kicking open doors to reveal a suspect's hideout and ACP Pradyuman muttering his iconic line, 'kuch toh gadbad hai, Daya' (something's not right, Daya), signaling to both his team and the audience that a crime has taken place.",
      "Trisha Shah, 35, a content creator from Mumbai and a fan of the show, says that the teasers make her nostalgic.",
      "\"CID was one of the few crime shows on television back then and my parents didn't mind me watching it because of its family-friendly content,\" Ms Shah says.",
      "\"Despite being a crime show, it never showed gruesome violence, sexual crimes, foul language or anything that was not suitable for family viewing.\"",
      "In an interview to Film Companion, an entertainment journalism platform, one of the writers of the show said that they even avoided giving surnames to the characters to avoid hurting anyone's sentiments.",
      "But the show's outlandish plots more than made up for its primness, whether that was ACP Pradyuman coming back from the dead or inspector Daya single-handedly manoeuvring a poison-gas filled plane to safety.",
      "In an interview to Forbes magazine, the producer of the show, BP Singh, described these scenes and plots as \"believable nonsense\".",
      "\"You may later laugh at it [the scene]. But for those five minutes, it is so engrossing that you don't mind it,\" he told the magazine.",
      "In a rather comical fashion, the characters would also explain plots and technologies used to solve crimes through their dialogues, making it easy for even children to grasp what was happening.",
      "\"The bad guys always got caught and that was comforting to watch,\" Ms Shah says. \"I don't think I'll enjoy the show today, but back then, it was a big deal.\"",
      "In the 1990s, TV was a big deal as it was the only form of home entertainment. At the start of the decade, India eased broadcasting rights, making more channels available.",
      "\"Initially, channels like Star began showing reruns of American shows like Baywatch and The Bold and The Beautiful. But new entrants like Zee TV and Sony began producing original shows to cater to the Indian audience,\" says Harsh Taneja, an associate professor of media at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.",
      "Producers often adapted Western shows for Indian audiences by importing format Bibles -  guidelines outlining story structure - and modifying them for local context, he says. So, a show like CID often featured plots that closely resembled those of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, an American crime drama.",
      "The 1990s and 2000s saw television become a staple in households as people's spending power grew. Many homes had not just one but two televisions, leading producers to create content targeting different age groups, says Mr Taneja.",
      "Interestingly, the target audience of CID, when it was released in the 1990s, was children in the age group of six to 14. After CID, several other crime-focussed shows began to populate channels - from Crime Patrol to Savadhan India. But one could say that it was CID that created an appetite for crime shows among viewers.",
      "Priya Ravi, 40, remembers waiting eagerly for each CID episode to air when she was a child. She confesses that it was the show that made her push her parents to get a television set at their home.",
      "\"Episodes used to air twice a week, and initially I used to go to a friend's place to watch them. But then I convinced my parents to get a TV so that I could watch the episodes at home. I was so happy the day the TV arrived,\" Ms Ravi says.",
      "She says that though she won't watch the new CID episodes, she'll definitely encourage her two children, aged seven and nine, to watch them.",
      "\"If the show remains as clean as it was back in the day, I think it's a great way to introduce children to some of the realities of life and make them vigilant about their safety and surroundings,\" she says.",
      "\"I'm looking forward to the heroic trio making a comeback.\"",

    "story": [
      "Rappers Jay-Z and Sean \"Diddy\" Combs have been accused in a civil lawsuit of raping a 13-year-old girl back in 2000.",
      "The lawsuit, which was originally filed in October and re-filed Sunday in New York to add Jay-Z to the list of defendants, alleges that the victim, identified only as a woman now living in Alabama, was raped by both men at a Video Music Awards afterparty.",
      "Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, referred to the allegations in a statement as a \"blackmail attempt.\" Combs' attorney denied the allegations.",
      "The lawsuit alleges the girl went to the VMAs in New York City without a ticket hoping to get inside, but was instead invited to an afterparty by a limo driver who claimed to work for Combs. The limo driver allegedly drove her to the party, where she was told to sign something that she believes was a non-disclosure agreement, the lawsuit claims.",
      "While inside, the lawsuit alleges, \"after attempting to talk to numerous celebrities, Plaintiff accepted a drink from one of the waitresses circulating the crowd.\" The lawsuit claims she began to feel \"woozy and lightheaded\" after drinking \"a portion of the drink\" and went to find a place to lie down. She went into a room that had a bed in it and, shortly after lying down, Combs, Carter and an unnamed woman celebrity whom the alleged victim recognized entered the room, the lawsuit claims.",
      "The lawsuit then alleges that Carter held her down and raped her while Combs and the woman celebrity watched. After, Combs also raped her while Carter and the woman watched, the suit claims. Combs then attempted to force the girl to perform oral sex on him, but she managed to punch him, grab her clothes, wrap them around her \u00a0and run away, according to the lawsuit.",
      "\"Although there were other guests still at the party, no one appeared to take notice of Plaintiff's distress or attempted to help her,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "According to the lawsuit, after leaving the house and putting her clothes back on, the girl managed to run back to a gas station she had seen on the way to the party, where a clerk \"noticed her distress and allowed her to use the phone.\" She then allegedly used the phone to call her father and have him pick her up.",
      "The woman is seeking unspecified damages.",
      "In response to the filing, Carter said in a statement, \"My lawyer received a blackmail attempt, called a demand letter, from a 'lawyer' named Tony Buzbee. What he had calculated was the nature of these allegations and the public scrutiny would make me want to settle. No sir, it had the opposite effect! It made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion. So no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!!\"",
      "\"Only your network of conspiracy theorists, fake physics, will believe the idiotic claims you have levied against me that, if not for the seriousness surrounding harm to kids, would be laughable,\" the statement added.",
      "In a letter sent Monday to the judge overseeing the case, an attorney for Carter wrote, \"For the avoidance of doubt, Mr. Carter is entirely innocent. This is a shakedown. He is not mentioned, referenced, or implicated in any way in the criminal investigation of Mr. Combs. He is neither a target nor a person of interest in that investigation.\"",
      "The letter was sent to request an expedited hearing on a petition to prevent the plaintiff in the case from remaining anonymous.",
      "Teny Geragos, an attorney representing Combs, said in a statement, \"This amended complaint and the recent extortion lawsuit against Mr. Buzbee exposes his barrage of lawsuits against Mr. Combs for what they are: \u00a0shameless publicity stunts, designed to extract payments from celebrities who fear having lies spread about them, just as lies have been spread about Mr. Combs. \u00a0As his legal team has said before, Mr. Combs has full confidence in the facts and the integrity of the judicial process. \u00a0In court, the truth will prevail: \u00a0that Mr. Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone\u2014man or woman, adult or minor.\"",
      "Buzbee was sued last month by an anonymous male celebrity, who alleges the lawyer tried to extort payments by threatening to file allegations of sexual assault, which the celebrity denies. Buzbee, in return, denies the extortion allegations.",
      "Buzbee did not immediately respond to a CBS News request for comment. In a statement posted Sunday night on X, Buzbee alleged that Carter was behind the anonymous lawsuit against him.",
      "\"What he fails to say in his recent statement is my firm sent his lawyer a demand letter on behalf of an alleged victim and that victim never demanded a penny from him. Instead, she only sought a confidential mediation,\" Buzbee wrote. \"Since I sent the letter on her behalf, Mr. Carter has not only sued me, but he has tried to bully and harass me and this plaintiff. His conduct has had the opposite impact. She is emboldened. I'm very proud of her resolve.\"",
      "Buzbee also wrote on Instagram that there has been a \"coordinated and aggressive effort\" against him that has included \"filing frivolous cases against me and my law firm, defaming me with outrageous assertions to anyone who will listen, and having mysterious people follow me and my family.\"",
      "\"People will see through this effort to discredit me and my clients and the truth will be revealed. I also won't allow anyone to scare my clients into silence,\" Buzbee wrote.",

    "summary": "The game's design nudged people into racking up unauthorized charges, the FTC said. Here's how customers will be refunded.",
    "story": [
      "Fortnite players and other Epic Games customers tricked by the game maker into making unwanted purchases are set to receive refund payments from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).",
      "As part of a settlement first\u00a0announced\u00a0in December 2022, the video game maker has been ordered by the FTC to pay $245 million to resolve allegations that it used unlawful billing practices involving design tricks\u00a0known as dark patterns to get players to unintentionally rack up charges. It is the largest ever refund amount in a gaming case, the agency said.",
      "The FTC says it is sending more than 629,000 payments Monday, with more disbursements to come at a later date. About half of the first tranche of payments will be made through PayPal, and the other half will be checks. Collectively, customers will receive $72 million in refunds, according to the agency.",
      "How much money will each customer get?",
      "The average payment is around $114, the FTC said. Epic Games customers who are entitled to refunds selected their payment method when they submitted a claim form. Customers who chose to receive PayPal payments have 30 days to redeem the funds, while check recipients have 90 days to cash them.",
      "What did Epic Games do?",
      "The FTC alleges the Fortnite-maker used dark patterns along with a variety of other tactics to trick customers into making unwanted purchases.",
      "For example, a \"counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration\" led Fortnite players to easily incur unwanted charges with the press of a single button, according to the FTC. Additionally, trying to transition the game from sleep to wake mode often triggered unwanted purchases. Other times, pressing an \"adjacent button\" while trying to preview an item led to a charge.",
      "\"As our complaints note, Epic used privacy-invasive default settings and deceptive interfaces that tricked Fortnite users, including teenagers and children,\" FTC Chair Lina M. Khan said in December 2022, when the settlement was first announced. \"Protecting the public, and especially children, from online privacy invasions and dark patterns is a top priority for the Commission, and these enforcement actions make clear to businesses that the FTC is cracking down on these unlawful practices.\"",

Gomez's last two Globe nominations were in the same category for \"Only Murders.\" Her co-stars, Steve Martin and Martin Short, have received equivalent nods in the best actor category each year since the show became eligible for consideration at the awards ceremony.",
      "For best supporting actress, Gomez was nominated for \"Emilia P\u00e9rez,\" the Spanish-language musical thriller from French director Jacques Audiard about a Mexican cartel boss undergoing gender-affirming surgery. Gomez co-starred in the film alongside Zoe Salda\u00f1a, whose performance also earned a Golden Globe nomination for best supporting actress in a motion picture.",

      "\"Not Fade Away\" closed out the Kennedy Center Honors at this year's ceremony, just as honorees The Grateful Dead had used Buddy Holly's ode to enduring love to close out hundreds of concerts over the years.",
      "The packed house Sunday night danced in the aisles to the bouncy beat after a night of honoring the Dead and other recipients of the lifetime achievement award for artistic accomplishment: director\u00a0Francis Ford Coppola,\u00a0jazz trumpeter\u00a0Arturo Sandoval\u00a0and singer-songwriter\u00a0Bonnie Raitt.\u00a0The venerable Harlem theater\u00a0The Apollo, which has launched generations of Black artists, also was recognized.",
      "Longtime Deadheads, including actors Miles Teller and Chloe Sevigny and talk show host David Letterman, paid tribute to the band's blend of musical experimentation, longevity and community-building. \"Their music fills the universe,\" Letterman proclaimed.",
      "The choice to honor The Apollo was an unusual one: the first time the Kennedy Center has chosen to honor a specific performance venue.",
      "\"The Apollo means so much to so many of us,\" Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said while arriving on the red carpet. Moore pointed to iconic Apollo performances from Lauryn Hill and a young Michael Jackson as treasured memories of his youth.",
      "The tribute to The Apollo highlighted the sheer diversity of art forms showcased at the 90-year-old theater. Savion Glover did a spirited tap dance routine; husband and wife duo The War and Treaty performed a medley of hits by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell; and comedian Dave Chappelle recounted his terrifying first Apollo performance at age 15.",
      "\"Everybody started booing. It was like I was outside my body watching,\" he said. Eventually Chappelle was rushed off the stage by the theater's infamous \"Sandman,\" but he credited the experience with helping him overcome his fear of bombing.",
      "The annual gala at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts always features personalized tributes with performances and testimonials from fellow artists. Medallions were presented during the traditional Saturday night ceremony at the State Department.",
      "In the first of the night's tributes, Emmylou Harris and Dave Matthews performed a cover of Raitt's duet with the late John Prine, \"Angel from Montgomery.\"",
      "Music star Sheryl Crow paid tribute to Raitt's trailblazing career as not just a singer or songwriter but as a widely respected blues guitarist in a male-dominated field.",
      "\"I would not be doing what I'm doing if I had not seen her perform as a 17-year-old,\" said Crow, who bought her first guitar shortly after seeing Raitt in concert.",
      "Raitt herself, on the pre-event red carpet, predicted an emotional evening.",
      "\"I've brought a massive box of Kleenex and my waterproof eyeliner,\" she laughed.",
      "Coppola received a tribute filled with previous Kennedy Center honorees, including Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese, Al Pacino and George Lucas. All described an iconoclastic and driven auteur who loved to nurture and support younger filmmakers.",
      "\"What Francis does creatively is jump off cliffs,\" Lucas said. \"When you spend enough time with Francis, you begin to believe you can jump off cliffs, too.\"",
      "Sandoval's tribute featured multiple performances from an all-star band featuring Trombone Shorty and pianist Chucho Valdez from Sandoval's original band, plus a flamenco dance performance by Timo Nunez. It also included a bit of light roast comedy from actor Andy Garcia.",
      "\"Arturo spoke very little English when he first came to America from Cuba all those years ago,\" Garcia said. \"But now his English ... is much worse.\"",
      "The tribute performances are often kept secret from the recipients themselves, most notably in 2018 when Cyndi Lauper flat-out lied to her longtime friend Cher about being unable to attend. Lauper appeared on stage to perform Cher's hit, \"If I Could Turn Back Time.\"",
      "At a ceremony at the White House before attending the awards event itself, President Biden praised each honoree. He also had De Niro, who was in the audience, stand before declaring, \"If I get in trouble, I'm coming to you pal.\"",
      "De Niro grinned and nodded and others in attendance, including the honorees, laughed at what appeared to be a reference to De Niro sometimes playing hardnosed enforcers in movies like \"The Godfather.\" But Biden actually meant he might seek the actor's help for post-presidency career advice.",
      "\"Things are not looking good for February,\" Biden joked.",
      "Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris received an extended standing ovation from the audience when introduced at Kennedy Center. But this could be the last honors ceremony without political intrigue for a while.",
      "During Donald Trump's first four years in office, Kennedy Center officials were forced to walk a public tightrope between the tradition of the president attending the ceremony and the open antipathy toward Trump from multiple honorees. In 2017, recipient Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Trump attended. Trump, who takes office in January, skipped the ceremony for the entirety of his first term.",
      "On the red carpet Sunday night, multiple Democratic political figures seemed to offer an olive branch.",
      "\"I hope he does come,\" Moore said. \"This is a wonderful celebration of genius in all its forms.\"",
      "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi added, \"I think he would really enjoy it.\"",
      "The 47th Annual Kennedy Center Honors will air on CBS and streaming on Paramount+ on Dec. 22 at 8:30 p.m. Eastern with host Queen Latifah. The show will be live and on-demand for Paramount+ with SHOWTIME subscribers or on-demand for Paramount+ Essential subscribers the day after the special airs.",

    "summary": "Dionne Warwick, Smokey Robinson and Melba Moore discuss the history of the Harlem landmark \"where stars are born and legends are made.\"",
    "story": [
      "On Wednesday nights, the Apollo Theater in Harlem is one of the hottest tickets in town. But there's no celebrity headliner. It's Amateur Night! And the audience is there to pick the NEXT breakout star.",
      "\"I know how tough the crowd can be,\" said Kyle Parks, a 23-year-old singer from Yonkers, New York. \"I know that's what makes this place legendary, what goes into it.\"",
      "Parks won the crowd over with his performance of \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" by Sam Cooke. Others ... weren't so lucky. Marion Caffey, longtime producer of the Apollo's iconic Amateur Night, said, \"They're brutally honest. And just sometimes just brutal, not necessarily honest!\"",
      "Caffey says it's the longest-running singing competition in history. \"Well, 'The Voice,' and 'America's Got Talent,' and 'American Idol,' and 'Star Search,' we are the great-grandfather of all of that,\" he said. \"This was the blueprint.\"",
      "The theater's motto is \"Where stars are born and legends are made\"\u2026 and it's launched plenty of them, from James Brown and Ella Fitzgerald, to Stevie Wonder, Lauryn Hill and H.E.R.",
      "And if you're wondering why every performer rubs that tree stump, according to Caffey, \"This stump used to be a full tree. And it stood outside the Lafayette Theater. And they would pull leaves from the tree for good luck. And now everyone comes here and rubs the Tree of Hope for good luck.\"",
      "Does it work? \"Well, I think it's good luck if you win, and it's not such good luck if you lose,\" Caffey said.",
      "But it worked for the award-winning singer Dionne Warwick, whose career skyrocketed since she and her gospel group won Amateur Night back in 1958.",
      "What did winning prove to her? \"Well, that we were good enough, first of all,\" Warwick said. \"And that we won $50!\"",
      "Warwick said going to the 1,500-seat theater was like going to school and getting a crash course in performing: \"The old saying is true, it is so true: 'If you can make it at the Apollo, you can make it anywhere.' They brought out the very best in you. Every single time I played the Apollo, it got better and better and better. And I mean, I felt like I was at home.\"",
      "But it wasn't always welcoming. Before it was the Apollo, it was a whites-only burlesque theater. In 1934, under new ownership and a new name, it opened its doors to everyone. Music historian Guthrie Ramsey said, \"It was one of the first to allow Black and white patrons to enjoy the music together. After all, it's New York City, and the Black community was growing. And so, it was basically a business model decision to allow Black citizens in.\"",
      "Ramsey says the story of the Apollo and the story of America are intertwined. \"It was a representative of anything that was going on in America, you could see the Apollo Theater reflecting that,\" he said. \"It's all of our histories. We all have a stake in it.\"",
      "During the civil rights movement, the Apollo became more than just a performance space. Motown great Smokey Robinson said, \"Sittin' in and marching and doing all this, and going to restaurants and they don't wanna serve us, and all that, we couldn't stay in any hotels \u2013 it was a rough time, you know?\"",
      "But the Apollo was like a beacon. \"It was the beacon,\" Robinson said. \"It was the Black music staple. It was just, you know, where the Black acts came. Couldn't play nowhere else!\"",
      "Robinson says the first time he and The Miracles performed here, he was a nervous wreck. They bombed! \u00a0\"I was frightened to death to be at the Apollo Theater,\" he said. \"Had we not had a record out and supposedly be 'professional' at that point, that the guy with the hook would have came and took us off the stage, because we were terrible!\" he laughed. \"We were just amateurs, we were so terrible, until Mr. Schiffman, the guy who owned the Apollo at that time, called Berry Gordy, who was our manager and stuff at that point, and told him he wanted his money back!\"",
      "In the decades that followed, as more places became integrated, the Apollo struggled financially, and closed its doors more than once. \"We could've lost the Apollo, but we're still here,\" said actress and singer Melba Moore. She says she grew up watching shows at the theater, and then got a chance to perform here \u2013 and later became a guest host on \"It's Showtime at the Apollo,\" the TV version of Amateur Night.",
      "Moore says this theater is something to be treasured.",
      "Tonight, the Apollo Theater is being awarded a prestigious Kennedy Center Honor at a ceremony that we'll see later this month on CBS.",
      "Michelle Ebanks, president and CEO of the theater, says it's the first time an institution (rather than a person) has received such recognition. \"The idea of the Apollo opened up this whole universe, so that everyone could see this is American culture, too,\" Ebanks said. \"This is the magic of art, the power of art.\"",
      "This is also the year the theater begins its 90th season. And to Smokey Robinson, the Apollo is still a force to be reckoned with. \"You know, it's the beginning. It's the proving ground. It's the Apollo!\"",

    "story": [
      "\"Squid Game\" fans know that trumpet wakeup call means someone is going to die. Not our hero, Gi-hun, but one or more of the players hoping to win a fortune competing in childish, but lethal, games. It's at once a thriller and a critique of inequality and greed.",
      "Season 1 was an international blockbuster. With 330 million views, it's Netflix's most-watched series of all time. It won Emmys for its lead actor, Lee Jung-jae, and creator Hwang Dong-hyuk. Both made history as the first Asian winners in their categories.",
      "We first spoke with Hwang in Korea just as he was about to start a global promotional tour for Season 2.",
      "\"So, you are kind of in a sweet spot now?\" I asked.",
      "\"I don't know what you mean by 'sweet spot,'\" Hwang replied.",
      "\"Just that things are going your way?\"",
      "\"But it's not easy. Nothing's easy,\" he said. \"People keep saying to me, 'You are the happiest person in Korea.' But in my mind, I am not that happy. I'm struggling every day and night.\"",
      "That's thanks to a brutal workload: Hwang directed and wrote every episode. Sworn to secrecy, \"Sunday Morning\" was invited to a soundstage outside Seoul where much of Season 2 was shot.",
      "Hwang was at the top of his game, but it wasn't always that way. He was only five when his father died. After that, he says, his family was trapped in poverty. As a struggling filmmaker, and in debt, Hwang said he sought escape in comic books. \"I read a lot in the survival game genre and gambling genre,\" he said. \"And that led me to think, what if I were to combine childhood games with people putting their lives at stake for a huge cash prize? And that was really how the idea was conceived.\"",
      "And a blockbuster was born.",
      "In the show, contestants driven by desperation risk everything for money, exploited by a sinister game master, the powerful Front Man.",
      "Asked if \"Squid Game\" represents how he sees capitalists and capitalism in general - a group of desperate people manipulated by a cruel and wealthy elite - Hwang replied, \"I think fundamentally what continues to drive this system is human selfishness and greed. These days I'm becoming more pessimistic about human nature. I almost think that, for homo sapiens, it's greed that allows them to create a society that they feel most comfortable in.\"",
      "Many of the characters in Season 2 are new (Hwang having killed off so many of them in Season 1), but the guards are back, and so is Gi-hun, now on a doomed mission to stop the game.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Squid Game: Season 2\" click on the video player below:",
      "Hwang said that \"Squid Game\" Seasons 2 and 3 \"will show people the bottom of this world, the bottom of the human being.\"",
      "So, it gets even darker? \"Yeah, it's getting darker, episode by episode,\" Hwang said.",
      "The show is so popular that recently 50,000 people applied for a chance to take part in a real-life (but non-deadly) Squid Game in Paris. The prize: an early look at the new season.",
      "Hwang is amazed, especially by his show's wild success in the U.S., where audiences have not traditionally gone for a subtitled TV series: \"I was always hoping to make something very popular in the States, so I was surprised,\" he said. \"At the same time there was, like, in my dream come true. But that level of success [was] just beyond my expectations.\"",
      "Ironically, this creator of a dystopian parable about desperation and poverty now finds himself a wealthy man \u2013 one of the great winners of capitalism. Has that changed him? \"Not much,\" he said. \"Made my life better, for sure, because I don't have to worry about [making] money anymore. But since then, I don't think I was changed a lot by more success or more money, because it's just a number. It doesn't have any meaning to me at all.\"",
      "What does have meaning is his work. But the success and the pressure of \"Squid Game\" have taken a toll: \"It's more than, like, five years I've been just working on this one project, day and night. I'm so exhausted. I'm so sick of, you know?\" he laughed. \"I need a break, I need a break.\"",
      "A break from non-stop work \u2026 and from his deep dive into the dark depths of human nature.",
      "So, what makes Hwang Dong-hyuk laugh? \"My friends! I love talking to my friends and having a beer.\"",

    "summary": "With her album, \"Hit Me Hard and Soft,\" and her current tour (her first without brother Finneas), Billie Eilish is discovering parts of herself she didn't know were there \u2013 from finding a new voice as a songwriter, to stretching her singing after starting vocal lessons.",
    "story": [
      "At the open of a Billie Eilish concert, a giant light box rises in the arena. \"Spoiler alert! I'm in the cube, but you can't see me,\" she said. \"I can literally see everybody so well from inside this box, but they have no idea I can see them. It feels like I'm wearing an invisibility cloak.\"",
      "\"That's a luxury you don't have most of the time,\" I said.",
      "\"That's true!\" she laughed. \"But it also makes me feel a little like I'm not real?\"",
      "Her whole career has been kind of unreal. Eilish, who turns 23 this month, has more than 100 million followers on Spotify, an ardent fan base that filled the United Center in Chicago.",
      "A few hours before showtime, Eilish was scurrying around backstage, introducing us to her backup singers \u2026 her band \u2026 and taking us to a room full of rescue dogs, who offer stress relief. \"Welcome to the puppy room!\" she said. A couple have already been adopted.",
      "She's filled her crew with friends (even the furry kind) because this tour is different. Since Eilish broke out at 14, her older brother, Finneas, has been her producer, songwriting partner and backing band. For the first time, she's on tour without him. \"I've never done a show without my brother in my life,\" she said. \"I mean, I've barely performed and sung without my brother, like, ever.\"",
      "But they agreed it was time for her to go out on her own. Finneas told us, \"I was built into the show for several years in an irreplaceable way. And I always kind of was trying to make myself replaceable.\"",
      "Her mom, Maggie Baird, came to the Chicago show. But Eilish's parents also aren't touring with her anymore. \"It does feel strange, yeah,\" Baird said. \"But it also feels okay. And there's also a lot of jobs I used to do where I'm like, I'm happy I don't have to do that one anymore!\"",
      "\"Honestly, she won't admit it, but I think it's been really nice for her that I've been gone,\" Billie laughed. \"And that then she can come see me and it's not just, like, her whole life. I mean, I've been her whole life for, like, 23 years now.\"",
      "\"Pretty good life, though,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, a lot! But, yeah\u2026\"",
      "Earlier this year, Eilish won her second Oscar for the \"Barbie\" theme, \"What Was I Made For.\" She already has nine Grammys, and now another seven nominations. Among her nominations are record of the year and song of the year, for a song (\"Birds of a Feather\") that she almost didn't put on her album.",
      "Billie and Finneas had struggled with the song. \"We wrote, like, the first half and it was super-good,\" she said. \"And then we overthought it for, like, months and months and months.\"",
      "I asked, \"When you sing it, do you hear all that you went through to create it?\"",
      "\"Sometimes,\" she replied. \"Sometimes when I listen to it, I hear certain parts that I'm like, 'Oh, that was such a nightmare! That was so punishing!'\"",
      "Watch Billie Eilish perform \"Birds of a Feather\":",
      "Eilish admits that, until recently, she didn't think of herself so much as a songwriter. That has changed. \"I did, like, way more writing on this album than anything ever,\" she said. \"But this is the thing I'm trying to say: I've been writing music since I was 11. But because I wasn't as fast at it, or wasn't as good, as my brother, I kind of thought, 'Oh, I'm not a songwriter.'\"",
      "But when they sat down to write Billie's third album, \"Hit Me Hard and Soft,\" Finneas felt uninspired.",
      "\"We'd get in the studio to write and I'd be, like, 'Can we go play pickleball?'\" he said. \"I think I just sort of had a little fatigue there.\"",
      "Billie said they were in \"different places,\" and that she felt alone. In the past, Finneas would help pull a lyric out of his sister. This time, she had to coax the words out of herself. \"And then, in just being given that space, I'd come up with it,\" she said.",
      "On the last chorus of \"Birds of a Feather,\" Eilish reached for a note she wasn't sure she could hit.\u00a0 Her vocal bravery came after she started taking singing lessons.",
      "I asked, \"Have you found some part of yourself you didn't even know was there?\"",
      "\"Yeah! Oh, yeah. I mean, my voice!\" she laughed. \"I can't express how gratifying, and satisfying, and fulfilling it has been to, like, learn these things about my own voice \u2013 that's in my body \u2013 that I didn't even know I was capable of. \u2026 It's so liberating.\"",
      "Hear Billie Eilish's isolated vocal track for \"Birds of a Feather\":",
      "For all we may think we know about Billie Eilish, the singer is just beginning to know herself.",
      "I asked, \"What's interesting to me is, you're talking now about two things: one is, you've discovered a part of your voice you didn't even know was there; and you've discovered you're more of a songwriter than you ever thought. Where does that leave you?\"",

      "Daniel Craig is back on the big screen \u2013 not as 007, or the smooth Southern private investigator in the \"Knives Out\" movies, but in the movie \"Queer,\" directed by Luca Guadagnino. Craig plays William Lee, an American living in 1950s Mexico City, who becomes infatuated with Eugene Allerton, another much younger expatriate (played by Drew Starkey).",
      "In one tender and poignant scene, a translucent image of Lee is seen leaning over towards Allerton. \"The sort of invisible hand,\" Craig described it. \"is what you're talking about \u2013 [something] you hope would happen, yes. The yearning \u2013 and hope is a really good word \u2013 that something will become of it. Maybe it's falling in love.\"",

      "I asked, \"Do you think that your character Lee is especially ardent in his overture because the Allerton character is aloof?\"",

And he thinks this is it, this is the one, so therefore he throws everything at it \u2013 probably awkwardly, and embarrasses himself in the process.\"",
      "\"When you walk into the bar and do that bow, that's (as the young people say) 'very cringe.'\"",
      "\"Yes. Is that what they say? Yes, it is very cringe!\" Craig laughed. \"Yeah, yeah. But that sung to me. I've been in situations like that certainly when I was younger, of trying to impress and trying to be kind of that person, and just failing miserably. That really rang out to me.\"",

      "Craig's latest role harkens back to the grittier parts he was known for in Britain pre-James Bond, such as \"Other Voices,\" \"Sylvia,\" \"Infamous\" and \"Layer Cake.\"",
      "Daniel Craig was born in the north of England, and at 6 years old saw his first stage production. He was introduced to the theater by his mother: \"We lived in Liverpool in the '70s. There was a theater called the Everyman, it's still there. They had cheap tickets so everybody could go. A lot of my mum's friends were designers and costume designers and worked backstage. She was a single mum, and we spent most of our time there.\"",
      "\"Was it magical to you?\"",
      "\"It was, yeah,\" Craig said. \"I think that's the moment I said, 'I wanna be an actor.' I mean, these people would walk off stage, and I'd see them in the bar afterwards. And I'd think they were gods, and they were just drunk!\"",
      "His mother's love for theater, it turned out, ran deeper than her son realized. He found out later that, as a young woman, she had been accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, one of the world's great acting schools. \"Yeah, she was, and she hadn't told me,\" Craig said. \"But they couldn't afford to go, so she had to go home, and went to art college instead up North.\"",
      "He was moved once he found out: \"She's always encouraged me. I mean, she sort of gently kicked me out the door, to say, 'Go, get on with it.' All the drama schools are in London, everything that was happening, and she said, 'You gotta go.' I left and went.\"",
      "He was only 16. \"She realized I was failing so badly at school, there was really no other option, I think!\" Craig laughed.",
      "He hasn't just been successful; he's one of the most recognized actors on the planet, whether he likes that or not.",
      "I asked, \"We interview a lot of big name actors on this show, and a lot of them say they don't like being famous. And it's not that I don't believe it, but I need to understand: what does being famous do to your brain?\"",
      "\"Oh God, well, that's the big question,\" Craig replied. \"It can do all sorts of wonderful things, of course, and as an actor, why did I become an actor? Because I like dressing up and showing off and I want people to like me. I mean, it's like, you want to sort of distill it down to its absolute basics. But what does fame do? I think fame can take you off in all sorts of weird and strange and not very healthy directions.\"",
      "\"It's gotta make acting harder in a way, because you can't, for instance, easily go on the subway and just look at the person across from you and kind of observe life around you?\"",
      "\"People watching, yes. Yeah, I did it a lot when I was younger, so I've got a lot in the bank!\"",
      "Daniel Craig has always been known for his intensity. But at 56, his next chapter might not be quite as physically rigorous, being 20 years older than when he was first cast as 007 in \"Casino Royale.\" \"God, remind me, why don't you?\" he laughed. \"Life is pain! And that's why I wanted to stop, one of the reasons I wanted to stop, because I'd throw myself into those movies, each one. From the very beginning I've been wanting to do as many stunts and as many of the action sequences as I possibly can. And I've injured myself. And I don't wanna do that. I don't want to take that risk anymore. I've got kids and I've got a life. And I want to spend the rest of my life upright if I can.\"",

      "Heritage Auctions had estimated that the slippers would fetch $3 million or more. Online bidding opened last month and by Friday had reached $1.55 million, or $1.91 million including the buyer's premium, Wilonsky said. Over 800 people were tracking the slippers, and the company's\u00a0web page for the auction\u00a0had hit nearly 43,000 page views by Thursday, he said.",
      "As Rhys Thomas, author of the book, \"The Ruby Slippers of Oz,\" puts it, the sequined shoes from the beloved 1939 musical have seen \"more twists and turns than the Yellow Brick Road.\"",
      "They were on display at the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids, Minnesota, in 2005 when Terry Jon Martin used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum's door and display case.",
      "Their whereabouts remained a mystery until the FBI recovered them in 2018. Martin, now 77, who lives near Grand Rapids in northern Minnesota, wasn't publicly exposed as the thief until he was indicted in May 2023. He pleaded guilty in October 2023. Martin admitted he used a small sledgehammer to break into the museum. He then used the tool to crack the case the slippers were in and take them. He said he didn't hear any alarm. He took off in his car and kept them in a trailer adjacent to his home.",
      "He was in a wheelchair and on supplementary oxygen when he was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health.",
      "His attorney, Dane DeKrey, explained ahead of sentencing that Martin, who had a long history of burglary and receiving stolen property, was attempting to pull off \"one last score\" after an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. But a fence \u2014 a person who buys stolen goods \u2014 later told him the rubies were just glass, DeKrey said. So Martin got rid of the slippers. The attorney didn't specify how.",
      "The alleged fence, Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of the Minneapolis suburb of Crystal, was indicted in March. He was also in a wheelchair and on oxygen when he made his first court appearance. He's scheduled to go on trial in January and hasn't entered a plea, though his attorney has said he's not guilty.",
      "The shoes were returned in February to memorabilia collector Michael Shaw, who had loaned them to the museum. They were one of several pairs that Garland wore during the filming, but only four pairs are known to have survived. In the movie, to return from Oz to Kansas, Dorothy had to click her heels three times and repeat, \"There's no place like home.\"",
      "Among those bidding was the Judy Garland Museum. The city of Grand Rapids raised money for the slippers at its annual Judy Garland festival to supplement the $100,000 set aside this year by Minnesota lawmakers to help the museum purchase the slippers.",
      "\"The Wizard of Oz\" story has gained new attention in recent weeks with the release of the movie \"Wicked,\" an adaptation of the megahit Broadway musical, a prequel of sorts that reimagines the character of the Wicked Witch of the West.",
      "The auction also included other memorabilia from \"The Wizard of Oz,\" including a hat worn by Margaret Hamilton, who played the original Wicked Witch of the West.",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 18:28:14 -0500",
    "summary": "Consumers are venting frustrations about health insurance in wake of UnitedHealthcare CEO murder. Costs have outpaced inflation for years.",
    "story": [
      "Health insurance costs are far outpacing inflation, leaving more consumers on the hook each year for thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket expenses. At the same time, some insurers are rejecting nearly 1 in 5 claims. That double whammy is leaving Americans paying more for coverage yet sometimes feeling like they're getting less in return, experts say.",
      "Frustration over denials and medical costs has fueled an outpouring of vitriol against health insurance companies in the wake of the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Also last week, a similar outcry led Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to reverse a\u00a0decision\u00a0to limit anesthesia coverage during surgeries.",
      "The anger may be rooted in fears that unexpected medical costs could prove financially ruinous, as well as concerns that essential care could be denied by an insurer, putting health and well-being at risk even for those who have health insurance.",
      "Some of those anxieties are well-founded: The top\u00a0cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. is health care-related debt, underscoring the financial stresses that can stem from high medical costs.",
      "In fact, most adults say they worry about their ability to pay for health care services or unexpected medical bills, a sentiment shared by people regardless of whether they're financially comfortable or struggling, a KFF survey found earlier this year.",
      "In 2024, the average health insurance premium for families carried a price tag of $25,572 per year, while single workers paid an average of $8,951, representing a 6% and 7% increase from the year earlier, KFF data shows. Since 2000, the rise in health insurance premiums has outpaced inflation for all but a handful of years, the health policy research firm found.",
      "\"Unhappiness with insurers stems from two things: 'I'm sick and I'm getting hassled,' and the second is very much cost \u2014 'I'm paying more than I used to, and I'm paying more than my wages went up',\" said Rob Andrews, CEO of the Health Transformation Alliance, a cooperative representing major companies such as American Express and Coca-Cola that works on improving health insurance for their employees. \"A lot of people think they are getting less\" from their insurers, Andrews said.",
      "And while Americans have unhappily encountered other types of inflation in recent years \u2014\u00a0sky-high grocery prices\u00a0have been credited with helping President-elect Donald Trump claim victory last month \u2014 health insurance can take on an even more personal edge, Thomas pointed out.",
      "\"It's not like, 'How much do I have to pay for a lawn chair or a steak,'\" Andrews noted. \"People are sick or having some sort of health problem they are worried about.\"",
      "To be sure, people with employer-sponsored health insurance typically don't pay the full premium, as their employers pick up much of the tab.",
      "Yet KFF data shows that employees' share of their premiums are also on the rise, with a worker with family coverage typically paying premiums of $5,700 per year in 2017, the most recent year for that data, up from about $1,600 in 2000, KFF data shows. The average family deductible \u2014 the amount paid out-of-pocket before insurance kicks in \u2014 has increased from $2,500 in 2013 to $3,700 in 2023, according to KFF.",
      "About 81% of Americans last year said they were dissatisfied with the cost of health care in the U.S, a 16-year high, Gallup polling found.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told CBS Mornings on Friday.",
      "Health insurance denials",
      "Aside from rising health insurance costs, Americans are also expressing anger at coverage denials, which a KFF analysis of nongroup qualified health plans in 2021 found impacted almost 1 in 5 claims. However, their study found denial rates varied considerably by insurer, with some as low as 2% while others were as high as 49%.",
      "\"When you are paying for something, and then they don't give it to you and they keep raising prices, of course you will be frustrated by that,\" noted Holden Karau, a software engineer who created a free service called\u00a0Fight Health Insurance to help people appeal their denials.",
      "Karau says she came up with the app, which uses AI to craft appeal letters, after her own and her dog's experience with insurance. Her pet insurer initially refused to pay for anesthesia for her dog's root canal, while Karau, who is transgender, said she dealt with many appeals to get her own procedures and surgeries covered by her insurance.",
      "More insurance companies are using AI to review claims and issue denials, which isn't always obvious to consumers. The shift to AI-based reviews has sparked lawsuits against insurers, with UnitedHealthcare sued last year by the families of two now-deceased customers who alleged the insurer knowingly used a faulty algorithm to deny elderly patients coverage for extended care deemed necessary by their doctors.",
      "\"With AI tools on the insurance side, they have very little negative consequences for denying procedures,\" Karau added. \"We are seeing really high denial rates triggered by AI. And on the patient and provider side, they don't have the tools to fight back.\"",
      "Most people may not be aware that they have the right to appeal a denial, Karau noted. The majority of people who are hit with a denial or billing errors don't contest, a study found earlier this year. For those that do, a first appeal will be dealt with by the insurer, but if that in-house appeal is also denied, you have the right to ask for an independent reviewer to look at your claim, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.",
      "\"There are multiple levels of appeal, and in my experience, I would say it's important to appeal until you at least get to an independent reviewer,\" Karau said. \"If you don't appeal, you won't get the care you need.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 17:05:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Even those enrolled in Medicare have a harder time paying for treatment compared with older adults in other countries.",
    "story": [
      "In the U.S., having health insurance is necessary, but not sufficient to ensure access to affordable medical care.",
      "While the U.S. lacks a universal health care system like those that exist in most other wealthy nations, most Americans over 65 are insured through Medicare. Yet many still struggle to afford care, with high out-of-pocket costs putting necessary medications and doctor visits out of reach, according to\u00a0research from The Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit that works to promote an equitable health care system.",
      "These extra costs, for which Medicare beneficiaries are on the hook, make it harder for older Americans to access affordable care relative to their peers in nine other countries, the group found. Researchers compared coverage for older adults in the U.S. to health care systems in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.",
      "Nearly one in four older adults in the U.S. spent at least $2,000 in out-of-pocket expenses last year, compared to less than 5% of older adults in France and the Netherlands who spent that much, The Commonwealth Fund found. Only in Switzerland did older adults report spending more on health care than those in the U.S.",
      "\"The reason to focus on this population is because in the U.S. nearly every adult over 65 has Medicare,\" Munira Z. Gunja, senior researcher for international health policy and practice innovations at The Commonwealth Fund told CBS MoneyWatch. While the U.S. stands out as \"the only high-income country without a universal health system,\" when it comes to the over-65 population, \"at least, we are on par with other countries,\" she said.",
      "Does Medicare fall short?",
      "But the study suggests that the kind of coverage Medicare plans provide isn't meeting many Americans' needs. Eight percent of older adults in the U.S., more than any other wealthy country except Austria, reported delaying or forgoing medical care because of costs. And there are repercussions to not getting the care one needs: One-third of older U.S. adults who said they faced cost-related barriers to accessing care reported being either in fair or poor health.",
      "\"We find that while nearly every older adult has Medicare coverage, it is still more expensive than what older adults in other nations face, and because of that, older adults in the U.S. are more likely to skip care,\" Gunja said. \"When they need prescription drugs, they are more likely to skip getting those too.\"",
      "Oftentimes, for example, Medicare Advantage members find themselves seeing out-of-network doctors, which exposes them to \"a ton of health care costs,\" according to Gunja.",
      "One exception",
      "There's one area in which Medicare beneficiaries faced few out-of-pocket costs and, as a result, were less likely to skip care \u2014 mental health treatment. Less than 5% of residents in all nations skipped mental health care over affordability concerns. The stat illustrates that when treatment is affordable, patients are more inclined to seek out the care they need, according to Gunja.",
      "\"It's a benefit that's offered on all health plans, and we see what happens when people don't need to spend as much on a service,\" she said.",
      "Solutions?",
      "When older people skip or delay care, their health can worsen, leading to sicker patients, who tend to require more costly care. That in turn drives up federal Medicare spending, according to The Commonwealth Fund.",
      "Gunja suggests that the U.S. can look to other countries for solutions that make health care more affordable for older adults. Some examples include capping out-of-pocket expenses and fully covering hospital and physician services.",
      "\"Across the board, the U.S. generally comes out last for most measures when it comes to affordability measures,\" Gunja said. \"Getting health insurance is absolutely necessary. But it's only the first step. We need to make sure coverage is not just comprehensive, but also affordable.\"",

      "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield said Thursday that the health insurance provider is reversing a policy that was set to go into effect in February that would have limited anesthesia coverage during surgeries and other procedures, a change that had prompted an outcry from some physicians and lawmakers.",
      "The policy, which would have covered Anthem's plans in Connecticut, New York and Missouri, was disclosed in recent weeks, with the company's New York unit posting a\u00a0notice on Dec. 1. The policy would have excluded people under 22 years old and maternity care.",
      "According to the original policy statement, Anthem had said it would pay only for anesthesia treatments for the length of time that a procedure or surgery is estimated to require based on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's physician work time values. The insurer noted that claims for anesthesia \"above the established number of minutes will be denied.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News on Thursday, Anthem said it was backing away from the policy, and added there had been \"widespread misinformation about an update to our anesthesia policy.\"",
      "\"As a result, we have decided to not proceed with this policy change,\" an Anthem spokesperson wrote in an email. \"To be clear, it never was and never will be the policy of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to not pay for medically necessary anesthesia services. The proposed update to the policy was only designed to clarify the appropriateness of anesthesia consistent with well-established clinical guidelines.\"",
      "Before the announcement of Anthem's reversal, the plan had drawn criticism from medical professionals as well as Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, who wrote on social media on Wednesday that the plan is \"appalling.\"",
      "\"Saddling patients with thousands of dollars in surprise additional medical debt.   And for what? Just to boost corporate profits?\" Murphy wrote. \"Reverse this decision immediately.\"",
      "Connecticut Comptroller Sean Scanlon told the Hartford Courant Thursday that the policy would not take place in his state after negotiating with the insurer.",
      "\"After hearing from people across the state about this concerning policy, my office reached out to Anthem, and I'm pleased to share this policy will no longer be going into effect here in Connecticut,\" Scanlon told the newspaper.",
      "\"Appalling behavior by commercial health insurers\"",
      "In a statement last month, the American Society of Anesthesiologists also called on Anthem to reverse the policy.",
      "\"With this new policy, Anthem will arbitrarily pre-determine the time allowed for anesthesia care during a surgery or procedure,\" the group said. \"If an anesthesiologist submits a bill where the actual time of care is longer than Anthem's limit, Anthem will deny payment for the anesthesiologist's care.\"",
      "The insurer's new policy could result in denials of coverage to patients who might need more anesthesia because their surgery is difficult or unusual, or if a complication occurs, the group added.",
      "\"This is just the latest in a long line of appalling behavior by commercial health insurers looking to drive their profits up at the expense of patients and physicians providing essential care,\" said Donald E. Arnold, an anesthesiologist and president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. \"This egregious policy breaks the trust between Anthem and its policyholders who expect their health insurer to pay physicians for the entirety of the care they need.\"",

      "\"We are several decades behind\"",
      "At the hearing, FDA officials defended the agency's work on food issues, turning many criticisms of the agency back at lawmakers for falling short of the Biden administration's budget requests on issues like reviewing the safety of chemicals added to foods.",
      "\"We are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts, because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized at some point in the past. We don't, but we are going to undertake it. But we are going to definitely struggle with the resources necessary to do that,\" said Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods.",
      "FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf also warned the agency was facing an increasingly steep battle pushing through new rules, like long-stalled efforts to move forward a new \"healthy\" standard and nutrition labels that would go on the front of food packages, as well as crack down on cigarettes.",
      "\"Given the current state of judicial affairs, First Amendment rights, the fact that corporations have the same rights as individuals, every little thing we do, unless specifically in detail instructed by Congress, it's not just that we lose in court, but we lose years,\" Califf said.",
      "One long-awaited change that could see movement soon is a ban on the food dye\u00a0Red No. 3, which advocacy groups have petitioned for. California moved last year to be the first state to ban the food dye on its own over health concerns.",
      "\"We are hopeful that, within the next few weeks, we will be acting on that petition and a decision should be forthcoming,\" said Jones.",
      "In a clash with Califf, Sanders urged Califf to call out the \"food and beverage industry, whose greed is destroying the health of millions of people\" for their role in slowing the progress of the agency's food policies.",
      "Califf told the committee that the agency was facing \"direct opposition from powerful industry forces\" on issues like food chemical safety, but also refused to \"castigate the people that work in the food and beverage industry.\"",
      "\"We have an industry that if you tried to change it overnight, there are farmers all over the United States who would not be able to grow the crops they're currently growing. So there needs to be a plan and it needs to be implemented in a mature thoughtful way across the country,\" said Califf.",

    "summary": "At least 364 pertussis cases were reported, marking the worst Thanksgiving week on record.",
    "story": [
      "At least 364 pertussis infections were reported to health authorities last week, according to figures published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, marking the worst Thanksgiving week for whooping cough in recent decades.",
      "This tops the previous Thanksgiving record of 228 cases of pertussis which were reported for the week ending Nov. 27, 2010. That year there were 27,550 cases reported by the end of 2010, below the 28,167 already tallied so far this year.",
      "Thanksgiving usually sees a slowdown in cases reported across most diseases, because of delays in testing and reporting around the holiday as well as changes in people going to the doctor.",
      "But this year's whooping cough wave is continuing to accelerate in several states this week, including in Ohio, which reported 84 cases. That is the most of any state, and more than the 67 pertussis cases that Ohio reported in the week before.",
      "\"Pertussis can be cyclical. After seeing lower numbers of reported cases in the past few years \u2014 during and after the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 nationally, pertussis is now returning to pre-pandemic trends. Ohio is no different,\" a spokesperson for Ohio's health department said in a statement.",
      "The Ohio spokesperson said this year's increase remained \"consistent with some years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,\" and has yet to top the total number of cases reported in 2013.",
      "While total cases nationwide remain lower than some previous records, the pace of weekly reported cases reached 577 ahead of Thanksgiving \u2014 more than 10 times the same time last year, and the worst in at least a decade.",
      "Health officials have cited a variety of factors for this year's wave of whooping cough cases, including gaps in immunity from vaccination or prior infection and the switch to safer but less effective vaccines in the 1990s.",
      "\"We have to acknowledge that our vaccination rates, in Montgomery County for school-age children, are low. They've decreased since the pandemic, and they're lower than the state of Ohio, and lower than the United States as well,\" said Dr. Becky Thomas, medical director of the health department for Ohio's Montgomery County.",
      "Within Ohio, Montgomery County makes up the largest share of cases reported in recent months, despite not having the most people in the state.",
      "Around 63% of their cases have been in schoolchildren and 12% are in daycares, Thomas said. The department often finds out about outbreaks first from school nurses, warning of large numbers of kids calling out sick with whooping cough.",
      "Thomas said doctors have been seeing high pertussis case counts for months, larger than the wave they saw last year.",
      "\"We had an increase in cases last fall, but nothing compared to this fall. And when we first started noticing a really significant increase was about the time that kids went back to school, so about the middle of August,\" said Thomas.",
      "Thomas said that the vast majority of reported cases in the county have said they were vaccinated for pertussis, though it is unclear if everyone was up-to-date on the shots. A third of cases have been in teens, who are recommended to have gotten a booster dose by age 12.",
      "\"We have specific data on vaccination records for entering seventh graders that shows those vaccination rates for that tetanus, whooping cough vaccine that they should have entering school are decreased,\" said Thomas.",
      "This year's whooping cough surge also comes as health departments are bracing for the return of an expected wave of COVID-19 and flu infections this winter.",
      "\"Whooping cough isn't the only respiratory illness that we're concerned about. So we're encouraging people to stay home when they're sick, practice good hand hygiene, get their health care provider if they need to if they're symptoms are worsening or severe, and of course get vaccinated,\" said Jennifer Wentzel, the county health department's commissioner.",

    "summary": "Consumers are venting frustrations about health insurance in wake of UnitedHealthcare CEO murder. Costs have outpaced inflation for years.",
    "story": [
      "Health insurance costs are far outpacing inflation, leaving more consumers on the hook each year for thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket expenses. At the same time, some insurers are rejecting nearly 1 in 5 claims. That double whammy is leaving Americans paying more for coverage yet sometimes feeling like they're getting less in return, experts say.",
      "Frustration over denials and medical costs has fueled an outpouring of vitriol against health insurance companies in the wake of the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Also last week, a similar outcry led Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to reverse a\u00a0decision\u00a0to limit anesthesia coverage during surgeries.",
      "The anger may be rooted in fears that unexpected medical costs could prove financially ruinous, as well as concerns that essential care could be denied by an insurer, putting health and well-being at risk even for those who have health insurance.",
      "Some of those anxieties are well-founded: The top\u00a0cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. is health care-related debt, underscoring the financial stresses that can stem from high medical costs.",
      "In fact, most adults say they worry about their ability to pay for health care services or unexpected medical bills, a sentiment shared by people regardless of whether they're financially comfortable or struggling, a KFF survey found earlier this year.",
      "In 2024, the average health insurance premium for families carried a price tag of $25,572 per year, while single workers paid an average of $8,951, representing a 6% and 7% increase from the year earlier, KFF data shows. Since 2000, the rise in health insurance premiums has outpaced inflation for all but a handful of years, the health policy research firm found.",
      "\"Unhappiness with insurers stems from two things: 'I'm sick and I'm getting hassled,' and the second is very much cost \u2014 'I'm paying more than I used to, and I'm paying more than my wages went up',\" said Rob Andrews, CEO of the Health Transformation Alliance, a cooperative representing major companies such as American Express and Coca-Cola that works on improving health insurance for their employees. \"A lot of people think they are getting less\" from their insurers, Andrews said.",
      "And while Americans have unhappily encountered other types of inflation in recent years \u2014\u00a0sky-high grocery prices\u00a0have been credited with helping President-elect Donald Trump claim victory last month \u2014 health insurance can take on an even more personal edge, Thomas pointed out.",
      "\"It's not like, 'How much do I have to pay for a lawn chair or a steak,'\" Andrews noted. \"People are sick or having some sort of health problem they are worried about.\"",
      "To be sure, people with employer-sponsored health insurance typically don't pay the full premium, as their employers pick up much of the tab.",
      "Yet KFF data shows that employees' share of their premiums are also on the rise, with a worker with family coverage typically paying premiums of $5,700 per year in 2017, the most recent year for that data, up from about $1,600 in 2000, KFF data shows. The average family deductible \u2014 the amount paid out-of-pocket before insurance kicks in \u2014 has increased from $2,500 in 2013 to $3,700 in 2023, according to KFF.",
      "About 81% of Americans last year said they were dissatisfied with the cost of health care in the U.S, a 16-year high, Gallup polling found.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told CBS Mornings on Friday.",
      "Health insurance denials",
      "Aside from rising health insurance costs, Americans are also expressing anger at coverage denials, which a KFF analysis of nongroup qualified health plans in 2021 found impacted almost 1 in 5 claims. However, their study found denial rates varied considerably by insurer, with some as low as 2% while others were as high as 49%.",
      "\"When you are paying for something, and then they don't give it to you and they keep raising prices, of course you will be frustrated by that,\" noted Holden Karau, a software engineer who created a free service called\u00a0Fight Health Insurance to help people appeal their denials.",
      "Karau says she came up with the app, which uses AI to craft appeal letters, after her own and her dog's experience with insurance. Her pet insurer initially refused to pay for anesthesia for her dog's root canal, while Karau, who is transgender, said she dealt with many appeals to get her own procedures and surgeries covered by her insurance.",
      "More insurance companies are using AI to review claims and issue denials, which isn't always obvious to consumers. The shift to AI-based reviews has sparked lawsuits against insurers, with UnitedHealthcare sued last year by the families of two now-deceased customers who alleged the insurer knowingly used a faulty algorithm to deny elderly patients coverage for extended care deemed necessary by their doctors.",
      "\"With AI tools on the insurance side, they have very little negative consequences for denying procedures,\" Karau added. \"We are seeing really high denial rates triggered by AI. And on the patient and provider side, they don't have the tools to fight back.\"",
      "Most people may not be aware that they have the right to appeal a denial, Karau noted. The majority of people who are hit with a denial or billing errors don't contest, a study found earlier this year. For those that do, a first appeal will be dealt with by the insurer, but if that in-house appeal is also denied, you have the right to ask for an independent reviewer to look at your claim, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.",
      "\"There are multiple levels of appeal, and in my experience, I would say it's important to appeal until you at least get to an independent reviewer,\" Karau said. \"If you don't appeal, you won't get the care you need.\"",

      "\"It's more expensive the closer to the city you get,\" she said.",
      "Christmas tree prices have risen over the last 15 years as supplies fell.",
      "\"The original tight supply goes back to 2008, when there was an oversupply and growers stopped planting as many,\" said Sidebottom, noting that it takes up to a decade to grow a tree. Extreme weather, including a 2021 heat dome, also killed a lot of trees in the Pacific Northwest, she added.",
      "Christmas trees are grown in every U.S. state, with Oregon, North Carolina and Michigan producing the most. Trees are also imported from Canada, with tree types including the Douglas fir imported from British Columbia.",
      "Drought conditions hit parts of the country in recent months, resulting in wildfires in parts of the East Coast and potentially sleepless nights for tree farmers, given roots that were not properly hydrated in the fall may not make it.",
      "\"We were very worried that it would impact the trees for this year. Thankfully we have not seen any issues,\" Angevine-Bergs said. \"We started cutting some trees early just to see, and in November we began realizing this year's trees are not going to be affected -- taller trees have deeper roots.\"",
      "The roughly 8-foot tree now standard for the Christmas holiday typically takes about eight years to grow, with a white pine, for instance, growing quickly and white fir and spruce trees taking longer.",
      "\"There's about a foot of growth a year, so you're sitting on your money a long time,\" Sidebottom said of the investment made by growers as they wait for their seedlings to sprout and flourish into mature trees.",
      "Just like the holiday shopping season, Americans have moved up the timing as to when they purchase Christmas trees. Last year, a third of Americans bought their Christmas trees during the week after Thanksgiving and another 33% made the purchase during the first week of December, according to a poll of 1,499 adults taken in August and September last year.",
      "Another 16% bought their tree in the second week of December; 14% claimed a tree before Thanksgiving; 3% in the third week of December and only 1% on Christmas Eve, the survey found.",

It is the largest ever refund amount in a gaming case, the agency said.",
      "The FTC says it is sending more than 629,000 payments Monday, with more disbursements to come at a later date. About half of the first tranche of payments will be made through PayPal, and the other half will be checks. Collectively, customers will receive $72 million in refunds, according to the agency.",

Customers who chose to receive PayPal payments have 30 days to redeem the funds, while check recipients have 90 days to cash them.",
      "What did Epic Games do?",
      "The FTC alleges the Fortnite-maker used dark patterns along with a variety of other tactics to trick customers into making unwanted purchases.",
      "For example, a \"counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration\" led Fortnite players to easily incur unwanted charges with the press of a single button, according to the FTC. Additionally, trying to transition the game from sleep to wake mode often triggered unwanted purchases. Other times, pressing an \"adjacent button\" while trying to preview an item led to a charge.",

    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 09:26:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump wants to impose across-the-board tariffs on imported goods from both allies and adversaries, claiming it's other nations who will pay such taxes to the U.S. Treasury. But it's American consumers who will be opening their wallets.",
    "story": [
      "Incoming President Donald Trump has made his feelings about tariffs very clear: \"The word 'tariff' is the most beautiful word in the dictionary,\" he has said. \"I think it's more beautiful than 'love.' \u2026 I love tariffs! \u2026 Music to my ears!\"",
      "And what exactly is a tariff? It is a tax. According to Dartmouth economics professor Doug Irwin, \"In U.S. history, we're basically only talking about import tariffs, taxes on imported goods coming into the U.S.\"",
      "Irwin says governments have all kinds of reasons for introducing tariffs: \"Sometimes it's to reduce the trade deficit. Sometimes it's to bring back jobs. Sometimes it's to punish other countries for their unfair trade practices. Sometimes it's to raise revenue so that we can cut income taxes.\"",
      "At its most fundamental, a tariff works like this:",
      "Suppose we import a product from China. The price is $50. But before you can buy it, our government adds $25 to the price. That's the tariff. Your final price is $75. China gets its $50; the extra $25 winds up going to the U.S. Treasury.",
      "But who pays these tariffs?",
      "According to Trump, it's the other countries. \"Trillions and trillions of dollars pouring into the United States Treasury,\" is his description of what happens. \"China paid hundreds of billions of dollars during my term.\"",
      "But as Irwin points out, that's NOT the way tariffs work!",
      "\"I think economists would say that's very misleading to say that that's what's going on,\" he said. \"Of course, it's the U.S. consumers that are paying those, not China itself. China's not writing checks to the U.S. government.\"",
      "Rather, it is a transfer of money from consumers to the federal government. A tax.",
      "Tariffs have been part of international trade since our country was founded; the first one was imposed by George Washington! And what we've learned from history is that they often have unintended consequences.",
      "We have a tariff on sugar that has doubled the price of sugar. It has helped out our sugar cane farmers in Louisiana and Florida, but it's also driven 34% of American chocolate and candy manufacturing (and jobs) out of the country.",

      "Candy makers turn sweet on Canada to mitigate costly U.S. sugar tariffs (Financial Post)",
      "More confectionery manufacturers move outside U.S. (Confectionery Production)",
      "Then, there was Trump's 25% tariff on imported steel in 2018. Our steelmakers thrived, but companies that make things out of steel (like Ford, GM and Caterpillar) suffered dearly. Just ask Ford's then-CEO Jim Hackett, who in 2018 told Bloomberg, \"The metals tariffs took about a billion dollars of profit from us. If it goes on longer, there will be more damage.\"",
      "Tariffs against one particular country can backfire. Irwin said, \"With the China tariffs, we're importing a lot more from Vietnam, we're importing a lot more from Malaysia. If the idea with the tariff was to bring jobs back home, instead we're just shifting them from China to Vietnam, in some sense.\"",
      "And P.S.: Tariffs don't just raise prices on the imported stuff; they can affect the price of domestic substitutes as well.",
      "So, if there's a tariff on imported steel, and I'm an American steelmaker, I can opportunistically say, \"Well hey, now I can raise my prices, too!\"?\u00a0 Absolutely! says Irwin: \"Consumers don't have the choice anymore. They can buy the really high-priced steel, or they can buy you.\"",
      "Finally, there's the retaliation problem. \"When we imposed the steel tariffs, the European Union and China got very upset with us,\" Irwin said. \"And what did they do? They raised tariffs on American farm goods. So, all of a sudden, American farmers, who had nothing to do with steel per se, found their sales limited overseas.\"",
      "Even Ronald Reagan could have told you that. In fact, he did! In 1987, Reagan said, \"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. The result is more and more tariffs, higher and higher trade barriers, and less and less competition.\"",
      "So, exactly what tariffs has Trump proposed? During his campaign, he promised as president he would \"phase in a system of universal baseline tariffs.\" Originally, he outlined tariffs across the board -- every product, in every category, from every country in the world. \"We're going to charge them 10 to 20 percent,\" he said.",

      "Retailers tell consumers that Trump tariffs are a reason to shop now",
      "Why is Trump threatening a 100% tariff on the BRICS nations?",
      "Now, every recent president has favored some tariffs. The Biden administration, for example, maintained some of the tariffs from Trump's first term, and imposed its own 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars. But these tariffs have always targeted particular categories of products. \"An across-the-board tariff? That's not targeting a particular commodity or product, that's not targeting a particular country,\" said Irwin. \"It's just saying, 'All imports, all sources get hit with this tax.' That's a very different type of tariff.\"",
      "And wouldn't we then notice prices going up, on everything?\u00a0 \"We would definitely notice,\" Irwin said.",
      "More recently, Trump has proposed double-digit tariffs on everything imported from Mexico, Canada and China. They would raise the price we pay for things like fruit, lumber, electronics, oil, medicine, metal and beef.",

      "But Trump's transition leader Howard Lutnick predicts that his boss won't tax imported goods for which there are no American-made alternatives. Back in September, Lutnick told CNBC, \"Tariffs are an amazing tool by the president to use. They're an amazing tool. But he understands, don't tariff stuff we don't make. If we don't make it, and you want to buy it, I don't want to put the price up.\"",
      "Can Trump impose tariffs without Congress? It's complicated, according to experts",
      "Can Trump impose tariffs without Congress? It's complicated, according to experts",
      "But maybe Trump has no intention of imposing the tariffs for real? Maybe he's playing a strategic game -- tariffs as negotiating tactics?",
      "\"Tariffs can be used as a threat and a bargaining chip,\" said Irwin. \"And sometimes, if you're really credible, just making the threat of a tariff is enough to bring another country to change its policy in a way that you desire without your actually having to impose the tariff in the end.\"",
      "In the end, when a government wants to achieve some economic or geopolitical goal, it can use all kinds of different tools: subsidies, tax breaks or penalties, trade agreements, regulations, certifications, investment incentives, diversification.",
      "According to Doug Irwin, tariffs are a powerful tool, too. They're just rarely the best one. \"What economists have concluded is that tariffs usually have a lot of unintended consequences, can lead to blowback where other countries retaliate against you, and so are not a really good policy instrument for achieving goals that we all Americans want to achieve,\" he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 20:44:33 -0500",
    "summary": "An appeals court judge wrote that the law that would force a sale or ban of TikTok \"survive[s] constitutional scrutiny.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court upheld a law that will ban TikTok in the U.S. in the coming months if its Chinese parent company doesn't sell its stake in the app, dealing another setback to the widely popular video-sharing service in its battle with the federal government.",
      "A panel of three judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously sided with the Justice Department in declining to review the petition for relief from TikTok and ByteDance, its Chinese parent company, saying the law is constitutional.",
      "\"We conclude the portions of the Act the petitioners have standing to challenge, that is the provisions concerning TikTok and its related entities, survive constitutional scrutiny,\" Senior Judge Douglas Ginsburg wrote in the majority opinion. \"We therefore deny the petitions.\"",
      "Congress approved\u00a0a foreign assistance package in April that included provisions giving TikTok nine months to sever ties with ByteDance or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. President Biden quickly signed the bill into law, and it is set to take effect on Jan. 19, with the possibility of a one-time 90-day delay granted by the president if a sale is in progress by then.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump tried to ban TikTok during his first term in office, but reversed his position during the presidential campaign and vowed to \"save\" the app. He takes office on Jan. 20.",
      "Lawmakers and national security officials have long had suspicions about TikTok's ties to China. Officials from both parties have warned that the Chinese government could use TikTok to spy on and collect data from its roughly 170 million American users or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content. The concern is warranted, they have argued, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering.",
      "The appeals court's decision tees up a fight at the Supreme Court over the law's ultimate fate. The parties asked the judges to make a decision by Friday so there is enough time for the high court to review the case before the law takes effect. The justices could agree to hear the case and pause the law while they consider the legal arguments, or let the appeals court's ruling stand as the final word.",
      "TikTok expects the law will be overturned by the Supreme Court, according to spokesperson Michael Hughes, who argued the law is based on \"inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information.\"",
      "\"The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" Hughes said in a statement.",
      "The Justice Department, meanwhile, applauded the decision.",
      "\"Today's decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to collect sensitive information about millions of Americans, to covertly manipulate the content delivered to American audiences, and to undermine our national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. \"As the D.C. Circuit recognized, this act protects the national security of the United States in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution. The Justice Department is committed to defending Americans' sensitive data from authoritarian regimes that seek to exploit companies under their control.\"",
      "The court's decision",
      "\"The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\" Ginsburg wrote in his opinion. \"Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\"",
      "The appeals court said that it recognized the decision will have \"significant implications\" for TikTok and its users.",
      "\"Consequently, TikTok's millions of users will need to find alternative media of communication,\" Ginsburg said. \"That burden is attributable to the [People's Republic of China's] hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security, not to the U.S. Government, which engaged with TikTok through a multi-year process in an effort to find an alternative solution.\"",
      "The D.C. Circuit found that the government's national-security justifications for banning TikTok \u2014 to counter China's efforts to collect Americans' data and limit its ability to manipulate content covertly on the platform \u2014 are \"wholly consistent\" with the First Amendment.",
      "\"The multi-year efforts of both political branches to investigate the national security risks posed by the TikTok platform, and to consider potential remedies proposed by TikTok, weigh heavily in favor of the Act,\" Ginsburg wrote. \"The government has offered persuasive evidence demonstrating that the act is narrowly tailored to protect national security.\"",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House China committee, praised the decision, calling it \"a loss for the Chinese Community Party,\" while also expressing optimism about the app's future in the U.S.",
      "\"I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,\" Moolenaar said in a statement.",
      "The House China committee spearheaded the bipartisan effort to pass the law.",
      "The legal arguments",
      "TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge in May that called the legislation \"an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power\" based on \"speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation\" that would suppress the speech of millions of Americans.",
      "\"In reality, there is no choice,\" the petition said, adding that a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\"",
      "The Chinese government vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance said \"such a fundamental rearchitecting is not remotely feasible\" under the restrictions within the legislation.",
      "\"The platform consists of millions of lines of software code that have been painstakingly developed by thousands of engineers over multiple years,\" the petition said.",
      "During oral arguments in September, the appeals panel appeared skeptical of TikTok's argument that free expression outweighs national security concerns, but the three judges were also critical of the government's stance.",
      "TikTok's lawyer Andrew Pincus said the law \"is unprecedented and its effect would be staggering.\"",
      "\"This law imposes extraordinary speech prohibition based on indeterminate future risks,\" Pincus said. \"Notwithstanding the obvious less restrictive alternatives, the government has not come anywhere near satisfying strict scrutiny.\"",
      "Judge Sri Srinivasan said, under TikTok's rationale, the U.S. would not be able to ban a foreign country from owning a major media company in the U.S. if the two are at war.",
      "\"Is your submission that Congress can't bar the enemy's ownership of a major media source in the U.S.?\" Srinivasan, an Obama appointee, asked Pincus.",
      "When Pincus noted that news outlets like Politico and Business Insider are owned by foreign entities, Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, quickly chimed in: \"But not foreign adversaries.\"",
      "Rao also pushed back on Pincus' argument that Congress did not include any evidence of its claims that TikTok poses a national security risk in the legislation.",
      "\"I know Congress doesn't legislate all the time, but here they did,\" she said. \"They actually passed a law and many of your arguments want us to treat them as an agency. It's strange. It's a very strange framework for thinking about our first branch of government.\"",
      "Attorney Jeffrey Fisher, who represents TikTok creators, compared the restrictions on TikTok to the U.S. government hypothetically banning bookstores from selling books written by foreign authors in conjunction with a foreign government.",
      "\"We're not talking about banning Tocqueville in the United States,\" Rao countered. \"We're talking about a determination by the political branches that there's a foreign adversary that is potentially exercising covert influence in the United States. Very different.\"",
      "Ginsburg, a Reagan appointee, expressed skepticism over the notion that the law singles out TikTok.",
      "\"It describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity,\" he said, noting that the company and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns. \"That's the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "Justice Department lawyer Daniel Tenny said the data on Americans that could be collected through the app \"would be quite valuable to a foreign adversary if it were trying to approach an American to try to have them be an intelligence asset.\" Tenny also spoke about the risk of content manipulation by China.",
      "\"What is being targeted is a foreign company that controls this recommendation engine and many aspects of the algorithm that's used to determine what content is shown to Americans on the app,\" Tenny said.",
      "But Srinivasan said it's Americans' choice to use the app, despite what content may appear.",
      "\"The fact that that's being denied subjects this to serious First Amendment scrutiny,\" he said.",
      "He later added, \"What gives arguable force to the other side's First Amendment argument is that it's not just that the government is targeting curation that occurs abroad. It's the reason the curation occurring abroad is being targeted, and the reason is a concern about the content consequences of that curation in the U.S.\"",

      "But, there is still the challenge of why health care costs are rising.",
      "\"You have efforts to extend coverage and make more people have health care be available, but prices are going up,\" Gounder said.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 17:05:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Even those enrolled in Medicare have a harder time paying for treatment compared with older adults in other countries.",
    "story": [
      "In the U.S., having health insurance is necessary, but not sufficient to ensure access to affordable medical care.",
      "While the U.S. lacks a universal health care system like those that exist in most other wealthy nations, most Americans over 65 are insured through Medicare. Yet many still struggle to afford care, with high out-of-pocket costs putting necessary medications and doctor visits out of reach, according to\u00a0research from The Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit that works to promote an equitable health care system.",
      "These extra costs, for which Medicare beneficiaries are on the hook, make it harder for older Americans to access affordable care relative to their peers in nine other countries, the group found. Researchers compared coverage for older adults in the U.S. to health care systems in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.",
      "Nearly one in four older adults in the U.S. spent at least $2,000 in out-of-pocket expenses last year, compared to less than 5% of older adults in France and the Netherlands who spent that much, The Commonwealth Fund found. Only in Switzerland did older adults report spending more on health care than those in the U.S.",
      "\"The reason to focus on this population is because in the U.S. nearly every adult over 65 has Medicare,\" Munira Z. Gunja, senior researcher for international health policy and practice innovations at The Commonwealth Fund told CBS MoneyWatch. While the U.S. stands out as \"the only high-income country without a universal health system,\" when it comes to the over-65 population, \"at least, we are on par with other countries,\" she said.",
      "Does Medicare fall short?",
      "But the study suggests that the kind of coverage Medicare plans provide isn't meeting many Americans' needs. Eight percent of older adults in the U.S., more than any other wealthy country except Austria, reported delaying or forgoing medical care because of costs. And there are repercussions to not getting the care one needs: One-third of older U.S. adults who said they faced cost-related barriers to accessing care reported being either in fair or poor health.",
      "\"We find that while nearly every older adult has Medicare coverage, it is still more expensive than what older adults in other nations face, and because of that, older adults in the U.S. are more likely to skip care,\" Gunja said. \"When they need prescription drugs, they are more likely to skip getting those too.\"",
      "Oftentimes, for example, Medicare Advantage members find themselves seeing out-of-network doctors, which exposes them to \"a ton of health care costs,\" according to Gunja.",
      "One exception",
      "There's one area in which Medicare beneficiaries faced few out-of-pocket costs and, as a result, were less likely to skip care \u2014 mental health treatment. Less than 5% of residents in all nations skipped mental health care over affordability concerns. The stat illustrates that when treatment is affordable, patients are more inclined to seek out the care they need, according to Gunja.",
      "\"It's a benefit that's offered on all health plans, and we see what happens when people don't need to spend as much on a service,\" she said.",
      "Solutions?",
      "When older people skip or delay care, their health can worsen, leading to sicker patients, who tend to require more costly care. That in turn drives up federal Medicare spending, according to The Commonwealth Fund.",
      "Gunja suggests that the U.S. can look to other countries for solutions that make health care more affordable for older adults. Some examples include capping out-of-pocket expenses and fully covering hospital and physician services.",
      "\"Across the board, the U.S. generally comes out last for most measures when it comes to affordability measures,\" Gunja said. \"Getting health insurance is absolutely necessary. But it's only the first step. We need to make sure coverage is not just comprehensive, but also affordable.\"",

    "story": [
      "In the wake of\u00a0UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson's killing in New York City Wednesday morning, some companies are taking additional precautionary measures to protect their executives while corporate security firms are reporting an uptick in interest in their services.",
      "The shooting of Thompson, who did not appear to have a security detail with him when he was attacked outside a Manhattan hotel, is shining a light on the business of protecting prominent corporate executives, whose security costs can reach millions of dollars per year.",
      "It's common for the top brass at public companies to be protected by guards around the clock, according to security experts. Social media's amplification of everyday individuals' dissatisfaction with a particular person, product or service has only heightened the need for protection, they say. That's particularly true in an industry like health care insurance, when many Americans say they are dissatisfied with the services they receive.",
      "Indeed, in the wake of Thompson's killing, many on social media expressed vitriol for some health insurers' practices.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told CBS Mornings about the public voicing its frustrations.",
      "To be sure, some of the biggest U.S. companies, particularly those in the tech sector, were spending heavily on personal and residential security for their top executives prior to Thompson's killing. Meta, whose businesses include Facebook and Instagram, reported the highest spending on personal security for top executives last year, at more than $24 million, filings culled by research firm Equilar show.",
      "While Thompson had an in-house security detail during his New York City visit, it wasn't with him at the time of the shooting, according to CNN, which cited a source familiar with UnitedHealthcare's security.",
      "In the wake of the attack, corporate security experts said companies should take time to evaluate their corporate security protocols and beef up protective measures, if necessary, to protect against a variety of threats.",
      "\"My phone has been ringing off hook, with calls in particular coming from health care leaders who are reevaluating their security,\" said Paul Sarnese, a safety and security consultant and former president of the International Association for Healthcare Security and Safety (IAHSS).",
      "He said the deadly incident will likely prompt more executives to seek more robust protection. \"This incident will definitely change those executives' minds that might have been reluctant to initiate security protocols. I think they'll be more receptive to executive protection,\" he said.",
      "Too much information",
      "In the wake of Thompson's death, some companies are taking steps to limit publicly available information about their executives. For example, a page on UnitedHealthcare's website about the company's leadership \u2014 where Thompson and other executives' bios were listed \u2014\u00a0no longer exists, and instead redirects to the company's home page.",
      "Medica, a Minnesota-based nonprofit health care firm, as well as other insurers have taken similar actions, their websites show.",
      "Medica told the Associated Press Friday that it is temporarily closing its six offices for security reasons, in addition to removing executives bios' from its website.",
      "\"Although we have received no specific threats related to our campuses, our office buildings will be temporarily closed out of an abundance of caution,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Experts say these types of moves are wise.",
      "\"I think we share too much. I don't need to know where you live and that you're married and have three wonderful kids,\" Sarnese said. \"We don't need to advertise to the public where the president and CEO are sitting.\"",
      "While executives across all industries should be evaluating their security postures, healthcare industry professionals have received more threats in recent years as a result of divisiveness that arose around safety protocols, including mask mandates, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sarnese said.",
      "\"Every industry has challenges because there is always going to be somebody who is upset with a service or product or philosophy. But COVID changed everything. We never saw the level of threats we saw during COVID toward healthcare workers and leaders, because of some of the mistrust and misinformation that was out there in the community,\" he said.",
      "\"All the ways things can go wrong\"",
      "Security industry veteran Brittney Blair of K2 Integrity said that online threat monitoring is as essential as physical protection.",
      "More companies are becoming more active in tracking cyber threats, including monitoring the web and dark web.",

    "summary": "Anthem will reverse a policy that would have capped insurance coverage for anesthesia after objections from doctors and lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield said Thursday that the health insurance provider is reversing a policy that was set to go into effect in February that would have limited anesthesia coverage during surgeries and other procedures, a change that had prompted an outcry from some physicians and lawmakers.",
      "The policy, which would have covered Anthem's plans in Connecticut, New York and Missouri, was disclosed in recent weeks, with the company's New York unit posting a\u00a0notice on Dec. 1. The policy would have excluded people under 22 years old and maternity care.",
      "According to the original policy statement, Anthem had said it would pay only for anesthesia treatments for the length of time that a procedure or surgery is estimated to require based on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's physician work time values. The insurer noted that claims for anesthesia \"above the established number of minutes will be denied.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News on Thursday, Anthem said it was backing away from the policy, and added there had been \"widespread misinformation about an update to our anesthesia policy.\"",
      "\"As a result, we have decided to not proceed with this policy change,\" an Anthem spokesperson wrote in an email. \"To be clear, it never was and never will be the policy of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to not pay for medically necessary anesthesia services. The proposed update to the policy was only designed to clarify the appropriateness of anesthesia consistent with well-established clinical guidelines.\"",
      "Before the announcement of Anthem's reversal, the plan had drawn criticism from medical professionals as well as Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, who wrote on social media on Wednesday that the plan is \"appalling.\"",
      "\"Saddling patients with thousands of dollars in surprise additional medical debt.   And for what? Just to boost corporate profits?\" Murphy wrote. \"Reverse this decision immediately.\"",
      "Connecticut Comptroller Sean Scanlon told the Hartford Courant Thursday that the policy would not take place in his state after negotiating with the insurer.",
      "\"After hearing from people across the state about this concerning policy, my office reached out to Anthem, and I'm pleased to share this policy will no longer be going into effect here in Connecticut,\" Scanlon told the newspaper.",
      "\"Appalling behavior by commercial health insurers\"",
      "In a statement last month, the American Society of Anesthesiologists also called on Anthem to reverse the policy.",
      "\"With this new policy, Anthem will arbitrarily pre-determine the time allowed for anesthesia care during a surgery or procedure,\" the group said. \"If an anesthesiologist submits a bill where the actual time of care is longer than Anthem's limit, Anthem will deny payment for the anesthesiologist's care.\"",
      "The insurer's new policy could result in denials of coverage to patients who might need more anesthesia because their surgery is difficult or unusual, or if a complication occurs, the group added.",
      "\"This is just the latest in a long line of appalling behavior by commercial health insurers looking to drive their profits up at the expense of patients and physicians providing essential care,\" said Donald E. Arnold, an anesthesiologist and president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. \"This egregious policy breaks the trust between Anthem and its policyholders who expect their health insurer to pay physicians for the entirety of the care they need.\"",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump wants former lawmaker and auctioneer Billy Long to replace IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he wants ex-congressman Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri and a former auctioneer, to run the IRS. As a lawmaker, Long co-sponsored legislation that aimed to wipe out much of the tax code.",
      "In making the announcement, Trump praised Long's \"32 years of experience running his own businesses in Real Estate and, as one of the premier Auctioneers in the Country.\" He also noted that since leaving Congress in 2023, Long has worked as a business and tax adviser.",
      "While Trump didn't mention the current IRS Commissioner, Danny Werfel, in his announcement, the decision signals the president-elect is likely to replace him with Long after taking office in January, Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Naming Long as the next IRS chief drew both support from conservatives as well as criticism from the left, with Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia who serves on the House Ways and Means Tax subcommittee calling it a \"terrible mistake,\" while Idaho Republican Senator Mike Crapo issued a statement saying he's looking forward to hearing Long's ideas for the tax agency. The fiscally conservative National Taxpayers Union Foundation praised Trump's choice, saying Long could help reform the IRS.",
      "Long has recently served as a tax adviser to businesses seeking to employ a controversial tax credit, but, unlike prior IRS commissioners, his background is largely outside of the tax industry, experts noted.",
      "\"This guy is an auctioneer \u2014 that's his expertise,\" Owens noted. \"This is an incredibly unserious choice.\"",
      "Werfel, who was appointed by President Biden, stepped into the role in 2023, with his term set to expire in 2027. Typically, presidents allow IRS commissioners to serve out their term, as Mr. Biden allowed Trump's former IRS appointee, Charles Rettig, to do before naming Werfel to the role.",
      "If the Senate approves his appointment to the IRS, Long would oversee an agency with 85,000 employees and an annual budget exceeding $12 billion.",
      "A spokesperson for the Trump campaign declined to comment.",
      "Here's what to know about Long and the IRS.",
      "Who is Billy Long?",
      "Long, who attended the University of Missouri but didn't graduate, described himself on a\u00a0website\u00a0for his congressional run as a \"fourth-generation native of Southwest Missouri.\" He touted his skills as an auctioneer, noting that he had been named the \"best auctioneer in the Ozarks for seven years in a row.\"",
      "Long also worked in real estate and in talk radio, hosting a show on a Missouri AM radio station.",
      "He shuttered his auction firm, Billy Long Auctions, before he was sworn into Congress in 2011, according to a local publication.",
      "What professional experience does Long have with taxes?",
      "As a congressman, Long co-sponsored some tax-related bills, including several efforts to eliminate the estate tax as well as a measure called the Tax Code Termination Act.",
      "That legislation would have wiped out much of the current tax code, replacing it with what the bill called a \"simple and fair system\" that would have applied \"a low rate to all Americans.\" Such flat taxes are considered regressive by many experts because low- and middle-income taxpayers would end up paying a larger share of their incomes than would wealthy Americans.",
      "\"As a business owner, Billy knows first-hand how government regulation and heavy taxes can affect the small businesses that serve as the economic engine of our country,\" his campaign site noted.",
      "While Long isn't an accountant or CPA, he has been involved in tax advising since leaving Congress. In a 2023 podcast, for example, he touted his work helping businesses use the Employee Retention Tax Credit, a credit that the IRS has\u00a0flagged for its high rate of fraud.",
      "In the podcast, Long also said that when he served as a congressman, he helped make the ERTC easier for businesses to claim, noting that the credit was difficult to qualify for during its first iteration.",
      "\"We went from having to say COVID adversely affected your business definitely, to taking that away, and you don't have to prove that you had any downturn,\" he said. \"We're doing recoveries for folks that had their best two years ever during COVID.\"",
      "The IRS says the ERTC is aimed at employers who paid wages to workers between March 12, 2020, and January 1, 2022, and that were either suspended by government order during the pandemic or experienced a \"required decline in gross receipts during 2020 or the first three calendar quarters of 2021.\" The credit is also available to startups that began at the end of 2021 and had less than $1 million in revenue.",
      "How does Long's experience compare with prior IRS commissioners?",
      "Long's lack of tax industry experience sets him apart from other recent IRS commissioners.",
      "Werfel, the current IRS chief, has an undergraduate degree from Cornell University and a master's degree in public policy from Duke University as well as a law degree from the University of North Carolina. He's also held a number of government jobs involved in operations and the IRS, including serving as acting commissioner of the IRS from May to December 2013, according to his biography.",
      "Werfel's predecessor, Charles Rettig, who was appointed by President-elect Trump, also held several degrees, including a master's in taxation. Before joining the IRS, Rettig worked as a tax attorney for more than three decades and served as the chairman of the IRS Advisory Council.",
      "What is happening with the IRS now?",
      "Under Werfel, the IRS has expanded audits of wealthy taxpayers and big corporations, clawing back billions in unpaid taxes, efforts that were funded by the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "The tax agency has also reduced the time it takes consumers to connect with an IRS employee, while also rolling out a free tax filing system called Direct File.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have pushed back against the expanded IRS funding, claiming\u00a0the agency would use the money to hire thousands of new agents to increase audits on middle-class taxpayers.",
      "The Treasury had said that funding could help the IRS add nearly 87,000 full-time workers over 10 years, but the agency didn't specify whether those new workers would be auditors, customer service workers or other types of employees. That figure also represented the total number of employees that could be hired, without calculating the impact of the number of IRS workers who are expected to retire or leave the department over the next several years.",
      "Some Democratic lawmakers are expressing concern that, if appointed, Long could disrupt the progress that the IRS has made under Werfel.",
      "Werfel \"has done an excellent job rebuilding the IRS, boosting customer service and enhancing enforcement aimed at wealthy tax evaders,\" Rep. Beyer said in a statement. \"Removing him will clearly signal Trump's intention to make the agency less responsive to the American people, while giving a green light to wealthy tax cheats to evade their fair share of the tax burden.\"",
      "Still, Republican lawmakers expressed support for the pick, such as Senator Crapo, who highlighted \"privacy and security\" issues at the IRS and \"inefficient use of resources.\" He added, \"I look forward to learning more about Mr. Long's vision for the agency.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 18:09:41 -0500",
    "summary": "Payments to victims of Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com are the largest yet by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
    "story": [
      "More than 4 million Americans gouged by credit repair companies including Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com will soon collectively receive $1.8 billion in refund checks, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced Thursday.",
      "The payments make up the biggest distribution yet from the CFPB's victims relief fund, financed by civil penalties paid by companies that violate consumer protection laws, the agency said.",
      "Checks will be mailed in coming weeks to 4.3 million consumers who were charged illegal advance fees or subjected to allegedly deceptive bait-and-switch advertising by Lexington Law, CreditRepair.com and their parent companies, according to the federal agency.",
      "The CFPB in August 2023 obtained a legal judgment against the credit repair businesses, with a district court ruling the companies had violated a law that prohibits such companies from collecting fees until at least six months after their promised results.",
      "The companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after the court ruling, shutting about 80% of their business operations, including telemarketing call centers.",
      "\"Exploited vulnerable consumers\"",
      "\"Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com exploited vulnerable consumers who were trying to rebuild their credit, charging them illegal junk fees for results they hadn't delivered,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra stated in a news release. \"This historic distribution of $1.8 billion demonstrates the CFPB's commitment to making consumers whole, even when the companies that harm them shut down or declare bankruptcy.\"",
      "Since its launch in 2011, the CFPB has distributed more than $3.3 billion to consumers harmed by a range of illegal practices, such as student loan and mortgage relief scams and predatory lending. The victims relief fund allows the CFPB to provide financial relief in cases where direction compensation from the violating company is not possible.",
      "The brainchild of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, the CFPB was established after the 2008 financial crisis. Funded by the Federal Reserve, the agency has weathered several legal challenges from opponents. The Supreme Court\u00a0in May upheld\u00a0its funding structure, which had been challenged by the payday lending industry.",
      "Still, the agency's efforts could prove short-lived amid calls from some Republicans to weaken the agency or get rid of it entirely. On Wednesday, billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 among those designated by President-elect Donald Trump to\u00a0front an effort\u00a0to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash regulations and cut government spending \u2014 called for deleting the CFPB, arguing in a\u00a0post\u00a0on social media that there are \"too many duplicative regulatory agencies.\"",
      "When will the refund checks be sent?",
      "Payments will be sent between December and January to eligible consumers harmed by the companies, and those eligible do not need to take any action to receive a check.",
      "Those who think they are eligible but have not received a payment by mid-January can then contact JND Legal Administration at www.cfpb-lexlaw.org. Details about the distribution can be found here.",
      "How big will the payments be?",
      "The CFPB said the payments are based on a pro-rata share of fees paid by consumers to CreditRepair.com and Lexington Law, but that the payments might not cover all the fees they incurred.",
      "If the payments were divided evenly, each person would receive about $419.",
      "\"If funds remain after the distribution is complete, additional checks may be sent to consumers who cashed their initial check. You don't need to take any additional action,\" the agency said.",
      "Can I file a claim?",
      "No, according to the agency. \"There won't be opportunities to file claims for this redress case,\" it said.",
      "Is the refund check taxable?",
      "It's unlikely, because the checks are considered refunds for payments that consumers made to the credit repair companies, rather than taxable income, the CFPB said. \"If you have tax-related questions, however, please contact a tax advisor,\" it added.",

    "story": [
      "The sprawling, windowless warehouses that hold rows of high-speed servers powering almost everything the world does on phones and computers are increasingly becoming fixtures of the American landscape, popping up in towns, cities and suburbs across the United States.",
      "Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and urban and rural governments alike are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies.",
      "But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas, abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents are pushing back against the world's most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.",
      "In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling hills of the area's westernmost counties and butt up against wooded bike trails winding through the suburbs. But one of the latest proposals in the area, Plaza 500, would see a 466,000-square-foot facility and adjacent electrical substation built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds and a community center.",
      "The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials promised jobs and a significant property tax boost. But data center critics say the incentives aren't enough to counteract the consequences of building the facilities so close to homes.",
      "Tyler Ray, a leader in the fight against the Virginia project, worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by 2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help power the data centers' hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere.",
      "Ray and his neighbors tried to stop the development, but their efforts were largely unsuccessful. The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project was exempt.",
      "\"I don't know how a general resident, even someone who has been engaging intently on an issue, has any chance to go up against the data center industry,\" Ray said the night the supervisors voted.",
      "For local governments, attracting data centers to their municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in 2024 that Virginia's current data centers brought in $1 billion in tax revenue.",
      "For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of direct jobs \u2013 often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently that its investment in nearby Loudoun County, which included two data centers, created around 150 direct jobs, a figure that data center opponents say isn't worth the hassle. But data center advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction, technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730 indirect jobs.",
      "Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax County should reap the benefits.",
      "\"I have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the big picture,\" Smith said. \"Data centers are not going away.\"",
      "On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the 4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia river.",
      "Last year, AWS paid roughly $34 million in property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a $66 million tax break. Those payments, in addition to $1.7 in charitable donations from the company in 2023, have been instrumental in updating infrastructure and bolstering services. These funds have gone toward a new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer and $5,000 grants for homebuyers so far totaling at least $2.8 million.",
      "\"This road right here? Wouldn't happen if it wasn't for AWS,\" said Boardman Mayor Paul Keefer, riding in the passenger seat of Police Chief Rick Stokoe's cruiser, pointing out the window at construction workers shifting dirt and laying pavement.",
      "AWS has cultivated relationships with local officials including Keefer and Stokoe, who have both been in positions to vote on whether to authorize tax breaks with the company. Some former county commissioners and residents worry that those relationships are too cozy.",
      "Kevin Miller, AWS's vice president of global data centers, said in an interview with the Associated Press that \"our interest is in being a model corporate citizen, to really be partners with those communities.\"",
      "Skepticism of the deals started years ago, when three formerly elected officials allegedly helped approve data center deals while also owning a stake in a company that contracted with AWS to provide fiber optic cables for the data centers. In June, they each paid $2,000 to settle an ethics complaint.",
      "Those officials are no longer in office. But the latest data center deal struck between Morrow County officials and AWS, which gives the company an estimated $1 billion in tax breaks spread over the 15 years to build five new data centers, again raised eyebrows.",
      "Two former Morrow County Commissioners, Jim Doherty and Melissa Lindsay, pushed unsuccessfully in 2022 for AWS to pay more in taxes in new data center negotiations.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 14:39:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Judge Reed O'Connor took issue with both a lack of judicial oversight and certain diversity requirements included in the deal's independent monitoring process.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Texas rejected a proposed plea agreement between the Justice Department and Boeing that would have settled the U.S. government's claims against the company, after crashes of two 737 Max jetliners that killed 346 people, according to a court order issued Thursday.",
      "In his ruling, Judge Reed O'Connor took issue with both a lack of judicial oversight and certain diversity requirements included in the deal's independent monitoring process and ordered the parties to provide the court with a plan for possible ways forward early next month.",
      "The federal government's proposed agreement with airplane manufacturing giant over the deadly crashes included various provisions, including an admission of guilt to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and a $243.6 million fine \u2014 much less than the billions the families of the victims had requested. The deal would also have required Boeing to spend $455 million on safety programs and to work with an independent monitor who would oversee the company's progress.",
      "Investigators alleged in court records that leading up to the crashes, Boeing deceived federal officials who regulated the planes. In 2021, Boeing and the Justice Department entered into a deferred prosecution agreement, which meant the criminal charge would have been dropped if Boeing had complied with the terms of the deal. But earlier this year, federal prosecutors informed the court that Boeing had not followed through on all of the requirements and intended to move forward with the case.",
      "By July, after weeks of negotiations, Boeing and the Justice Department settled on the proposed plea agreement, prompting an outcry from families of those who died in the crashes. At the time, CBS News reported the deal only covered wrongdoing by Boeing tied to the crashes and did not give the company immunity for other incidents, including a door panel that blew off a Max jetliner during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. According to a Justice Department official, the proposed agreement also did not cover any current or former Boeing officials, only the corporation.",
      "Attorneys for some of the victims' families opposed the deal, arguing the \"rotten\" agreement with the government did not justly remedy the families' claims against Boeing. In court filings, they accused Boeing of more criminality and urged stricter penalties, harsher monitoring and recognition of the lives lost.",
      "In rejecting the plea agreement, the judge took aim at diversity, equity and inclusion considerations that the parties said they would take when hiring an independent monitor. He wrote that he was \"concerned with the Government's shifting and contradictory explanations of how the plea agreement's diversity-and-inclusion provision will practically operate in this case.\"",
      "Judge O'Connor had previously raised this issue and in responsive court filings, the Justice Department defended the language, arguing it predated the Boeing agreement. \"This new language reflected not a change in policy but rather a principle that has always governed the process: that selection of a monitor must be based solely on merit, from the broadest possible pool of qualified candidates,\" they said.",
      "O'Connor ruled Thursday that the language was inappropriate: \"In a case of this magnitude, it is in the utmost interest of justice that the public is confident this monitor selection is done based solely on competency. The parties' DEI efforts only serve to undermine this confidence in the Government and Boeing's ethics and anti-fraud efforts.\"",
      "The judge also wrote that the Justice Department's previous efforts to oversee Boeing's conduct \"failed\" and said the independent monitor provision in the proposed deal did not go far enough to include the court in the process.",
      "\"At this point, the public interest requires the Court to step in. Marginalizing the Court in the selection and monitoring of the independent monitor as the plea agreement does undermines public confidence in Boeing's probation, fails to promote respect for the law, and is therefore not in the public interest,\" O'Connor wrote, \"Accordingly, the Court cannot accept the plea agreement.\"",
      "The Justice Department said it's reviewing the decision. Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "In a statement, Paul Cassell, an attorney for some of the victims' families, told CBS News, \"Judge O'Connor has recognized that this was a cozy deal between the Government and Boeing that failed to focus on the overriding concerns \u2013 holding Boeing accountable for its deadly crime and ensuring that nothing like this happens again in the future.\"",

More than half of those job seekers have been on the hunt for new employment for more than 27 weeks, or about half a year.",
      "A drawn-out job search is increasingly common in the labor market today as companies hold off on hiring, especially in some industries such as tech and professional services, ZipRecruiter chief economist Julia Pollak told CBS MoneyWatch. It's a far cry from the heady years of 2021 and 2022, when Americans switched jobs at high rates in search of better pay and more fulfilling work, a trend termed \"The Great Resignation.\"",
      "The job market has since weakened under the strain of the Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy, with the central bank boosting borrowing rates to their highest point in 23 years to combat inflation, Pollak noted. While inflation has rapidly cooled in the past two years and the Fed began cutting rates in September, the burden of higher borrowing costs has caused consumers to pull back on buying cars and homes, impacting key sectors of the economy, Pollak said.",

      "\"Our investigation found that in 2023 alone, American, Delta, United, Frontier and Spirit collected more than $3 billion in seat fees \u2014 only seat fees. That's not airfare, that's just fees for booking a specific seat in advance, or selecting a slightly better seat,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal in a hearing by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on the impact of such charges on consumers.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Trump said Atkins, the CEO of Patomak Partners and a former SEC commissioner, was a \"proven leader for common sense regulations.\" In the years since leaving the SEC, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation.",
      "\"He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.",

Gensler, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, announced last month that he would be stepping down from his post on the day that Trump is inaugurated \u2014 Jan. 20, 2025.",
      "Trump, once a crypto skeptic, had pledged to make the U.S. \"the crypto capital of the planet\" and create a \"strategic reserve\" of bitcoin. Money has poured into crypto assets since he won. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, is now above $95,000. And shares in crypto platform Coinbase have surged more than 70% since the election.",
      "Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of Coinbase, congratulated Atkins in a post on X.",
      "\"We appreciate his commitment to balance in regulating U.S. securities markets and look forward to his fresh leadership at (the SEC),\" Grewal wrote. \"It's sorely needed and cannot come a day too soon.\"",

      "\"He'd probably take the position that no cryptocurrency is a security, and hence no exchange that deals with crypto is a securities exchange,\" Sherman said. \"The opportunity to defraud investors would be there in a very significant way.\"",
      "Atkins began his career as a lawyer and has a long history working in the financial markets sector, both in government and private practice. In the 1990s, he worked on the staffs of two former SEC chairmen, Richard C. Breeden and Arthur Levitt.",
      "His work as an SEC commissioner started in 2002, a time when the fallout from corporate scandals at Enron and WorldCom had turned up the heat on Wall Street and its government regulators.",
      "Atkins was widely considered the most conservative member of the SEC during his tenure at the agency and was known to have a strong free-market bent. As a commissioner, he called for greater transparency in and analysis of the costs and benefits of new SEC rules.",
      "He also emphasized investor education and increased enforcement efforts against those who steal from investors over the internet, manipulate markets, engage in Ponzi schemes and other types of fraud.",
      "At the same time, Atkins objected to stiff penalties imposed on companies accused of fraudulent conduct, contending that they did not deter crime. He caused a stir in the summer of 2006 when he said the practice of granting stock options to executives before the disclosure of news that was certain to increase the share price did not constitute insider trading.",
      "U.S. Rep. Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said Atkins has the experience needed to \"restore faith in the SEC.\"",
      "\"I'm confident his leadership will lead to clarity for the digital asset ecosystem and ensure U.S. capital markets remain the envy of the world,\" McHenry posted on X.",
      "Atkins already has some experience working for Trump. During Trump's first term, Atkins was a member of the President's Strategic and Policy Forum, an advisory group of more than a dozen CEOs and business leaders who offered input on how to create jobs and speed economic growth.",
      "In 2017, Atkins joined the Token Alliance, a cryptocurrency advocacy organization.",

    "summary": "Democratic governors met in Los Angeles over the weekend to discuss the way forward, as GOP is set to control all three branches of the federal government.",
    "story": [
      "Beverly Hills, California \u2014 Democrats, who are about to be locked out of power in Washington as Republicans take control of all three branches of government in January, see the state capitals run by Democratic governors as the clearest path of resistance to President-elect Donald Trump's second term.",
      "The 16 governors and three governors-elect who gathered for their annual conference in Los Angeles this past weekend welcomed areas of compromise they can find with a\u00a0Trump White House, but they're already planning which fights to pick and are considering how they'll proceed.",
      "Many of the governors at the conference were elected during the blue wave in 2018 and have experience working with a Trump White House, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"We were able to find ways,\" said Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, who was one of these governors and serves as the chair of the Democratic Governors Association. \"We really took a positive approach to it, and this time around, I think we'll end up doing the same thing, because really, we have no idea what's coming down. So, we'll evaluate it as it comes to us.\"",
      "Politically, Democratic governors are also primed to fill a leadership vacuum in the party in the coming years. Some potential 2028 presidential candidates have already been taking action.",
      "In early December, California Gov. Gavin Newsom launched a special session to \"safeguard California values\" and bolster funds for legal defenses against potential federal actions on abortion, climate and immigration. A week after the election, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker partnered with Colorado Gov. Jared Polis to start the \"Governors Safeguarding Democracy\" group, a think tank to create a \"toolbox\" of policies and responses to Trump's presidency.",
      "\"Anything that's happening right now in Washington, states are gonna be the front line of defense on that,\" said Democratic strategist Corey Platt, who was the DGA's political director from 2013 to 2018. \"There's always a disconnect from voters to D.C. Folks are always angry at D.C., and yet, states have to make things work every day.\"",
      "No \"perfect answer\" for 2024 losses",
      "Still fresh in the minds of these governors were the party's widespread losses in the 2024 election. North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein's victory in the governor's race\u00a0was an electoral bright spot for Democrats in the battleground state, where Vice President Kamala Harris lost by 3 points.",
      "He said he didn't \"have a perfect answer\" on why he won (though his\u00a0scandal-plagued GOP opponent helped give him an advantage) and Harris lost. Stein blamed a \"tough national environment,\" but noted that his state often splits their ticket: in seven of the last nine presidential elections, North Carolina has voted for a Republican for president and a Democrat for governor.",
      "\"People were definitely anxious economically, because they were seeing and feeling price increases,\" he said. \"Typically, when you're unhappy, you blame the party that's in control of the White House. Even if it's not nationally their fault.\"",
      "New Jersey and Virginia, a potential flip opportunity for Democrats, have off-year gubernatorial elections in 2025. The 2026 map is vast, with 36 states electing governors. Several of those states, such as Georgia, Nevada and New Hampshire, could be targeted pickups for the party. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear will be taking over as DGA Chair in 2026.",
      "\"Lifting up as many people as we can that are running on these common sense, common ground areas that people care about the most, will also create that critical mass for people to say the Democratic Party is for working people,\" said Beshear, the rare Democratic governor who has won in a Republican state.",
      "Platt, a former DGA political director, agreed that the 2026 gubernatorial races can help find \"the good surrogate for Democratic policy and Democratic ideas that has empathy, that folks can understand.\" He added that while a large number of governors are going to be \"in that conversation\" as the party recalibrates, it won't just be them.",
      "\"We're gonna need leaders that can speak to real people,\" he said. \"It doesn't happen because of a poll. It doesn't happen because of a tactic. It's real and authentic, and I'm excited to see how that happens.\"",
      "Courtney Alexander, communications director for the Republican Governors Association, opposes potential attempts by Democratic governors to counter the incoming Trump administration.",
      "\"The fact that Americans resoundingly rejected the Democratic Party agenda just one month ago, and yet Democrats continue to believe running against an agenda of lower costs, more safety, and more freedom is their winning message shows just how wholly out of touch they are with the country,\" Alexander told CBS News.",
      "Trump's mass deportation plan",
      "Some governors are laying the groundwork to counter Trump's plans for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.",
      "Trump said in an interview with NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that deporting undocumented migrants who are convicted criminals is the first priority in his mass deportation plan, but other, nonviolent undocumented migrants may also be subject to removal.",
      "\"I think you have to do it, and it's a hard \u2014 it's a very tough thing to do. But you have to have, you know, you have rules, regulations, laws. They came in illegally,\" Trump said.",
      "New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said while she'd accept federal assistance to help locate and deport undocumented migrants who are convicted criminals, there would be \"zero way\" she'd cooperate with a broader mass deportation plan.",
      "She noted her control over the state police force, said she wouldn't grant licenses for physical detentions, and said providing the federal government private information about undocumented residents would endanger transgender residents or women who travel from states with abortion bans.",
      "\"I don't doubt that he will make every effort,\" Lujan Grisham said about Trump and his mass deportation plan. \"He's going to have trouble executing that. But I also am not Pollyanna about how serious [he is].... I take him at his word, which is why I know what I must do and will do. And let's see if my strategy works the way that I think it will across the country.\"",
      "Kelly said she would not permit the Kansas National Guard \"to perform that kind of service\" and said it's not the job of the Kansas State Police either.",
      "\"No doubt, if there are things they push us to do that we think are wrong or illegal, we'll draw the line,\" said Kelly.",
      "Stein, who will be taking office as North Carolina governor in January, said the mass deportation of all undocumented migrants in his state \"would create real economic challenges,\" but he has doubts about how likely it is that the mass deportations will be implemented.",
      "\"[Trump] is a master of saying something and creating a great deal of noise, and then the reality may be different. I'm going to wait to see exactly what it is he ultimately proposes,\" Stein said.",

      "\"It is something I would seriously consider,\" she told The Associated Press in an interview. \"If I'm being completely transparent, I don't know exactly what that would look like. And I certainly want to get all of the information possible if that is something that's real for me. But yeah, I would 100% consider it.\"",
      "Elected as RNC co-chair in March, Lara Trump was a key player in the Republicans retaking the White House and control of the Senate while maintaining a narrow House majority. What she does next could shape Republican politics, given her elevated political profile and her ties to the incoming president.",

      "Led by chairman Michael Whatley and Lara Trump, the RNC invested heavily in recruiting roughly 230,000 volunteers and an army of lawyers for what it called its \"election integrity\" effort, four years after Donald Trump lost his reelection bid to Democrat Joe Biden, citing false or unproven theories about voter fraud. Outside groups such as Turning Point Action and Musk's America PAC took a greater responsibility for advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts.",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 14:29:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump says he'll end birthright citizenship, after years of criticizing the constitutional right.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump says he'll end birthright citizenship, after years of criticizing the constitutional right.",
      "In an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that aired Sunday, Trump said he's \"absolutely\" still planning to end birthright citizenship on Day One of his presidency. \"We have to end it,\" Trump told host Kristen Welker. In a video post in\u00a02023, Trump had said he'd sign an executive action to do so on the first day in office.",
      "What is birthright citizenship, and is it in the U.S. Constitution?",
      "Birthright citizenship automatically grants citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of the parents' citizenship status.",
      "The Citizen Clause, under the 14th Amendment\u00a0to the Constitution, states that \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"",
      "Congress passed the 14th Amendment in 1866, during the Reconstruction period following the Civil War. In 1868, the amendment was ratified to extend citizenship to people born on U.S. soil, invalidating the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision, which barred slaves and descendants of slaves from becoming citizens.",
      "Why does Trump want to end birthright citizenship?",
      "Trump has been talking about ending birthright citizenship since his presidential campaign in 2015. In a policy paper at the time, he called birthright citizenship \"the biggest magnet for illegal immigration.\" In the 2023 video, Trump blamed birthright citizenship for \"birth tourism,\" in which he said migrants spend the final weeks of their pregnancies in hotels in order to give birth in the U.S. and then use the child's citizenship status to bring relatives into the U.S. through \"chain migration,\" also known as family-based migration.",
      "During his first term, Trump pledged to end birthright citizenship but did not do so. He told \"Meet the Press\" that he had planned to sign an executive action on birthright citizenship before his focus turned to fighting COVID-19.",
      "Trump called the guarantee of citizenship by birth \"ridiculous,\" telling Welker that the U.S. is the only country with birthright citizenship. In fact, dozens of other countries have birthright citizenship.",
      "\"If somebody sets a foot \u2014 just a foot, one foot, you don't need two \u2014 on our land, congratulations, you are now a citizen of the United States of America,\" Trump complained. \"We're going to end that because it's ridiculous.\"",
      "Opponents of birthright citizenship say it was never intended to cover undocumented immigrants' children or so-called \"birth tourism.\" They contend the amendment was ratified to eliminate barriers to birthright citizenship based on race.",
      "More broadly, the pledge is part of what Trump has billed as a radical shift on immigration that he campaigned on, part of a promise to target both unauthorized and legal immigrants using unprecedented measures likely to test the limits on his authority.",
      "Can Trump end birthright citizenship?",
      "When asked whether he could get around the 14th Amendment through executive action, Trump acknowledged \"it would maybe have to go back to the people, but we have to end it,\" which seemed to indicate he might try to initiate a constitutional amendment to end the right, if necessary. He clarified that he would pursue an end to birthright citizenship through executive action \"if we can.\"",
      "Could Trump repeal birthright citizenship through executive action?",
      "\"The answer is no,\" said Michael LeRoy, professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign School of Labor and Employment Relations and College of Law. That's because the president lacks the authority to unilaterally change the Constitution.",
      "Eliminating birthright citizenship through a constitutional amendment would be nearly impossible as well, because of the widespread approval needed not only from Congress but also from the states.",
      "What's enshrined in the Constitution can't be altered\u00a0by a regular congressional vote, either. Amendments not only have to be approved by a two-thirds vote in both chambers of Congress, but ratified by three-fourths of state legislatures, or three-fourths of conventions called in each state for ratification. It's an extensive process with a high bar.",
      "The only time in U.S. history a constitutional amendment has been repealed was when the 18th Amendment prohibiting the manufacture, sale and transportation of intoxication liquors, better known as prohibition, was repealed in 1933 through the addition of the 21st Amendment, LeRoy noted.",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina says he's working on drafting a constitutional amendment to end the practice.",
      "Do other countries besides the U.S. have birthright citizenship?",
      "The U.S. is far from the only country with birthright citizenship, although birthright citizenship without conditions is more common in North and South America than it is in the rest of the world.",
      "Unlike some countries, the U.S. does not require a parent to be a citizen for a child born on U.S. soil to become a citizen. It's automatic.",
      "Full list of countries with birthright citizenship",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Monday declined to take up a Hawaii man's appeal of his prosecution for carrying a handgun without a license.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday declined to take up a Hawaii man's appeal of his prosecution for carrying a handgun without a license, leaving untouched a state supreme court decision that castigated its new framework for determining whether gun laws comport with the Second Amendment.",
      "Justice Clarence Thomas, in a statement joined by Justice Samuel Alito, criticized the Hawaiian court for its ruling, but said the high court was right to dismiss the challenge on technical grounds. However, he wrote that the court should hear an \"appropriate case\" to \"make clear that Americans are always free to invoke the Second Amendment as a defense against unconstitutional firearms-licensing schemes.\"",
      "The court laid out the so-called \"history and tradition\" standard in a landmark Second Amendment decision in June 2022. The test requires the government to show that a gun law is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.",
      "The Supreme Court provided some clarity about its new standard this past June, when it upheld a federal firearms prohibition for alleged domestic abusers, but lower courts have still struggled to apply the framework when assessing the constitutionality of firearm restrictions. That decision involved whether certain categories of people \u2014 namely those found to pose a credible threat to others \u2014 can be temporarily disarmed.",
      "The case from Hawaii involved the state's rules for licenses to carry handguns in public. Under the state's scheme, residents must obtain a permit to legally own a firearm. Those who want to carry a gun publicly also must obtain a carry license, which can be acquired by demonstrating an \"urgency or need,\" good moral character and that they are \"engaged in the protection of life and property.\"",
      "Applicants also have to be at least 21 years old and a U.S. citizen. Police departments had the discretion to deny licenses.",
      "In December 2017, Christopher Wilson was arrested after he and a group of hikers were found on a trail running through private property into the West Maui Mountains. Wilson and his fellow hikers told police they didn't see \"no trespassing\" signs on the property and were headed into the mountains to look at the moon and planets. Wilson also told police he had a weapon, and a loaded pistol was seized from his waistband.",
      "Wilson didn't have a permit to acquire a gun or a license to carry it and was charged with violating Hawaii laws for carrying or possessing a handgun.",
      "Wilson sought to dismiss the charges on the grounds that they violated his Second Amendment rights under two recent Supreme Court decisions, one of which said the Constitution guarantees the right to keep a handgun in the home for self-defense.",
      "Wilson's bid to toss out the charges was denied, but soon after, the Supreme Court handed down its June 2022 ruling that expanded gun rights and laid out its history-and-tradition test for evaluating the constitutionality of firearms rules.",
      "On the heels of that decision, Wilson again sought to have the charges against him dismissed, arguing that under the Supreme Court's standard, he was legally allowed to carry a firearm for self-defense, and the state had to justify its licensing scheme.",
      "A trial court sided with Wilson and dismissed the charges against him. But the Hawaii Supreme Court reversed that decision and concluded that prosecuting Wilson for carrying a handgun didn't violate the Constitution. The Hawaii court also lambasted the nation's highest court for its Second Amendment rulings.",
      "The state supreme court claimed that the Supreme Court \"distorts and cherry-picks historical evidence\" in its Second Amendment cases and accused the high court of ad-libbing a new standard for evaluating gun laws.",
      "Referencing the Supreme Court's latest decision, the Hawaii Supreme Court said its new test is a \"backward-looking approach\" that \"ignores today's realities.\"",
      "\"The spirit of Aloha clashes with a federally-mandated lifestyle that lets citizens walk around with deadly weapons during day-to-day activities,\" Hawaii's highest court wrote.",
      "Wilson, represented by public defenders, appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Hawaii court showed \"open hostility to the individual rights protected by the Second Amendment.\"",
      "They warned in a filing that refusing to apply the court's history-and-tradition test \"upends the constitutional order between the States and the national government. When constitutional rights are incorporated under the Fourteenth Amendment, the states must recognize them.\"",
      "Writing on Monday, Thomas said the decision by the Hawaii Supreme Court \"failed to give the Second Amendment its due regard.\"",
      "\"Had the Hawaii Supreme Court followed its duty to consider the merits of Wilson's defense, the licensing scheme's unconstitutionality should have been apparent,\" he wrote.",
      "But Thomas noted that \"correction of the Hawaii Supreme Court's error must await another day,\" since Wilson sought to dismiss only some of the charges and asked the court to review an \"interlocutory order over which we may not have jurisdiction.\" Thomas said that Wilson could ask the court to review the case again after trial.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch echoed that sentiment in a statement of his own, writing that \"Mr. Wilson remains free to seek this Court's review after final judgment.\"",

      "Justice Neil Gorsuch noted that the schools have since changed the admissions policy, which \"greatly diminish[es] the need for our review.\" Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, disagreed with the decision not to hear the case.",
      "The challenge came on the heels of the Supreme Court's June 2023 decision that struck down affirmative action at higher-education institutions and said race can no longer be used as a factor in admissions decisions.",
      "Schools nationwide are now weighing how to better diversify their student bodies without running afoul of the Supreme Court's ruling, and are looking to other factors like zip codes and socioeconomics that can be taken into consideration to achieve that objective.",
      "In Boston, admission to the three so-called \"Exam Schools,\" Boston Latin Schools, Boston Latin Academy and the John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, was based on a combination of a student's score on a standardized test, grade point average and preference. But the COVID-19 pandemic roiled the admissions process, as it became difficult to administer its exam-based process.",
      "Under admissions criteria revised in light of the impact of the pandemic, 20% of seats were awarded based on students' GPA and the rest of the seats went to students with the highest GPAs from each of Boston's zip codes.",
      "The admissions process launched in November 2020 and closed in January 2021. Under the revised criteria, 43% of incoming students were economically disadvantaged, an increase from the prior year. Of those admitted to the exam schools, 31% were White, 23% Black, 23% Hispanic, and 18% Asian, according to court filings.",
      "Under the old plan, 39% of invited students were White, 21% Asian, 21% Hispanic and 14% Black.",
      "The criteria was only in effect for one year, and beginning with the 2022-2023 school year, the school system put in place a new plan that relies on grades, census tracts and performance on a standardized test.",
      "In February 2021, the Boston Parent Coalition for Academic Excellence sued the Boston School Committee, which oversees the city's public school system, and superintendent on behalf of 14 anonymous White and Asian students who claimed they applied for admission to the exam schools that fall. They sought to bar the committee from implementing the plan.",
      "A federal district court sided with the school system, finding that the revised admissions criteria did not violate the Constitution and was racially race neutral. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit upheld that decision, finding in part that the Boston School Committee's use of neutral selection criteria to increase racial diversity was allowed by the Supreme Court.",
      "The coalition appealed to the high court, arguing that the admissions criteria was designed to reduce the number of Asian American and White students who were allowed to attend the three exam schools. The parents argued that under the 1st Circuit's decision, a school district could \"openly target\" students based on their race.",
      "\"Should the court turn away this case, it will only embolden government officials to continue targeting disfavored racial groups \u2014 particularly, Asian Americans,\" they argued in a filing.",
      "But the Boston School Committee argued that there is no longer a controversy for the Supreme Court to decide. The admissions criteria at the center of the challenge was adopted for one year when the COVID-19 pandemic made it impossible to administer its existing exam-based process, it said.",
      "Lawyers for the school district also said the temporary admissions plan was developed and ended before the Supreme Court's affirmative action decision.",
      "\"Nothing in this Court's precedent mandates that a public body be blind to whether its race-neutral policies will have a disparate impact on historically disadvantaged groups, or even help reduce past disparate impacts,\" they said.",
      "Alito wrote that the Supreme Court, through its decision not to hear the case, has \"now twice refused to correct a glaring constitutional error that threatens to perpetuate race-based affirmative action in defiance of Students for Fair Admissions,\" referring to the 2023 case.",
      "The Supreme Court already has been asked to step into two recent disputes over admissions policies at a prestigious Virginia high school and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.",
      "In February, the justices turned away a challenge to the admissions criteria at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. Administrators said the policy is designed to mitigate socioeconomic and geographic barriers for prospective students.",
      "The high court also said it would not stop West Point from considering race in its admissions process while a legal fight over its policies plays out before a federal appellate court.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump plans to act on the \"first day\" of his presidency on the cases of some Jan. 6 defendants and said he believes the House members on the select Jan. 6 committee who investigated the 2021 Capitol riot, including Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson and former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, \"should go to jail.\"",
      "In an interview that aired Sunday on NBC News' \"Meet the Press,\" Trump told host Kristen Welker he would not direct the FBI director or attorney general to do so, but said \"I think they'll have to look at that.\"",
      "The president-elect was also pressed on whether he would pardon some or all of the Capitol riot defendants. He indicated he would not issue a universal blanket pardon: \"We're going to look at independent cases.\" Last week, one of Trump's Senate allies, GOP Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri, told CBS News he thinks Trump and the next attorney general should be going through the riot defendants on a \"case-by-case\" basis.",
      "Trump said of the Jan. 6 defendants and convicts, \"I'm going to be acting very quickly,\" adding that he planned to act as soon as he's inaugurated in January. \"First day,\" he said.",
      "CBS News' review of Justice Department filings shows there have been approximately 1,560 Jan. 6 defendants, and approximately 590 of them are charged with assaulting police. More than 900 defendants have pleaded guilty.",
      "Several of the defendants have openly predicted pardons from Trump are imminent \u2014 including for those accused of violent acts.",
      "Over the weekend, Joseph Hutchinson, who is accused of beating police during the Capitol riot and was a fugitive from justice for three years as he eluded authorities, said in a filing that he wants to be released immediately, arguing, \"No one is going to flee from a trial that isn't coming.\u00a0 I will await my pardon like any responsible person.\"",
      "Trump has not yet said if he'll allow new Capitol riot prosecutions, investigations or pending prosecutions to continue. Hundreds more arrests have been expected.",
      "The president-elect was also asked by Welker if he intended to appoint \"a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States, Joe Biden and the entire crime family,\" as he said he would last year on Truth Social.",
      "\"No, I'm not doing that unless I find something that I think is reasonable,\" Trump said. \"But that's not going to be my decision.\" He said he would leave it up to Pam Bondi, who he intends to name attorney general and Kash Patel, his pick for FBI director.",
      "He said he would leave it to Bondi to determine whether to investigate special counsel Jack Smith, who brought both federal criminal cases against Trump, one on election interference in 2020 and another on documents he allegedly took after his first term from the White House to his Florida residence.",
      "\"I want her to do what she wants to do,\" he said of investigating Smith, whom he referred to as \"corrupt.\" \"I'm not going to instruct her to do it.\"",
      "Cheney on Sunday night said in a statement that Trump's suggestion she and others on the Jan. 6 committee should be jailed is \"a continuation of his assault on the rule of law and the foundations of our republic.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump knows his claims about the select committee are ridiculous and false, as has been detailed extensively, including by Chairman Thompson in this July 2023 letter,\" she said. \"There is no conceivably appropriate factual or constitutional basis for what Donald Trump is suggesting \u2013 a Justice Department investigation of the work of a congressional committee \u2013 and any lawyer who attempts to pursue that course would quickly find themselves engaged in sanctionable conduct.\"",

      "Mr. Biden says the administration is \"clear eyed\" about the possibility that ISIS may try to gain control amid a power vacuum, but he said that \"we will not let that happen.\" He noted that the U.S. conducted precision airstrikes within Syria targeting ISIS camps and operatives.",

      "The president credited his administration's work in other foreign conflicts with contributing to the collapse of Assad's government, arguing support for Assad from Iran, Hezbollah and Russia fell apart \"because all three of them are far weaker today than they were when I took office.\"",

He said Hezbollah has been \"badly degraded,\" as has Hamas, while Iran's military capabilities have been \"weakened.\" The dynamics, the president said, made it \"impossible\" for Hezbollah and Iran to continue to prop up the Assad regime.",

      "\"The upshot for all this is, for the first time ever, neither Russia nor Iran nor Hezbollah could defend this abhorrent regime in Syria,\" Mr. Biden said, calling it a \"direct result\" of Ukraine and Israel's self defense with the \"unflagging support\" of the U.S.",

As Mr. Biden left the room, he ignored questions shouted at him until a reporter asked, \"What does the U.S. know about where Austen Tice might be and if he's safe?\"",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Rep. Mike Turner, Republican of Ohio, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 8, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Ohio, Congressman Mike Turner. Just a stunning turn of events within such a short period of time. The US doesn't have a diplomatic presence inside of Syria. Our visibility is a little limited here. What is it that you think Americans need to know about this turn of events?",
      "REP. MIKE TURNER: Margaret, that was an excellent report, because you certainly laid the groundwork of this has been an incredibly brutal civil war with hundreds of thousands of people dying, including the use of chemical weapons. And of course, reminding people that the Obama administration had said this would be a red line, that we would use military force to stop the use of chemical weapons, then failing to do so. This is an Islamic militia that has risen up and has continued and now is successfully toppling the Assad regime. As your report indicated, it's al Qaeda in its origins, but it opposes ISIS. It is Turkish-backed. This is a blow to Iran, a blow to Russia. We're seeing what is likely a disintegration in Syria. The big questions will be, what does this mean for the US? What does it mean for Iran, Russia, the neighbors of Israel and Jordan, which are strong allies of the United States?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you mentioned there, and we showed the picture of Abu Muhammad al-Golani. He is the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, people call HTS. You're going to hear a lot about that in the coming days and weeks, the rebel group that appears to be taking control. But they are working also with the Prime Minister. The United States government has a ten million bounty on the head of Jolani. Do you think the United States still should keep that? Should Americans be concerned that this will mean something in terms of impact for terror threats to the United States?",
      "REP. TURNER: This is a terrorist organization and group, but this is not going to be just a passing of power and authority. It could be. We'll have to, obviously, watch that. You know, one of the things that we do see here, though, is this is a diplomatic failure with respect to the United States and Turkey. You know, the U.S. has troops in Syria. This is on the border of Turkey. Turkey is a NATO ally. The United States is working with the Kurds. This really could have been an opportunity for the United States to work to try to resolve the issue between the Kurds, Turkey and the United States and working with Turkish interests in Syria. Hopefully this could be an opportunity where there could be a diplomatic support there that hopefully could have- help in this transition in Syria.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are 900 US troops in Syria in the South. Donald Trump in 2019 pulled US troops out of northern Syria, abandoning our allies there. Do you believe he will stand by the 900 US troops that remain there? Or should he consider pulling them out when he takes office?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well I think, you know, one of the things that Donald Trump will make clear is, is that any any threat to us, troops will be unbelievably responded to. So everyone should understand, absolutely, the United States troops are to be secure. The second thing is, is he does absolutely support the Kurds and that he's going to look for a diplomatic solution. I think there will be an assessment as to whether or not those troops should remain. But it's, you know, I think here there is an opportunity for the parties, especially now that Iran and Russia's roles are going to be domin- diminished. They have been brutal in their support with Assad, the hundreds of thousands of people, including use of chemical weapons that have been killed, have been under the Russian influence there. Russia still has two bases, a naval and air force base there that are going to be, you know, both at risk for Russia, but also a risk to the population of Syria because they could- they have been used before to attack the Syrian population. We'll have to see what Russia does there. But this is going to be an area that's going to be highly volatile and in transition.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And no idea where Bashar Al Assad might have fled to?",
      "REP. TURNER: No, not at this time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, since we're talking about the incoming administration, Donald Trump has chosen Tulsi Gabbard, the former Congresswoman, a former Democrat, now Republican, to be the Director of National Intelligence, overseeing 18 intelligence agencies. She not only went and met with Assad, she publicly doubted high confidence assessments by U.S. intelligence that he did what we showed you pictures of him doing, using chemical weapons there. Do you trust that she could actually represent the intelligence community, lead it and be trusted to brief the Commander in Chief?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, I obviously differ in a great deal in a number of areas with both her judgment and and her background and experience, but what I do trust is the\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013You're smiling when you're saying this\u2013",
      "REP. TURNER: The Senate is the Senate process, and I think this- the senators are going to put her through a process. She has been nominated. She will go through the process, and I think there will be significant debate and evaluation. I think\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013You don't think she'll be confirmed?--",
      "REP. TURNER: \u2013that Donald Trump has put together in his last term, and I think he will in this term, a great national security team. I think CIA director, Radcliffe, I think Mike Waltz as National Security Director, are both great examples of people who are going to be foundational. I think you're going to see a great national security team.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is a community that you also have oversight of, so you may not vote in the Senate, but it sounds like she doesn't have your confidence. What about Pete Hegseth to run the Pentagon at a time of global instability?",
      "REP. TURNER: Yeah, I think the Chairman of the Armed Services in the Senate made a great statement. He said, we certainly support the process, and he has his support going through the process, and we'll have to see how that goes through. One thing that is absolutely clear is that the Pentagon needs reformed. We are not keeping pace with what Russia and China are doing in advanced weapon systems. At the same time, we're seeing the weapon systems of advanced technology that are being utilized on the battlefield of Ukraine, and our acquisition systems and our accounting systems, our spending systems are not working at the Pentagon\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -That requires experience\u2013",
      "REP TURNER: \u2013We need reform. We need reform. Someone has to be able to lead that, and that's going to be the debate in the Senate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I love when I ask Congresspeople, and they just keep reminding me that they don't sit in the Senate and don't want to comment. I sense some some uncertainty there on your part, but I don't want to put words in your mouth. I want to ask you though about what is ticking down in Congress right now, and that is something there's a scramble at the end of this year to get a bunch of work done. Your Democratic colleague in the Senate, Mark Warner, said \"it is an urgent priority to address cybersecurity gaps in these final weeks.\" Is it a priority for you to do something because of this massive breach by China, of U.S. Telecom?",
      "REP. TURNER: You know, one thing that's- it's very disappointing, and we've seen from this administration, this this malaise of this stasis of where they're unable to move as a result of the president unable to make a decision. Here we have this massive breach, this hack that has occurred from China, but we're hearing nothing from the president himself, no action from this administration as to what their- what consequences that will be. This is not- doesn't need just a technological fix. This needs also a diplomatic fix, a nation to nation, consequences to China\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013What would consequences look like?",
      "REP. TURNER: Now in the Obama administration, in the Obama administration, China hacked the personnel management system of the US government, and there were no consequences, and now we're seeing China hack the entire system of the nation. There needs to be consequences. They can be economic. They can be in a number of ways. But right now we have zero, we have nothing coming out of the administration. What need to be talking about is not technologically how do we fix this? But how do we address, which is what Donald Trump is doing, is coming in and saying China is our most, gravest threat. How do we address the fact that China is aggressively attacking the United States, and they're doing that in our telecom?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Question for the incoming administration to pick that up. Thank you, Chair Turner. \"Face the Nation\" will be back in a minute. Stay with us."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For some analysis on the events unfolding in the Middle East, we're joined now by Andrew Boyd, a CBS News contributor who previously held leadership positions at the CIA and once served in Damascus as a Foreign Service Officer, and Mouaz Moustafa, the Executive Director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force. Welcome back to \"Face the Nation.\" Mouaz, I want to start with you. You've been involved with the Syrian opposition for well over a decade. Help us understand what it means to see the regime fall.",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE SYRIAN EMERGENCY TASK FORCE: It's an indescribable feeling of- of happiness that- that this regime, this dictator who has made the worst crimes of the 21st century, alongside Russia, and Iran, and ISIS, all of these horrible people have been defeated by a coalition of rebel forces that did not need any support from any outside country, not Turkey, not Qatar, not anyone. This time around, Syria was liberated by its people, for its people. And it's truly inspiring. And it's not just good reverberations for Syria, for the Middle East and Europe as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a lot of uncertainty as to what this all means. Andy, you've watched this region very closely for some time. At this hour, none of the officials that I have spoken with in regional governments, in the U.S. government, seem to know where Bashar al-Assad even went. Does it matter where he went?",
      "ANDREW BOYD, FMR. CIA CENTER FOR CYBER INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR: Mouaz may differ on this one. I don't think it does, now that the government has fallen. I do think what unfolds over the next couple of weeks, and- and if the opposition actually treats all of the factions in Syria with dignity and respect and- and ensures their safety, we will have more understanding, because you know, there's a lot of atrocities that were carried out by the Assad regime. Those people are probably still in Syria, and so we'll see how that goes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A fair point, the people who worked within the regime are still there.",
      "BOYD: Syrian military intelligence, the mil- the other intelligence services, Syrian General Intelligence Directorate, I mean, have- have a lot of blood on their hands.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, and I know that you personally, Mouaz, were involved in smuggling out documented evidence of some of the torture, of the mass atrocities, the systematic, institutionalized violence that happened from some of those prisons. You brought it to Congress. You made it public. What do you think we can learn now, as those billing- buildings are being seized by rebels?",
      "MOUSTAFA: Well, the first thing that we are working really hard, and I can tell you all the rebel factions are working really hard to do, is find Austin Tice and hopefully bring him home, God willing, alive, to his family\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: An American journalist who once worked at CBS News for some time, a Marine veteran.",
      "MOUSTAFA: And he's a hero. He went to cover the plight of the Syrian people from what Assad, Iran, and Russia have been doing to them, and God willing, we bring him home alive, but we need to find him and bring him to his mom no- no matter what. And the Syrians owe him a debt forever. Also, other Americans that are undeclared. And freeing Syrians from- from prisons is something that's really important, but the collection of that intelligence as well as the Hezbollah, Iranian, Russian, Assad regime, any officials that have been arrested by the Syrian people, again, without any support of the international community or regional countries, who actually worked to try to save Assad, that is valuable, that's valuable to the United States. That's why we need to engage with this new, emerging government that God willing, is the path to democracy. The only Arab country in the world with the hope of being a democracy is Syria. That's incredible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That- that's a big promise to make.",
      "MOUSTAFA: It's not a promise, it's hope, that's realistic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Hope. Andy- but right now, the person we're seeing emerge\u2014we showed him, in Umayyad Mosque, hugely symbolic place to come and make a speech, in Damascus\u2014is this leader of a terrorist group, designated by the United States as a terrorist, $10 million bounty on his head.",
      "BOYD: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that signify to you?",
      "BOYD: Well, as Congressman Turner said, it's not going to be an easy process to un-designate Abu Muhammad al-Jawlani\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which means the U.S. can't talk to him.",
      "BOYD: The U.S. can't talk to him. I mean, you know, we can accommodate some sort of flexibility there, but he's not going to instantly come off the designation list. So, I mean, we'll see. I mean, you have said that- that he's going to respect all the factions, the Druze, the Christian, even the Shia and Alawi, who were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of 1000s of Syrians\u2014",
      "MOUSTAFA: I'm speaking by his actions, not by his words. Aleppo, et cetera. You could talk to the Bishop of Aleppo, but, yeah, absolutely.",
      "BOYD: Right, but, you know, time will tell. I mean, I'm a born skeptic, as a lot of my colleagues at the agency are. We will see.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead, Mouaz. Tell us who is in this- you talked about it as a coalition, not just HTS. Who are these people who now seem to be in control of Syria?",
      "MOUSTAFA: Sure. First of all, since the whole world is boiling down the whole Syrian revolution to one faction of a coalition, or let's say, even one person within a faction of that coalition, let's discuss that. Why was HTS put on the terrorist list? It was put on a terrorist list over an older version called Jabhat al-Nusra that had a loose affiliation with al-Qaeda, not the transnational or regional terrorist thing, but an inter-Islamist, whatever. I don't agree with any\u2014",
      "BOYD: But- but Mouaz, I think Margaret's talking also as a person Abu Muhammad al-Jawlani. I mean, he was in al-Qaeda in Iraq. He worked for Abu Musab Zarqawi. He spent several years in Bucca prison as a detainee, you know, so, we're also, we're talking HTS, Jabhat al-Nusra, but also him as a person. He's designated\u2014",
      "MOUSTAFA: Sure, let's talk about him as a person. But what's hilarious about this is, right now, as millions of Syrians come back from Europe and are ready to come back home, as people have not been displaced, and there has been zero reports of violations, and I was on the phone with the Bishop of Aleppo. The reason I was on the phone is that President Trump, and people in President Trump's camp were concerned about the Christians in Syria. Of course, there's so much focus on, you know, any time there's something- terrorists, terrorists. And- and what ended up happening is the Bishop of Aleppo said, Sir, first, it's the coalition of groups, including HTS, and we have had electricity more now than we have under the regime, and our only fear is Russian air strikes. So I'm glad that President Trump still- told Russia what it should do: get out of Syria, and it has done so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will be watching to see whether that continues to be the case and what transpires. And what it means for the\u2014",
      "MOUSTAFA: One- one last thing, Margaret, it's really important\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mouaz, I have to go. I'm so sorry.",
      "MOUSTAFA: But al-Qaeda in Syria [UNINTEL], it's the affiliate, and HTS has defeated it and defeated ISIS. The old designation is kind of irrelevant.",

It's a conflict that former and soon-to-be-President again Donald Trump is familiar with.

      "Dictator Bashar al-Assad appears to have fled the country. And we are reminded this morning of the horrors from his reign of terror. His brutal suppression of anti-regime protests in 2011 sparked the world's largest refugee crisis. Since then, the mass atrocities became too numerous to detail, the death toll impossible to tally, including due to the regime's use of chemical weapons against civilians.",

      "The rebel forces say they have now \u2013 quote \u2013 \"fully liberated\" a number of major cities. And they have also emptied prisons filled with those who dared to stand up against Assad's rule during the country's nearly-14-year civil war, a war that, up until now, had seemed frozen, even forgotten.",
      "But as the statues and monuments to the Assad dynasty continue to be pulled to the ground, the family's blood-soaked half-century of authoritarian rule passed from father to son is now over. Ten years ago, at the height of the civil war, which was born out of the Arab Spring uprisings\u2026",
      "(MAN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)",
      "IMTIAZ TYAB: \u2026 Assad was then just barely clinging to power. But Russia and Iran, along with Lebanon's powerful Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia, came to his rescue and tipped the war firmly in his favor through a punishing campaign of well-documented war crimes, including indiscriminate airstrikes and chemical weapons attacks, a brutality against his own people that's hard to fathom.",
      "But Russia is now preoccupied with its war in Ukraine. Hezbollah's leadership has been decapitated after a year of bitter fighting with Israel. And Iran along with its other proxies have also been degraded by Israeli strikes.",
      "Assad's 24-year rule looks unlikely to be rescued or resurrected, ushering a new, but deeply uncertain era for Syria.",

      "IMTIAZ TYAB: And a key leader of Syria's armed opposition, Abu Mohammad al-Golani, who belongs to a group known as Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, which used to be aligned with al Qaeda, has forbid anyone to go near the buildings housing Syria's state institutions, signaling the rebels want to support a peaceful transition of power.",
      "But the power vacuum left by Bashar al-Assad is enormous, Margaret. And the fear is, these groups could soon turn on each other and begin a new, perhaps even darker chapter in this already ugly civil war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's Imtiaz Tyab reporting from the Turkish-Syrian border.",
      "And we're joined now by the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Ohio Congressman Mike Turner.",
      "Just a stunning turn of events within such a short period of time. The U.S. doesn't have a diplomatic presence inside of Syria. Our visibility is a little limited here. What is it that you think Americans need to know about this turn of events?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER (R-Ohio): Well, Margaret, that was an excellent report, because you certainly laid the groundwork of this has been an incredibly brutal civil war with hundreds of thousands of people dying, including the use of chemical weapons, and, of course, reminding people that the Obama administration had said this would be a red line, that we would use military force to stop the use of chemical weapons, then failing to do so.",
      "This is a \u2013 an Islamic militia that has risen up and has continued and now is successfully toppling the Assad regime. As your report indicated, it's al Qaeda in its origins, but it opposes ISIS. It is Turkish-backed.",
      "This is a blow to Iran, a blow to Russia. We're seeing what is likely a disintegration in \u2013 in Syria. The big questions will be, what does this mean for the U.S.? What does it mean for Iran, Russia, the neighbors of Israel and Jordan, which are strong allies of the United States?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you mentioned there and we showed the picture of Abu Mohammad al-Golani. He is the leader of Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, people call HTS. You're going to hear a lot about that in the coming days and weeks, the rebel group that appears to be taking control.",
      "But they are working also with the prime minister. The United States government has a ten million bounty on the head of Jolani. Do you think the United States still should keep that? Should Americans be concerned that this will mean something in terms of impact for terror threats to the United States?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, this is a terrorist organization and group, but this is not going to be just a passing of power and authority. It could be. We'll have to, obviously, watch that.",
      "You know, one of the things that we do see here, though, is, this is a diplomatic failure with respect to the United States and Turkey. You know, the U.S. has troops in Syria. This is on the border of Turkey. Turkey is a NATO ally. The United States is working with the Kurds. This really could have been an opportunity for the United States to work to try to resolve the issue between the Kurds, Turkey and the United States and working with Turkish interests in Syria.",
      "Hopefully, this could be an opportunity where there could be a diplomatic support there that hopefully could have \u2013 you know, help in this transition in Syria.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are 900 U.S. troops in Syria in the South.",
      "Donald Trump in 2019 pulled U.S. troops out of Northern Syria, abandoning our allies there. Do you believe he will stand by the 900 U.S. troops that remain there, or should he consider pulling them out when he takes office?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I think, you know, one of the things that Donald Trump will make clear is, is that any threat to U.S. troops will be unbelievably responded to.",
      "So, everyone should understand, absolutely, that the United States troops are to be secure. The second thing is, is, he does absolutely support the Kurds and that he's going to look for a diplomatic solution. I think there will be an assessment as to whether or not those troops should remain.",
      "But it's \u2013 you know, I think, here, there is an opportunity for the parties, especially now that Iran and Russia's roles are going to be diminished \u2013 diminished. They have been brutal in their support with Assad, the hundreds of thousands of people, including use of chemical weapons, that have been killed have been under the Russian influence there.",
      "Russia still has two bases, a naval and air force base there, that are going to be, you know, both at risk for Russia, but also a risk to the population of Syria, because they could \u2013 they have been used before to attack the Syrian population.",
      "We'll have to see what Russia does there. But this is going to be an area that's going to be highly volatile and in transition.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And no idea where Bashar al-Assad might have fled to?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: No, not at this time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, since we're talking about the incoming administration.",
      "Donald Trump has chosen Tulsi Gabbard, the former congresswoman, a former Democrat, now Republican, to be the director of national intelligence, overseeing 18 intelligence agencies.",
      "She not only went and met with Assad. She publicly doubted high-confidence assessments by U.S. intelligence that he did what we showed you pictures of him doing, using chemical weapons there.",
      "Do you trust that she could actually represent the intelligence community, lead it and be trusted to brief the commander in chief?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I obviously differ in a great deal in a number of areas with both her judgment and \u2013 and her background and experience.",
      "But what I do trust is the\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're smiling when you're saying this.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: \u2026 is the Senate \u2013 is the Senate's process.",
      "And I think the \u2013 the senators are going to put her through a process. She has been nominated. She will go through the process, and I think there will be significant debate and evaluation. I think\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think she'll be confirmed?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: \u2026 that Donald Trump has put together in his last term, and I think he will in this term, a great national security team.",
      "I think CIA Director Ratcliffe, I think Mike Waltz as national security director\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: \u2026 are both great examples of people who are going to be foundational.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: And I think you're going to see a great national security team.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is a community that you also have oversight of. So you may not vote in the Senate, but it sounds like she doesn't have your confidence.",
      "What about Pete Hegseth to run the Pentagon at a time of global instability?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Yes, I think \u2013 I think the chairman of the Armed Services in the Senate has made a great statement. He said, we certainly support the process, and he has his support going through the process, and we'll have to see how that goes through.",
      "One thing that is absolutely clear is that the Pentagon needs reform. We are not keeping pace with what Russia and China are doing in advanced weapon systems.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: At the same time, we're seeing the weapon systems of advanced technology that are being utilized on the battlefield of Ukraine, and our acquisition systems and our accounting systems, our spending systems are not working at the Pentagon.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That requires experience.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: We need reform. We need reform. Someone has to be able to lead that, and that's going to be the debate in the Senate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I love when I ask congresspeople, and they just keep reminding me that they don't sit in the Senate and don't want to comment. I sense some \u2013 some uncertainty there on your part, but I don't want to put words in your mouth.",
      "I want to ask you, though, about what is ticking down in Congress right now. And that is something \u2013 there's a scramble at the end of this year to get a bunch of work done.",
      "Your Democratic colleague in the Senate Mark Warner, said: \"It is an urgent priority to address cybersecurity gaps in these final weeks.\"",
      "Is it a priority for you to do something because of this massive breach by China of U.S. telecom?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: You know, one thing that's \u2013 that's very disappointing and we've seen from this administration, this malaise of \u2013 or this stasis of where they're unable to move as a result of the president unable to make a decision.",
      "Here, we have this massive breach, this hack that has occurred from China, but we're hearing nothing from the president himself, no action from this administration as to what their \u2013 what consequences there will be.",
      "This is not \u2013 doesn't need just a technological fix. This needs also a diplomatic fix, a nation-to-nation consequences to China. You know, in the Obama administration\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What would consequences look like?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: In the Obama administration, China hacked the personnel management system of the U.S. government, and there were no consequences. And now we're seeing China hack the entire system of the nation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: There needs to be consequences. They can be economic. They can be in a number of ways.",
      "But, right now, we have zero. We have nothing coming out of the administration. What need \u2013 we need to be talking about is not, technologically, how do we fix this\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: \u2026 but how do we address \u2013 which is what Donald Trump is doing, is coming in and saying, China is our most \u2013 gravest threat. How do we address the fact that China is aggressively attacking the United States? And they're doing that in our telecom.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Question for the incoming administration to pick that up.",
      "Thank you, Chair Turner.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For some analysis on the events unfolding in the Middle East, we're joined now by Andrew Boyd, a CBS News contributor who previously held leadership positions at the CIA and once served in Damascus as a Foreign Service officer, and Mouaz Moustafa, the executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force.",
      "Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "Mouaz, I want to start with you.",
      "You have been involved with the Syrian opposition for well over a decade. Help us understand what it means to see the regime fall.",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA (Executive Director, Syrian Emergency Task Force): It's an indescribable feeling of happiness that this regime, this dictator who has made the worst crimes of the 21st century, alongside Russia and Iran and ISIS, all of these horrible people have been defeated by a coalition of rebel forces that did not need any support from any outside country, not Turkey, not Qatar, not anyone.",
      "This time around, Syria was liberated by its people for its people. And it's truly inspiring. And it's not just good reverberations for Syria, for the Middle East and Europe as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there's a lot of uncertainty as to what this all means.",
      "Andy, you have watched this region very closely for some time. At this hour, none of the officials that I have spoken with in regional governments, in the U.S. government seem to know where Bashar al-Assad even went. Does it matter where he went?",
      "ANDREW BOYD: Mouaz may differ on this one. I don't think it does now that the government has fallen.",
      "I do think what unfolds over the next couple of weeks and, if the opposition actually treats all of the factions in Syria with dignity and respect and ensures their safety, we will have more understanding, because there's a lot of atrocities that were carried out by the Assad regime.",
      "Those people are probably still in Syria. And so we will see how that goes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A fair point. The people who worked within the regime, they're still there?",
      "ANDREW BOYD: The Syrian military intelligence, the military \u2013 the other intelligence services, Syrian General Intelligence Directorate, I mean, have a lot of blood on their hands. So\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "And I know that you personally, Mouaz, were involved in smuggling out documented evidence of some of the torture, of the mass atrocities, the systematic, institutionalized violence that happened from some of those prisons. You brought it to Congress. You made it public.",
      "What do you think we can learn now as those billing \u2013 buildings are being seized by rebels?",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA: Well, the first thing that we are working really hard, and I can tell you all the rebel factions are working really hard to do, is find Austin Tice and hopefully bring him home, God willing, now back to this family.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: An American journalist who once worked at CBS News for some time, a Marine veteran.",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA: And he's a hero.",
      "He went to cover the plight of the Syrian people from what Assad, Iran and Russia have been doing to them. And, God willing, we bring him home alive. But we need to find him and bring him to his mom, no matter what. And the Syrians owe him a debt forever.",
      "And, also, other Americans that are undeclared, and freeing Syrians from prisons is something that's really important. But the collection of that intelligence, as well as the Hezbollah, Iranian, Russian, Assad regime, any officials that have been arrested by the Syrian people, again, without any support of the international community or regional countries, who actually worked to try to save Assad, that is valuable.",
      "That's valuable to the United States. That's why we need to engage with this new emerging government that, God willing, is the path to democracy. The only Arab country in the world\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA: \u2026 with the hope of being a democracy is Syria. That's incredible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a big promise to make.",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA: It's not a promise. It's hope that's realistic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or hope. Hope.",
      "Andy, but the \u2013 right now, the person we're seeing emerge, we showed him in Umayyad Mosque\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 hugely symbolic place to come and make a speech in Damascus, is this leader of a terrorist group designated, by the United States as a terrorist\u2026",
      "ANDREW BOYD: Correct. Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 $10 million bounty on his head.",
      "ANDREW BOYD: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that signify to you?",
      "ANDREW BOYD: Well, as Congressman Turner said, it's not going to be an easy process to undesignate Abu Mohammad al-Jolani.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You \u2013 which means the U.S. can't talk to him.",
      "ANDREW BOYD: The U.S. can't talk to him.",
      "I mean, we can accommodate some sort of flexibility there, but he's not going to instantly come off the designation list. So, I mean, we will see. I mean, you have said that \u2013 that he's going to respect all the factions, the Druze, the Christian, even the Shia and Alawi, who are responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Syrians.",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA: I'm speaking by his actions, not by his words.",
      "ANDREW BOYD: Right.",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA: Well, Aleppo, et cetera \u2013 you could talk to the bishop of Aleppo, but, yes, absolutely.",
      "ANDREW BOYD: But \u2013 but time will tell. I mean, I'm a born skeptic, as a lot of my colleagues at the agency are. We will see.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead, Mouaz.",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tell us who is in this. You talked about it as a coalition, not just HTS. Who are these people who now seem to be in control of Syria?",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA: Sure.",
      "First of all, since the whole world is boiling down the whole Syrian revolution to one faction of a coalition, or, let's say, even one person within a faction of that coalition, let's discuss that.",
      "Why was HTS put on the terrorist list? It was put on a terrorist list over an older version called Jabhat al-Nusra that had a loose affiliation with al Qaeda\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA: \u2026 not a transnational or regional terrorist thing, but an inter-Islamist whatever.",
      "I don't agree with any\u2026",
      "ANDREW BOYD: But, Mouaz, I think Margaret's talking also as a person, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani. I mean, he was in al Qaeda in Iraq. He worked for Abu Musab al Zarqawi. He spent several years in Bucca prison as a detainee.",
      "So we're also \u2013 we're talking HTS, Jabhat al-Nusra, but also him as a person. He's designated\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA: Sure, let's talk about him as a person.",
      "But what's hilarious about this is, right now, as millions of Syrians come back from Europe and are ready to come back home, as people have not been displaced and there has been zero reports of violations \u2013 and I was on the phone with the bishop of Aleppo.",
      "The reason I was on the phone is that President Trump and people in President Trump's camp were concerned about the Christians in Syria. Of course, there's so much focus on \u2013 any time there's something, terrorist, terrorist.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA: And what ended up happening is, the bishop of Aleppo said, sir, first, it's the coalition of groups, including HTS.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA: And we have had electricity more now than we have under the regime, and our only fear is Russian airstrikes.",
      "So I'm glad that President Trump still \u2013 still\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

      "And there were some heroic ones, but there were also a lot of examples of people that knew that something was wrong and they didn't say anything.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY (R-Pennsylvania): Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why didn't anyone say anything? Were they unaware of vulnerabilities, or is there a culture of silence, where people speaking up get smacked down for doing so?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: That's \u2013 that is my concern, is that there's a culture of silence and that individual officers and agents are not empowered to say something is wrong.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Kelly, on that point, I mean, some of this sounds like management 101, that this is not specific to the Secret Service. A lot of organizations have problems like what you just highlighted there.",
      "Acting Director Rowe testified Thursday he thinks the Secret Service needs to identify leaders earlier on and promote them based on ability, not just hours logged on the clock.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: But isn't that true of everything in life?",
      "When you look at this, when people talk about, we need better leadership than that, I was on those grounds the night before. They weren't set up at that point. They were going to work through the night to get it ready. And then you find out afterwards that there was no coordination, there was no team meeting, there was no, well, this is going to be your responsibility to know where you're supposed to be and what time you're supposed to be there.",
      "You bring local law enforcement in, but you don't \u2013 you don't include them in the planning. Or, when you do the \u2013 the interviews afterwards, well, I thought he was going to do it. No, we thought somebody else was going to do it.",
      "When you knew there was a suspicious person on the grounds \u2013 and this is a common \u2013 going back and forth now. This is where they said they weren't communicating with each other. You can't tell me that you didn't know until 10 minutes after 6:00 that you couldn't communicate. At 11 minutes after 6:00, the shooter took action.",
      "They knew an hour-and-a-half ahead of time. Out of all the thousands of the people walking around on that ter \u2013 on that property, there was a suspicious person, and they kept losing sight of him.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Because they failed from the first thing, from the picking of the site, preparing the site, to the coordination of the site, to the ability to communicate.",
      "At every step of the way, they failed. And the question is, why didn't you just say, hold up, just hold up, don't let him come out?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, when the acting director says on Thursday of this week, we need to pick better leaders, that would suggest that the agency today does not necessarily have the leaders it needs to fix\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Oh.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 all the things you just laid out.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Yes.",
      "And I think, by saying what he said, that's what he meant. They don't have the leadership they need. When they morphed them into Homeland Security back in 2001, 2 \u2013 whenever it was, they took away their identity and their exclusivity. When you're the best of the best, when you're the elite of the elites\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: \u2026 if you lose that, then all of a sudden you just become part of a team.",
      "There was a huge mistake back when Homeland came into existence. That's not a criticism, because they did what they had to do back then. But I'm telling you, on July 13, there was a lack of professionalism, there was a lack of concern, there was a lack of coordination.",
      "And the ability to communicate is the one thing I will never understand. You knew you couldn't talk to each other. Why did you go forward?",

      "But there is a systematic problem here. The structure, the personnel, the staffing of the Secret Service, hasn't changed in years, at the same time as we are now asking them to do things that they didn't do a decade ago.",
      "And they are \u2013 they are fulfilling an operational tempo that requires them to be deployed\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 three weeks out of a month, constantly doing events, skipping firearms training, skipping leadership development training. We are not developing their skills and their training. And I think you see the results of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you made three dozen recommendations in this report on what to change, including to reduce the number of protectees.",
      "Right now, Secret Service protects not only presidential leadership, their immediate families, their spouses, their children, candidates, and anyone really the president designates. Should all of that continue?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: We've increased the size of protectees that are out there, including foreign assets that come here and people that bring \u2013 bring their families and things. So that's gotten so big.",
      "But, if you look at Homeland, I think \u2013 I think, when you look at Secret Service, it's about 3 percent of their overall spend. The biggest spend is on FEMA. And, now, we don't want to change anything like that.",
      "But you can't have an exclusive without funding them to the level that they need to be funded, not only in manpower and in training, but in the assets that they have to have available to them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: You always have to ask yourself, what are your missions and what is the thing that only you can do? Like, what is that no- fail mission?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: In this case, with the Secret Service, that no- fail mission is to protect our highest-level candidates and our highest- level elected officials, period.",
      "All the other things, investigation of financial crimes, training and support, these are all secondary missions. So, if you're not actually adequately performing any of those missions to standard, and if you have reached a breaking point, then it's time to assess, what are those missions that need to fall off and to be transitioned elsewhere?",

      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, with the fact that you couldn't find out more about the shooter, both in Butler and in \u2013 the potential shooter in Mar-a- Lago.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes.",
      "That's actually a really important element to the story. And people have rightful questions about it. I have questions about it. And that is, why did the shooter do this?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: What drove him to do it? Was he a lone wolf shooter? Did he have associates or affiliates? What was his motivation? How was he radicalized?",
      "We endeavored to get answers to those questions. We submitted numerous requests to the Department of Justice and FBI. Their response is, this is an ongoing criminal investigation, and we can't give that information to Congress.",
      "That, in my view, is an unacceptable position. And here's why.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For both Butler and Mar-a-Lago, that was the answer?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Correct. That's right.",
      "And here's why that's unacceptable. I sit on the Intelligence Committee. I have sat on the Armed Services Committee. And Congress all the time gets access to our nation's most sensitive secrets, ongoing operations, intelligence operations, military operations.",
      "So you can't tell me that there isn't a way to put us into a secure facility and get us information about an ongoing criminal investigation, when I regularly am receiving briefs on what our \u2013 our spies and our military special operators are doing regularly around the world.",
      "So, none of this stands to reason. And we have dedicated ourselves to continue to get those answers. And if the FBI and DOJ thinks that they can wait us out and stonewall us, they are wrong.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You think they're intentionally withholding information?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: I don't know what their intention is. I mean, I'm not a mind reader. But, you know, I have been around Congress long enough to know what \u2013 what\u2026",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: When you get stonewalled. Yes. Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: When you get stonewalled.",
      "I mean, listen, this is \u2013 this is not uncommon\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: No.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 when you're dealing with agencies and departments. It's a pretty regular method. And it's something that, you know, we encounter all the time in our oversight responsibilities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we don't know, or tell me if perhaps you know answer to this.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes, we're \u2013 we're in\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was there a foreign nexus? Do we know, yes or no?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Americans are deluged with misinformation and disinformation that's coming from a variety of sources.",
      "And conspiracy theories sometimes take root when there's a lack of information or there's conflicting information. So our job is to try to get information out there, to be transparent, to be accessible, to tell the real story.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: And that's why this is important. This element of that story is important, because there's a lot of conspiracies around\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Absolutely.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 these shootings, right? And we take that seriously.",
      "And we want to \u2013 we want to, you know, rebuff those. But, you know, in this case \u2013 and I sit on a lot of other committees with access to information \u2013 I have seen no evidence that a state actor, an adversary was responsible for either of these attempted assassination attempts. I have seen no evidence.",
      "But, you know, when you're in a position where, you know, the government says, well, it's not this, but we won't tell you what it is, right, and \u2013 and we can't tell you \u2013 we can't tell you definitively, well, you know, people respond and have questions about that.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: And I understand that mentality. So, even though we don't have evidence of one thing, people still want to know what else it is. And I still want to know what else it is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did he act alone? Do we know that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: We don't know that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or Congress doesn't know that.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Yes.",
      "And, you know, it's one thing to say \u2013 and I'm going to be really clear about this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Because this is very, very sensitive territory\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Because we want to make sure we're not\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 getting people spun up unnecessarily.",
      "There is no evidence of \u2013 from other sources, you know, internal government sources, from our investigation, that others were involved, that he acted with others, and that a foreign state or adversary was involved in this.",
      "But that still raises the question of, why did he do this?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Was just \u2013 was he just a disturbed young man who decided to take action alone? Probably. I mean, that's probably the answer.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: That's what it looks like now, yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Right?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: That's what it looks like. But we need to know, right? And let's get the information out there that the government has to make sure that we can settle this. And that's \u2013 that's our obligation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the agency today able to do its job, if they weren't able to do it in July?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: We were tasked with trying to find out what happened that day, why it happened that day, and to \u2013 and to the best of our ability make sure that the Secret Service, that doesn't happen again to them.",
      "We can't guarantee that these things won't happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Because it's a crazy world right now. But there was too much ahead of time that we did know that we didn't share.",
      "I would never let my child play near a road. And when you do, you put people in jeopardy of that and you know there's a danger there. Don't let it happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there anything that you feel important to raise that we didn't talk about?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: We never identified as Republicans and Democrats. We \u2013 we defined as a task force to find out what happened that day.",
      "And the whole \u2013 the whole goal from day one is to restore the faith and trust and confidence that the American people must have in this agency. At this point, it's probably at the lowest ebb it's ever been.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: And the other thing is, I think we realize that threats are 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. You can't take a day off. You can't take a play off. You've got to be ready every single moment for anything that could possibly happen.",
      "Is that a difficult task? Yes. Is it almost impossible? Yes, there's a lot of bad actors out there. But you know what's not impossible? Our dedication to the fact that we're going to do the best we can do every single day to ensure that the American people have the faith and trust and confidence they must have in us.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: This is a tough place to work.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Oh.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: And there are \u2013 frankly, there are some people here that don't belong here, that I think are just here to get attention, to get, you know, clicks on social media, that aren't here to legislate.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: But this has been one of the best experiences of my time in Congress. And I couldn't have asked for a better partner than Mike Kelly.",
      "You know, and he's a very conservative Republican, and I'm a Democrat. We're both proud of that.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: We're proud of our politics. And\u2026",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: We are.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: And we represent our districts, right?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Yes. Yes. We do. We do.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: That's actually \u2013 that's actually the job, right?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: We represent the culture and the politics and the hopes and dreams of our districts. And that's what's so \u2013 so beautiful about this place when it works well.",
      "But this process \u2013 and I think this is really important for Americans to understand \u2013 this process was serious. It was bipartisan. It was \u2013 it was deep. And we did the job that we were asked to do.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A panel of federal judges in D.C. last week upheld a new law that could effectively ban the popular social media app TikTok by mid- January if its Chinese owners do not sell it to a new buyer.",
      "Frank McCourt, the executive chairman of McCourt Global and founder of Project Liberty, is one of the potential buyers, and he joins us now.",
      "Good to see you here.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT (Executive Chairman, McCourt Global): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, TikTok says, well, they might go to the Supreme Court on this one. If they don't, their parent company, ByteDance, has said they're not interested in selling.",
      "Do you have any indication that they will and that the incoming Trump administration would support someone like you buying it?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Well, yes, I think where we are now, Margaret, is, there's three options.",
      "You know, one is an appeal. Our lawyers tell us there's very little chance of a successful appeal by ByteDance, strong bipartisan legislation, a 3-0 by the three \u2013 you know, by the appellate court.",
      "So now that leaves us with two, a ban or a sale. We don't want to see it banned. I would add that President \u2013 president-elect Trump has also said he doesn't want to see it banned. So now let's talk about the sale.",
      "So we've been working for the last eight months on the assumption that the legislation would be upheld and that there would be a sale.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: So, that's where we are right now. And we're working very, very hard to be in a position to buy the U.S. portion of TikTok\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: \u2026 so it's not shut down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what is that worth to you? There are estimates it could be as high as $200 billion in worth.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Two hundred billion dollars would be more \u2013 more in the range of what the entirety of the platform is worth, not just the U.S. piece.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: And let's be clear. The Chinese government has said they're not selling the algorithm. They view that as I.P. of the country.",
      "So, Tik \u2013 U.S. TikTok is a piece of ByteDance. If it's sold, it will be sold without an algorithm. So the value will be far, far less than 200 \u2013 $200 billion. We have circled over $20 billion to be in a position, and we're very serious about raising whatever capital is required to buy the platform.",
      "And \u2013 and, to be clear\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: \u2026 we're looking to move the 170 million users over to a new protocol, where the individuals will own and control their identity and their data. We're not looking to replicate the existing version.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, let's talk about that.",
      "As you said, 170 million Americans use TikTok, especially young people. U.S. law prohibits foreign control of mass media, but this social media space is kind of a loophole here. There aren't a lot of governing rules in this space.",
      "Do you think Congress needs to write new rules of the role \u2013 of the road to ban foreign ownership and to put restrictions on even owners like you?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: I think we need to upgrade our regulations and our policies. There's no doubt about that.",
      "But, far more importantly, we need to fix the technology. The Internet is broken, fundamentally broken. We heard your guest earlier Representative Turner talk about the threat from China on our telecom hack, massive hack, massive threat to Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they're still in the telecom system, according to U.S. intelligence.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Absolutely.",
      "And we heard your recent guests, Representatives Kelly and Crow, talk about the deluge of misinformation and disinformation, the fact that it's a very dangerous world right now.",
      "The reason why the Congress moved so quickly with TikTok to pass the legislation is because it is a national security threat to Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: And the reason why the judges upheld it is for that same reason.",
      "So let's turn a problem into a solution by taking advantage of this moment, move the 170 million users over to a new protocol where individuals are respected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have an indication from president-elect Trump that he wants to see an American entity buy this? Because he would also have some influence in the outcome.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Of course, as president-elect, he'll have massive influence. But\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you spoken to him?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: But \u2013 but President \u2013 President Trump is a dealmaker. We know that. I'm a dealmaker, OK? I have been doing business deals my entire \u2013 my entire life.",
      "Let's make a deal where everybody wins, where China's able to sell the U.S. portion of TikTok, where American citizens are protected, and where there's \u2013 and 170 million users continue to enjoy the platform. So he has said he doesn't want it banned, which means a sale.",
      "And the legislation and the \u2013 the appellate decision require that this platform be \u2013 be owned by Americans. We have built a clean, bottom-up American stack to move this user base over, where there will be no Chinese backdoors and no ability to \u2013 to take advantage of American citizens.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You \u2013 you're indicating you've built out some technology, you think, that will not allow for government surveillance?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But can you, if you are \u2013 whoever owns this is going to be powerful, if you get 170 million Americans on a platform, particularly young people, to consume the information on this system.",
      "So what guarantees do you make? Because Facebook and Twitter, they also harvest information about consumers. Would you?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Yes, well, that's exactly what we don't want to do.",
      "So the reason why we want to move people to a new stack where you can't harvest without permission, so individuals will own and control their identity and their data, permission its use, will actually have an Internet that respects people, as opposed to exploits them.",
      "Imagine empowering people. And, to be clear, Margaret, I'm not looking to be the CEO of TikTok. We call it the people's bid, because we want this to empower people and to stop this nonsense where we're exploiting people by scraping their data and taking advantage of them, and, in the case of TikTok, actually creating a national security threat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Elon Musk, who owns X, formerly known as Twitter, now has raised concerns about content moderation restricting free speech. Do you share that concern, and what restrictions would you put on paid political advertising?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: I mentioned earlier that we need better policies, for sure, but we need better tech.",
      "Right now, we have a tech stack that's built, and these giant apps scrape our data and exploit it. Why not flip the power? Why not actually give people their data back?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",

    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 15:21:06 -0500",
    "summary": "The task force is wrapping up its work probing security failures surrounding the July 13 and Sept. 15 assassination attempts.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado, the top Democrat on the bipartisan House task force investigating the assassination attempts against President-elect Donald Trump, said he's concerned that \"there's a culture of silence\" at the Secret Service that prevents agents from speaking out when they should.",
      "\"I was struck by the stories in the recount of the specific actions of officers and agents on the ground that day,\" Crow said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"There were some heroic ones, but there were also a lot of examples of people that knew that something was wrong and they didn't say anything.\"",
      "The task force, which the House voted to establish earlier this year, in recent days wrapped up its work probing security failures surrounding the July 13 assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, and the Sept. 15 foiled attempt in West Palm Beach, Florida. In the wake of the initial attack, the Secret Service came under intense scrutiny, leading to the resignation of its director.",
      "Last week, Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe testified before the panel in its final hearing, where he acknowledged the Secret Service's failure to adequately secure the area in Butler, noted \"critical gaps\" within the agency's operations and said \"we did not meet the expectations of the American public, Congress, and our protectees.\" He noted that it has been his \"singular focus to bring much-needed reform to the Secret Service.",
      "He added that the agency is \"operating in a heightened threat environment, with expanding protection requirements.\"",
      "\"The responsibilities of the Secret Service are critical to the national security of the United States,\" Rowe said, adding that \"our agency is not defined by one failure, but by our ability to learn from mistakes.\"",
      "Task force chairman Rep. Mike Kelly, a Pennsylvania Republican whose district includes Butler, said the agency lacks the leadership it needs. And he argued that when the Secret Service was brought under the umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security, \"they took away their identity \u2014 their exclusivity.\"",
      "\"When you're the best of the best, when you're the elite of the elites, if you lose that, then all of a sudden you just become part of a team,\" Kelly said on \"Face the Nation.\" \"That was a huge mistake.\"",
      "On the July 13 attack, Kelly said the Secret Service failed \"at every step of the way.\"",
      "\"They failed from the first thing, from the picking of the site, the preparing the site to the coordination of the site, the ability to communicate,\" Kelly said, adding that there was no team meeting before the event, and local law enforcement wasn't included in the planning.",
      "\"On July 13, there was a lack of professionalism, there was a lack of concern, there was a lack of coordination, and the ability to communicate is the one thing I'll never understand,\" Kelly said. \"You knew you couldn't talk to each other. Why did you go forward?\"",
      "Crow said important questions remain about the shooter in Butler and would-be shooter in West Palm Beach, saying that the task force submitted numerous requests to the Justice Department and FBI about their motivations. Crow claimed that the requests have been denied because the criminal investigations are ongoing, calling it an \"unacceptable position\" and accused the agencies of trying to \"stonewall\" Congress on the issue.",
      "The Colorado Democrat argued that when it comes to the Secret Service, there is a \"systematic problem here.\" He noted that although there are \"plenty of extraordinary agents and officers\" in the Secret Service, there was a \"failure of mission\" in Butler.",
      "\"The structure, the personnel, the staffing of the Secret Service hasn't changed in years, at the same time as we are now asking them to do things that they didn't do a decade ago,\" Crow said, saying the tempo of the job leaves agents without time for adequate training. \"We are not developing their skills and their training, and I think you see the results of that.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Kelly said the task force has been working since Day One to try to help restore trust and confidence in the Secret Service, which he said was likely at \"the lowest ebb\" in its history. And he acknowledged the relentless pressure on the Secret Service.",
      "\"You've got to be ready every single moment for anything that could possibly happen. Is that a difficult task? Yes, is it almost impossible?\" Kelly said. \"But you know what's not impossible, our dedication to the fact that we're going to do the best we can do every single day to ensure that the American people have the faith and trust and confidence they must have in us.\"",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with business executive Frank McCourt on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 8, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A panel of federal judges in DC last week upheld a new law that could effectively ban the popular social media app TikTok by mid-January if its Chinese owners do not sell it to a new buyer. Frank McCourt, the Executive Chairman of McCourt Global, and founder of Project Liberty, is one of the potential buyers, and he joins us now. Good to see you here.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So TikTok says, well, they might go to the Supreme Court on this one. If they don't, their parent company, ByteDance, has said they're not interested in selling. Do you have any indication that they will and that the incoming Trump administration would support someone like you buying it?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Well yeah, I think where we are now, Margaret, is, there's three options. You know, one is an appeal. Our lawyers tell us there's very little chance of a successful appeal by Bytedance, strong bipartisan legislation, a three to zero vote by the three by the appellate court. So now that leaves us with two, a ban or a sale. We don't want to see it banned. I'd add that President- President-elect Trump, has also said he doesn't want to see it banned. So now let's talk about the sale. So we've been working for the last eight months on the assumption that the legislation would be upheld and that there would be a sale. So that's where we are right now, and we're working very, very hard to be in a position to buy the US portion of TikTok so it's not shut down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So what is that worth to you? There are estimates it could be as high as $200 billion in worth.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT:\u00a0 $200 billion would be more more in the range of what the entirety of the platform is worth, not just the US piece. And let's be clear, the Chinese government has said they're not selling the algorithm. They view that as IP of the country. So US Tiktok is a piece of bytedance. If it's sold, it will be sold without an algorithm. So the value will be far, far less than 200- $200 billion. We have circled over $20 billion to be in a position, and we're very serious about raising whatever capital is required to buy the platform and and to be clear, yeah, we're looking to move the 170 million users over to a new protocol where the individuals will own and control their identity and their data. We're not looking to replicate the existing version.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So let's talk about that. As you said, 170 million Americans use TikTok, especially young people. US law prohibits foreign control of mass media, but this social media space is kind of a loophole here. There aren't a lot of governing rules in this space. Do you think Congress needs to write new rules of the role- of the road to ban foreign ownership and to put restrictions on even owners like you?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: I think we need to upgrade our regulations and our policies. There's no doubt about that. But far more importantly, we need to fix the technology. The internet is broken, fundamentally broken. We heard your guest earlier, Representative Turner, talk about the threat from China on our telecom hack, massive hack, massive threat to Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they're still in the telecom system.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Absolutely. And we heard your recent guests, Representatives Kelly and Crow, talk about the deluge of misinformation and disinformation, the fact that it's a very dangerous world right now. The reason why the Congress moves so quickly with TikTok to pass the legislation is because it is a national security threat to Americans, and the reason why the judges upheld it is for that same reason. So let's turn a problem into a solution by taking advantage of this moment, move the 100 and 70 million users over to a new protocol where individuals are respected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have an indication from President elect Trump that he wants to see an American entity buy this? Because he would also have some influence in the outcome.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Of course, as president elect he'll have massive influence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you spoken to him?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: But President Trump is a deal maker. We know that. I'm a deal-maker. Okay? I've been doing business deals my entire- my entire life. Let's make a deal where everybody wins, where China's able to sell the US portion of TikTok, where American citizens are protected, and where there's- and 170 million users continue to enjoy the platform. So he has said he doesn't want it banned, which means a sale. And the legislation and the- the appellate decision require that this platform be- be owned by Americans. We have built a clean, bottom-up American stack to move this user base over, where there'll be no Chinese back doors and no ability to to take advantage of American citizens.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're indicating you've built out some technology you think that will not allow for government surveillance.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But can you, if you are- whoever owns this is going to be powerful if you get 170 million Americans on a platform, particularly young people, to consume the information on this. System. So what guarantees do you make? Because Facebook and Twitter, they also harvest information about consumers. Would you?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Yeah, well, that's exactly what we don't want to do. So the reason why we want to move people to a new stack where you can't harvest without permission, so individuals will own and control their identity and their data permission its use, will actually have an internet that respects people as opposed to exploits them. Imagine empowering people. And to be clear, Margaret, I'm not looking to be the CEO of TikTok. We call it the people's bid, because we want this to empower people and to stop this nonsense where we're exploiting people by scraping their data and taking advantage of them, and in the case of Tiktok, actually creating a national security threat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Elon Musk, who owns X, formerly known as Twitter, now has raised concerns about content moderation, restricting free speech. Do you share that concern, and what restrictions would you put on paid political ads?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: I mentioned earlier that we need better policies, for sure, but we need better tech right now. We have a tech stack that's built and these giant apps scrape our data and exploit it. Why not flip the power? Why not actually give people their data back. Our data is our personhood in this age, let us decide how to use it. Let us each decide what moderation we're comfortable with, what censorship we're comfortable with, what privacy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so the Surgeon General says you need a warning label, because this is damaging the mental health of young people in this country. Should people under the age of 16 have access?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Under the current tech stack, I agree with the Surgeon General, under a new technology. Listen, I'm a builder. My family has been building for five generations. This is an engineering problem that can be fixed. Let's take this ban of TikTok, this massive national security problem and turn it into a solution for Americans. Let's make it a win, a win, win.",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Reps. Mike Kelly, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 8, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you both for- for sitting here with us and for doing so in a bipartisan manner. The Secret Service did a pretty self-critical review of what went wrong on July 13 with that near miss on Donald Trump's life. They said a lack of diligence, communications gaps were responsible here. They took the blame, the director resigned. What more did you find that they didn't already fall on their swords for?",
      "REP. KELLY: Well, I guess I could start off because this is my hometown, right? And I thought from the very beginning, it probably wasn't the right size venue, because of- when the president had come to Butler before, he- about 50,000 people showed up. The venue we went to would really hold- they would hold a lot of people, but it's a very difficult venue to get in and get out of. I was more concerned with traffic, and how do I get tied up\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You thought that before?",
      "REP. KELLY: Yeah, when I- when they- when they first said they were coming to Butler, I thought they were going to come to the same place, and they said, no, they were going someplace different. So when you look at that, so to the- in the very start of it, and I didn't realize at the time, but once the campaign team makes a selection, they hand the keys over to Secret Service. And I think looking back on it, Secret Service would have been better at that point to say, you know what, we know you want to be in that town, but there's probably better places for you to be. This is going to be hard for us to secure. And as it turned out- I never imagined, by the way, that it was- the event that took place that day was going to take place, I just thought that Secret Service should have taken more command of it, especially when they're so strained. They- they're- during an election period, there's so many protectees out there, and it kind of marginalizes what they can do and where they can be. So I think the site was a difficult site to secure. On July 13, it was impossible. When they came back on October 5, it was the difference between day and night. They really locked it down, and they did a lot of things they probably should have done in the beginning, but it's always- hindsight's always 20/20. So I think what we- we heard from the very beginning the Secret Service, 'this is the worst day of our lives. We're embarrassed by what happened. We're so sorry.' But the other element was local law enforcement that usually would come in and help out. There was very little preparation for the event on July 13, and I think that's what I would say. The lack of preparation, the lack of coordination, and more than anything, the lack of communication on July 13, were some of the biggest things that we looked at. So how did you guys ever imagine that this would work? There's just nothing that makes sense that happened that day.",
      "REP. CROW: You know, I've learned in my time in Congress that, you know, agencies and departments, when they do after action reviews of things that have gone wrong, that they'll often look at the operational and the tactical level of what happened, but they almost never look at the structural level. You know, they don't critique their structure. They won't critique their- their superiors, the agencies that they're nestled within. They will very often not look at overall resourcing, money because of the politics of making asks like that. And they very rarely ever look at culture, right, because it's just too sensitive for them. So we- we actually took those, those areas really seriously. We looked at the Secret Service. Should it be nestled within DHS? Is it structured right? Does it get the resourcing and training? And then the area that I in particular looked at was the culture of the organization, because I was struck by the stories and the recount of the specific actions of officers and agents on the ground that day, and there were some heroic ones, but there were also a lot of examples of people that knew that something was wrong and they didn't say anything, right? So one example of this is the drone operator. So Secret Service has these drone operators, and they literally bought a drone off the market, a commercially available drone, they showed up with this drone in a box. It didn't work, they didn't know how to make it work, so they just put it aside and they didn't have a drone.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it wasn't that the Secret Service didn't have a drone? They just had a drone that didn't work, or they didn't know how to\u2013",
      "REP. CROW: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Use it.",
      "REP. CROW: Yeah. They- they bought one off the commercial market. The operator that was responsible for operating it was not trained on how to fix it, on how to troubleshoot it, so, you know, spent an hour trying to get it to work, couldn't get it to work, threw up his hands, put it aside and they were without a drone. And a drone could have prevented, potentially, the shooting. But, you know, the- the larger point of that story is not that they couldn't get the drone to work, which is problematic in and of itself, but that nobody said, hey, we don't have aerial coverage. We don't have a central element of our security plan. So let's revise- let's revisit our plan and make changes that are necessary here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But why? Because you- you did hone in on, during the hearing as well, on the issue of culture. Why didn't anyone say anything? Were they unaware of vulnerabilities? Or is there a culture of silence where people speaking up get smacked down for doing so.",
      "REP. CROW: That's- that- that is my concern, is that there's a culture of silence and that individual officers and agents are not empowered to say something is wrong. Now think about it this way. There are examples of this in- in our daily lives, right? When we all get onto an airplane, we get onto a flight to go anywhere, to visit our family, there- there is a standing rule in commercial aviation that anybody in the cockpit, regardless of your position, whether you're the captain or the first officer or the brand new pilot sitting there being trained, anyone at any time can call something out and say, this is unsafe, we're going to stop it, right? And that is designed for safety, and there are plenty of examples in which that actually saves people's lives.",
      "REP. KELLY: Absolutely.",
      "REP. CROW: That same mentality didn't appear to be a part of what happened at Butler, Pennsylvania. So the question is, how do we change- help change overall culture?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a very hard thing to solve for.",
      "REP. CROW: It's very hard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, Congressman Kelly on that point, I mean, some of this sounds like management 101, that this is not specific to the Secret Service. A lot of organizations have problems like what you just highlighted there. Acting Director Rowe testified Thursday. He thinks the Secret Service needs to identify leaders earlier on and promote them based on ability, not just hours logged on the clock.",
      "REP. KELLY: But isn't that true of everything in life? When you look at this, when people talk about, we need better leadership than that, but my question is then, where do you go to get that talent, and when you find that talent, do you let it escalate, or do you- do you tamp it down? I would just say, whenever we got further and further- the day- I was there, from the time they said they were coming to Butler to find- I was on those grounds the night before, they weren't set up at that point, they were going to work through the night to get it ready. And then you find out afterwards that there was no coordination, there was no team meeting, there was no 'this is going to be your responsibility to know where you're supposed to be and what time you're supposed to be there.' You bring local law enforcement in, but you don't- you don't include them in the planning, or when you do the- the interviews afterwards. 'Well, I thought he was going to do it.' 'No, we thought somebody else was going to do it.' When you look at local law enforcement, instead of one command center, there's two command centers, right? And they are not able to communicate with each other. The thing I think that we look at, more than anything else, and I've said this since day one, the day that- that it happened. Why, when you knew there was a suspicious person on the grounds, and this is a common- going back and forth now, this is where they said they weren't communicating with each other. You can't tell me that you didn't know till ten minutes after six, that you couldn't communicate. At 11 minutes after six, the shooter took action. They knew an hour and a half ahead of time. Out of all the thousands of the people walking around on that terr- on that property, there was a suspicious person, and they kept losing sight of him. I would have said, and I have no background in law enforcement, keep the president back until we clear the area. That's the part that doesn't make sense, because they failed, from the first thing- from the picking of the site, preparing the site, to the coordination of the site, to the ability to communicate, at every step of the way, they failed. And the question is, why didn't you just say, hold up, just hold up. Don't let him come out. If that happens, Corey Comperatore is still alive today. The other two gentlemen that were- were wounded are still alive today, and more- and the person we never talk about is the shooter would still be alive today had they captured him ahead of time or pulled him off. That family lost a son that day. The Comperatore family lost their father and a husband that day. The two people that were wounded, were seriously wounded. It all could have been stopped by somebody saying, hold up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, when the acting director says on Thursday of this week, we need to pick better leaders. That would suggest that the agency today does not necessarily have the leaders it needs to fix all the things you just laid out.",
      "REP. KELLY: Oh- yeah and I think by saying what he said, that's what he meant. They don't have the leadership they need, and as Jason was just talking about, when they morphed them into Homeland Security back in 2001, whenever it was, they took away their identity and their exclusivity. When you're the best of the best, when you're the elite of the elites, if you lose that, then all of a sudden you just become part of a team. And there's just something about it in human nature. If you can reach that pinnacle, if you can be the best of the best, that's what you want to strive for all the time. But if all of a sudden, it's like, just come on in, sit down, we'll let you know when we need you. That kind of destroys that whole foundation that you have to have. And I just- I just think it was- there was a huge mistake back when Homeland came into existence. That's not a criticism, because they did what they had to do back then, but I'm telling you, on July 13, there was a lack of professionalism, there was a lack of concern, there was a lack of coordination, and the ability to communicate is the one thing I'll never understand. You knew you couldn't talk to each other. Why did you go forward?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They were text messaging, right?",
      "REP. KELLY: Yeah, yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Not using the radio.",
      "REP. KELLY: Or cell phones.",
      "REP. CROW: Can I comment on that?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, please.",
      "REP. CROW: Here's what I think is happening with leadership development and the status of leadership within Secret Service. And I- I want to be really clear that there are plenty of extraordinary agents and officers in the Secret Service, right? And when we talk about a failure of mission, you know, in Butler or any place else, that doesn't mean that, you know, 80, 90% of the- of the Secret Service agents aren't phenomenal and dedicated professionals. But there is a systematic problem here, and I'm familiar with this problem because it's not that different from what the military has experienced the last 20 years because of the global war on terror. Let me explain what's happening. We were- we were at war for 20 years, and we- we were at war in several different places, and we asked our military to deploy constantly. And I was- I was in the military for around four years, and during that time, I deployed three times, so I was either in deployment, getting back from a deployment, or getting ready for a deployment the entire time I was in active duty military and we weren't doing our regular training cycles. So the military spent two decades doing that, and as a result of that, people missed their leadership development schools. They missed their training cycles. They missed that normal pipeline of how we create leaders. Because I'm somebody that believes that leaders are not born, that they're developed and they're made. And that requires intentional development over time, that requires a plan to develop it, and it requires time and resources to develop it. So you- you apply that to the Secret Service now, you know, the- the structure, the personnel, the staffing of the Secret Service, hasn't changed in years, at the same time as we are now asking them to do things that they didn't do a decade ago. And they are- they are fulfilling an operational tempo that requires them to be deployed three weeks out of a month, constantly doing events, skipping firearms training, skipping leadership development training. We are not developing their skills and their training. And I think you see the results of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The acting director said, you- they are looking to hire 650 special agents, 350 uniformed division officers. You just said building experience takes time, so they're trying to fix this, but it sounds like you could look at that and say they're not ready for the job they have now, in this moment in time.",
      "REP. CROW: There's a- there's a long-term problem and a short-term problem, right? The long-term problem is we actually need to make the commitment, the resourcing commitment, the structural commitment, and this is-this is a congressional responsibility, to set them up\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Funding.",
      "REP. CROW: \u2013for long term success. But in the short term, you're right. You can't mass produce a presidential detail Secret Service agent. It takes, on average, seven years to- from- from recruitment to training to get somebody ready to protect the President of the United States. We're- we're not going to speed that up, nor would anyone want to speed that up. That's not a situation where you want to shortcut that, just like you wouldn't want to speed up medical training for your doctor, right? So we have to look at, in the near term, then, who are those other individuals, those skill sets within Department of Defense, within Homeland Security, who can help cover down? And how can we use technology to actually supplement that, whether that's drones, AI, other things that can take pressure off of some of the agents doing regular jobs that- that can be shifted so we can cover down in the ways we need to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you made three dozen recommendations in this report on what to change, including to reduce the number of protectees. Right now, Secret Service protects not only presidential leadership, their immediate families, their spouses, their children, candidates, and anyone, really, the president designates. Should all of that continue?",
      "REP. KELLY: Well, it depends, you know, as Jason just laid out, it- what is your main purpose? Look, we've increased the size of protectees that are out there, including foreign assets to come here and people to bring- bring their families and things. So that's gotten so big, but if you look at Homeland, I think- I think when you look at Secret Service, it's about 3% of their overall spend, the biggest spend is on FEMA. And we know we don't want to change anything like that. But you can't have an exclusive without funding them to the level that they need to be funded, not only in manpower and in training, but in the assets that they have to have available to them. If you increase the size and scope of what they're supposed to do, but then you keep them housed under a smaller thing, and then try to move back and forth and bring just- not just, but when you bring other people from Homeland in to supplement what you don't have in Secret Service, you're going away, then, from that structure of, these are the people that we have ready to do this job. So I think what- and what- what the Director Rowe said yesterday, if you're looking at a bigger team, you have to get more recruits. And once you get those recruits, you have to make sure that they're ready to get on the field and do the job that they're expected to do. My understanding, it's very difficult now, screening and getting recruits to commit, I think it's a very hard thing to do. And who is it that you're looking for? The best of the best. How hard is it for them to get there? Really hard. So I think from a standpoint of team building, there has to be kind of a different things that- So he's a special ops guy, or paratrooper. And I mean, not everybody can be a paratrooper. It takes a lot of training, because you're not supposed to jump out of a plane unless it's going down right, and you need some help. But it takes a special breed--",
      "REP. CROW:",
      "-- It's a commentary on our mindset, the mentality of paratroopers, more than anything else, we're always a little bit off.",
      "REP. KELLY:",
      "Jump, jump. We were in Normandy this summer together- that's the first time we had met, and he said, I'm going to be jumping out of the airplane tomorrow. I said, why in the world would you do that? He said, because that's what I do. And I said, when was the last time you did it, on the 75th anniversary? I said, so five years ago was the last time you jumped out of a plane. Now go to what we're talking about today. If I talk to a Secret Service guy, says, when was the last time you protected somebody? Well, five years ago. I said, No, no, no, you're not the guy I'm looking for. You want the cream of the crop, right? But in order to get there, you have to develop where that person wants to be there so bad that he or she will do everything that's possible to get there and- and I think that's what we're looking for. We're looking for a really elite group. But then if we're going to ask them to make that commitment to our country, we should make our commitment to make it possible for them to be the best of the best.",
      "REP. CROW: So here's how I look at the issue of the structure of the Secret Service. I actually don't look at it differently than I look at the structure and the missions of any organization, whether it's a business, a community club or organization, a political campaign. You always have to ask yourself, what are your missions and what is the thing that only you can do? Like, what is that no-fail mission? In this case, with the Secret Service, that no fail mission is to protect our highest level candidates and our highest level elected officials. Period. All the other things, investigation of financial crimes, training and support, these are all secondary missions. So if you're not actually adequately performing any of those missions to standard, and if you reached a breaking point, then it's time to assess, what are those missions that need to fall off and to be transitioned elsewhere? That's my view. You can't--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want to cleave off the financial crimes unit?",
      "REP. CROW: -- I don't know how else we can handle it, right? If- if we have a challenge of not being able to mass produce agents, right, if it takes time to do that, and those are longer term muscle movements, as I say- and this is a no-fail mission. It just can't fail, today, tomorrow, the day after. Every single day, you have to show up and be perfect in that job. Then you have to, you just have to make a decision about what you're not going to do so that you can perform that no-fail mission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Kelly, right after Butler happened, Donald Trump said he thought the Secret Service actually did a good job that day. Do you get the sense that with the passage of time, he's going to support or has any interest in some of the very specific recommendations that you're making?",
      "REP. KELLY: Okay, so I was about 60 feet away from the President when the shots rang out, and I just saw him grab his head and he went down, and I said, Oh my god, somebody just shot him. I will tell you this, within seconds, all these agents that were up on- the on the stage with him, covered him. Now, if I'm Donald Trump and I'm thinking, these guys were there, right there, the problem wasn't the people that were around him. The problem was the people around him weren't being communicated with by- from other people. So they were reacting to, boom, I got to be there. So if I were Donald Trump, I would be very thankful for that, right? But the question wasn't- was it the Secret Service that was around him? It was about the Secret Service and the rest of law enforcement, the rest of the people there to protect him, that outer shell--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- The infrastructure, the management, the support--",
      "REP. KELLY:-- It was the infrastructure that failed. It wasn't the group that was around him. So yes, if I'm him, I'm saying, yeah, thank you. You guys were able to put- you were going to put your life on the line to protect me. And they did it within a second or two. But then when he got back up, and I thought, this is, this is absolutely insane, it was just like, my gosh. I can't believe this happened. And then- I will say one thing, though, because it's- when he broke out of that, and he put his hand up, now, when you keep in mind, there's maybe 25, 30,000 people, and they're all on the ground. When he stands up and goes 'fight,' the rest of these people stand up, and I'm thinking, what in the world? And he- they're- they're chanting USA. I thought, you know what, this is a pretty tough country. You know, they all stand up and they start going, 'USA.' And I thought, oh my gosh. Now for me that day, it was difficult. My wife, three of my grandchildren, my son, were there with me, but they weren't where they were supposed to be because of the lack of coordination. So I had a lot of concerns that day. The first one being, where's my wife? Where's my grandkids? Where's my son? And there was a lady named Mrs. Fogel sitting beside me. Marc Fogel who is a teacher from Butler who is imprisoned in- in Russia right now. They were all there for this event. And you watch how quickly that happened and how- how afterwards, it's the after thought you think about, how in the world did this happen? How did this happen in Butler, Pennsylvania, the home of the Jeep and on farm show grounds and an attempted assassination of a president, it's like, wow, times have changed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And then weeks later, it nearly happened again down in Mar a Lago.",
      "REP. KELLY: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We know very little. And you Congressman Crow seemed very frustrated, based on the report and the hearing--",
      "REP. CROW: -- Do I seem frustrated?--",
      "REP. KELLY: -- No, no, you're very--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- with the fact that you couldn't find out more about the shooter, both in Butler and in- the potential shooter, in Mar a Lago?",
      "REP. CROW: Well, you know, we completed a five-month investigation which was comprehensive, it was thorough, and it tells, you know, the full story about the actions of the Secret Service and state and local law enforcement and what happened and what didn't happen. Right? That we have the definitive story of that, and we have recommendations around that. There is one area, as you point out, that we weren't able to get to. That- that's actually a really important element to the story. And people have rightful questions about it. I have questions about it. And that is, why did the shooter do this? What drove him to do it? Was he a lone wolf shooter? Did he have associates or affiliates? What was his motivation? How was he radicalized?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is Thomas Matthews Crooks?",
      "REP. CROW : That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who took these shots with an AR-15?",
      "REP. CROW: Yeah, these are important questions that America deserves answers to, that Congress deserves answers to. So we endeavored to get answers to those questions. We submitted numerous requests to the Department of Justice and FBI. Their response is, this is an ongoing criminal investigation, and we can't give that information to Congress. That, in my view, is an unacceptable position. And here's why--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- For both Butler and Mar a Lago, that was the answer?",
      "REP. CROW: Correct. That's right. And here's why that's unacceptable. Congress is what we like to say, is the article one branch of the Constitution. The founders made us first. They put us first in the constitution for a reason, because we are supposed to be the preeminent branch with oversight authority over the executive branch, with preeminent oversight authority over the executive branch. So you can't come and tell me that there's whole areas of information that we can't access because of an ongoing criminal investigation. And then to add to that, if they're concerned about the protection of that information, about the dissemination of that information, and compromising an investigation, I understand those concerns, but I sit on the Intelligence Committee, I've sat on the Armed Services Committee, and Congress all the time gets access to our nation's most sensitive secrets. Ongoing operations, intelligence operations, military operations, so you can't tell me that there isn't a way to put us into a secure facility and get us information about an ongoing criminal investigation when I regularly am receiving briefs on what our- our spies and our military special operators are doing regularly around the world. So none of this stands to reason, and we have dedicated ourselves to continue to get those answers. And if the FBI and DOJ thinks that they can wait us out and stonewall us, they are wrong.",
      "REP. KELLY: -- Good luck--",
      "REP. CROW: -- Because members of our task force, even after we sunset in a couple of weeks here, sit on all of these committees, and we will get that information.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why-- you used the term \"slowwalk\" us? You think they're intentionally withholding information?",
      "REP. CROW: I don't know what their intention is. I'm not a mind reader, but, you know, I've been around Congress long enough to know what- what people do--",
      "REP. KELLY: --When you get stonewalled--",
      "REP. CROW: --When you're getting stonewalled. I mean, listen, this is, this is not uncommon when you're dealing with agencies and departments. It's a pretty regular method, and it's something that, you know, we encounter all the time in our oversight responsibilities, so--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you think that is?",
      "REP. KELLY: You know what--\u00a0 in my life, right? And I've done a lot of different things, but most have been in the retail- in the public. It's always bothered me with there's a sense of paranoia with these agencies, and when you ask them a question, they would- they would try to come back to you, why are you asking that question? I said, well, why are you asking me why I'm asking that question? Why don't you just answer it and we can go to the next subject. It's- it's that holding back, that holding back, that holding back. It's like, well, we don't trust you.\u00a0 And that's a well, that's- that's why we're here today because you know what--",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --There is quite--",
      "REP. KELLY: --I'm not so sure the American people--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- a lot of political tension, --",
      "REP. KELLY: -- You know when we started--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN-- between the Congress and the Justice Department--",
      "REP. CROW: -- Well there should be. They're often like, hey,--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --and the FBI.",
      "[END CROSSTALK]",
      "REP. CROW: --you're out to get us. Like, well, we're not out to get you, but we are out to hold you accountable and to get answers. So, I mean, we're not, we're not here to- to, you know, just play nice all the time. We have independent obligations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean the seriousness of the task and what was being looked at you think should have compelled the FBI and the DOJ to share the information about what they know of the, now deceased, alleged shooter in Butler and the attempted shooter in Mar a Lago.",
      "REP. KELLY: Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What is it that you want to know about them? Because the public knows very little about Mr. Crooks, in particular.",
      "REP. KELLY: When you look at him and you try to find out- having four children and 10 grandchildren, parents are usually the best people to go to. You were talking earlier, you have family of your own. I think as a parent, you're more aware of what's going on with your child. What are her good days? What are her bad days? What is it that's bothering her? There's something there that's missing. I don't know what it is and I'm not making a criticism. It's just whenever we were asking questions and told, these are things that we're not done investigating yet, and we're tasked with getting something done in a time period. And at the very beginning of this, do you know our whole- our whole effort was to restore the faith and trust and confidence the American people must have in these institutions. When they stonewall you, when they hold you back, what would you automatically think? What is it they don't want us to know? Listen, I don't know enough about Mr. Crooks or the Crooks family. I just know that a lot of- a lot of things happened that day that didn't have to happen that day. But now, when you do the aftermath of, okay, so what is it we could have done different, and why aren't you telling us certain things that we need to know? Don't stonewall us because when you stonewall us, my feeling is, and I think Jason is the same way, there's something you don't want us to know. Was the failure where, and is it that you don't want to take that? Because as we went through all this stuff and the finger pointing, it wasn't my job, it was his job. And it's like, wait a minute. Just stop. Just stop. We're not here to get rid of you. We're here to make sure this doesn't happen again, to the best of our abilities. So it was frustrating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we don't know, or tell me if perhaps you know answers\u2013",
      "REP. CROW: Yeah we\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was there a foreign nexus? Do we know yes or no?",
      "REP. CROW: Margaret, I will get to that. But I want to, I just want to lay the groundwork a little bit for this issue. You know, we're in an age of incredible disinformation and misinformation. Americans are deluged with misinformation and disinformation that's coming from a variety of sources. Our adversaries, our state adversaries, Russia, China and others, non-state actors. And there's a lot of conspiracy theories out there. And conspiracy theories sometimes take root when there's a lack of information or there's conflicting information. So our job is to try to get information out there, to be transparent, to be accessible, to tell the real story. And that's why this is important. This element of that story is important because there's a lot of conspiracies around\u2013",
      "REP. KELLY: \u2013Absolutely\u2013",
      "REP. CROW: \u2013These shootings, right? And we take that seriously. We want to- we want to, you know, rebuff those. But you know, in this case, and I sit on a lot of other committees with access to information, I have seen no evidence that a state actor and adversary was responsible for either of these attempted assassination attempts. I have seen no evidence. But you know, when you're in a position where you know the government says, \"well, it's not this, but we won't tell you what it is.\" Right? And \"we can't tell you, we can't tell you definitively.\" Well, you know, people respond and have questions about that, and I understand that mentality. So even though we don't have evidence of one thing, people still want to know what else it is. And I still want to know what else it is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did he act alone? Do we know that?",
      "REP. CROW: We don't know that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or Congress doesn't know that.",
      "REP. CROW: Yeah, and you know, it's one thing to say, and I'm going to be really clear about this, because this is very, very sensitive territory, because we want to make sure we're not\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -Right\u2013",
      "REP. CROW: \u2013Getting people spun up unnecessarily. There is no evidence of- from other sources, you know, internal government sources, from our investigation, that others were involved, that he acted with others, and that a foreign state or adversary was involved in this. But that still raises the question of, why did he do this? Was just- was he just a disturbed young man who decided to take action alone? Probably, I mean, that's probably the answer.",
      "REP. KELLY: That's what it looks like now.",
      "REP. CROW: Right. That's what it looks like. But we need to know, right? And let's get the information out there that the government has to make sure that we can settle this. And that's, that's our obligation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And, you know, I asked you specifically about foreign nexus, because, as you know, Congressman Kelly, in the weeks leading up to this, there was more information about a direct threat to the now President-elect Donald Trump from the Iranian regime. It was a heightened threat environment. There was a specific, known actor that they were worried about, and because of that, security was increased. So we're not just talking about day to day Secret Service protection. You're talking about an environment where there were threats, known threats. So in that environment, that doesn't speak to a lot of- I mean, you laid out a lot of concerns you have.",
      "REP. KELLY: Oh, absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is the agency today able to do its job if they weren't able to do it in July?",
      "REP. KELLY: Well, I would sure hope that they understand that there's more oversight. And when you, when you as you speak, as a foreign government getting involved in it. It's part of the testimony. It's a back and forth between, actually, the people that were there saying \"I wonder if this could have been part of what they were referring to with a foreign adversary.\" I wondered why they didn't share more of it. And I think that- now these are the people you have on the ground doing the protection, and they're saying this as- afterwards, \"I wonder if this was what they were talking about, and why didn't we know more about it?\" In fact, some of them knew nothing about it at all. You know, back to what you said in the beginning, this is a preparation for anything that is, is the indication of whether it's going to go well or not. There's so many missing pieces on this one. And I think that we're frustrated. And I think the- the task force, the 30 people that were working on this every single day, were frustrated, too. How could there be so many missing pieces, this, it just doesn't make sense that none of this stuff came together, and on that day, none of it, none of it was coordinated. It was just thrown together. And now we look at it and think, you know what we were tasked with, trying to find out what happened that day, why it happened that day, into- into the best of our ability make sure that the Secret Service, that doesn't happen again to them. We can't guarantee that these things won't happen, because it's a crazy world right now. But there was too much ahead of time that we did know that we didn't share. And I- I know when you talk to them, the key to everything is communication. The lack of communication. I'll never understand when it comes down to that, and I'm not going to repeat it again, because I've said it- my wife said please quit talking that way, but I would never let my child play near a road. And when you do, you put people in jeopardy of that. And you know there's a danger there. Don't let it happen. This doesn't, I don't think it's- you don't have to have a degree and everything to understand protection is protection. The main job of Secret Service on that day was that they have protectees. And if that's, if that's our mission, then we can slow walk and help them out with different assets that maybe they don't have, but it was for me, that day, that was a signal that there's something wrong. And as we went through the task force, the inability to communicate, even with the- the federal agencies are on board, that just sends up a red flag right away. I said, why won't you tell us what we're asking you, and if it comes back, we don't know why we're asking- why you're asking us that. That is because we were tasked to find out. At the end of the day, the American people have to have confidence in you, and at this point, it's hard to have confidence with people who won't share information with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's- there are already proposals out there. One of your Democratic colleagues has proposed cleaving it off from DHS. Others have proposed other visions for what to do to the agency. In the new Congress, where does this rank in terms of priority?",
      "REP. CROW: Well, pretty high for us, right? I mean, as we already talked about, it's a very dangerous world. You know, you have Iran targeting- this is public now, there have been public indictments released by Department of Justice. You have Iran targeting for assassination, current and former administration officials, American elected officials, in the United States. You have, you have, you know, the Wall Street Journal reported not long ago about Chinese hacking of our telecommunication systems, possibly the largest hack and breach in American history. Our adversaries are doing troubling, deeply troubling things right now as we're sitting here speaking about it. So it's a dangerous world\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013and domestic actors. Heightened threat environment.",
      "REP. CROW: \u2013And domestic actors, domestic extreme- extremism too. You're absolutely right. So again, this goes back to this being a no-fail mission, having to make sure that we are both raising the fences around the things we need to protect, but also establishing deterrence with respect to our foreign adversaries. We can't be in a position anymore where our rivals, our adversaries, are doing these things without substantial cost, without substantial response to them. There has to be penalties imposed much harsher penalties imposed for them doing it because right now, clearly deterrence, in several important respects, has not been established. So, we are going to do both to make sure that our people are protected, because we just cannot be in a situation where our highest elected officials are at risk here.",
      "REP. KELLY: Totally agree.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm getting a wrap on time. But is there anything that you feel important to raise that we didn't talk about?",
      "REP. KELLY: Well I think that from the very beginning, we never identified as Republicans and Democrats. We, we defined as a task force to find out what happened that day. And the whole, the whole goal from day one is to restore the faith and trust and confidence that the American people must have in this agency. At this point it's probably at the lowest ebb it's ever been. And the other thing is, I think we realize that threats are 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, you can't take a day off. You can't take a play off. You've got to be ready every single moment for anything that could possibly happen. Is that a difficult task? Yes. Is it almost impossible? Yes, there's a lot of bad actors out there. But you know what's not impossible? Our dedication to the fact that we're going to do the best we can do every single day to ensure that the American people have the faith and trust and confidence they must have in us. We both represent three quarters of a million people. They sent us here to represent them. And so that's the message, I think, from day one, I would just- and this guy's got background in it, I don't. But our task force worked together so well. And I think the best thing is, you know what, there's not an election year which really can take the focus off of these different things that come up from a political standpoint. This isn't political for me. This is strong policy for the American people.",
      "REP. CROW: This is a tough place to work. And there are, frankly, there are some people here that don't belong here, that I think are just here to get attention to get, you know, clicks on social media, that aren't here to legislate. But this has been one of the best experiences of my time in Congress, and I couldn't have asked for a better partner than Mike Kelly. You know, and he's a very conservative Republican and I'm a Democrat. We're both proud of that. We're proud of our politics, and\u2013",
      "REP. KELLY: \u2013We are\u2013",
      "REP. CROW: We represent our districts, right?--",
      "REP. KELLY: \u2013We do, we do\u2013",
      "REP. CROW: That's actually, that's actually the job, right? We represent the culture and the politics and the hopes and dreams of our districts. And that's what's so, so beautiful about this place when it works well. But this process, and I think this is really important for Americans to understand, this process was serious, it was bipartisan, it was- it was deep, and we did the job that we were asked to do. And not a lot of people get exposure to that, you know, they just see these clips of people doing crazy things here. And I would just encourage people to read the report, to look at what we did here, and to know that, you know, important things can still get done.",
      "REP. KELLY: At the very end, the suggestions we have\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're very specific.",
      "REP. KELLY: They're very specific, but there's nothing that most people say, \"why in the world would they think of that?\" And then the answer is, that's the same way you would think, if you were going on a trip or doing anything and taking your children with you, you would- you go through that same checklist. Everything in life revolves around a checklist, and the worst thing you can do is stop using the checklist.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will see what happens in the new Congress with the new president and the choice of a potentially new director. Thank you.",
      "REP. CROW: Thank you.",
      "REP. KELLY: Thanks for having us."

      "President-elect Donald Trump called on Sunday for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, saying after meeting with world leaders in Paris that Ukraine and its president \"would like to make a deal and stop the madness.\"",
      "\"There should be an immediate ceasefire and negotiations should begin,\" Trump wrote in a post on social media, calling the war between Russia and Ukraine one that \"should never have started, and could go on forever.\"",
      "Trump was in Paris on Saturday to attend the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral and met with world leaders including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron. The meeting marked Trump's first in-person conversation with the Ukrainian president since he won the presidential election in November.",
      "The president-elect has repeatedly pledged that he would end the war between Russia and Ukraine immediately upon returning to the White House while claiming that Russian President Vladimir Putin would never have invaded the country if he were president.",

      "The Ukrainian president said in a post on social media that the war \"cannot simply end with a piece of paper and a few signatures,\" urging that a ceasefire \"without guarantees can be reignited at any moment.\" Zelenskyy argued that Putin \"can only be stopped by strength \u2014 the strength of world leaders who can become leaders of peace. \"",

      "President-elect Donald Trump received a warm welcome with a full dose of presidential pomp from French President\u00a0Emmanuel Macron\u00a0on Saturday and they held an impromptu meeting with Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy on a day that mixed pageantry with attention to pressing global problems.",
      "Trump, on his first international trip since he was re-elected to the White House, traveled to France to join world leaders and dignitaries to celebrate the renovation and\u00a0reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral\u00a0five years after a devastating fire destroyed the landmark.",
      "Trump's visit to France also comes as Macron and other European leaders are trying to cultivate the president-elect's favor and persuade him to maintain support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia's three-year invasion.",
      "Trump touched down at Paris' Orly Airport on Saturday morning. More than 20 French government security agents helped ensure his safety alongside the Secret Service, according to French national police. Security is tighter than usual outside the U.S. Embassy and other sites around Paris for the grandiose reopening.",
      "As Trump arrived at the Elysee Palace, the official residence of the French president, Macron went out of his way to project an image of close ties, posing for multiple handshakes interspersed with plenty of back-patting. Trump said it was \"a great honor\" and talked about the \"great relationship\" they have had.",
      "The grand red carpet arrival is the same protocol the French use to welcome sitting American presidents. It was yet another sign of how eager both Macron and other European leaders are to win Trump's favor and placate him even before he takes office.",
      "Before they went inside, Trump said, \"It certainly seems like the world is, going a little crazy right now. And we'll be talking about that.\"",
      "Zelenskyy arrived at the palace about 45 minutes after Trump and greeted him inside the cathedral.",
      "Macron had planned to meet with Zelenskyy, and the French president's office said the three-way meeting was proposed by Macron and arranged shortly before Trump's arrival. Trump has pledged to end the war in Ukraine swiftly but has not specified how, raising concerns in Kyiv about what terms may be laid out for any future negotiations.",
      "Details of the tri-lateral meeting were not immediately available.",
      "Trump was given prime seating at the service right between them \u2014 a better location than first lady Jill Biden, who sat on Brigitte Macron's other side \u2014 and many current heads of government and state.",
      "Earlier this week,\u00a0Trump said he had accepted an invitation\u00a0from Macron, saying the French president had done \"a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day for all!\"",
      "Notre Dame was damaged in a fire that raged for 12 hours on April 15, 2019, nearly destroying the iconic 1,200-year-old church. Although experts said at the time that the restoration could take up to 40 years, Macron vowed to rebuild in five years.",
      "\"The decision to rebuild Notre Dame was about our capacity to save, restore, sometimes reinvent what we are by preserving where we come from,\"\u00a0Macron told 60 Minutes. \"This is a message of achievement.\"",
      "Macron, who has had an up-and-down relationship with Trump, has made a point of cultivating a relationship with the president-elect since he defeated Vice President Kamala Harris last month. But his office nonetheless played down the significance of the invitation, saying that other politicians who do not currently hold office had been invited as well.",
      "President Biden was invited as well but will not attend. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre cited a scheduling conflict and said that Jill Biden will instead represent the U.S.",
      "Trump and the U.S. first lady last encountered one another shortly after the election, when he visited the White House for the traditional meeting between outgoing and incoming presidents.",
      "Inside Notre Dame, Trump also greeted Britain's Prince William, who Trump met with later at the British ambassador's residence in Paris. Trump was greeted in the foyer, shook the royal's hand and said \"good man, this one.\"",
      "Trump told reporters the Prince of Wales was doing \"a fantastic job\" before the two went to sit down and talk in a private room reserved for high-profile figures in the residence that once was the Paris town home of Princess Pauline Borghese, the youngest sister French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte.",
      "Prince William was also scheduled to meet separately with Jill Biden, according to the British royal palace.",
      "Relations between France and the U.S. during Trump's first term began warmly enough but grew increasingly strained over time.",
      "Macron was the guest of honor at Trump's first state dinner, and Trump traveled to France several times. But the relationship suffered after Macron criticized Trump for questioning the need for NATO and raising doubts about America's commitment to the mutual defense pact.",
      "On the campaign trail this year, Trump often mocked Macron, imitating his accent and threatening to impose steep tariffs on wine and champagne bottles shipped to the U.S. if France tried to tax American companies.",
      "But Macron was one of the first global leaders to congratulate Trump last month after the election.",
      "Last weekend, Trump\u00a0announced that he intends\u00a0to nominate real estate developer Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to serve as ambassador to France. Predecessors in that prestigious role include Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson.",

    "story": [
      "The oldest known wild bird in the world has laid an egg at the ripe age of about 74, her first in four years, U.S. wildlife officials said.",
      "The long-winged seabird named Wisdom, a Laysan albatross, returned to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge at the northwestern edge of the Hawaiian Archipelago and laid what experts estimate may be her 60th egg, the Pacific Region of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service said in a Facebook post this week.",
      "Wisdom and her mate, Akeakamai, had returned to the atoll in the Pacific Ocean to lay and hatch eggs since 2006. Laysan albatrosses mate for life and lay one egg per year, but according to the USFWS, Akeakamai hadn't been seen for several years, prompting \"Wisdom to begin courtship dances with other males\" as soon as she returned to the island last week.",

    "story": [
      "The Geminid meteor shower peak is a week away, but this year it might be a good idea to keep an eye out early, according to NASA. Dedicated skywatchers might want to check the sky not only in the days ahead of the peak, however \u2014 but also early in the morning.",
      "The shower will peak from Friday Dec. 13 into early Saturday Dec. 14 \u2014 when the moon is nearly full, according to NASA. Illumination from the moon could make spotting the cosmic show a challenge during the peak, but bright meteors can be spotted the week before the peak.",
      "Here's what you should know about the Geminids meteor shower, including how to watch:",
      "Where you can see the Geminids",
      "Meteors from the Geminids will be visible throughout the sky and across the globe, according to NASA. They're best viewed in an area far away from city and street lights.",
      "Viewers \u2014 who should prepare for frigid temperatures \u2014 should lie flat on their backs with their feet facing south. Give your eyes a half hour to adjust to the dark.",
      "The shower usually starts around 9 or 10 p.m. local time, with the meteors best viewed at night or in the pre-dawn hours.",
      "EarthSky, an astronomy website published by experts in the field, suggests finding a way to block out the moon when watching for the Geminids.",
      "\"So with moonlit skies in 2024, you might only catch the brightest meteors,\" according to EarthSky. \"Luckily, many of the Geminids are bright meteors. Try blocking out the moon when watching for meteors.\"",
      "Are any nights this year good for Geminid viewing?",
      "Casual observers won't be able to pick up any noticeable activity from the Geminids until the night of Dec. 11, according to Bill Cooke, lead of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. More than half of the moon's surface will already be illuminated by the sun at that point of the month, so it will still cause some problems with meteor viewing.",
      "Astronomy fans determined to see the Geminids without interference from the moon's light may have some luck if they're willing to get up after moon-set around 3:30 a.m. local time, Cooke said. Even then though, it will be a challenge to spot many Geminids an hour.",
      "\"In short, 2024 is a bad year for Geminid watching \u2013 December 2025 will be much better,\" Cooke said.",
      "What are the Geminids?",
      "Most meteor showers originate from comets, but the Geminids come from 3200 Phaethon, an asteroid. The Geminids first appeared in the mid-1800s. At the time, there were 10 to 20 meteors an hour, but the shower has grown bigger and meteors are now visible at a rate of 120 meteors an hour under perfect conditions.",
      "While most meteors appear to be colorless or white, NASA scientists say the Geminids are bright, fast and usually yellow in color. They streak through the sky at a speed of 22 miles per second.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 21:07:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Heat shield damage seen during the first Artemis test flight is now understood, NASA says, but more time is needed to implement fixes.",
    "story": [
      "Less than a year after announcing major delays for the next two Artemis moon missions, NASA managers said Thursday the projected flight dates are slipping once again, with the first piloted voyage around the moon now expected in the April 2026 timeframe, and the first lunar landing in mid 2027.",
      "NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said the delays are needed to revise the Orion crew capsule's re-entry trajectory to reduce stress and prevent the sort of unexpected heat shield damage seen after an unpiloted 2022 test flight \u2014 and to complete extensive testing of the capsule's environmental control and life support systems.",
      "\"Based on the data, we have decided, unanimously, to move forward with the current Artemis 2/Orion capsule and heat shield with a modified entry trajectory...to lessen the heat coming back into the Earth's atmosphere,\" Nelson said.",
      "\"Additionally, we need to complete our updates to the Orion environmental controls and the life support systems that were identified earlier this year.\"",
      "Future heat shields for the Artemis 3 moon landing mission and subsequent flights will use essentially the same materials but with modifications to improve their performance during re-entry.",
      "In the meantime, Nelson said, \"We are planning for Artemis 2 to launch in April of '26 and we're going to do all in our power, with our commercial partners, to launch earlier.\"",
      "The Artemis program aims to send astronauts to the moon's south polar region where ice deposits may allow crews to one day extract oxygen and hydrogen to produce air, water and rocket propellants that would not have to be carried up, at great expense, from Earth.",
      "Following the launch of Artemis 2, Nelson said NASA is going \"to make (any) adjustments that are necessary, and we plan to launch Artemis 3, the first landing on the moon in over a half century. Assuming the SpaceX lander is ready, we plan to launch Artemis 3 in mid-2027. That will be well ahead of the Chinese government's announced intention (of sending taikonauts to the moon in) 2030...We need to get this Artemis 2 test flight right to ensure the success of our return to the moon.\"",
      "NASA launched the Artemis program's first test flight, Artemis 1, in November 2022, using the agency's new Space Launch System, or SLS, rocket to send an unpiloted Lockheed Martin-built Orion capsule on a looping flight around the moon and back.",
      "NASA had planned to launch the Artemis 2 mission at the end of this year to carry a three-man one-woman crew around the moon to thoroughly test the spacecraft's life support, propulsion and other systems.",
      "But after the Artemis 1 flight, engineers discovered the Orion capsule's 16-foot-wide heat shield suffered unexpected damage during it's high-speed return from the moon using a technique called a \"skip entry.\"",
      "In a skip entry, the capsule dips into the atmosphere, slows and rises back up before dropping back into the atmosphere for the final descent. The idea is similar to how a flat rock can skip across a still pond. Skip entries provide a number of benefits, including a wider range of splashdown targets.",
      "The Orion heat shield is designed to ablate, or char, during re-entry when the spacecraft enters Earth's atmosphere at more than 25,000 mph. But the charred material is intended to stay in place, providing a layer of insulation. During the Artemis 1 re-entry, more charred material separated from the heat shield than computer models predicted.",
      "While the unexpected \"liberation\" had no impact on the spacecraft \u2014 NASA said astronauts would not have even noticed had any been on board \u2014 engineers wanted to make sure they understood the underlying cause so they could update computer models to accurately predict re-entry effects across multiple trajectories.",
      "After hundreds of tests and an exhaustive engineering analysis, NASA has \"since determined that while the capsule was dipping in and out of the atmosphere as part of that planned skip entry, heat accumulated inside the heat shield's outer layer,\" said Pam Melroy, a former shuttle commander and now deputy administrator of NASA.",
      "That heat build up led to \"gases forming and becoming trapped inside the heat shield,\" she said. \"This caused internal pressure to build up and led to cracking and uneven shedding of that outer layer.\"",
      "While the same type of heat shield will be used for the Artemis 2 mission in April 2026, the crew will use a modified re-entry trajectory to reduce the sort of heating that damaged the Artemis 1 heat shield.",
      "As for the Artemis 3 lunar landing flight, the new mid-2027 target launch date assumes SpaceX's lunar lander, a variant of the upper stage used by the company's new Super Heavy-Starship rocket, completes multiple test flights in Earth orbit, along with at least one unpiloted lunar landing.",
      "On Wednesday, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he was selecting billionaire Jared Isaacman, a space veteran with strong ties to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, to serve as NASA's next administrator.",
      "During the news conference Thursday, Nelson was asked whether he was concerned that the next administration might make major changes to the Artemis program given SpaceX's development of the new Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "\"First of all, there is one human-rated spacecraft that is flying and that has already flown beyond the moon, and that's the SLS (Space Launch System) combined with Orion,\" Nelson said. \"Secondly, this is a partnership. It's a commercial partnership. It's an international partnership.",
      "\"I think what is going to happen over time is you're going to have a number of years that we're going to have the partners flying with NASA, and then whatever the technologies that are developed later on will dictate what is going to be the system that's flying.\"",
      "He concluded by saying, \"I don't see the concern that your question raises, although it's a legitimate question, that you're suddenly going to have Starship take over everything.\"",

He chartered the first purely commercial, all-civilian American \"space tourist\" mission \u2014 Inspiration4 \u2014 in February 2021, paying SpaceX an undisclosed amount to launch him and three other civilian flyers on a two-day, 23-hour flight.",
      "He flew to space again this past September, commanding the first of three planned SpaceX Polaris missions, logging nearly five days in space on a flight that took the crew farther from Earth than any astronauts have gone since the Apollo moon program. Isaacman also became the first private citizen to carry out a spacewalk.",
      "He is scheduled to lead another Polaris mission aboard a SpaceX capsule before leading the first crew to space aboard the California rocket builder's gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "Dates have not been announced for either of those missions, and it's not yet clear what impact Isaacman's selection to lead NASA will have on those flights, whether Isaacman still intends to fly aboard one or both or what sort of influence his friendship with Musk might have on NASA's future direction.",
      "But Isaacman, a skilled pilot who flies his own MiG-29 fighter jet, made it clear in a post following Trump's announcement that NASA can expect him to be a vocal space advocate who will help \"usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilization.\"",
      "\"With the support of President Trump, I can promise you this: We will never again lose our ability to journey to the stars and never settle for second place,\" Isaacman said. \"We will inspire children, yours and mine, to look up and dream of what is possible. Americans will walk on the moon and Mars and in doing so, we will make life better here on Earth.\"",
      "He said it would be the \"honor of a lifetime to serve in this role and to work alongside NASA's extraordinary team to realize our shared dreams of exploration and discovery.\"",
      "Jim Bridenstine, Nelson's predecessor at the helm of NASA, helped kickstart the agency's Artemis moon program during the first Trump administration.",
      "He said in a statement Wednesday that \"Jared's vision for pushing boundaries, paired with his proven track record of success in private industry, positions him as an ideal candidate to lead NASA into a bold new era of exploration and discovery. I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm him.\"",
      "The Isaacman announcement comes as NASA struggles to keep the Artemis program on track amid tight budgets and what the agency's own inspector general calls the \"unsustainable\" costs of NASA's Space Launch System, or SLS, moon rocket.",
      "SpaceX supporters argue the company's more powerful, fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship rocket is the obvious choice for deep space exploration, but the huge rocket is far from operational with just a half-dozen suborbital test flights to its credit.",
      "The SLS, on the other hand, is considered operational in that it completed an initial test flight in November 2022, sending an unpiloted Orion capsule around the moon and back. But unlike the Super Heavy-Starship, the SLS is a throwaway, expendable booster expected to cost some $1.4 billion for each of its first four moon missions.",
      "NASA is currently gearing up to launch three NASA astronauts and a Canadian flyer on an SLS-Orion mission \u2014 Artemis 2 \u2014 late next year. But problems with the first Orion's heat shield and other issues threaten to push the Artemis 2 flight into 2026, years past initial expectations.",
      "It's not yet clear when the Artemis 3 mission, the first to carry astronauts to a landing near the moon's south pole, might be feasible.",
      "But that flight will feature a lunar lander built by SpaceX, a variant of the company's Starship upper stage. SpaceX has carried out six test flights of the fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship to date, but has not yet put the Starship upper stage into orbit or brought it down for an intact landing.",
      "Given the company's rapid-fire test schedule, most observers believe SpaceX will get the Super Heavy-Starship working as planned in the near future, but scores of test flights will be required to demonstrate the safety and reliability required by NASA to put astronauts aboard.",
      "And the moon mission poses unique challenges.",
      "For the initial landing mission, multiple Super Heavy \"tanker\" flights will be required to refuel the moon lander in low-Earth orbit before it can be sent to the moon. Once in lunar orbit, it will await the arrival of the Artemis 3 crew, launched aboard an Orion capsule by an SLS rocket.",
      "After boarding the Starship lander, two astronauts would descend to the surface, carry out the mission's planned exploration, and then head back up to the orbiting Orion for the trip back to Earth.",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 16:58:47 -0500",
    "summary": "The game's design nudged people into racking up unauthorized charges, the FTC said. Here's how customers will be refunded.",
    "story": [
      "Fortnite players and other Epic Games customers tricked by the game maker into making unwanted purchases are set to receive refund payments from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).",
      "As part of a settlement first\u00a0announced\u00a0in December 2022, the video game maker has been ordered by the FTC to pay $245 million to resolve allegations that it used unlawful billing practices involving design tricks\u00a0known as dark patterns to get players to unintentionally rack up charges. It is the largest ever refund amount in a gaming case, the agency said.",
      "The FTC says it is sending more than 629,000 payments Monday, with more disbursements to come at a later date. About half of the first tranche of payments will be made through PayPal, and the other half will be checks. Collectively, customers will receive $72 million in refunds, according to the agency.",
      "How much money will each customer get?",
      "The average payment is around $114, the FTC said. Epic Games customers who are entitled to refunds selected their payment method when they submitted a claim form. Customers who chose to receive PayPal payments have 30 days to redeem the funds, while check recipients have 90 days to cash them.",
      "What did Epic Games do?",
      "The FTC alleges the Fortnite-maker used dark patterns along with a variety of other tactics to trick customers into making unwanted purchases.",
      "For example, a \"counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration\" led Fortnite players to easily incur unwanted charges with the press of a single button, according to the FTC. Additionally, trying to transition the game from sleep to wake mode often triggered unwanted purchases. Other times, pressing an \"adjacent button\" while trying to preview an item led to a charge.",
      "\"As our complaints note, Epic used privacy-invasive default settings and deceptive interfaces that tricked Fortnite users, including teenagers and children,\" FTC Chair Lina M. Khan said in December 2022, when the settlement was first announced. \"Protecting the public, and especially children, from online privacy invasions and dark patterns is a top priority for the Commission, and these enforcement actions make clear to businesses that the FTC is cracking down on these unlawful practices.\"",

    "summary": "Abutting homes, schools an parks, the sprawling warehouses are a huge drain on local resources and major pollutant.",
    "story": [
      "The sprawling, windowless warehouses that hold rows of high-speed servers powering almost everything the world does on phones and computers are increasingly becoming fixtures of the American landscape, popping up in towns, cities and suburbs across the United States.",
      "Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and urban and rural governments alike are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies.",
      "But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas, abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents are pushing back against the world's most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.",
      "In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling hills of the area's westernmost counties and butt up against wooded bike trails winding through the suburbs. But one of the latest proposals in the area, Plaza 500, would see a 466,000-square-foot facility and adjacent electrical substation built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds and a community center.",
      "The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials promised jobs and a significant property tax boost. But data center critics say the incentives aren't enough to counteract the consequences of building the facilities so close to homes.",
      "Tyler Ray, a leader in the fight against the Virginia project, worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by 2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help power the data centers' hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere.",
      "Ray and his neighbors tried to stop the development, but their efforts were largely unsuccessful. The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project was exempt.",
      "\"I don't know how a general resident, even someone who has been engaging intently on an issue, has any chance to go up against the data center industry,\" Ray said the night the supervisors voted.",
      "For local governments, attracting data centers to their municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in 2024 that Virginia's current data centers brought in $1 billion in tax revenue.",
      "For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of direct jobs \u2013 often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently that its investment in nearby Loudoun County, which included two data centers, created around 150 direct jobs, a figure that data center opponents say isn't worth the hassle. But data center advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction, technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730 indirect jobs.",
      "Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax County should reap the benefits.",
      "\"I have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the big picture,\" Smith said. \"Data centers are not going away.\"",
      "On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the 4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia river.",
      "Last year, AWS paid roughly $34 million in property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a $66 million tax break. Those payments, in addition to $1.7 in charitable donations from the company in 2023, have been instrumental in updating infrastructure and bolstering services. These funds have gone toward a new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer and $5,000 grants for homebuyers so far totaling at least $2.8 million.",
      "\"This road right here? Wouldn't happen if it wasn't for AWS,\" said Boardman Mayor Paul Keefer, riding in the passenger seat of Police Chief Rick Stokoe's cruiser, pointing out the window at construction workers shifting dirt and laying pavement.",
      "AWS has cultivated relationships with local officials including Keefer and Stokoe, who have both been in positions to vote on whether to authorize tax breaks with the company. Some former county commissioners and residents worry that those relationships are too cozy.",
      "Kevin Miller, AWS's vice president of global data centers, said in an interview with the Associated Press that \"our interest is in being a model corporate citizen, to really be partners with those communities.\"",
      "Skepticism of the deals started years ago, when three formerly elected officials allegedly helped approve data center deals while also owning a stake in a company that contracted with AWS to provide fiber optic cables for the data centers. In June, they each paid $2,000 to settle an ethics complaint.",
      "Those officials are no longer in office. But the latest data center deal struck between Morrow County officials and AWS, which gives the company an estimated $1 billion in tax breaks spread over the 15 years to build five new data centers, again raised eyebrows.",
      "Two former Morrow County Commissioners, Jim Doherty and Melissa Lindsay, pushed unsuccessfully in 2022 for AWS to pay more in taxes in new data center negotiations.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 19:28:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Craig Garriott has built satellites for Boeing for nearly three decades.",
    "story": [
      "Whether it's providing internet to storm-ravaged communities or supporting American troops at war, Craig Garriott has long believed the satellites he builds for Boeing helped protect lives.",
      "Now, Garriott, 53, says, it's the lives of hundreds of technicians at the Boeing facility where he has worked for nearly three decades that need protecting from company management.",
      "\"They've taken the focus off quality, the focus off the people on the floor, and they've put it completely on profit and going fast,\" Garriott said in an exclusive interview with CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave. \"I'm afraid with Boeing in the hands that it's in now down here, they're not gonna listen to me until somebody dies.\"",
      "He said efforts by Boeing executives to boost production at the company's Los Angeles-area military and commercial satellite plant have led to a \"toxic culture\" that has put workers there in danger. Garriott recalled how a four-ton satellite estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars crashed to the factory floor after it wasn't properly secured \u2014 an incident so catastrophic he compared it to \"a plane falling out of the sky.\"",
      "\"One person was underneath that satellite and they barely got out,\" said Garriott, who also represents 600 hourly workers as the head of the local carpenters union. \"It's the worst thing that can possibly happen on a site.\"",
      "A Boeing spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about the incident. In a statement to CBS News, the spokesperson said, \"Boeing is dedicated to the safety of its employees, and all employees are empowered and encouraged to report any safety concerns.\"",
      "Garriott's allegations echo concerns raised by multiple whistleblowers who have worked on Boeing's commercial airliners, including the troubled 737 MAX. And they add to struggles already facing Boeing's space division.",
      "The most high-profile Boeing space failure occurred in September, when the company's Starliner spacecraft experienced a cascade of technical troubles on a manned test flight to the International Space Station. NASA considered the return flight too risky, and sent it back to Earth without the two astronauts it had planned to shuttle home. Those astronauts will instead travel back next year in a capsule built by rival SpaceX and its CEO Elon Musk.",
      "Tapped by President-elect Trump to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, Musk is set to potentially wield enormous influence over lucrative space and defense contracts, which could put Boeing at a further disadvantage.",
      "Boeing, the company that helped put a man on the moon, is now exploring a new course \u2014 indicating it may sell off parts of its space business, according to a recent report in the Wall Street Journal. During Boeing's October earnings call, new CEO Kelly Ortberg suggested he was reevaluating the company's portfolio.",
      "\"We're better off doing less and doing it well than doing more and not doing it well,\" Ortberg said.",
      "The Boeing spokesperson did not respond to questions about how the company views competition from SpaceX or about steps it is taking to prepare for the incoming administration.",
      "Garriott estimates he's raised 300-400 safety violations over past year",
      "Acquired by Boeing in 2000, the satellite manufacturing facility has long been considered one of Boeing's more stable business units. It relies in part on a union workforce that Garriott said is responsible for constructing and testing satellites and their component parts.",
      "\"This is perhaps the most technical group of hourly people that you'll probably find on this planet,\" said Garriott, who estimated he's raised between 300 and 400 safety violations over the past year. Those complaints, he said, range from obstructed fire extinguishers and fire alarms to concerns over heavy machinery blocking exits and trapping workers in certain parts of the factory.",
      "In October, union workers filed a complaint with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration that, according to Garriott, highlighted unsafe conditions on the factory floor.",
      "Another technician at the facility, who spoke to CBS News on the condition he remain anonymous to protect his job, said safety had become \"an afterthought\" and quality had \"degraded\" over the past five to six years.",
      "\"You speak up now, you're a troublemaker\"",
      "Garriott sued Boeing in April alleging company management retaliated against him for raising safety issues. He said he's been harassed by leadership at the facility and has been the target of dozens of corporate investigations that he says turned up nothing and were only meant to intimidate him.",
      "\"When I first started at Boeing, the guys that spoke up and said, 'Hey, this doesn't feel right,' those guys were revered,\" Garriott said. \"You speak up now, you're a troublemaker.\"",
      "In a statement, Boeing said it investigated Garriott's claims and disputed the allegations he made in his lawsuit.",
      "'We have strict policies prohibiting retaliation toward employees who raise concerns, and Boeing did not retaliate against Mr. Garriott,\" the Boeing spokesperson said.",
      "Garriott is the latest whistleblower claiming the company retaliated against him after raising safety concerns. John Barnett, a former quality manager at the company's 787 Dreamliner factory, died by suicide in March while in Charleston, South Carolina, giving testimony in his whistleblower retaliation case.",
      "Barnett's mother, Vicky Stokes, told CBS News in April she holds the aircraft manufacturing giant responsible for the grinding treatment that ultimately left her son despondent.",
      "\"If this hadn't gone on so long, I'd still have my son, and my sons would have their brother and we wouldn't be sitting here. So in that respect, I do,\" Stokes said when asked if she places some of the blame for her son's death on Boeing.",
      "In June, former Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told lawmakers on the Senate investigations subcommittee that Boeing's culture is \"far from perfect,\" but said the company is \"committed to making sure every employee feels empowered to speak up if there is a problem.\" He also said Boeing is working on improving \"transparency and accountability, while elevating employee engagement.\"",
      "Garriott said although his family fears he will endure further reprisals from Boeing, he's now speaking out publicly in an effort to improve conditions for workers he said he took an oath as union head to protect.",
      "\"I'm not gonna stop till I know that Boeing understands that these people mean something, they matter,\" Garriott said, urging company executives to open up a dialogue with workers on the factory floor. \"Make 'em feel like they matter. Make 'em feel like their safety matters.\"",

    "story": [
      "Luigi Mangione has been charged with murder in last week's deadly shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, according to court documents filed Monday night. The 26-year-old, who was identified earlier as a person of interest, was arrested on firearms and other charges in Pennsylvania after being spotted at a McDonald's in Altoona amid a massive manhunt for the shooter.",
      "Here's what we know about Mangione:",
      "Luigi Mangione identified as suspect in CEO shooting",
      "Before Mangione was officially identified as the suspect, New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch announced at a news conference Monday afternoon that he was believed to be a person of interest in the shooting.",
      "Officers in Altoona arrested Mangione on unrelated charges at a McDonald's there after a customer alerted an employee who called police, officials said. \"A Pennsylvania resident saw something early this morning at McDonald's and said something to our local police,\" Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said, praising the resident as \"a hero.\"",
      "The officers questioned Mangione, who was acting suspiciously, Tisch said.",
      "According to court documents, the Altoona officers found Mangione sitting at a table in the back of the McDonald's wearing a blue medical mask and looking at a laptop with a backpack on the floor near the table. When the officers asked him to pull the mask down, they recognized him from photos released to the media.",
      "\"My partner and I recognized him immediately,\" Altoona Patrolman Tyler Frye told reporters during a news conference Monday night. \"Just from what we saw in the media, with photos, videos, we just didn't even think twice about it, we knew that was our guy.\"",
      "Mangione was carrying multiple fraudulent IDs and a U.S. passport, Tisch said. One of the IDs matched the fake New Jersey ID that the shooting suspect used to check into a Manhattan hostel before the shooting, the commissioner said.",
      "When the Altoona officers asked Mangione for his ID at the McDonald's, he gave them the New Jersey ID, according to an affidavit submitted with a criminal complaint. When one officer was checking the ID with dispatchers, the other asked Mangione if he had been to New York recently, and Mangione \"became quiet and started to shake,\" according to the affidavit.",
      "\"That really invoked a physical reaction from the suspect,\" Altoona Deputy Police Chief Derek Swope told reporters Monday night. \"He became visibly nervous, kind of shaking at that question, and he didn't really answer it directly, so that statement alone really said a lot, and the suspect didn't have to say a lot after that question to show that, you know, he was very nervous at that point.\"",
      "Mangione provided his real name after he was told he would be arrested if he lied about his identity, according to the affidavit. When an officer asked Mangione why he lied about his name, he allegedly said, \"I clearly shouldn't have.\"",
      "Officers found a gun and a suppressor on Mangione that were consistent with the weapon used in the Dec. 4 shooting of Thompson, Tisch said. Police said the gun appeared to be a ghost gun. Clothing and a mask consistent with those of the suspect in the case were also recovered, police said.",
      "A handwritten document that \"speaks to both his motivation and mindset\" was also recovered from Mangione, Tisch said.",
      "\"We don't think that there's any specific threats to other people mentioned in that document, but it does seem that he has some ill will toward corporate America,\" NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told reporters.",
      "Mangione was charged\u00a0Monday evening with five counts in Pennsylvania: forgery, firearms not to be carried without a license, tampering with records or identification, possessing instruments of crime, and false identification to law enforcement.",
      "Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Mangione was initially cooperative and then stopped cooperating with investigators. He wasn't aware of Mangione having a criminal history.",
      "His LinkedIn says he worked at TrueCar, has Ivy League degree",
      "According to his LinkedIn account, Mangione worked as a data engineer at the car-buying website TrueCar. But a company spokesperson told CBS News that Mangione hasn't worked there since 2023.",
      "Mangione\u00a0graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2020, a Penn spokesperson confirmed to CBS News. He received a Master of Science   in engineering with a major in computer and information science, and a Bachelor of Science in engineering, majoring in computer science with a minor in mathematics, the spokesperson confirmed.",
      "While at Penn, he worked as a teaching assistant and founded a video game development club, according to his LinkedIn account.",
      "At Stanford University in California, Mangione was a head counselor for a pre-collegiate studies program during the summer of 2019, the university said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "He has ties to Honolulu",
      "Mangione's last known address was in Honolulu, Hawaii, Kenny told reporters. According to an Instagram video posted by the Surfbreak coliving community, Mangione had been living there at some point.",
      "\"We are aware that Luigi Mangione was a resident at the Surfbreak co-living's Honolulu location in 2022,\" Surbreak told CBS News in a statement. \"His alleged actions do not reflect the individual we knew, the values of Surfbreak as an organization, or our community. Reasonable people may disagree but violence is never the answer.\"",
      "Sarah Nehemiah, who knew Mangione during his time living at a co-living/working space called Surfbreak in Honolulu, said he left the community in April 2022 due to a lifelong back injury exacerbated by physical activity on the island.",
      "\"Mangione lived at Surfbreak from January 2022 until April of that year. It was our understanding that he left due to a lifelong back injury that was exacerbated by surfing and hiking. To our knowledge, nearly all members of Surfbreak from his tenure lost contact after he left. To our knowledge, he did return to Hawaii briefly in early 2023 and started a book club. Several members left due to discomfort in book choices,\" said Nehemiah, who says she is now acting as a spokesperson for several members of the community.",
      "A second source familiar with Mangione's stay at Surfbreak said back pain was a major theme of his life at that time. He tried to surf in Hawaii and was not able to. This appeared to be a source of pain and frustration for him, said the source.",
      "The background image on Mangione's X account shows an X-ray of a spine with hardware in it, reflective of previous surgery. It is not known if this is an X-ray of Mangione's spine. An orthopedist told CBS News that the image appeared to show a hardware fusion likely for spondylolisthesis.",
      "He's related to prominent Maryland family",
      "Mangione was born and raised in Maryland, Kenny said. He is related to a prominent Maryland family that owns country clubs, health care facilities and real estate companies, CBS News Baltimore\u00a0reported. He's also a cousin of Maryland state Delegate Nino Mangione, who represents parts of Baltimore County.",
      "Mangione's paternal grandparents, Nicholas and Mary Mangione, were real estate developers who purchased the Turf Valley Country Club in 1978 and Hayfields Country Club in Hunt Valley in 1986.",
      "They founded Lorien Health Systems in 1977, and operated WCBM, a Baltimore radio station. Luigi Mangione volunteered at Lorien Health Systems in 2014 while in high school, according to his LinkedIn.",
      "Mangione's family said Monday in a statement, \"Unfortunately, we cannot comment on news reports regarding Luigi Mangione. We only know what we have read in the media. Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi's arrest. We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved. We are devastated by this news.\"",
      "He graduated from the Gilman School in Baltimore",
      "Mangione graduated in 2016 from the Gilman School, an all-boys private school in Baltimore, according to his LinkedIn account. He was valedictorian for achieving the highest cumulative GPA over four years, according to his LinkedIn page. He captained the Gilman robotics team and also received a scholarship prize in 2014.",
      "James Sandberg, a former classmate of Mangione, told CBS Baltimore that, while he wasn't \"particularly close\" with Mangione, he knew him \"somewhat well\" and said, \"He was a nice kid.\"",
      "Sandberg said he was \"shocked\" after someone shared an article naming Mangione as a person of interest in the shooting.",

      "\"As of right now the information we're getting from Altoona is that the gun appears to be a ghost gun, may have been made on a 3D printer, with the capability of firing a 9mm round,\" NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said Monday. \"Obviously, that will come out during our ballistics testing.\"",
      "Earlier in the investigation, a law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation had told CBS News that police believed the suspect used a\u00a0B&T Station SIX\u00a0gun to carry out the shooting. Investigators visited gun dealers in Connecticut during their search. The gun used in the shooting had a long barrel and a\u00a0distinctive look, CBS News' Anna Schechter reported. In addition to the unusual gun, the words \"delay,\" \"deny\" and possibly \"depose\" appeared on shell casings and bullets recovered from the shooting scene, police said.",
      "What is a ghost gun?",
      "A privately made firearm, more commonly known as a ghost gun, is a firearm that has been assembled or completed by people other than licensed manufacturers, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.",
      "They're made without a serial number, which can make them difficult to track. Not all ghost guns are illegal and not all firearms are required to have a serial number. Ghost guns can be pistols, revolvers, rifles, shotguns, machineguns and more.",
      "From 2016 through 2021, there were more than 45,000 suspected ghost guns reported to the ATF as having been recovered by police from potential crime scenes.",
      "How do people usually make ghost guns?",
      "Ghost guns can be made using a 3D printer or assembled from a kit. The weapons can be produced for less than $200, though officials have put the average price at around $500, CBS News previously reported.",
      "In 2018, CBS News correspondent Carter Evans was able to purchase a kit for a gun similar to a Glock 9mm with no background check or waiting period. Kits online are available for everything from handguns to AR-15s and AK-47s.",
      "\"You can buy a box of firearms parts, and you can assemble those firearms together. And I've seen videos on YouTube, where you can see people doing it in record time \u2014 20, 30 minutes,\" Marvin Richardson, ATF acting director in 2022, has previously\u00a0said.",
      "Are ghost guns illegal?",
      "Not all ghost guns are illegal. According to the ATF, individuals can make their own firearms using a 3D printing or other process if the gun is \"detectable,\" as defined in the Gun Control Act.",
      "It's generally legal to make a firearm for personal use without a license,\u00a0according to the ATF.",
      "Some states, including New York \u2014 where Thompson's shooting happened \u2014 have additional laws related to ghost guns.",
      "What does a ghost gun look like?",
      "There are many types of ghost guns with a range of appearances. The ATF lists 10 categories of privately made firearms: pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, frame or receiver, machinegun conversion device, destructive device, machinegun, firearm silencer and any other weapon.",

      "A polygamist religious leader who claimed more than 20 spiritual \"wives\" including 10 underage girls was sentenced to 50 years in prison on Monday for coercing girls as young as 9 years old to submit to criminal sex acts with him and other adults, and for scheming to kidnap them from protective custody.",
      "Samuel Bateman, whose small group was an offshoot of the sect once led by Warren Jeffs, had pleaded guilty to a yearslong scheme to transport girls across state lines for his sex crimes, and later to kidnap some of them from protective custody.",
      "Under the agreement, Bateman pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit transportation of a minor for sexual activity, which carries a sentence of 10 years to life imprisonment, and one count of conspiracy to commit kidnapping, which is punishable by up to life imprisonment. He was sentenced to 50 years on each count, to be served concurrently.",
      "The rest of the charges were dismissed as part of the agreement.",
      "Authorities say that Bateman, 48, tried to start an offshoot of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints based in the neighboring communities of Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah. The fundamentalist group, also known as FLDS, split from the mainstream Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after Mormons officially abandoned polygamy in 1890.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Susan Brnovich sentenced Bateman after hearing statements in court by three teenage girls about the trauma they still struggle to overcome. Although they gave their names in court, The Associated Press does not name victims of sexual crime, and some appeared to still be minors.",
      "\"You should not have the opportunity to be free and never have the opportunity to be around young women, \" Brnovich told Bateman, noting that for a nearly 49-year-old man the 50-year sentence was effectively a life sentence.",
      "\"You took them from their homes, from their families and made them into sex slaves,\" the judge said. \"You stripped them of their innocence and childhood.\"",
      "After the sentencing, the teens, who were accompanied by women who appear to have been foster parents, hugged and wept quietly. They were escorted out of court by a half dozen men and women in jackets with the slogan \"Bikers Against Child Abuse.\"",
      "The alleged practice of sect members sexually abusing girls who they claim as spiritual \"wives\" has long plagued the FLDS. Jeffs was convicted of state charges in Texas in 2011 involving sexual assaults of his underage followers. Bateman was one of Jeffs' trusted followers and declared himself, like Jeffs, to be a \"prophet\" of the FLDS. Jeffs denounced Bateman in a written \"revelation\" sent to his followers from prison, and then tried to start his own group.",
      "In 2019 and 2020, insisting that polygamy brings exaltation in heaven and that he was acting on orders from the \"Heavenly Father,\" Bateman began taking female adults and children from his male followers and proclaiming them to be his \"wives,\" the plea agreement said. While none of these \"marriages\" were legally or ceremonially recognized, Bateman acknowledged that each time he claimed another \"wife,\" it marked the beginning of his illicit sexual contact with the woman or girl.",
      "Federal agents said Bateman demanded that his followers confess publicly for any indiscretions and he imposed punishments that ranged from public shaming to sexual activity, including requiring that some male followers atone for their \"sins\" by surrendering their own wives and daughters to him.",
      "Bateman traveled extensively between Arizona, Utah, Colorado and Nebraska and regularly coerced underage girls into his criminal sexual activity, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona said. Recordings of some of his sex crimes were transmitted across state lines via electronic devices.",
      "Bateman was arrested in August 2022 by state police as he drove through Flagstaff pulling a trailer. Someone had alerted authorities after spotting small fingers reaching through the slats of the door. Inside the trailer, which had no ventilation, they found a makeshift toilet, a sofa, camping chairs and three girls, 11 to 14 years old.",
      "Bateman posted bond but was soon arrested again, accused of obstructing justice in a federal investigation into whether children were being transported across state lines for his sex crimes. Authorities also took nine children from Bateman's home in Colorado City into protective custody.",
      "Eight of the children later escaped from foster care in Arizona, and were found hundreds of miles away in Washington state, in a vehicle driven by one of the adult \"wives.\" Bateman also admitted his involvement in the kidnapping plot.",
      "Federal prosecutors noted that Bateman's plea agreement was contingent on all of his co-defendants also pleading guilty. It also called for restitution of as much as $1 million per victim, and for all assets to be immediately forfeited.",
      "Seven of Bateman's adult \"wives\" have been convicted of crimes related to coercing children into sexual activity or impeding the investigation into Bateman. Some acknowledged they also coerced girls to become Bateman's spiritual \"wives,\" witnessed Bateman having criminal sexual activity with girls, participated in illicit group sex involving children, or joined in kidnapping them from foster care. Another woman is scheduled to be tried Jan. 14 on charges related to the kidnappings.",

    "summary": "Democratic governors met in Los Angeles over the weekend to discuss the way forward, as GOP is set to control all three branches of the federal government.",
    "story": [
      "Beverly Hills, California \u2014 Democrats, who are about to be locked out of power in Washington as Republicans take control of all three branches of government in January, see the state capitals run by Democratic governors as the clearest path of resistance to President-elect Donald Trump's second term.",
      "The 16 governors and three governors-elect who gathered for their annual conference in Los Angeles this past weekend welcomed areas of compromise they can find with a\u00a0Trump White House, but they're already planning which fights to pick and are considering how they'll proceed.",
      "Many of the governors at the conference were elected during the blue wave in 2018 and have experience working with a Trump White House, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"We were able to find ways,\" said Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, who was one of these governors and serves as the chair of the Democratic Governors Association. \"We really took a positive approach to it, and this time around, I think we'll end up doing the same thing, because really, we have no idea what's coming down. So, we'll evaluate it as it comes to us.\"",
      "Politically, Democratic governors are also primed to fill a leadership vacuum in the party in the coming years. Some potential 2028 presidential candidates have already been taking action.",
      "In early December, California Gov. Gavin Newsom launched a special session to \"safeguard California values\" and bolster funds for legal defenses against potential federal actions on abortion, climate and immigration. A week after the election, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker partnered with Colorado Gov. Jared Polis to start the \"Governors Safeguarding Democracy\" group, a think tank to create a \"toolbox\" of policies and responses to Trump's presidency.",
      "\"Anything that's happening right now in Washington, states are gonna be the front line of defense on that,\" said Democratic strategist Corey Platt, who was the DGA's political director from 2013 to 2018. \"There's always a disconnect from voters to D.C. Folks are always angry at D.C., and yet, states have to make things work every day.\"",
      "No \"perfect answer\" for 2024 losses",
      "Still fresh in the minds of these governors were the party's widespread losses in the 2024 election. North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein's victory in the governor's race\u00a0was an electoral bright spot for Democrats in the battleground state, where Vice President Kamala Harris lost by 3 points.",
      "He said he didn't \"have a perfect answer\" on why he won (though his\u00a0scandal-plagued GOP opponent helped give him an advantage) and Harris lost. Stein blamed a \"tough national environment,\" but noted that his state often splits their ticket: in seven of the last nine presidential elections, North Carolina has voted for a Republican for president and a Democrat for governor.",
      "\"People were definitely anxious economically, because they were seeing and feeling price increases,\" he said. \"Typically, when you're unhappy, you blame the party that's in control of the White House. Even if it's not nationally their fault.\"",
      "New Jersey and Virginia, a potential flip opportunity for Democrats, have off-year gubernatorial elections in 2025. The 2026 map is vast, with 36 states electing governors. Several of those states, such as Georgia, Nevada and New Hampshire, could be targeted pickups for the party. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear will be taking over as DGA Chair in 2026.",
      "\"Lifting up as many people as we can that are running on these common sense, common ground areas that people care about the most, will also create that critical mass for people to say the Democratic Party is for working people,\" said Beshear, the rare Democratic governor who has won in a Republican state.",
      "Platt, a former DGA political director, agreed that the 2026 gubernatorial races can help find \"the good surrogate for Democratic policy and Democratic ideas that has empathy, that folks can understand.\" He added that while a large number of governors are going to be \"in that conversation\" as the party recalibrates, it won't just be them.",
      "\"We're gonna need leaders that can speak to real people,\" he said. \"It doesn't happen because of a poll. It doesn't happen because of a tactic. It's real and authentic, and I'm excited to see how that happens.\"",
      "Courtney Alexander, communications director for the Republican Governors Association, opposes potential attempts by Democratic governors to counter the incoming Trump administration.",
      "\"The fact that Americans resoundingly rejected the Democratic Party agenda just one month ago, and yet Democrats continue to believe running against an agenda of lower costs, more safety, and more freedom is their winning message shows just how wholly out of touch they are with the country,\" Alexander told CBS News.",
      "Trump's mass deportation plan",
      "Some governors are laying the groundwork to counter Trump's plans for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.",
      "Trump said in an interview with NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that deporting undocumented migrants who are convicted criminals is the first priority in his mass deportation plan, but other, nonviolent undocumented migrants may also be subject to removal.",
      "\"I think you have to do it, and it's a hard \u2014 it's a very tough thing to do. But you have to have, you know, you have rules, regulations, laws. They came in illegally,\" Trump said.",
      "New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said while she'd accept federal assistance to help locate and deport undocumented migrants who are convicted criminals, there would be \"zero way\" she'd cooperate with a broader mass deportation plan.",
      "She noted her control over the state police force, said she wouldn't grant licenses for physical detentions, and said providing the federal government private information about undocumented residents would endanger transgender residents or women who travel from states with abortion bans.",
      "\"I don't doubt that he will make every effort,\" Lujan Grisham said about Trump and his mass deportation plan. \"He's going to have trouble executing that. But I also am not Pollyanna about how serious [he is].... I take him at his word, which is why I know what I must do and will do. And let's see if my strategy works the way that I think it will across the country.\"",
      "Kelly said she would not permit the Kansas National Guard \"to perform that kind of service\" and said it's not the job of the Kansas State Police either.",
      "\"No doubt, if there are things they push us to do that we think are wrong or illegal, we'll draw the line,\" said Kelly.",
      "Stein, who will be taking office as North Carolina governor in January, said the mass deportation of all undocumented migrants in his state \"would create real economic challenges,\" but he has doubts about how likely it is that the mass deportations will be implemented.",
      "\"[Trump] is a master of saying something and creating a great deal of noise, and then the reality may be different. I'm going to wait to see exactly what it is he ultimately proposes,\" Stein said.",

    "summary": "Consumers are venting frustrations about health insurance in wake of UnitedHealthcare CEO murder. Costs have outpaced inflation for years.",
    "story": [
      "Health insurance costs are far outpacing inflation, leaving more consumers on the hook each year for thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket expenses. At the same time, some insurers are rejecting nearly 1 in 5 claims. That double whammy is leaving Americans paying more for coverage yet sometimes feeling like they're getting less in return, experts say.",
      "Frustration over denials and medical costs has fueled an outpouring of vitriol against health insurance companies in the wake of the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Also last week, a similar outcry led Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to reverse a\u00a0decision\u00a0to limit anesthesia coverage during surgeries.",
      "The anger may be rooted in fears that unexpected medical costs could prove financially ruinous, as well as concerns that essential care could be denied by an insurer, putting health and well-being at risk even for those who have health insurance.",
      "Some of those anxieties are well-founded: The top\u00a0cause of bankruptcy in the U.S. is health care-related debt, underscoring the financial stresses that can stem from high medical costs.",
      "In fact, most adults say they worry about their ability to pay for health care services or unexpected medical bills, a sentiment shared by people regardless of whether they're financially comfortable or struggling, a KFF survey found earlier this year.",
      "In 2024, the average health insurance premium for families carried a price tag of $25,572 per year, while single workers paid an average of $8,951, representing a 6% and 7% increase from the year earlier, KFF data shows. Since 2000, the rise in health insurance premiums has outpaced inflation for all but a handful of years, the health policy research firm found.",
      "\"Unhappiness with insurers stems from two things: 'I'm sick and I'm getting hassled,' and the second is very much cost \u2014 'I'm paying more than I used to, and I'm paying more than my wages went up',\" said Rob Andrews, CEO of the Health Transformation Alliance, a cooperative representing major companies such as American Express and Coca-Cola that works on improving health insurance for their employees. \"A lot of people think they are getting less\" from their insurers, Andrews said.",
      "And while Americans have unhappily encountered other types of inflation in recent years \u2014\u00a0sky-high grocery prices\u00a0have been credited with helping President-elect Donald Trump claim victory last month \u2014 health insurance can take on an even more personal edge, Thomas pointed out.",
      "\"It's not like, 'How much do I have to pay for a lawn chair or a steak,'\" Andrews noted. \"People are sick or having some sort of health problem they are worried about.\"",
      "To be sure, people with employer-sponsored health insurance typically don't pay the full premium, as their employers pick up much of the tab.",
      "Yet KFF data shows that employees' share of their premiums are also on the rise, with a worker with family coverage typically paying premiums of $5,700 per year in 2017, the most recent year for that data, up from about $1,600 in 2000, KFF data shows. The average family deductible \u2014 the amount paid out-of-pocket before insurance kicks in \u2014 has increased from $2,500 in 2013 to $3,700 in 2023, according to KFF.",
      "About 81% of Americans last year said they were dissatisfied with the cost of health care in the U.S, a 16-year high, Gallup polling found.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, told CBS Mornings on Friday.",
      "Health insurance denials",
      "Aside from rising health insurance costs, Americans are also expressing anger at coverage denials, which a KFF analysis of nongroup qualified health plans in 2021 found impacted almost 1 in 5 claims. However, their study found denial rates varied considerably by insurer, with some as low as 2% while others were as high as 49%.",
      "\"When you are paying for something, and then they don't give it to you and they keep raising prices, of course you will be frustrated by that,\" noted Holden Karau, a software engineer who created a free service called\u00a0Fight Health Insurance to help people appeal their denials.",
      "Karau says she came up with the app, which uses AI to craft appeal letters, after her own and her dog's experience with insurance. Her pet insurer initially refused to pay for anesthesia for her dog's root canal, while Karau, who is transgender, said she dealt with many appeals to get her own procedures and surgeries covered by her insurance.",
      "More insurance companies are using AI to review claims and issue denials, which isn't always obvious to consumers. The shift to AI-based reviews has sparked lawsuits against insurers, with UnitedHealthcare sued last year by the families of two now-deceased customers who alleged the insurer knowingly used a faulty algorithm to deny elderly patients coverage for extended care deemed necessary by their doctors.",
      "\"With AI tools on the insurance side, they have very little negative consequences for denying procedures,\" Karau added. \"We are seeing really high denial rates triggered by AI. And on the patient and provider side, they don't have the tools to fight back.\"",
      "Most people may not be aware that they have the right to appeal a denial, Karau noted. The majority of people who are hit with a denial or billing errors don't contest, a study found earlier this year. For those that do, a first appeal will be dealt with by the insurer, but if that in-house appeal is also denied, you have the right to ask for an independent reviewer to look at your claim, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.",
      "\"There are multiple levels of appeal, and in my experience, I would say it's important to appeal until you at least get to an independent reviewer,\" Karau said. \"If you don't appeal, you won't get the care you need.\"",

      "If you have yet to buy a Christmas tree this year, take cheer \u2014 prices are roughly the same as in 2023.",
      "Growers weren't expecting to raise wholesale prices, according to an annual survey by the Real Christmas Tree Board, based in Howell, Michigan, and sponsored by annual fees paid by growers and importers.",
      "\"It's similar to last year. From what we're hearing, wholesalers are holding their prices,\" Jill Sidebottom, a spokesperson for the National Christmas Tree Association, a trade group that advocates for the tree industry, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The median price of a Christmas tree came to $75 in 2023, down from $80 in 2022.",
      "\"Since COVID, demand thankfully has been very high, and we appreciate that families are still putting up a real tree. The alternative is plastic, and that's not good for the environment,\" Lisa Angevine-Bergs, owner of the Angevine Farm in Warren, Connecticut, and executive director of the Connecticut Christmas Tree Growers told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's more expensive the closer to the city you get,\" she said.",
      "Christmas tree prices have risen over the last 15 years as supplies fell.",
      "\"The original tight supply goes back to 2008, when there was an oversupply and growers stopped planting as many,\" said Sidebottom, noting that it takes up to a decade to grow a tree. Extreme weather, including a 2021 heat dome, also killed a lot of trees in the Pacific Northwest, she added.",
      "Christmas trees are grown in every U.S. state, with Oregon, North Carolina and Michigan producing the most. Trees are also imported from Canada, with tree types including the Douglas fir imported from British Columbia.",
      "Drought conditions hit parts of the country in recent months, resulting in wildfires in parts of the East Coast and potentially sleepless nights for tree farmers, given roots that were not properly hydrated in the fall may not make it.",
      "\"We were very worried that it would impact the trees for this year. Thankfully we have not seen any issues,\" Angevine-Bergs said. \"We started cutting some trees early just to see, and in November we began realizing this year's trees are not going to be affected -- taller trees have deeper roots.\"",
      "The roughly 8-foot tree now standard for the Christmas holiday typically takes about eight years to grow, with a white pine, for instance, growing quickly and white fir and spruce trees taking longer.",
      "\"There's about a foot of growth a year, so you're sitting on your money a long time,\" Sidebottom said of the investment made by growers as they wait for their seedlings to sprout and flourish into mature trees.",
      "Just like the holiday shopping season, Americans have moved up the timing as to when they purchase Christmas trees. Last year, a third of Americans bought their Christmas trees during the week after Thanksgiving and another 33% made the purchase during the first week of December, according to a poll of 1,499 adults taken in August and September last year.",
      "Another 16% bought their tree in the second week of December; 14% claimed a tree before Thanksgiving; 3% in the third week of December and only 1% on Christmas Eve, the survey found.",
      "\"The trend now is earlier, even before Thanksgiving,\" Angevine-Bergs said.",
      "In decades past, \"We never sold trees before Thanksgiving,\" said Angevine-Berg of her roughly 50 acre farm, in the family for 156 years and selling Christmas trees since 1960. \"As a child, we were always busy on Christmas Eve, and now you wouldn't necessarily be open.

      "Fortnite players and other Epic Games customers tricked by the game maker into making unwanted purchases are set to receive refund payments from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).",
      "As part of a settlement first\u00a0announced\u00a0in December 2022, the video game maker has been ordered by the FTC to pay $245 million to resolve allegations that it used unlawful billing practices involving design tricks\u00a0known as dark patterns to get players to unintentionally rack up charges. It is the largest ever refund amount in a gaming case, the agency said.",
      "The FTC says it is sending more than 629,000 payments Monday, with more disbursements to come at a later date. About half of the first tranche of payments will be made through PayPal, and the other half will be checks. Collectively, customers will receive $72 million in refunds, according to the agency.",
      "How much money will each customer get?",
      "The average payment is around $114, the FTC said. Epic Games customers who are entitled to refunds selected their payment method when they submitted a claim form. Customers who chose to receive PayPal payments have 30 days to redeem the funds, while check recipients have 90 days to cash them.",
      "What did Epic Games do?",
      "The FTC alleges the Fortnite-maker used dark patterns along with a variety of other tactics to trick customers into making unwanted purchases.",
      "For example, a \"counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration\" led Fortnite players to easily incur unwanted charges with the press of a single button, according to the FTC. Additionally, trying to transition the game from sleep to wake mode often triggered unwanted purchases. Other times, pressing an \"adjacent button\" while trying to preview an item led to a charge.",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 14:29:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump says he'll end birthright citizenship, after years of criticizing the constitutional right.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump says he'll end birthright citizenship, after years of criticizing the constitutional right.",
      "In an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that aired Sunday, Trump said he's \"absolutely\" still planning to end birthright citizenship on Day One of his presidency. \"We have to end it,\" Trump told host Kristen Welker. In a video post in\u00a02023, Trump had said he'd sign an executive action to do so on the first day in office.",
      "What is birthright citizenship, and is it in the U.S. Constitution?",
      "Birthright citizenship automatically grants citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil, regardless of the parents' citizenship status.",
      "The Citizen Clause, under the 14th Amendment\u00a0to the Constitution, states that \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"",
      "Congress passed the 14th Amendment in 1866, during the Reconstruction period following the Civil War. In 1868, the amendment was ratified to extend citizenship to people born on U.S. soil, invalidating the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision, which barred slaves and descendants of slaves from becoming citizens.",
      "Why does Trump want to end birthright citizenship?",
      "Trump has been talking about ending birthright citizenship since his presidential campaign in 2015. In a policy paper at the time, he called birthright citizenship \"the biggest magnet for illegal immigration.\" In the 2023 video, Trump blamed birthright citizenship for \"birth tourism,\" in which he said migrants spend the final weeks of their pregnancies in hotels in order to give birth in the U.S. and then use the child's citizenship status to bring relatives into the U.S. through \"chain migration,\" also known as family-based migration.",
      "During his first term, Trump pledged to end birthright citizenship but did not do so. He told \"Meet the Press\" that he had planned to sign an executive action on birthright citizenship before his focus turned to fighting COVID-19.",
      "Trump called the guarantee of citizenship by birth \"ridiculous,\" telling Welker that the U.S. is the only country with birthright citizenship. In fact, dozens of other countries have birthright citizenship.",
      "\"If somebody sets a foot \u2014 just a foot, one foot, you don't need two \u2014 on our land, congratulations, you are now a citizen of the United States of America,\" Trump complained. \"We're going to end that because it's ridiculous.\"",
      "Opponents of birthright citizenship say it was never intended to cover undocumented immigrants' children or so-called \"birth tourism.\" They contend the amendment was ratified to eliminate barriers to birthright citizenship based on race.",
      "More broadly, the pledge is part of what Trump has billed as a radical shift on immigration that he campaigned on, part of a promise to target both unauthorized and legal immigrants using unprecedented measures likely to test the limits on his authority.",
      "Can Trump end birthright citizenship?",
      "When asked whether he could get around the 14th Amendment through executive action, Trump acknowledged \"it would maybe have to go back to the people, but we have to end it,\" which seemed to indicate he might try to initiate a constitutional amendment to end the right, if necessary. He clarified that he would pursue an end to birthright citizenship through executive action \"if we can.\"",
      "Could Trump repeal birthright citizenship through executive action?",
      "\"The answer is no,\" said Michael LeRoy, professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign School of Labor and Employment Relations and College of Law. That's because the president lacks the authority to unilaterally change the Constitution.",
      "Eliminating birthright citizenship through a constitutional amendment would be nearly impossible as well, because of the widespread approval needed not only from Congress but also from the states.",
      "What's enshrined in the Constitution can't be altered\u00a0by a regular congressional vote, either. Amendments not only have to be approved by a two-thirds vote in both chambers of Congress, but ratified by three-fourths of state legislatures, or three-fourths of conventions called in each state for ratification. It's an extensive process with a high bar.",
      "The only time in U.S. history a constitutional amendment has been repealed was when the 18th Amendment prohibiting the manufacture, sale and transportation of intoxication liquors, better known as prohibition, was repealed in 1933 through the addition of the 21st Amendment, LeRoy noted.",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina says he's working on drafting a constitutional amendment to end the practice.",
      "Do other countries besides the U.S. have birthright citizenship?",
      "The U.S. is far from the only country with birthright citizenship, although birthright citizenship without conditions is more common in North and South America than it is in the rest of the world.",
      "Unlike some countries, the U.S. does not require a parent to be a citizen for a child born on U.S. soil to become a citizen. It's automatic.",

    "story": [
      "Awards season kicked off with a bang for Selena Gomez, who on Monday received Golden Globe nominations for her performances on both the big and small screens.",
      "Gomez, who was already a two-time Golden Globe nominee, earned nods this year in the categories for best actress in a musical or comedy TV series and best supporting actress in a motion picture. Mindy Kaling and Morris Chestnut unveiled the nominees in a televised presentation Monday morning at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles.",
      "The best actress nomination went to Gomez for her role in the Hulu mystery series \"Only Murders in the Building,\" which she reprised for a fourth run in August after previously gleaning acclaim for her work on its earlier seasons. Gomez's last two Globe nominations were in the same category for \"Only Murders.\" Her co-stars, Steve Martin and Martin Short, have received equivalent nods in the best actor category each year since the show became eligible for consideration at the awards ceremony.",
      "For best supporting actress, Gomez was nominated for \"Emilia P\u00e9rez,\" the Spanish-language musical thriller from French director Jacques Audiard about a Mexican cartel boss undergoing gender-affirming surgery. Gomez co-starred in the film alongside Zoe Salda\u00f1a, whose performance also earned a Golden Globe nomination for best supporting actress in a motion picture.",
      "Gomez praised Salda\u00f1a in a social media post reacting to the nominations.",
      "\"I don't even know what to write.. I'm so proud of @zoesaldana and I am so grateful and honored @goldenglobes,\" she wrote in a video caption  on her Instagram Stories, which captured the moment Gomez heard her name in the category for best supporting actress in a movie.",
      "\"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" led Monday's Golden Globes nominations with 10 nods in total, across multiple acting categories in addition to directing, screenwriting and music. (Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, who plays the titular character, was also nominated.) \"Only Murders\" is also a top competitor, with four nods tying the show in second place among TV contenders. It is tied with \"Sh\u014dgun\" and second only to \"The Bear.\"",
      "Gomez called out Gasc\u00f3n in another Instagram post, along with the French composers Cl\u00e9ment Ducol and Camille, who worked on \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" and received Golden Globe nominations for best original song and score.",
      "\"@karsiagascon mi amor I am so proud and grateful to know you!\" Gomez wrote, before congratulating Audiard, Ducol and Camille.",
      "Nominating an actor in two categories for their work in multiple projects at one awards show is uncommon, but it has happened at the Golden Globes before. Over the last decade, Amy Adams, Regina King and Alicia Vikander are just some of the celebrities who have competed in dual Globes races during a single year. Among the pool of 2025 nominees, Gomez and Sebastian Stan were the only actors recognized in multiple acting categories for multiple roles.",
      "Stan, of \"Pam & Tommy\" fame, was nominated in the best actor categories for musical or comedy film as well as drama. He received the nods for his lead roles in the dark comedy \"A Different Man\" and the controversial biopic \"The Apprentice,\" where he portrayed a young Donald Trump.",

      "The Lebanon, Tennessee-based restaurant chain said that its inability to accommodate the party was unrelated to the students' abilities, but that the situation was nonetheless \"unfortunate.\"",
      "\"Our missteps last week were unfortunate but were unrelated to the students' capabilities,\" Cracker Barrel said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch Monday. \"They were due to our inability to accommodate a party of 18 that arrived when we were facing unexpected staffing issues and had partially closed our second dining room.\"",
      "The chain conceded that its response led to misperceptions on the part of its guests and the public. \"Our failure to follow certain operational protocols combined with poor communication on our part then led to misunderstandings and misperceptions,\" it said.",
      "In a public letter posted Thursday, Charles County Public Schools superintendent Maria Navarro alleged that a group of 11 students and seven faculty visited Cracker Barrel in Waldorf as part of an organized outing and was \"refused service.\" The visit was part of programming that aims to help students with special needs practice skills they learn in the classroom in real-life settings within the community, including at local restaurants and retail establishments.",
      "Navarro contends that the school district had notified the restaurant of the planned visit and was told reservations were not required. Upon arrival, however, the group was denied service. They were able to order food to-go, the letter said.",
      "\"The alleged treatment of CCPS students, and staff, at Cracker Barrel is one that no one should experience.\u202fHowever, it is encouraging to learn that the district manager said the business would be willing to work with CCPS to do better,\" Navarro said.",

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 10:36:49 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Monday declined to take up a Hawaii man's appeal of his prosecution for carrying a handgun without a license.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday declined to take up a Hawaii man's appeal of his prosecution for carrying a handgun without a license, leaving untouched a state supreme court decision that castigated its new framework for determining whether gun laws comport with the Second Amendment.",
      "Justice Clarence Thomas, in a statement joined by Justice Samuel Alito, criticized the Hawaiian court for its ruling, but said the high court was right to dismiss the challenge on technical grounds. However, he wrote that the court should hear an \"appropriate case\" to \"make clear that Americans are always free to invoke the Second Amendment as a defense against unconstitutional firearms-licensing schemes.\"",
      "The court laid out the so-called \"history and tradition\" standard in a landmark Second Amendment decision in June 2022. The test requires the government to show that a gun law is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation.",
      "The Supreme Court provided some clarity about its new standard this past June, when it upheld a federal firearms prohibition for alleged domestic abusers, but lower courts have still struggled to apply the framework when assessing the constitutionality of firearm restrictions. That decision involved whether certain categories of people \u2014 namely those found to pose a credible threat to others \u2014 can be temporarily disarmed.",
      "The case from Hawaii involved the state's rules for licenses to carry handguns in public. Under the state's scheme, residents must obtain a permit to legally own a firearm. Those who want to carry a gun publicly also must obtain a carry license, which can be acquired by demonstrating an \"urgency or need,\" good moral character and that they are \"engaged in the protection of life and property.\"",
      "Applicants also have to be at least 21 years old and a U.S. citizen. Police departments had the discretion to deny licenses.",
      "In December 2017, Christopher Wilson was arrested after he and a group of hikers were found on a trail running through private property into the West Maui Mountains. Wilson and his fellow hikers told police they didn't see \"no trespassing\" signs on the property and were headed into the mountains to look at the moon and planets. Wilson also told police he had a weapon, and a loaded pistol was seized from his waistband.",
      "Wilson didn't have a permit to acquire a gun or a license to carry it and was charged with violating Hawaii laws for carrying or possessing a handgun.",
      "Wilson sought to dismiss the charges on the grounds that they violated his Second Amendment rights under two recent Supreme Court decisions, one of which said the Constitution guarantees the right to keep a handgun in the home for self-defense.",
      "Wilson's bid to toss out the charges was denied, but soon after, the Supreme Court handed down its June 2022 ruling that expanded gun rights and laid out its history-and-tradition test for evaluating the constitutionality of firearms rules.",
      "On the heels of that decision, Wilson again sought to have the charges against him dismissed, arguing that under the Supreme Court's standard, he was legally allowed to carry a firearm for self-defense, and the state had to justify its licensing scheme.",
      "A trial court sided with Wilson and dismissed the charges against him. But the Hawaii Supreme Court reversed that decision and concluded that prosecuting Wilson for carrying a handgun didn't violate the Constitution. The Hawaii court also lambasted the nation's highest court for its Second Amendment rulings.",
      "The state supreme court claimed that the Supreme Court \"distorts and cherry-picks historical evidence\" in its Second Amendment cases and accused the high court of ad-libbing a new standard for evaluating gun laws.",
      "Referencing the Supreme Court's latest decision, the Hawaii Supreme Court said its new test is a \"backward-looking approach\" that \"ignores today's realities.\"",
      "\"The spirit of Aloha clashes with a federally-mandated lifestyle that lets citizens walk around with deadly weapons during day-to-day activities,\" Hawaii's highest court wrote.",
      "Wilson, represented by public defenders, appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the Hawaii court showed \"open hostility to the individual rights protected by the Second Amendment.\"",
      "They warned in a filing that refusing to apply the court's history-and-tradition test \"upends the constitutional order between the States and the national government. When constitutional rights are incorporated under the Fourteenth Amendment, the states must recognize them.\"",
      "Writing on Monday, Thomas said the decision by the Hawaii Supreme Court \"failed to give the Second Amendment its due regard.\"",
      "\"Had the Hawaii Supreme Court followed its duty to consider the merits of Wilson's defense, the licensing scheme's unconstitutionality should have been apparent,\" he wrote.",
      "But Thomas noted that \"correction of the Hawaii Supreme Court's error must await another day,\" since Wilson sought to dismiss only some of the charges and asked the court to review an \"interlocutory order over which we may not have jurisdiction.\" Thomas said that Wilson could ask the court to review the case again after trial.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch echoed that sentiment in a statement of his own, writing that \"Mr. Wilson remains free to seek this Court's review after final judgment.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday turned away a challenge to race-neutral admissions criteria at three prestigious Boston high schools that aimed to increase the racial and economic diversity of their student bodies.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch noted that the schools have since changed the admissions policy, which \"greatly diminish[es] the need for our review.\" Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, disagreed with the decision not to hear the case.",
      "The challenge came on the heels of the Supreme Court's June 2023 decision that struck down affirmative action at higher-education institutions and said race can no longer be used as a factor in admissions decisions.",
      "Schools nationwide are now weighing how to better diversify their student bodies without running afoul of the Supreme Court's ruling, and are looking to other factors like zip codes and socioeconomics that can be taken into consideration to achieve that objective.",
      "In Boston, admission to the three so-called \"Exam Schools,\" Boston Latin Schools, Boston Latin Academy and the John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, was based on a combination of a student's score on a standardized test, grade point average and preference. But the COVID-19 pandemic roiled the admissions process, as it became difficult to administer its exam-based process.",
      "Under admissions criteria revised in light of the impact of the pandemic, 20% of seats were awarded based on students' GPA and the rest of the seats went to students with the highest GPAs from each of Boston's zip codes.",
      "The admissions process launched in November 2020 and closed in January 2021. Under the revised criteria, 43% of incoming students were economically disadvantaged, an increase from the prior year. Of those admitted to the exam schools, 31% were White, 23% Black, 23% Hispanic, and 18% Asian, according to court filings.",
      "Under the old plan, 39% of invited students were White, 21% Asian, 21% Hispanic and 14% Black.",
      "The criteria was only in effect for one year, and beginning with the 2022-2023 school year, the school system put in place a new plan that relies on grades, census tracts and performance on a standardized test.",
      "In February 2021, the Boston Parent Coalition for Academic Excellence sued the Boston School Committee, which oversees the city's public school system, and superintendent on behalf of 14 anonymous White and Asian students who claimed they applied for admission to the exam schools that fall. They sought to bar the committee from implementing the plan.",
      "A federal district court sided with the school system, finding that the revised admissions criteria did not violate the Constitution and was racially race neutral. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit upheld that decision, finding in part that the Boston School Committee's use of neutral selection criteria to increase racial diversity was allowed by the Supreme Court.",
      "The coalition appealed to the high court, arguing that the admissions criteria was designed to reduce the number of Asian American and White students who were allowed to attend the three exam schools. The parents argued that under the 1st Circuit's decision, a school district could \"openly target\" students based on their race.",
      "\"Should the court turn away this case, it will only embolden government officials to continue targeting disfavored racial groups \u2014 particularly, Asian Americans,\" they argued in a filing.",
      "But the Boston School Committee argued that there is no longer a controversy for the Supreme Court to decide. The admissions criteria at the center of the challenge was adopted for one year when the COVID-19 pandemic made it impossible to administer its existing exam-based process, it said.",
      "Lawyers for the school district also said the temporary admissions plan was developed and ended before the Supreme Court's affirmative action decision.",
      "\"Nothing in this Court's precedent mandates that a public body be blind to whether its race-neutral policies will have a disparate impact on historically disadvantaged groups, or even help reduce past disparate impacts,\" they said.",
      "Alito wrote that the Supreme Court, through its decision not to hear the case, has \"now twice refused to correct a glaring constitutional error that threatens to perpetuate race-based affirmative action in defiance of Students for Fair Admissions,\" referring to the 2023 case.",
      "The Supreme Court already has been asked to step into two recent disputes over admissions policies at a prestigious Virginia high school and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.",
      "In February, the justices turned away a challenge to the admissions criteria at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. Administrators said the policy is designed to mitigate socioeconomic and geographic barriers for prospective students.",
      "The high court also said it would not stop West Point from considering race in its admissions process while a legal fight over its policies plays out before a federal appellate court.",

      "\"I've brought a massive box of Kleenex and my waterproof eyeliner,\" she laughed.",
      "Coppola received a tribute filled with previous Kennedy Center honorees, including Robert De Niro, Martin Scorsese, Al Pacino and George Lucas. All described an iconoclastic and driven auteur who loved to nurture and support younger filmmakers.",

      "Sandoval's tribute featured multiple performances from an all-star band featuring Trombone Shorty and pianist Chucho Valdez from Sandoval's original band, plus a flamenco dance performance by Timo Nunez. It also included a bit of light roast comedy from actor Andy Garcia.",
      "\"Arturo spoke very little English when he first came to America from Cuba all those years ago,\" Garcia said. \"But now his English ... is much worse.\"",
      "The tribute performances are often kept secret from the recipients themselves, most notably in 2018 when Cyndi Lauper flat-out lied to her longtime friend Cher about being unable to attend. Lauper appeared on stage to perform Cher's hit, \"If I Could Turn Back Time.\"",
      "At a ceremony at the White House before attending the awards event itself, President Biden praised each honoree. He also had De Niro, who was in the audience, stand before declaring, \"If I get in trouble, I'm coming to you pal.\"",
      "De Niro grinned and nodded and others in attendance, including the honorees, laughed at what appeared to be a reference to De Niro sometimes playing hardnosed enforcers in movies like \"The Godfather.\" But Biden actually meant he might seek the actor's help for post-presidency career advice.",
      "\"Things are not looking good for February,\" Biden joked.",

      "During Donald Trump's first four years in office, Kennedy Center officials were forced to walk a public tightrope between the tradition of the president attending the ceremony and the open antipathy toward Trump from multiple honorees. In 2017, recipient Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Trump attended. Trump, who takes office in January, skipped the ceremony for the entirety of his first term.",

    "summary": "The Philippines' Kanlaon volcano erupted for nearly four minutes, shooting ash 2.5 miles into the sky and prompting the emergency evacuation of some 87,000 people.",
    "story": [
      "Manila \u2014 A volcano briefly erupted in the central Philippines on Monday, sending a huge ash column high into the sky as the government ordered the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from surrounding villages. Rising more than 8,000 feet above sea level on the central island of Negros, Kanlaon is one of 24 active volcanoes in the Philippines.",
      "A nearly four-minute eruption Monday afternoon sending a 2.5-mile ash column above the crater and a deadly spurt of hot ash, gases and fragmented volcanic rock about 2 miles down the mountain's southeast flank, officials told a news conference. The nation's volcano alert level was raised, indicating more explosive eruptions could still follow.",
      "There were no reported casualties from Monday's eruption, but volcanic ash fell across a wide area, including in Antique province, some 120 miles across the sea to the west of the volcano. The ash cloud obscured visibility and created a potential health risk, officials warned.",
      "\"Getting hit by these pyroclastic density currents is like being run over by a high-speed vehicle,\" said Maria Antonia Bornas, volcano monitoring chief of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology.",
      "\"If the ash enters your lungs it would cause asphyxiation,\" she said, urging local officials to evacuate 15 villages within six kilometres of the crater.",
      "She said ash from the eruption rained down on several nearby towns and cities around the volcano and warned heavy rain could dislodge the fresh volcanic sediment from the latest eruption, which could bury communities below.",
      "About half of a dozen domestic flights and one bound for Singapore were canceled Monday and Tuesday due to the eruption, according to the Philippine Civil Aviation Authority.",
      "\"Evacuations are ongoing\" in four upland villages of La Castellana town, on the volcano's southwest slope, municipal police officer Staff Sergeant Ronel Arevalo told AFP, adding he did not have the total number of residents to be evacuated. The Philippine government said in a notice posted on its official information agency website that an \"urgent evacuation operation is underway, affecting approximately 87,000 residents\" in the area around the volcano.",
      "La Castellana resident Dianne Paula Abendan, 24, used her mobile phone to take a video clip of a giant cauliflower-shaped grey mass of smoke billowing above the crater.",
      "\"These past few days we've seen black smoke coming out of (the) volcano. We were expecting that it would erupt anytime this week,\" she told AFP by phone.",
      "Abendan said people rushed home to await evacuation orders, but added that the volcanic activity appeared to ease slightly about an hour later.",
      "Authorities said flights to and from the Bacolod-Silay international airport, nearest the volcano, remained normal, but carriers were warned from flying below 10,000 feet near the volcano.",
      "\"Flight operators are advised to avoid flying close to the volcano due to possible hazards of sudden steam-driven or phreatic eruptions and precursory magmatic activity,\" said an official bulletin from the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines.",
      "In September, hundreds of nearby residents were evacuated after the volcano spurted thousands of tons of harmful gases in a single day. The seismology office said Kanlaon has erupted more than 40 times since 1866.",
      "In 1996, three hikers were killed due to ash ejection from the volcano.",

      "Washington \u2014 The collapse of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria has raised hopes that more information could come to light on the whereabouts of journalist Austin Tice, who is believed to still be alive more than 12 years after his kidnapping.",
      "After a rebel offensive brought an end to the 50-year rule of the Assad family on Sunday, President Biden expressed optimism that Tice could be returned to the U.S.",
      "\"We think we can get him back, but we have no direct evidence of that yet,\" Mr. Biden said at the White House Sunday. \"We have to identify where he is.\"",
      "Tice, a Marine veteran and freelance journalist disappeared on Aug. 14, 2012, while he was reporting on the Syrian civil war. Weeks later, a short video appeared online that showed a distressed Tice blindfolded with his apparent captors. It was the last time he was seen.",
      "Though no one has ever claimed responsibility for his disappearance, Mr. Biden previously said that the U.S. knows \"with certainty that he has been held by the Syrian regime.\"",
      "\"We remain committed to returning him to his family,\" Mr. Biden said Sunday.",
      "Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in an interview with \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday that the U.S. has been in engaged with its allies and others on the ground in Syria \"to track who's coming out of these prisons.\"",

      "State Department spokesman Matthew Miller confirmed Monday that the government's top hostage negotiator, Roger Carstens, is in neighboring Lebanon working on Tice's case.",
      "\"He is in Beirut to talk with people in the region, to talk with parties in the region, to collect information and to try to find out where Austin Tice is and get him home as soon as possible,\" Miller said.",

      "Tice family says \"significant source\" provided new details",
      "Two days before rebels toppled the Assad regime, Tice's parents and siblings questioned Sullivan about his case in a meeting they said had been planned for months.",
      "Debra Tice, his mother, said at a news conference later in the day that \"Austin Tice is alive\" and \"is being cared for and he is well.\" She said the information was from a \"significant source\" that had been vetted by the U.S. government.",
      "Marc Tice, his father, said the new information \"is very different\" from past leads.",
      "\"We are confident that this information is fresh. It indicates as late as earlier this year that Austin is alive and being cared for,\" he said.",
      "But the family also said they're frustrated with the U.S. government's inability to bring him home and said they received few assurances about the Biden administration's efforts.",
      "\"There just seems to be a massive disconnect between what President Biden has dictated for Austin in terms of doing everything that we can to bring him home, and then the actions and the behavior of the people that sit just below him,\" his brother Simon Tice said at the news conference.",
      "The family also blamed the U.S. government for preventing the release of information about the source of Austin Tice's well-being.",
      "In an interview with CBS News on Monday, his sister Naomi Tice called on the Biden administration and incoming Trump administration to use all the tools they have available to bring her brother home.",
      "\"We just really hope that they utilize this opportunity,\" she said.",

      "U.S. prosecutors are accusing two senior Syrian officials of overseeing a notorious torture center that abused peaceful protesters, including a 26-year-old American woman who was later believed to have been executed.",
      "The indictment was released Monday, two days after a shock rebel offensive overthrew Syrian President Bashar Assad. The U.S., U.N. and others accuse him of widespread human rights abuses in a 13-year battle to crush opposition forces seeking his removal from power.",
      "The war, which began as a largely nonviolent popular uprising in 2011, has killed half a million people.",
      "The indictment, filed Nov. 18 in federal court in Chicago, is believed to be the U.S. government's first against what officials say were networks of Assad intelligence services and military branches that detained, tortured and killed thousands of perceived enemies.",
      "It names Jamil Hassan, director of the Syrian air force's intelligence branch, who prosecutors say oversaw a prison and torture center at the Mezzeh air force base in the capital, Damascus, and Abdul Salam Mahmoud, who prosecutors say ran the prison.",
      "Victims included Syrians, Americans and dual citizens, the indictment said. The U.S.-based Syrian Emergency Task Force has long pushed federal prosecutors for action on one case, that of 26-year-old American aid worker Layla Shweikani.",
      "The group presented witnesses who testified of Shweikani's 2016 torture at the prison. Syrian rights groups believe she was later executed at the Saydnaya military prison in the Damascus suburbs.",

      "A spokesperson for the U.S.-based carrier said that it will evaluate a possible resumption in late 2025 of the only daily service out of Miami International Airport into Haiti by a major U.S. airline.",
      "This comes after The Federal Aviation Administration prohibited U.S. airlines from flying to Haiti for 30 days after gangs shot three planes. Further, the United Nations temporarily suspended flights to Port-au-Prince on Tuesday, limiting humanitarian aid coming into the country.",
      "The American Airlines statement read in part: \"American has made the difficult decision to suspend daily service between Miami (MIA) and Port-au-Prince, Haiti (PAP),\" the spokesperson said. \"We are proud of our more than 50-year-commitment to Haiti and we will continue to monitor the situation, assessing safety, security, and customer demand, in evaluating a return of service.

      "The WHO said Sunday that 406 cases of the disease have been recorded in the Kwango Province, approximately 435 miles southeast of the capital Kinshasa. More than half of those who died were children younger than 5 years old who were severely malnourished, the health agency said.",
      "The actual number of deaths in the region is difficult to determine, and some reports say as many as\u00a0143 people have died. A team of scientists from the World Health Organization is on the ground investigating the illness, which researchers believe started circulating in October.",
      "The DRC's Ministry of Public health sent an alert to WHO on Oct. 29 saying it was concerned about a mysterious illness that had caused \"increased\" deaths in the Panzi health region, according to the WHO. The ministry said in a press briefing on Dec. 5 that the mortality rate was about 8% and that several deaths were reported outside of health facilities.",

      "Titled \"Derailing the Tren de Aragua,\" the report offers U.S. leaders a starting point to understand the violent criminal organization that it says was \"honed and perfected inside Venezuelan prison walls then exported throughout the Western Hemisphere.\"",

      "\"The TdA is unique among criminal organizations because it has an ideology associated with it,\" Humire said in the report. \"Now that the TdA is already present in America, to fix this, a proper understanding of the TdA is necessary to detect their motives, tactics, and overall strategy of organized crime.\"",
      "What is Tren de Aragua?",
      "Humire, who is director of the Center for a Secure and Free Society and a Heritage Foundation fellow, told Fox News Digital that the first thing to understand about Tren de Aragua is that it is much more than a gang. Rather, it is an organized international terrorist effort backed by some of America\u2019s worst enemies to sow chaos and destabilize the U.S.",
      "Born from a Venezuelan prison more than a decade ago, Tren de Aragua, which means \"Train from Aragua,\" burst into the national consciousness in 2023 after reports of members of the group holding an entire apartment building hostage in Aurora, Colorado, a suburb of Denver.",

      "American media coverage and politicians have cast Tren de Aragua as a group of simple thugs and criminals. However, Humire\u2019s report emphasizes that Tren de Aragua is a state-sponsored transnational criminal organization sponsored by and embedded in the Venezuelan socialist government.",

      "While many comparisons have been drawn between Tren de Aragua and the El Salvadoran gang La Mara Salvatrucha 13 (MS-13), TdA is expanding much more quickly, which Humire said is likely due to its unique origin and state sponsorship in Venezuela.",
      "He also alleged that TdA\u2019s rapid expansion in the United States is a \"direct consequence of the Biden\u2013Harris Administration\u2019s failed immigration policies and lack of border enforcement.\"",
      "The Biden Cuban, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans parole program and the Venezuelan parole program before it have made it so that in many cases Venezuelan migrants are being waved into the country en masse with little to no vetting. Because of these policies, the Venezuelan population in the U.S. has grown by nearly 1 million \u2013 520.8% \u2013 becoming the fastest-growing nationality in the U.S. since 2021.",
      "The result has been that though TdA is new to the U.S., it now has a presence in more than 30 major U.S. cities and at least 100 federal investigations involving the group are underway, as the report puts it, \"catching most of the U.S. law enforcement community by surprise.\"",

      "How to \u2018derail\u2019 the train",
      "In the first 100 days of his new administration, Humire said Trump should follow the example set by Texas\u2019 efforts to root out the gang by delivering on his promise to launch an \"Operation Aurora\" to take a \"whole-of-government approach\" that uses federal resources within the Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the military to complement state-led law enforcement efforts as well as partner with Latin American allies to hit TdA from every angle.",
      "\"It is believed that the main TdA leaders have not yet arrived in America, meaning time is of the essence to take preventive measures,\" says the report.",
      "Humire said the Trump Department of Homeland Security should immediately label TdA a transnational terror group and mark Venezuelan migrants as \"special interest aliens.\" This designation would reverse the Biden administration\u2019s policy of waving in Venezuelan migrants and instead allow U.S. immigration officials to more properly vet Venezuelan migrants.",

      "What will Trump do?",
      "Humire said there are already positive signs from the Trump transition that the president-elect is serious about his promise to dismantle TdA.",

      "\"This is something that the Biden administration could have done. They had all the tools necessary to do that, but they missed the key ingredient, which is political will,\" he said. \"So, the political will in the new administration to tackle this issue is very high, going from the president down to his appointees and all throughout.\"",

      "A VPN could be your secret weapon to protect your identity and finances.",
      "VPNs (virtual private networks) are a powerful tool for securing your internet connection. They protect your data by encrypting it, making it harder for hackers or even your internet service provider (ISP) to see what you're doing online. But how should you set up a VPN?

      "How VPNs work",
      "VPNs operate through two primary mechanisms: IP address masking and data encryption. When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from their server network, effectively preventing websites and cyber criminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",
      "VPN on devices vs. router: What's the difference?",
      "Understanding the difference between using a VPN on individual devices vs. setting it up on your router is crucial for maximizing your online security and privacy.",
      "Most people are familiar with using a VPN app on their phone, laptop or tablet. In this setup, the device connects directly to the internet through the VPN, keeping that device's internet activity secure.",
      "With a VPN router, instead of installing a VPN on each device, the router connects to the VPN.

      "A VPN router ensures that every device on your network is protected, even those that don\u2019t support VPNs, like smart home devices or certain game consoles. Once the router is set up with a VPN, it encrypts the internet traffic of all connected devices.",
      "Installing or managing VPN software on every device is unnecessary with a VPN router. Once the router is configured, you can sit back and enjoy a protected internet connection across your entire home network. However, it\u2019s a good idea to occasionally check that the connection is working properly using tools like DNS leak tests.",
      "Using a VPN prevents your ISP from seeing which websites or services you\u2019re using. This is particularly useful if you\u2019re concerned about privacy or want to access geo-restricted content, such as streaming services like Netflix or gaming platforms.",
      "A home router (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Are there any downsides to VPN routers?",
      "While VPN routers are convenient, they do come with a few potential drawbacks.",
      "Most basic routers provided by your ISP don\u2019t support VPN connections. You\u2019ll likely need to purchase a more advanced, VPN-compatible router, which can be pricier, starting at around $50 and going much higher for premium models.",
      "Encrypting all the traffic in your home network requires processing power. If you have a lot of devices connected at once, a primary router might struggle to keep up. In this case, a higher-end router with more processing power is recommended.",
      "When you use a VPN app on a device, switching server locations, adjusting security settings or choosing different VPN protocols is easy. Making these changes on a VPN router requires logging into the router\u2019s settings, which can be more time-consuming and complicated.",

      "Choose a compatible VPN service: Select a VPN provider that supports\u00a0router installations. Look for services that offer comprehensive guides and customer support to assist you through the setup.",
      "Select the right router: Ensure your router is VPN compatible and has strong security features. Opt for\u00a0routers that support the latest Wi-Fi encryption standards, such as WPA3, and have built-in firewalls to protect against external threats. This will provide a solid foundation for your VPN connection.",
      "Install the VPN: Follow your VPN provider's step-by-step instructions to configure the service on your\u00a0router. This typically involves entering your login credentials, installing necessary certificates and selecting a server location.",
      "Test your connection: Once configured, verify that your VPN is functioning correctly by testing the connection. Ensure that all devices connected to the router are protected by the VPN.",
      "Leverage additional security features: Take advantage of your router\u2019s features such as guest networks and parental controls to enhance security further. A separate guest network prevents unauthorized access to your main network, while regular firmware updates from the manufacturer help mitigate vulnerabilities.",
      "By integrating these steps, you not only set up a VPN but also fortify your home network against potential cyber threats.",

      "While it might sound obvious, the first step to troubleshooting a computer that constantly crashes is ensuring everything is firmly plugged in. It's often the most overlooked step, so if you're using a desktop, you'll want to look behind your PC and ensure everything is plugged in. It would be best to try using a different electrical outlet to first rule out any electrical issues in your home.",
      "If you feel comfortable opening up your desktop PC, you can also go inside the case and ensure all your PCI connections are firmly plugged in.

      "Computer overheating is a common cause of intermittent shutdowns and crashes. If your CPU (central processing unit), essentially the brain of your computer, or graphics card gets too hot, your computer might shut down to ensure the components aren't damaged. If you notice that your laptop or desktop is giving off a lot of heat, or in the case of a laptop, it is hot to the touch, or if you notice your fans running louder than usual, these are all signs of overheating.",
      "If your computer is overheating, the first step is to clean it thoroughly. I recommend blowing dust out of the interior fans with compressed air and keeping your PC in an area where it can receive proper airflow. If you have a desktop PC, try not to keep it under your desk. Keeping a PC under a desk can cause issues with dust build-up and lack of airflow. It's best to keep your desktop in a part of your home or office where it can receive a decent amount of airflow.",

      "Hearing loss and other complications are prevalent among U.S. military veterans. Audiologist Dr. Tom Tedeschi shares why it's such a big issue and how vets should properly care for their ears.",
      "Have you ever found yourself needing to constantly turn the volume up on your TV because it sounds like the actors onscreen are speaking in whispers, but then whenever action is onscreen, your TV feels deafening? It's not just you.",
      "This is one of the most common issues people have with their TV audio, but, fortunately, you can change a few settings on your TV to make the dialogue sound clearer.",
      "Read on for three easy fixes to help your TV audio sound better.",

      "1. Check out your TV's audio settings",
      "A viewer adjusting TV audio settings with a remote control. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Most modern TVs feature preset audio settings that you can adjust on the fly to make things sound better, depending on whether you're gaming, watching a live concert or watching a slow-burn drama. Too much bass will often obscure spoken dialogue in TV shows and movies, and I suggest going through your TV's preset audio settings to see if you can make the audio clearer. Most TVs feature a movie, music and standard mode for TV audio. You can find your TV's audio presets by navigating to the settings from your remote and selecting \"sound.\"",
      "Some TVs will also feature audio presets explicitly designed for dialogue. Check to see if you have a setting for \"Dialogue,\" \"News,\" \"Speech\" or even \"Speech Boost\" in your TV audio settings. Any three of these should help your TV dialogue come through more clearly. You might also want to consider disabling settings for surround sound or bass boost, as these can cover up the sound of dialogue by increasing the bass too much.",
      "Increasing the treble might be worth it if you have access to EQ settings on your TV and are struggling to hear TV dialogue. It's an easy fix that can improve audio quality without taking too much away from non-dialogue sound in a movie or TV show.",
      "HOW TO EASILY CONNECT HEADPHONES TO YOUR TV FOR GREAT SOUND",
      "2. Adjust dynamic range compression",
      "A floor-standing speaker. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Dynamic range compression, or \"volume leveling,\" is useful for tailoring audio sound to personal needs. Volume leveling reduces the gulf between the loudest and quietest sounds onscreen, making it easier to hear and understand onscreen dialogue, especially in action movies, where the dialogue is often much quieter than the preceding action sequence. You'll find the settings for volume leveling or dynamic range compression in your TV audio settings, which, on most TVs, you can access directly from the remote.",
      "My TV features volume leveling, and I love to use it when I watch TV late at night at a low volume. It helps me to understand everything easily without having the speakers loud enough to wake anyone else up. It's also a great way to keep the audio level when commercials come on if you watch cable.",
      "BEST WAYS TO STREAM ANY CONTENT FROM YOUR PHONE TO A TV",
      "3. Look into speakers or a soundbar",
      "A speaker. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The default speakers built into TVs aren't the best. While a few high-level TVs come with a built-in soundbar, you'll still have the best experience with your own independent speakers or a soundbar. If you followed the two tips above but are still having trouble hearing movie or TV dialogue, it might be time to look into and invest in a set of speakers or, if you want a single unit,\u00a0a soundbar.",
      "I prefer using a soundbar with a TV over speakers for a cleaner setup because they often come with built-in subwoofers that enhance the bass, making action scenes and music sound more immersive. Additionally, modern soundbars are sleek and can easily blend with your home decor. Many of them also support advanced audio technologies like Dolby Atmos, which provides a surround sound experience without the need for multiple speakers scattered around the room.",

      "Check for a 3.5mm jack: Most TVs, especially older models, have a headphone jack located on the back or side panel. If your TV has this port, simply plug in your wired headphones for instant audio.",
      "Using adapters: If your TV lacks a headphone jack but has RCA outputs (the red and white ports), you can use an RCA-to-3.5mm adapter to connect your headphones.",
      "Bluetooth connection: Many modern TVs support Bluetooth. To connect:",

      "Select your headphones from the list of available devices to pair them.",
      "Bluetooth transmitter: If your TV doesn\u2019t have Bluetooth, consider using a Bluetooth transmitter. This device plugs into the TV\u2019s audio output (like the headphone jack or RCA ports) and sends audio wirelessly to your Bluetooth headphones.",
      "Media streamers: If you use devices like Roku or Apple TV, they often support Bluetooth connections for headphones, allowing you to listen privately through those devices instead.",
      "By connecting headphones, you can enjoy clearer dialogue without disturbing others, making it easier to follow along with your favorite shows and movies.",
      "BEST NOISE-CANCELING HEADPHONES TO BOOST YOUR LISTENING",
      "5. Explore Professional-Grade Hearing solutions",

For those with mild to moderate hearing loss, products like the\u00a0AirPods Pro 2 can double as hearing aids with customizable sound settings designed to enhance speech clarity. These devices are particularly useful when paired with your TV\u2019s Bluetooth, allowing for a clear and immersive listening experience.",

Designed for comfort and discretion, these nearly invisible hearing aids fit snugly behind or inside the ear, ensuring a seamless and natural listening experience.",

      "Scambaiting is when someone interacts with a scammer to waste their time and resources. Some of these online experiences are entertaining and even hilarious to watch.

      "Why scambaiting matters",
      "So, why should we care about scambaiting? This creative strategy offers several compelling benefits. First and foremost, it effectively wastes scammers' time. Every minute they spend on the phone with Daisy is a minute they can't use to target real victims. By keeping them occupied, we can potentially prevent them from scamming someone else.",
      "In addition to wasting time, scambaiting raises awareness about common scams. It serves as an educational tool, helping others recognize and avoid falling prey to similar tactics. The more people understand how these scams operate, the less likely they are to become victims. Moreover, watching scammers get flustered sheds light on the lengths these criminals will go to and highlights the importance of staying vigilant against their schemes.",

      "While scambaiting can be a fun way to fight back against scams, the best defense is simply not picking up and answering scam calls in the first place. One effective strategy is to consider investing in personal data removal services that wipe your information from public databases on the internet. By reducing your digital footprint, you can make it more difficult for scammers to contact you in the first place. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

However, there are some additional red flags beyond the ones we've already mentioned that can help you identify a fake email. Here are some of them:",
      "Check the sender\u2019s address and domain name. Fake emails often use spoofed or similar-looking addresses and domain names to deceive you. For example, an email from support@amaz0n.com or info@fedex.delivery.com is likely a phishing attempt. You'll notice in the Apple phishing email below the email address has just a bunch of letters and numbers. Always verify the sender\u2019s address and domain name before opening or responding to an email.",
      "Check the spelling and grammar. Phishing emails often contain spelling and grammar errors or use poor or unnatural language. For example, an email that says, \"Dear Customer, Your order has been shipped. Please confirm your delivery address by clicking here.\" It is suspicious because it does not address you by name, uses a generic greeting and asks you to click on a link. Always read the email carefully and look for any mistakes or inconsistencies.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Check the links and attachments. Fake emails often contain links and attachments that lead to malicious websites or download malware to your device. For example, an email that says, \"You have won a $100 gift card from Walmart. Click here to claim your prize.\" It is likely a scam. On a laptop or desktop, always carefully hover your mouse over the links and check the URL before clicking on them, and never open or download any attachments from unknown or suspicious sources.",
      "How to handle spam emails",
      "Use strong antivirus software: The first and most crucial step to protect yourself from accidentally clicking on fake links in spam emails is to have strong antivirus software installed on your device. This software can detect and block malicious emails and links, providing an extra layer of security.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "Do not open or reply to spam emails.\u00a0This can confirm your email address to the sender and encourage them to send you more spam. It can also expose you to malicious links or attachments that can harm your device or data.",
      "Mark spam email as junk or spam. Most email providers have a\u00a0feature that allows you to flag spam emails and move them to a separate folder. This can help you filter out spam emails from your inbox and also improve the spam detection of your email provider.",
      "Do not share your email address publicly or with unknown sources.\u00a0This can reduce the chances of your email address being collected by spammers. You can also use a disposable or\u00a0email alias for signing up for online services that you do not trust or need.",
      "Use a personal data removal service: Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams during the busy holiday season.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "If you realize that you have clicked on a link or opened an attachment from a fake email, don\u2019t panic. Here are some steps that you can take to minimize the damage and protect yourself:",
      "1. Disconnect your device from the internet.\u00a0This will prevent any further communication or data transfer between your device and the malicious website or\u00a0malware. You can do this by turning off your Wi-Fi or unplugging your ethernet cable.",
      "2. Scan your device for malware. Use a reputable\u00a0antivirus software to scan your device and remove any potential threats.

      "5. Monitor your accounts and credit reports.\u00a0If you have entered or provided any financial information on the malicious website or link you clicked on, you should monitor your bank accounts, credit cards and credit reports for any suspicious or unauthorized activity.",
      "6. You should also\u00a0contact your bank or credit card company and inform them of the incident. You may need to cancel or freeze your cards or accounts to prevent any further fraud.",
      "7. Report the phishing email.\u00a0You should also report the phishing email to the sender\u2019s legitimate organization, such as your bank, retailer or delivery service, and to the authorities, such as the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or the\u00a0Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG). This will help them to take action and prevent others from falling for the same scam.",
      "8. Use identity theft protection services\u00a0if you entered your personal information on any links you clicked on or websites that you were directed to. Identity theft protection companies can monitor your personal information (home title, Social Security number, phone number, email address) and alert you in the event they become breached. It can also alert you if any of these are being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",

You'll often find these apps on third-party app stores, shady websites, or through suspicious emails and texts. What you wouldn't expect is to encounter them on the Google Play Store if you're an Android user or the App Store if you're on iPhone.",
      "While Apple does a great job of keeping its app marketplace safe, Google doesn't quite measure up.",
      "A new report has revealed that over a dozen malicious apps containing SpyLoan malware have been available on the Play Store. These apps have been downloaded by 8 million Android users, putting them at risk of extortion, harassment and financial loss. Below are images of four of the SpyLoan apps found on Google Play.",

      "Images of\u00a0four of the SpyLoan apps found on Google Play (McAfee)",
      "What is SpyLoan malware?",
      "SpyLoan is malware often hidden in apps that promise instant loans. These apps reel people in with offers of quick, hassle-free loans, boasting low rates and hardly any requirements. While they might look legit at first glance, their real goal is to gather as much personal info as they can.",
      "Once they have it, they use it to harass or pressure users into paying ridiculous interest rates. They also use shady tactics like countdown timers or \"limited-time\" offers to create a fake sense of urgency, pushing people to act fast without thinking it through. Instead of helping with finances, these apps trap users in a cycle of debt and invade their privacy.",
      "McAfee's mobile research team has\u00a0uncovered 15 apps on the Google Play Store packed with SpyLoan malware. These apps use the same code and systems, targeting users worldwide to steal data and send it to command-and-control (C2) servers. Many of them hide behind fake names and logos that mimic legitimate financial institutions, making them look trustworthy at first glance. You can find the names of these apps in the screenshot added below.",

      "McAfee, an App Defense Alliance partner tasked with helping keep the Play Store safe, reported the apps to Google. Google took action, and the malicious versions of the apps are no longer available on Google Play.",
      "We reached out to Google, and a rep confirmed that Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by Google Play Protect. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android devices.",
      "ANDROID BANKING TROJAN EVOLVES TO EVADE DETECTION AND STRIKE GLOBALLY",
      "How do these predatory apps work?",
      "The goal of these malicious apps is to gather as much data as possible from infected devices, which they then use to extort users. Victims are often coerced into repaying loans at sky-high interest rates, with some even being threatened for delays. In extreme cases, the app operators have harassed victims' families and sent death threats, using stolen personal photos as leverage.",
      "These apps request intrusive permissions, giving them access to system data, cameras, call logs, contacts, location, and SMS messages. They justify this data collection by claiming it's necessary for user verification and anti-fraud measures.",
      "Users signing up for these services are verified through a one-time password (OTP) to confirm their phone number is from the target region. They are also pressured to share additional details like ID documents, bank accounts, and employment information.",

      "4 ways to protect yourself from SpyLoan malware",
      "1. Have strong antivirus software: Android has its own built-in malware protection called Play Protect, but the SpyLoan malware proves it\u2019s not enough. Historically, Play Protect hasn\u2019t been 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android phones. The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you of any\u00a0phishing emails or\u00a0ransomware scams.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Download apps from reliable sources: It\u2019s important to download apps only from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. You might say I am contradicting myself, but the Play Store is still safer than other options out there. They have strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software.\u00a0However, even with the security measures provided by Google Play, downloading apps from the store does not guarantee 100% protection against malware or harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they can pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Never trust download links that you get through SMS.",
      "3. Be cautious with app permissions: Always review the permissions requested by apps before installation. If an app requests access to features that seem unnecessary for its function, it could be a sign of malicious intent. Do not give any app Accessibility permissions unless you really need to. Avoid granting permissions that could compromise your personal data.",
      "4. Take loans from legit institutions:\u00a0Always take loans from legitimate financial institutions like banks or well-known lenders. Avoid sketchy apps or services promising instant cash with minimal requirements. They\u2019re often too good to be true. Legit lenders are transparent about their terms, interest rates, and fees, and they won\u2019t demand access to your personal data or pressure you with scare tactics. If you\u2019re unsure about a lender, check reviews, verify their credentials, or consult a financial advisor before committing.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It can be tempting to use apps that promise instant loans, especially when you need the money. But they're often just trying to scam you and push you into a never-ending debt cycle. If you need a loan, go to a trusted bank or lender. Protecting yourself from malicious apps like those infected with SpyLoan malware starts with staying informed and cautious. Always scrutinize the apps you download, stick to trusted platforms, and think twice before sharing sensitive information.",

      "Judge Maxwell Wiley on Friday agreed to the prosecution's request to dismiss the most serious charge, second degree manslaughter, after jurors twice told the court they had deadlocked on the issue.",
      "They had previously been instructed to deliberate the lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide only if they found Penny not guilty of manslaughter for some reason other than a lack of justification.",

      "They returned Monday to consider only the lesser charge, and Wiley issued a clarification to start the day.",
      "\"The court concluded it would be lawful to direct the jury to go on to count two because the DA withdrew count 1,\" he said. \"The court thought, under the law, that withdrawal was dismissal.\"",
      "However, he said, there's no clear \"black-letter law\" on the issue.",
      "The defense had opposed the last-minute charge swap, arguing it presented a violation of state laws and could encourage a precedent where prosecutors overcharge from the start, knowing they can downgrade charges later on the fly if their case doesn't stand up.",
      "\"The risk here of a coercive verdict or a compromised verdict\u2026New York is clear that compromised verdicts are discouraged,\" Penny's lawyers told the judge. \"It would force them into what we would submit would be manufactured, as to the lesser count of criminal negligence.\"",

Assad\u2019s rule, long sustained by Russia and Iran, has come to an end, leaving his former patrons scrambling to manage the fallout. The implications for these two powers, as well as for the broader regional and global landscape, are profound.",
      "Russia\u2019s involvement in Syria was never just about Assad, experts say. Securing a foothold in the Middle East was a cornerstone of Moscow\u2019s strategy, with the Khmeimim Air Base and Tartus naval facility serving as vital assets for projecting power. However, with Assad now gone, Russia\u2019s assets in Syria are at risk.",
      "Rebekah Koffler, strategic military intelligence analyst and author of \"Putin\u2019s Playbook,\" emphasized the significance. \"Syria has been a key theater in the broader proxy conflict between Russia and the U.S. losing Assad represents a strategic defeat for Russia, costing them critical bases in the Middle East and further stretching their military resources as they continue fighting in Ukraine.\"",

The post-war reconstruction never began, and with Russia now focused on Ukraine, Syria became a secondary priority. Now, Russia has abandoned Assad, revealing itself as an unreliable partner.\"",

Now that Assad, one of Putin\u2019s key allies, has lost Syria, the balance of power shifts dramatically. With this loss, Trump may have newfound leverage over Putin, as losing Syria undermines Russia\u2019s influence in the region and strains its already overstretched resources. This could open a path for Trump to negotiate the end of the war in Ukraine from a stronger position, leveraging Putin\u2019s setbacks in Syria.\"",

Syria was a crucial link in Tehran\u2019s \"Axis of Resistance,\" connecting Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon and enabling the smuggling of weapons across the region via a corridor stretching from Iran through Iraq and Syria into Lebanon.",
      "\"This is an unprecedented, historic moment,\" Svetlova said. \"The Iranian \u2018Ring of Fire,\u2019 meticulously built by Qassem Soleimani, has been shattered. If Soleimani was still alive, he would be horrified to see the collapse of his life\u2019s work.\"",
      "The weakening of Hezbollah during its war with Israel further exacerbated Assad\u2019s vulnerability, leaving the regime without critical support on the ground. Hezbollah had been a key force assisting Assad\u2019s army during the civil war, but after sustaining heavy losses to Israeli forces, it could no longer provide sufficient support.

      "\"The Iranian people and the regime are worlds apart in their perspectives,\" said another Iranian dissident who spoke anonymously to Fox News Digital from the country. \"While the regime has largely watched Assad's downfall from the sidelines, likely due to its own internal weaknesses or strategic agreements, the Iranian people are celebrating. There\u2019s a wave of hope and joy spreading across social media, fueled by the idea that revolutions in countries aligned with the Islamic Republic - past or present - could spark a domino effect. For many, Assad's collapse represents the weakening of the resistance axis and a glimmer of possibility for change within Iran itself.\"",

      "Before presenting his documentation to the world, Neuer attempted to address it directly with UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini. In a letter to Lazzarini, Neuer explained that Lazzarini\u2019s staff have previously complained that U.N. Watch did not submit its reports to UNRWA for comment prior to publishing. Neuer then recounted several attempts to meet personally with Lazzarini to discuss U.N.

Rami Abdurrahman who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said Syrian troops and members of different security agencies withdrew from the city, adding that rebels entered parts of it.",
      "The insurgency announced later Saturday that it had taken over Homs. The city's capture was a major victory for the rebels, who have already seized the cities of Aleppo and Hama, as well as large parts of the south, in a lightning offensive that began Nov. 27.

    "summary": "Merriam-Webster announced its word of the year is \u201cpolarization.\"",
    "story": [
      "Merriam-Webster\u2019s word of the year is one that the dictionary suggests unifies both sides of the aisle.",
      "The dictionary publisher said Monday that \u201cpolarization\u201d is its 2024 word of the year, defining it as \u201cdivision into two sharply distinct opposites; especially, a state in which the opinions, beliefs, or interests of a group or society no longer range along a continuum but become concentrated at opposing extremes.\u201d",
      "The announcement comes on the heels of a heated election, which culminated with President-elect Donald Trump's win.",
      "\u201cSearch volume on Merriam-Webster.com throughout the year reflected the desire of Americans to better understand the complex state of affairs in our country and around the world,\u201d the dictionary said.",
      "The word was frequently used by the media this year, Merriam-Webster noted, and was repeated on networks like MSNBC and Fox News \u2014 particularly when describing politics and the presidential election. (Comcast owns NBCUniversal, which is the parent company of NBC News and MSNBC.)",
      "Several other terms associated with politics \u2014 including \u201cdemocracy\u201d \u2014 also made the dictionary\u2019s words of the year list.",
      "\u201cDemocracy\u201d garnered bipartisan attention across blue and red states, with people looking the word up to try and \u201cfully understand what it means\u2014and to challenge, celebrate, and protect it,\u201d according to Merriam-Webster.",
      "\u201cThe word democracy never appears in the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution, but it has long been a focus of American and global attention, rarely more so than now,\u201d the dictionary noted in its explanation.",
      "Search interest in the word \u201cpander\u201d grew in mid-October, according to Merriam-Webster, when several \u201cconservative news outlets accused Vice President Kamala Harris of pandering to different groups, including young voters, Black voters, and supporters of gun rights.\u201d The dictionary also cited Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz\u2019s appearance on \u201cThe View,\u201d during which he said Trump\u2019s visit to McDonald\u2019s \"showed that he would 'pander and disrespect'\" its workers.",
      "The word \u201cweird,\u201d which the dictionary defines as \u201cstrange or extraordinary character,\u201d also picked up traction in July after Walz, who was Harris\u2019 running mate, \u201creferred to \u2018weird people on the other side,\u2019\u201d according to Merriam-Webster.",
      "\u201cCognitive,\u201d defined as \u201cof, relating to, being, or involving conscious intellectual activity,\u201d is not necessarily associated with politics. But this year, Merriam-Webster said the word saw a \u201crise in lookups\u201d due to \u201cmultiple reasons relating to the U.S. election,\u201d including the health of both President Joe Biden and Trump.",
      "Aside from politically relevant words, some internet culture terminology also made the list. \u201cDemure,\u201d or \u201cpeople who avoid drawing attention to themselves,\u201d surged in use, according to Merriam-Webster, after TikToker Jools Lebron kicked off a meme that dominated the internet.",
      "People also searched words related to current events, including \u201ctotality,\u201d or \"the phase of an eclipse during which it is total,\" after April\u2019s solar eclipse; and \u201callision,\u201d\u00a0a term that refers to a marine vessel colliding with a stationary object, which many looked up after the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore collapsed in March.",
      "Merriam-Webster\u2019s list follows several other similar roundups. Last week, Oxford University Press announced its word of the year was \u201cbrain rot,\u201d referring to the hyper-online way of speaking popularized by young Gen Zers and Gen Alpha. Meanwhile, Collins Dictionary named \u201cBrat\u201d word of the year, after the Charli XCX album became part of the cultural zeitgeist over the summer."

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 21:55:51 GMT",
    "summary": "Earlier this year, Steve Cohen laid out his principles as the owner of the New York Mets, saying it was a \u201cphilanthropic\u201d endeavor, in an interview with CNBC\u2019s Andrew Ross Sorkin.",
    "story": [
      "Earlier this year, Steve Cohen laid out his principles as the owner of the New York Mets, saying it was a \u201cphilanthropic\u201d endeavor, in an interview with CNBC\u2019s Andrew Ross Sorkin.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t care about the cost side,\u201d Cohen said, adding: \u201cIf I can make millions of people happy, how cool is that? I actually do it as a civic responsibility.\u201d",
      "That attitude helps explain how outfielder Juan Soto ended up agreeing to the richest-ever contract in baseball on Sunday, and among the most lucrative signed by any professional athlete in the world.",
      "The deal for Soto, who's 26 and from the Dominican Republic, comes to $765 million over 15 years and includes a $75 million signing bonus and has the potential to increase to more than $800 million, according to MLB.com.",
      "What\u2019s especially notable about the contract is that none of the money is \u201cdeferred\u201d \u2014\u00a0meaning it must be paid each year that Soto is on the Mets\u2019 active roster. Besides the dollar amount, the lack of deferrals is what makes Soto\u2019s contract even more eye-popping than the $700 million deal signed just last year by Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani: $680 million of Ohtani\u2019s deal will not be paid until after 2034.",
      "For Soto, it means taking all the money up front.",
      "\u201cIt actually makes little sense why (Soto) would get such a big contract without deferrals,\u201d Nathan Goldman, an associate professor of accounting at North Carolina State University, said in an interview with NBC News.",
      "Given the hefty combined personal income tax rates \u2014\u00a0approximately 15% for the wealthiest residents \u2014 levied by the city and state of New York, Soto\u2019s ultimate payout will be somewhat diminished.",
      "Yet Soto retains the potential to earn even more money: According to MLB.com, he can opt out of his contract after his fifth year with the Mets if he believes he can command higher sums on the free market.",
      "However, the Mets can override that opt-out by increasing his annual salary by $4 million a year, from $51 million to $55 million for the final 10 years.",
      "And Soto\u2019s contract does not include the amount the Mets and Cohen will have to pay to satisfy Major League Baseball\u2019s luxury tax. Though ostensibly designed to create a more even playing field between large- and small-market teams, deep-pocketed owners like Cohen have not flinched at paying that penalty to acquire the most coveted players.",
      "The simple answer to unlocking Soto\u2019s contract may simply be Cohen. Despite regularly carrying some of the most expensive contracts in baseball this century \u2014 including a $340 million deal signed with shortstop Francisco Lindor in 2022 \u2014 the Mets have been thwarted time and time again, including crushing losses in the playoffs and World Series. The team is nearing the 40th anniversary of its last championship.\u00a0\u00a0The outlook seemed to change five years ago, when Cohen, a longtime hedge fund manager, purchased the team for $2.4 billion. Cohen has been an unusually accessible owner, meeting with fans on multiple occasions and often weighing in on social media.",
      "More importantly: Cohen, worth as much as $21.3 billion according to Forbes, has been among the most profligate owners in baseball since he took the reins of the team. According to data from Spotrac, a website that monitors sports spending, the Mets have held the largest annual payroll since 2023. A separate index from TheScore.com that tracks payrolls versus teams\u2019 approximate revenues shows Cohen may actually be operating the team at a loss.",
      "Despite the annual ratcheting of payrolls, the winner of the World Series has often been unpredictable. But the baseball gods have been notoriously cruel to the Mets, despite their outsize spending. After crashing out of the first round of the playoffs in 2022 with a roster full of veterans, Cohen blew up the team and traded for prospects while loading up on another set of expensive free agents.",
      "But that team still only tied for second in the National League East Division this year and barely made the playoffs. While they nevertheless made it to the National League Championship Series, they were ultimately bested by the Los Angeles Dodgers, who went on to win the World Series in October.",
      "Yet over time, payroll does seem to equate to winning \u2014 belying the infamous \u201cMoneyball\u201d approach to spending efficiently on under-used players.",
      "With Soto\u2019s contract, it seems Cohen will not be denied again. According to reports, the New York Yankees, baseball\u2019s long-running big spenders, offered Soto only $5 million less than the Mets. But despite making the World Series this year, the Bronx Bombers have faced roster turmoil in recent years, while continuing to employ a manager, Aaron Boone, now loathed by many fans.",
      "Ironically, Soto is coming over from the Yankees, where he was traded in December 2023.",
      "Soto is entering his peak years and continues to draw comparisons to the hitting legends Ted Williams and Barry Bonds. That combination of youth and potential helped clinch the salary record.",
      "Another key to Soto ending up with such a massive contract was simply timing. He took advantage of a year lacking in other mega free agents and was able to command a premium on the open market.",
      "It\u2019s possible Soto\u2019s contract will be surpassed in just one year. Analysts say Toronto Blue Jays star Vladimir Guerrero Jr., who finished sixth in MVP voting last season, is expected to command massive numbers when he enters free agency after the 2025 season.",
      "Even if no one ends up reaching or surpassing Soto\u2019s figure, MLB will continue to lead all professional sports in titanic deals for contracts, for one simple reason: Unlike the NFL and NBA, it doesn\u2019t have a salary cap.",
      "According to Michael Ginnitti, Spotrac\u2019s founder and managing editor, \u201cBaseball\u2019s luxury tax system \u2026 allows billionaires to spend billions on their team if they choose.\u201d"

    "summary": "Caleb Vitello, who has decades of experience with ICE, has been tapped as acting director of the agency",
    "story": [
      "Many of\u00a0President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s picks for his Cabinet and other high-level posts have been outsiders, often with Fox News appearances as key qualifications. But to lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency expected to execute what is touted as one of his administration\u2019s signature policies, the mass deportation of millions of immigrants, Trump went a different route, tapping Caleb Vitello, who has decades of experience with the agency.",
      "That experience will most likely help Vitello implement Trump\u2019s deportation policies quickly. So, too, will Trump\u2019s decision to name him as \u201cacting\u201d director, meaning he won\u2019t have to wait for Senate confirmation to start aggressive removal efforts.",
      "Vitello \u201cgrew up in the Enforcement and Removal Operations division\u201d of ICE, a current ICE official said. With more than 20 years of experience at ICE, he\u2019s intimately familiar with how it hunts fugitives, the official added.",
      "That expertise will be needed, because more than 400,000 immigrants with criminal convictions are on the agency\u2019s non-detained docket, meaning they came into the U.S. and have pending immigration proceedings but aren\u2019t in detention, according to ICE.",
      "Jason Houser, who was chief of staff at ICE during the Biden administration until early 2023, called Vitello a thoughtful, good leader. \u201cHe knows the complexities and challenges of a broken immigration system,\u201d Houser said.",
      "Multiple agency insiders\u00a0expressed relief that an ICE veteran\u00a0was chosen.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very even-keeled.\u00a0I honestly I can\u2019t think of a single thing that [is] controversial about him.\u00a0I don\u2019t want to call him a Boy Scout, but he\u2019s as close as it gets,\u201d said Corey Price, the former acting executive associate director of Enforcement and Removal Operations.",
      "ICE\u2019s 20,000 agents in 400 offices will be in charge of the entire removal process, including searching for immigrants in the country illegally, detaining them in ICE facilities, taking them to staging areas in the Southern U.S. and overseeing ICE-chartered flights out of the country.",
      "Vitello oversaw the recent implementation of a body-worn camera policy that requires agents to activate the cameras during searches and seizures and when they are on active patrol or are apprehending fugitives.",
      "Expert on use of force",
      "Vitello was the primary use-of-force instructor at the agency\u2019s training facility at Fort Benning, Georgia, for five years and testified on behalf of ICE in a use-of-force case in 2018, according to court documents.",
      "The case involved a 2013 incident in which an ICE agent was moving a shackled and handcuffed detainee from one cell to another.\u00a0The detainee accused the agent of pushing him from behind so that he fell flat on his face on a concrete floor. Because the detainee was fully restrained, he was unable to shield his face and lost several teeth.",
      "The ICE agent was criminally charged, but a judge later dismissed the case. The detainee filed a civil suit against ICE claiming the agent\u2019s behavior was a direct result of agency training.",
      "Vitello disputed ICE\u2019s claim on the stand in 2018, saying that what the ICE agent had done was \u201chighly unusual\u201d and \u201coutrageous\u201d and \u201cis nothing that we teach, it is nothing that we do, it is nothing that we would agree upon,\u201d according to court filings."

      "After the deadly collapse of a 12-story condominium tower in the Surfside suburb of Miami in 2021, state lawmakers implemented new requirements for older condominiums. Buildings that are at least 30 years old, as was the Champlain tower that fell, have to undergo special inspections, make repairs and gather reserve funds for future maintenance. The deadline is at the end of this month.",
      "With inspections now underway, the bills are coming due. For some associations, the costs are in the millions of dollars, and condo owners, many of whom are retirees on fixed incomes, are on the hook.",
      "Roughly 1 million units are subject to the new capital-intensive rules. Some owners are hoping to sell their units rather than comply, others are walking away, and still others are looking to investors to bail them out.",
      "Longtime analyst Peter Zalewski, founder of Miami-based real estate consultancy Condo Vultures, calls it the condo cliff.",
      "\u201cI would compare it to what we saw in during the Great Recession, which is effectively zombie buildings. These are the units where a small minority are going to have to basically bear the cross or pay for everyone else who\u2019s not able to pay, whether they can\u2019t or they choose not to pay,\u201d said Zalewski.",
      "According to Zalewski\u2019s count, in South Florida, including Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties, three-quarters of all the condo units for sale are more than 30 years old and subject to the new rules. In the usually busy summer season, sales were down 21.5% year over year and the average price was down 2.4%. In the third quarter of this year, active listings were up 60% from the same period the year before.",
      "Special assessments, levied to undertake the repairs, have been as high as $200,000 per unit owner, and repair bills have come in for as much as $15 million, according to a recent report from the\u00a0Palm Beach Post.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s going on right now is these reports are coming in, maintenance fee budgets are being put together, and many boards do not want to acknowledge how much it\u2019s going to be,\u201d Zalewski said. \u201cAll the bills will be sent, and people will receive their little booklets where it says how much you have to pay every month. They\u2019ll get them in January. So right now it\u2019s kind of the calm before the storm.\u201d",
      "In September, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called for a special session to deal with this condo association financial cliff.\u00a0Legislative leaders, however, decided to wait until the regular session begins in early 2025 to consider making any changes to the law, saying they need to get a better idea of the financials involved, according to the Palm Beach Post.",
      "Stefania Ancona, a real estate agent in Miami, says the pool of buyers now is extremely limited, so sellers have to either pay the new assessments first or slash their prices. But there is another exit: investors.",
      "One such building \u2014 the Bay Garden Manor condo building on West Avenue in Miami \u2014 is set to be sold to a large investor and torn down to make way for luxury waterfront property, Ancona said.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that foreclosures or short sales may happen. I don\u2019t know yet. I haven\u2019t seen many yet, because, again, the investors are buying out the buildings that they feel are in a desirable location,\u201d she said.",
      "Condo prices were down about 2% in the summer season, and Zalewski said that\u2019s just the beginning.",
      "\u201cIt was only in September that the area started to get bombarded with information about the pitfalls,\u201d said Zalewski. \u201cUninformed buyers saw cheaper prices [in the summer] and figured they better buy now so that they could own a piece of South Florida. There is a lot of buyer regret right now.\u201d",

      "Stacey Campbell, a parent of one of the students involved, shared an email from a CCPS staff member in a\u00a0Facebook post, which offered more details.",
      "\u201cWhile waiting, I asked to speak to the manager on duty and the general manager,\u201d read a portion of the letter, which explained that the group was seated in a closed section in the back of the restaurant while their takeout order was being filled.",
      "The CCPS worker said the staff was \u201cblatantly rude\u201d and \u201cignored\u201d all of the students, and once they talked with a general manager, they were told the eatery doesn\u2019t \u201caccommodate to this type of group.\u201d",
      "Navarro said that after the incident, staff talked to a Cracker Barrel district manager who wanted to \u201cobtain more information and express concerns\u201d about the students\u2019 treatment at the establishment. She added that the manager said they were willing to work with CCPS \u201cto do better.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe alleged treatment of CCPS students and staff at Cracker Barrel is one that no one should experience,\u201d Navarro wrote, adding that other retailers and restaurants have reached out to offer their venues for future CCPS student field trips.",
      "\u201cWe look forward to hearing from Cracker Barrel,\u201d Navarro ended the letter.",
      "\u201cIt broke my heart,\u201d said Dustin Reed, a CCPS parent who\u00a0spoke to NBC Washington\u00a0on Friday. Reed added that he and Johnna Penrod have been comforting their 7-year-old daughter, who is nonverbal, since the incident.",
      "\u201cPushed off to the side and just not even paid attention to,\u201d Reed said. \u201cOnly thing they wanted to go in there and to do was eat some food and enjoy their time there and learn from it.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust because they have different abilities than we do doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re less than we are,\u201d Penrod told NBC Washington. \u201cThey deserve to be treated like human beings, they deserve to be loved, they deserve to be cared for. They deserve to have morale given to them.\u201d",
      "Cracker Barrel apologized for disappointing the students.",
      "\u201cOur missteps last week were unfortunate but were unrelated to the students\u2019 capabilities,\u201d a representative for Cracker Barrel told TODAY.com, adding that the refusal of service to the party of 18 was due to staffing issues and a partially closed second dining room.",
      "\u201cOur failure to follow certain operational protocols combined with poor communication on our part then led to misunderstandings and misperceptions,\u201d the rep continued. They said they\u2019re working with the community to learn and do better but did not specify how.",
      "Reed, on the other hand, said he believes \u201cchildren\u2019s civil rights\u201d were \u201cblatantly ignored and disregarded.\u201d",
      "Pernod said their daughter has enjoyed outings at many other locations, including fast-food restaurants, and that the group visited a dollar store before Cracker Barrel that day without incident.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that a district manager or someone in their HR department is going to say that is going to fix this. The damage is done,\u201d Pernod told TODAY.com. \u201cThis isn\u2019t \u2018Oh, I stepped on your toe in the movie theater, I apologize.\u2019 This isn\u2019t that type of thing that you can just sweep underneath the rug with an \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 in my opinion.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Democrats are still reeling and reflecting on what went so wrong for their party this year.",
      "But at the Democratic governors\u2019 annual gathering in California, they were in full agreement that something has to change in order for their party \u2014 and, in their eyes, hopefully one of them \u2014 to have a real shot at the White House in 2028.",
      "\u201cWe can worry later about who we run for president [in 2028], or policy tweaks,\u201d New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy told NBC News, adding that for now, Democrats need to \u201cbuild the foundation, build the infrastructure, elect a DNC chairman who is committed to doing just that.\u201d",
      "And amid a pitch to rededicate the party to a focus on improving voters\u2019 everyday lives, addressing key issues such as inflation, health care, infrastructure, transportation and education, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear warned Democrats about a key obstacle to their ambitions for redefinition: President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "In the last Trump administration, people focused \u201ctoo much on Trump and what was happening in D.C. and not enough on [Democratic] priorities,\u201d Beshear said.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t fall into us versus them,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not a winning strategy.\u201d",
      "At other levels of the party \u2014 including among some of the \u201cresistance\u201d activist groups that gained prominence during Trump\u2019s first term \u2014 there\u2019s already broad agreement that Democrats can\u2019t react to Trump in the same ways they did eight years ago.",
      "But some of the most prominent governors, who happen to be among those mentioned as potential presidential candidates, quickly leaned into setting up their states as bulwarks against Trumpism after his election. California Gov. Gavin Newsom called a special legislative session, while Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker talked about how to \u201cshore up\u201d his state against Trump.",
      "Others in purple and red states have taken less aggressive postures. At the Democratic Governors Association meetings, Beshear and fellow red-state Democratic governor Laura Kelly of Kansas said they\u2019d look for room to work with Trump in areas that would benefit their constituents.",
      "\u201cReally, we have no idea what\u2019s, what\u2019s coming down the pike,\u201d Kelly told reporters Saturday. \u201cSo we\u2019ll evaluate it as it comes to us, and if it\u2019s \u2014 we will always look for ways to work together.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou know, that\u2019s my job as governor, is to do what I need to do to get what we need in the state of Kansas. So we are very open to working with the Trump administration,\u201d she added.",
      "Beshear said he would be in favor of pro-Trump policies when they\u2019re good for Kentuckians and anti-Trump pushback when the new presidential administration takes actions that are bad for the people in his state.",
      "Beshear said that reacting to the daily slog of Trump\u2019s news of the day could be detrimental to Democrats, echoing Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., who told NBC News last month that Democrats need to stop \"freaking out\" at everything Trump says, comparing members of his party to cats and Trump to \"the guy with the laser pointer.\"",
      "\"You\u2019re going to be chasing it around the whole room,\" Fetterman said.",
      "It could be an early theme to watch as Democrats position themselves in the governor's race in New Jersey, where a pair of Democratic House members, Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill, are part of a crowded primary for the chance to succeed Murphy, who is term-limited. The primary field also includes Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop.",
      "After the primary, the Democratic nominee will have to face off against a Republican nominee in a state in which Trump made significant gains in 2024. After losing New Jersey by 16 percentage points in 2020, Trump ran just 6 points behind Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.",
      "Murphy said he thought that Harris\u2019 campaign made significant missteps: \u201cI\u2019m of the opinion that it wasn\u2019t one thing, but that there were 12 to 15 things \u2014 including some very smart moves by Trump and his team \u2014 that all went against us.\u201d",
      "In the immediate future, Democrats face their first path to defining the future of their party in February, when the party will elect a new chair of the Democratic National Committee.",
      "\u201cI want to see someone who focuses on what we as Democrats far too often take for granted or view as mundane and that is party infrastructure, the \u201850 State Strategy 2.0,\u2019\u201d Murphy said, calling on Democrats to \u201cpresent ourselves and ask for the order, even if it\u2019s in a red, red town, county or state.\u201d",
      "For now, Murphy and Beshear say, Democrats need to focus on defining what they stand for with voters and looking ahead to the 2026 midterms, which will be the first nationwide test of Democrats\u2019 post-2024 rebuild.",
      "\u201cAs much as we need to be sober and reflective, it\u2019s also not, therefore, the end of the Democratic Party, the end of the world,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cWe will live to fight again. In that part, I\u2019m highly confident.\u201d",
      "Beshear predicted that Trump will continue to move to the right in his second administration, meaning \u201cthe common sense and the middle ground is open\u201d for Democrats if they wish to take it.",
      "\u201cThe best thing for Democrats to do ahead of [the 2028 presidential election] is to win widely in the 2026 midterms,\u201d he added."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Conservative justices objected as the Supreme Court on Monday sidestepped a new dispute over race in education by declining to consider whether an admissions program for public high schools in Boston unlawfully considered race.",
      "Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas both said they would have taken up the case, while Justice Neil Gorsuch said he shared their concerns about the policy.",
      "Alito wrote that there was \"overwhelming direct evidence of intentional discrimination\" that warranted the Supreme Court's intervention.",
      "It is the second time the court has declined to review a policy aimed at increasing diversity in public high schools since it ended the consideration of race in college admissions last year.",
      "That ruling left in doubt whether the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has the votes to strike down admissions policies that do not explicitly consider race but nevertheless lead to a more diverse class.",
      "\"We have now twice refused to correct a glaring constitutional error that threatens to perpetuate race-based affirmative action,\" Alito added.",
      "The policy, implemented by the Boston School Committee in 2021, applied to three selective high schools in Boston: Boston Latin School, Boston Latin Academy and John D. O\u2019Bryant School. It replaced a previous emphasis on standardized test scores as well as grades. Under the new plan, grades were considered, with 20% of the seats taken by those with the best grades.",
      "Other seats were filled based on the geographic locations of the students within Boston, with those with the best grades getting preference.",
      "The plan, which was in effect for only one year, was challenged by the Boston Parent Coalition for Academic Excellence, a group representing white and Asian parents, which said the policy constituted a form of racial discrimination under the 14th Amendment\u2019s equal protection clause.",
      "A federal judge ruled that the policy was lawful because it was written in a race-neutral way. The Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed.",
      "The Supreme Court in February turned away a similar challenge to an admissions policy at a Virginia high school that was also aimed at increasing diversity.",
      "In a statement, Gorsuch said the fact the Boston schools' policy was no longer in effect was one reason not to hear the case.",
      "Court declines challenge to school gender identity policy",
      "In other action in the schools context Monday, the court also declined to take up a case out of Wisconsin about whether parents can sue schools over policies intended to protect students struggling with their gender identities.",
      "The Eau Claire Area School District issued guidance in 2021 in support for students who are transgender, nonbinary or gender-nonconforming. The policy says that in some cases, an affected student\u2019s parents may not be central to the process if there is a risk of lack of acceptance at home.",
      "The policy was challenged by Parents Protecting Our Children, a group representing parents. It argued it violates parental rights under both the 14th Amendment\u2019s due process clause and the First Amendment\u2019s free exercise clause.",
      "Lower courts ruled that the group did not have legal standing to pursue its claims because it could not show that any members had been harmed by it.",
      "Again, Alito and Thomas said they would have taken the case up, as did fellow conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh.",
      "\"This case presents a question of great and growing national importance,\" Alito wrote."

      "When President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House next year, he\u2019ll do so with a more sprawling business empire and far fewer promises about how he\u2019ll avoid conflicts of interest.",
      "While Trump was primarily a real estate developer in his first term, he has since expanded dramatically into new industries including social media and cryptocurrency. The presidency has only further raised his profile and drawn Trump, a lifelong salesperson, to more licensing deals. He\u2019s also grown his golf courses in Scotland while putting his name on products ranging from NFTs to Bibles to a resort in Oman.",
      "But Trump and his team have so far provided no details about how \u2014 or if \u2014 he will separate his business interests from his work as president.",
      "In an interview with NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that aired Sunday, Trump declined to say he would divest from his new social media company.",
      "\"Well, I don\u2019t know how I can divest. What does that mean? I\u2019m not allowed to open it and use it? I mean, all I do is \u2014 I \u2014 I don\u2019t openly look at the \u2014 the company,\" Trump said. \"I\u2019m not even on the board of the company. I didn\u2019t want to be on the board. I have other people, and they run it, and they run it very well, because Truth has become a very, very successful platform.\"",
      "He also said he wouldn't accept a salary as president.",
      "Before the interview, a spokeswoman declined to answer specific questions about how he\u2019d avoid conflicts of interest, whether he\u2019d continue making foreign deals or whether he\u2019d give the government a preferential rate when the Secret Service stays at his properties.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump removed himself from his multi-billion-dollar real estate empire to run for office and forewent his government salary, becoming the first President to actually lose net worth while serving in the White House. Unlike most politicians, President Trump didn\u2019t get into politics for profit \u2014 he\u2019s fighting because he loves the people of this country and wants to make America great again,\u201d Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the Trump transition team, told NBC News in an email.",
      "Yet ethics experts, government watchdogs and Democrats warn that Trump\u2019s wide web of business dealings pose alarming conflicts of interest for his presidency. His appointees will be charged with regulating his businesses, his promised tariffs could affect his profit margins, and his dealings with foreign countries could affect deals his eponymous company seeks abroad.",
      "It\u2019s why American presidents have historically put their assets into blind trusts, separating their financial interests from their leadership responsibilities until they are out of office.",
      "\u201cThe scale has changed. Previously, there was one real way you could benefit Trump and that was physically going to one of his properties and spending money there,\u201d said Jordan Libowitz, vice president for communications at the government watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \u201cNow, you have the opportunity to pump millions into his stock, into crypto \u2014 and just directly write him a check.\u201d",
      "In his first administration, Trump promised to turn his empire over to his sons, not to engage in any new foreign deals, and to donate his presidential salary back to taxpayers. The Trump Organization \u2014 the Trump family company comprising hotels, commercial and residential real estate, and golf clubs \u2014 said it would donate the profits from foreign government bookings back to the government, and also cut the Secret Service a deal while it protected the president.",
      "Critics argued these restrictions were too flimsy to protect against conflicts of interest and not always followed.",
      "In his second administration, however, there are indications Trump plans to have a more involved role in his businesses than he did in his first. The president-elect plans to travel to Scotland to open a new golf course in Aberdeen next year, his son Eric Trump said two weeks after the election. Trump has also continued to promote new products\u00a0\u2014 including guitars \u2014 as he builds out his forthcoming administration.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s open season on the profiteering,\u201d said Richard Painter, who served as President George W. Bush\u2019s ethics lawyer and who has vocally criticized both Trump and President Joe Biden for alleged ethics violations.",
      "Here\u2019s where Trump stands to make outside income as president.",
      "Hotels, golf clubs and real estate",
      "Trump\u2019s clubs and hotels raked in bookings, events and spending, boosted by lobbyists, Republican lawmakers, foreign governments and others seeking to curry favor with the then-president. According to CREW, 144 members of Congress and 150 foreign officials visited a Trump business during his administration, and 100 political events and 142 events hosted by special interest groups were hosted on his properties too.",
      "Supporters and favor-seekers also spent heavily at his Washington, D.C., hotel and Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. Spending by Republican officials and groups largely evaporated at the D.C. hotel in particular once Trump left office. Trump sold the hotel in 2022.",
      "Trump personally directed business his way when he visited his own properties hundreds of times, according to NBC News tracking, raking in taxpayer dollars as the government footed the bill for Secret Service space to work and stay.",
      "While Eric Trump had said the Trump properties would give the taxpayers an essentially free rate on Secret Service accommodations, the Secret Service paid as much as $1,185 a night \u2014 five times the recommended rate for Secret Service on the job \u2014 to protect the then-president. In total, documents obtained and reviewed by CREW indicate that taxpayers spent at least $1.75 million on Secret Service costs at Trump properties during his administration.",
      "Trump\u2019s properties will likely continue to be magnets for political spending moving forward. Mar-a-Lago, where Trump resides, was a popular destination for allies to meet with him and host fundraisers over the past four years. And since the election, Trump has hosted potential administration appointees and foreign leaders there.",
      "Diving into cryptocurrency",
      "Just two months before he was elected, Trump announced his family\u2019s cryptocurrency business, World Liberty Financial. The company aims to be a crypto bank where customers are encouraged to borrow, lend and invest in digital coins, though it\u2019s currently only selling nontransferable tokens. An October launch of the coins saw sluggish sales \u2014 with just $12 million, well below the $300 million in tokens the platform said it was looking to sell.",
      "\u201cCrypto is the future,\u201d Trump said, touting the launch of sales.",
      "The industry\u2019s future could depend in large part on his presidency. Under the Biden administration, the industry has faced litigation led by the Securities and Exchange Commission that threatens to break up crypto companies, which currently act as both exchange and broker for the digital assets.",
      "\u201cIf the SEC chair basically abandons this litigation, stands down, then that\u2019s a huge win for the crypto exchanges,\u201d said Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University and an expert in financial regulation and new financial technologies.",
      "Trump\u2019s pick to head up the SEC, Paul Atkins, is a cryptocurrency proponent, and his administration is shaping up to be a friendly one to the fintech industry.",
      "The value of bitcoin surged in value following Trump\u2019s election, surpassing $100,000 on Dec. 5.",
      "\u201cCONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU\u2019RE WELCOME!!! Together, we will Make America Great Again!\u201d Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "\u201cEven the appearance that he will not go after the industry aggressively will benefit him and his crypto interest immediately,\u201d said Kedric Payne, the senior director for ethics at the Campaign Legal Center, a group that has filed ethics complaints against lawmakers.",
      "In late November, Justin Sun, a cryptocurrency proponent and the founder of crypto platform TRON, announced he would purchase $30 million in tokens from World Liberty Financial. Sun\u2019s investment will ensure the venture profits the incoming president, whose connected LLC, DT Marks DEFI, starts seeing profits only after $30 million in sales are made by the company.",
      "This venture creates an opportunity for unlimited profits, Allen added, unlike Trump\u2019s physical businesses, which have physical limitations \u2014 like the number of hotel rooms \u2014 limiting profits.",
      "Crypto allows Trump to create \u201cassets out of thin air,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really just sort of scales up the possibilities here.\u201d",
      "Media and technology interests",
      "Half of Trump\u2019s net worth is tied up in shares of his publicly traded media company, Trump Media and Technology Group, of which Trump owns a majority stake. The company owns his preferred social media network, Truth Social, where much of Trump\u2019s own messaging and advertisements for his own endorsed projects are published. The stock\u2019s price is volatile \u2014 and seems untethered to the company\u2019s actual business, which has seen significant losses \u2014 but has nonetheless doubled year to date. And experts say the company poses a number of potential conflicts of interest.",
      "The company is regulated by Trump\u2019s own appointees. It, too, acknowledges the inextricable connection between the president and its fortunes.",
      "\u201cThe value of TMTG\u2019s brand may diminish if the popularity of President Donald J. Trump were to suffer. Adverse reactions to publicity relating to President Donald J. Trump, or the loss of his services, could adversely affect TMTG\u2019s revenues, results of operations and its ability to maintain or generate a consumer base,\u201d the company wrote in a regulatory filing in November.",
      "The president has the power to fire and appoint commissioners to the Federal Communications Commission, and Trump\u2019s new pick to run the agency has promised to \u201csmash the censorship cartel\u201d on social media.",
      "The business also creates new potential avenues for people seeking to influence, benefit or exact leverage over the president-elect through the purchase of advertisements on the platform or significant shares of stock.",
      "If a billionaire or foreign wealth fund were to buy up a ton of stock, they\u2019d raise Trump\u2019s net worth, Libowitz hypothesized.",
      "\u201cThey could inflate it, but then they could also threaten to sell all of that stock at the same time, cratering the value and destroying this net worth,\u201d he said. \u201cHere is a new nightmare scenario that no previous president has had to deal with.\u201d",
      "Bibles, guitars, cologne and more",
      "According to his financial disclosures, Trump has been making millions on licensing deals for the use of his name in branding and advertisement for a wide range of products.",
      "Since the November election, he\u2019s rolled out several new products: Bibles commemorating his survival of a July assassination attempt, Trump-branded or -signed guitars, and most recently a cologne.",
      "Painter, the White House ethics lawyer for Bush, said such ventures were off-limits for previous presidents.",
      "\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t even let his name go on a public school in Texas \u2014 I still remember that,\u201d Painter said of the 43rd president. \u201cNever would we let Bush\u2019s name be used for branding to sell anything, anywhere. Same rule in the Obama administration.\u201d",
      "Using a private office for public gain is specifically prohibited for federal employees, Painter said, but he was quick to note that Trump isn\u2019t the only president ignoring this rule.",
      "Biden\u2019s name was used to launch the Penn Biden Center at the University of Pennsylvania after he left the vice presidency, and the university gave Biden a lucrative job. The center was kept open even after he became president, earning criticism from Republicans about the donations it received from Chinese sources. Painter said he urged the Biden team to shutter the center.",
      "While Trump pledged not to engage in any foreign business deals during his first administration, his transition team declined to say if that rule will apply to his second term.",
      "Out of office, Trump has pursued foreign licensing deals. In 2022, for instance, Trump licensed his company\u2019s name to an Oman hotel, just as he was announcing a third presidential bid.",
      "According to an October 2024 report from an independent monitor appointed to oversee the Trump Organization\u2019s financial disclosures following a civil fraud ruling, the organization had informed the monitor it was creating 25 new entities for the \u201cpurpose of either licensing products or merchandise and hotel licensing deals.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A murder charge was filed in New York on Monday night against the man accused of gunning down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last week outside a busy New York City hotel, according to online court documents.",
      "Hours before the murder and weapons charges were filed in New York, Luigi Mangione, 26, appeared in court for a preliminary arraignment in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested earlier in the day at a McDonald's in Altoona. There, he was charged with two felonies \u2014\u00a0forgery and carrying a firearm without a license \u2014\u00a0and three misdemeanors: tampering with records or identification, possessing instruments of crime and providing false identification to law enforcement.",
      "After the Pennsylvania court appearance, law enforcement officials told reporters that charges would be filed in New York shortly.",
      "Follow here for live coverage.",
      "Online court documents showed Monday night that Mangione has been charged with one count of murder, three counts of criminal possession of a weapon and one count of possession of a forged instrument.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.",
      "Law enforcement officials had been looking for the suspected gunman in Thompson's slaying for days, distributing photos and video of the person who carried out the targeted attack on the CEO.",
      "On Monday, a McDonald's employee called police about a suspicious person in the Altoona restaurant, and police later said they discovered he had with him a gun similar to the one used in the fatal shooting.",
      "Mangione also carried a fake ID with the same name the suspected gunman used at a New York City hostel, police said. A gun silencer was also found, police said.",
      "Investigators found a handwritten document that \"speaks to both his motivation and mindset,\u201d NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch told reporters Monday.",
      "Police did not provide specifics about a possible motive, but NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny\u00a0said Mangione appeared to hold \"ill will toward corporate America.\u201d",
      "Thompson, 50, was on his way to UnitedHealth Group\u2019s investor conference at the New York Hilton Midtown when a masked gunman approached from behind and opened fire around 6:45 a.m. Wednesday, security video of the shooting showed.",
      "Other pedestrians had walked past the gunman before he shot Thompson, leading police to believe Thompson was the shooter's only intended target.",
      "Thompson, who was shot in the back and a leg, was pronounced dead at Mount Sinai West.",
      "The gunman fled on foot and then on a bike into Central Park, authorities said.",
      "Within hours of the shooting, police labeled Thompson's killing a\u00a0\u201cpremeditated, preplanned targeted attack.\u201d",
      "Three live 9 mm rounds and three discharged 9 mm shell casings were found at the scene, and a cellphone was found nearby.",
      "Three pieces of recovered ammunition had the words \u201cdeny,\u201d \u201cdelay\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d written on them in marker, one on each, police said.",
      "Thompson, who lived in Minnesota, had recently received threats but had not altered his travel routine, according to his wife, Paulette Thompson.",
      "He was not with a security detail when the shooting unfolded.",
      "\u201cYes, there had been some threats,\u201d Paulette Thompson told NBC News hours after the attack. \u201cBasically, I don\u2019t know, a lack of coverage?\u00a0I don\u2019t know details. I just know that he said there were some people that had been threatening him.\u201d",
      "Police believe the gunman arrived in New York City on Nov. 24 by Greyhound bus from Atlanta and stayed at a hostel on the Upper West Side, where he rarely took off or pulled down his mask.",
      "He paid in cash and is thought to have used fake identification to stay at the hostel, police said.",
      "After the shooting, police scoured the city for evidence, including the weapon. Officials also released multiple photos of a person of interest in hope of uncovering the man's identity.",
      "Mangione graduated with multiple degrees from the University of Pennsylvania in May 2020 and received a BS in engineering and a master of science engineering degree, according to officials with the Ivy League school. Public records and his social media profiles indicate he has lived in Philadelphia and Hawaii and has worked for the University of Pennsylvania.",
      "Mangione attended the private, all-boys Gilman School in Baltimore in high school. He graduated in 2016, the school confirmed.",
      "Thompson's slaying sent shock waves throughout the corporate and health care worlds, raising questions about appropriate security for top-level executives.",
      "UnitedHealth Group did not regularly employ personal security service for executives, according to the company's\u00a0two\u00a0most recent proxy statements. Companies have to\u00a0report security expenses of more than $10,000 annually for directors or corporate officers.",
      "Humana\u00a0and\u00a0Cigna, two other major health care giants, both said in their most recent proxy statements that they provide personal security to executives. Those records, though, did not reveal which executives received protection or how much was being spent.",
      "Another major player in health insurance, CVS Health, requires its CEO to use corporate aircraft and a corporate driver as part of a disclosed \u201cexecutive security program,\u201d\u00a0according to regulatory filings.",
      "The shooting also unearthed a dark, angry American viewpoint on private health providers, with many social media users celebrating Thompson's death or making possible excuses for his killing."

    "story": [
      "A group of students with disabilities visited a Cracker Barrel in Waldorf, Maryland, and were refused service, according to school officials, leading to community outcry and a planned protest.",
      "Charles County Public Schools (CCPS) superintendent Maria V. Navarro\u00a0wrote in a statement\u00a0Thursday that 11 students with disabilities and seven staff members visited the restaurant two days earlier. The field trip was part of a community-based instruction program meant to hone life skills, including interacting with others in public spaces like retail shops and restaurants.",
      "Navarro wrote that, prior to the visit, staff notified the Cracker Barrel location of the group\u2019s plans, including headcount and purpose of the visit. According to CCPS, they were told that no reservation was needed.",
      "\u201cUpon arrival, the students and staff were declined service and asked to no longer include the restaurant on its CBI list,\" Navarro wrote, adding that the group was able to place a carryout order.",
      "Stacey Campbell, a parent of one of the students involved, shared an email from a CCPS staff member in a\u00a0Facebook post, which offered more details.",
      "\u201cWhile waiting, I asked to speak to the manager on duty and the general manager,\u201d read a portion of the letter, which explained that the group was seated in a closed section in the back of the restaurant while their takeout order was being filled.",
      "The CCPS worker said the staff was \u201cblatantly rude\u201d and \u201cignored\u201d all of the students, and once they talked with a general manager, they were told the eatery doesn\u2019t \u201caccommodate to this type of group.\u201d",
      "Navarro said that after the incident, staff talked to a Cracker Barrel district manager who wanted to \u201cobtain more information and express concerns\u201d about the students\u2019 treatment at the establishment. She added that the manager said they were willing to work with CCPS \u201cto do better.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe alleged treatment of CCPS students and staff at Cracker Barrel is one that no one should experience,\u201d Navarro wrote, adding that other retailers and restaurants have reached out to offer their venues for future CCPS student field trips.",
      "\u201cWe look forward to hearing from Cracker Barrel,\u201d Navarro ended the letter.",
      "\u201cIt broke my heart,\u201d said Dustin Reed, a CCPS parent who\u00a0spoke to NBC Washington\u00a0on Friday. Reed added that he and Johnna Penrod have been comforting their 7-year-old daughter, who is nonverbal, since the incident.",
      "\u201cPushed off to the side and just not even paid attention to,\u201d Reed said. \u201cOnly thing they wanted to go in there and to do was eat some food and enjoy their time there and learn from it.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust because they have different abilities than we do doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re less than we are,\u201d Penrod told NBC Washington. \u201cThey deserve to be treated like human beings, they deserve to be loved, they deserve to be cared for. They deserve to have morale given to them.\u201d",
      "Cracker Barrel apologized for disappointing the students.",
      "\u201cOur missteps last week were unfortunate but were unrelated to the students\u2019 capabilities,\u201d a representative for Cracker Barrel told TODAY.com, adding that the refusal of service to the party of 18 was due to staffing issues and a partially closed second dining room.",
      "\u201cOur failure to follow certain operational protocols combined with poor communication on our part then led to misunderstandings and misperceptions,\u201d the rep continued. They said they\u2019re working with the community to learn and do better but did not specify how.",
      "Reed, on the other hand, said he believes \u201cchildren\u2019s civil rights\u201d were \u201cblatantly ignored and disregarded.\u201d",
      "Pernod said their daughter has enjoyed outings at many other locations, including fast-food restaurants, and that the group visited a dollar store before Cracker Barrel that day without incident.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that a district manager or someone in their HR department is going to say that is going to fix this. The damage is done,\u201d Pernod told TODAY.com. \u201cThis isn\u2019t \u2018Oh, I stepped on your toe in the movie theater, I apologize.\u2019 This isn\u2019t that type of thing that you can just sweep underneath the rug with an \u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 in my opinion.\u201d",
      "Reed is\u00a0planning a protest of the Cracker Barrel location\u00a0where the incident occurred on Sunday, and 75 people say they\u2019re interested in attending as of this writing.",

      "\u201cThis group of students and teachers were, are, and always will be welcome to dine with us,\u201d the Cracker Barrel representative said. \u201cWe will make things right, and we look forward to earning back their trust and confidence.\u201d"

    "summary": "Learn more about what's known so far about the rape allegation from a woman who said she was 13 when she was raped by Jay-Z along with Sean 'Diddy' Combs.",
    "story": [
      "Rapper and entrepreneur Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, was accused in a lawsuit Sunday of raping a teenage girl after an awards show more than two decades ago along with Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, the hip-hop mogul facing federal sex trafficking charges and a wave of lawsuits alleging sexual assault.",
      "The plaintiff in Sunday\u2019s suit said she was 13 at the time of the alleged assault, according to the complaint, which was filed in federal court in New York\u2019s Southern District.",
      "Carter denied the allegations Sunday, calling them \u201cidiotic\" in a statement. Combs\u2019 legal team dismissed the suit as a \u201cshameless publicity stunt.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the litigation.",
      "What are the allegations against Carter?",
      "The lawsuit was originally filed in October against Combs, and it was amended Sunday to include Carter as a defendant.",
      "The plaintiff, who is identified as \u201cJane Doe\u201d in the suit, said she met the men after the MTV Music Video Awards at Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan in 2000. She\u2019d been trying to get into the event \u2014 or to go to an after-party \u2014 but did not have a ticket, and she began approaching limousine drivers outside, according to the suit.",
      "One of the drivers said he worked for Combs and told her she \u201cfit what Diddy was looking for,\u201d the suit alleges. After the driver took to her an after-party, the plaintiff says, she was told to sign what she believed was a nondisclosure agreement and given a drink that made her \"woozy,\" the suit alleges.",
      "The plaintiff lay down in a room, the lawsuit says, and Combs and Carter entered. Carter removed her clothes, according to the suit, and raped her while Combs and a female celebrity who is not named in the document watched, it says.",
      "Combs tried to force the plaintiff to perform oral sex, but she hit him in the neck and he stopped, the suit alleges. She grabbed her clothes, ran to a gas station and called her father, it says.",
      "What does Carter say about the suit?",
      "In a statement, Carter said the lawyer who filed the suit had made a \u201cterrible error in judgement thinking that all \u2018celebrities\u2019 are the same. I\u2019m not from your world. I\u2019m a young man who made it out of the project of Brooklyn. We don\u2019t play these types of games. We have very strict codes and honor. We protect children, you seem to exploit people for personal gain.\u201d",
      "\u201cOnly your network of conspiracy theorists, fake physics, will believe the idiotic claims you have levied against me that, if not for the seriousness surrounding harm to kids, would be laughable,\u201d he added.",
      "Carter described a pre-litigation demand letter from the lawyer who filed the suit as an effort to \u201cblackmail\u201d him into settling. Attorney Tony Buzbee said his client had sought only confidential mediation and did not demand any money.",
      "In response to the letter, Buzbee said in the amended complaint that Carter orchestrated a \u201cconspiracy of harassment, bullying and intimidation against Plaintiff\u2019s lawyers, their families, employees and former associates in an attempt to silence Plaintiff from naming Jay-Z.\u201d",
      "On Monday, a lawyer for Carter asked a judge to either deny a request to allow the plaintiff to remain anonymous or dismiss the case.",
      "Carter\u2019s lawyer asked for an expedited hearing, which has not yet been scheduled.",
      "The lawyer, Alex Spiro, said the plaintiff\u2019s decision to sue anonymously was \u201cinconsistent with a genuine effort to determine the truth or falsity of these allegations as opposed to an effort to procure a quick, extortionate settlement.\u201d",
      "How are Carter and Combs linked?",
      "Both men rose to fame in the 1990s hip-hop scene in New York, with Combs founding Bad Boy Records and helping launch the career of the Notorious B.I.G., and Carter helping found Roc-A-Fella Records and releasing his debut album in 1996.",
      "They appeared on each other\u2019s music and went on to become well-known \u2014 and wealthy \u2014 entrepreneurs whose business ventures went far beyond hip-hop.",
      "Carter founded the entertainment company Roc Nation in 2008. Forbes has estimated his wealth at $2.5 billion. Much of Diddy\u2019s wealth in recent years came from a partnership with a vodka brand, according to Forbes.",
      "What are the allegations against Combs?",
      "Combs, 55, was arrested in September in connection with what federal authorities described as a yearslong scheme to sexually abuse and exploit women. He was charged with a racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation for purposes of prostitution, federal prosecutors said.",
      "Prosecutors in New York\u2019s Southern District accused Combs of coercing and forcing women into elaborate, drug-fueled \u201cfreak offs\u201d with male sex workers that he arranged, directed and recorded.",
      "Combs has also been named as a defendant in lawsuits Buzbee filed on behalf of more than 100 accusers from across the U.S.",
      "Combs, who is being held at Brooklyn\u2019s Metropolitan Detention Center without bail, pleaded not guilty to the federal charges, and his lawyers have denied the allegations in the lawsuits.",
      "\u201cAs his legal team has said before, Mr. Combs has full confidence in the facts and the integrity of the judicial process,\u201d his legal representatives said in a statement Sunday. \u201cIn court, the truth will prevail: that Mr. Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone \u2014 man or woman, adult or minor.\u201d"

    "summary": "The man arrested Monday in connection with the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson is alleged to have had a type of homemade weapon known as a \"ghost gun.\"",
    "story": [
      "The man arrested\u00a0Monday in connection with the fatal shooting of\u00a0UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson is alleged to have had a type of homemade weapon known as a \"ghost gun.\"",
      "Luigi Mangione, 26, whom police named as a \u201cstrong person of interest,\u201d had a \"ghost gun that had the capability of firing 9 mm round and a suppressor\u201d when he was arrested on weapons charges in Altoona, Pennsylvania, New York Police Department Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told reporters.",
      "A senior law enforcement official told NBC News the weapon found in Mangione's possession appears to be similar to the weapon used in the Manhattan murder.\u00a0Kenny said the weapon \"may have been made on a 3D printer.\"",
      "What are ghost guns?",
      "\"Ghost guns\" are firearms that can be assembled at home from parts that are bought online. Those parts can usually be obtained without background checks and do not have serial numbers.",
      "How long have ghost guns been around?",
      "The do-it-yourself kits have been around since the 1990s, but they have exploded in popularity in recent years \u2014 especially among criminals.",
      "The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said that from January 2016 to December 2021, it received about 45,000 reports of suspected privately made firearms recovered by law enforcement agencies in criminal investigations \u2014 including 692 homicides or attempted homicides.",
      "The number of ghost guns recovered rose steadily each of those years, from 1,758 in 2016 to 19,344 in 2021, according to the Justice Department.",
      "Technology has also added to the steep increase \u2014 online videos about how to assemble the guns have millions of views, while some sellers offer 3D printing\u00a0files for customers to print and assemble the weapons themselves, without serial numbers.",
      "The Justice Department said in a 2022 fact sheet that firearms without serial numbers are incredibly difficult to trace \u2014 the ATF reported it was able to trace only 0.98% of the suspected ghost guns submitted by law enforcement to individual purchasers.",
      "What is the government doing about the issue?",
      "In 2022, President Joe Biden announced\u00a0restrictions on the sale of ghost guns with the finalization of a rule requiring makers of gun kits to include serial numbers on firearms and sellers to follow the same standard as with other guns, including requiring background checks for purchases.",
      "\u201cThese guns are the weapons of choice for many criminals,\u201d Biden said, and \u201cwe are going to do everything we can to deprive them of that choice.\u201d",
      "Gun rights groups and manufacturers have challenged the ATF rule in court, with a federal judge in Texas and an appeals court ruling against the Biden administration. The Supreme Court has ruled twice that the regulations can remain while the litigation continues.",
      "Gun safety advocates, meanwhile, have been urging Congress to close loopholes and turn the rule into a law. Over a dozen states have also passed laws regulating ghost guns, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun violence prevention organization.",
      "The group and others have also been urging Congress to take action on 3D-printed guns, which the Trump administration loosened regulations on in 2020. No federal law bars them, but the ATF says that it is illegal to make them for sale without licenses and that they must be detectable by metal detectors and X-ray machines. A number of states also have individual laws regulating or banning the weapons, according to Everytown."

    "summary": "A.J., Big Justice and the Rizzler: They bring the boom. They're the Costco Guys, with the kid who does the Rizz Face. But who are they?",
    "story": [
      "Before you ask; they bring the boom. That's what they do.",
      "You might have noticed kids talking about Costco more than usual. Maybe they yell an emphatic \"BOOM!\" or \"DOOM!\" after eating, or start making the \"rizz face\" at you.",
      "That would be the result of three viral stars known to the internet as A.J., Big Justice and the Rizzler. As wild as the nicknames might sound, the three viral TikTok stars have shown up all over social media and beyond in 2024.",
      "After their viral Costco-related videos and \"BOOM or DOOM\" food reviews, A.J. and Big Justice have been bringing the \"Boom\" beyond TikTok to mainstream media. After releasing a song, \"We Bring the Boom,\" their dance has become a popular celebration for college football players, with even Lebron James and son Bronny James seen doing the dance before a Los Angeles Lakers game.",
      "The Costco guys often team up with TikTok sensation \"The Rizzler,\" a kid most famous for his \"Rizz Face\" expression, which is a mewing gesture. The three have made public appearances together on multiple occasions, including an interview on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.",
      "Here's what to know about A.J., Big Justice, and the Rizzler.",
      "Who are Andrew \"A.J.\" Befumo Jr. and Eric \"Big Justice\" Befumo?",
      "A.J. Befumo, 48, is a graduate of Seton Hall University currently living in Boca Raton, Florida, according to his LinkedIn.",
      "Before the internet fame, Befumo used his Instagram and TikTok to promote mortgage broker American Financial Network, where he worked as a regional manager since 2021.",

      "On January 29, 2024, A.J. Befumo posted a TikTok with his son, Eric Befumo, 12, in Costco asking fans to guess if their order was over or under $300. The video received over 750,000 likes and 7.9 million views, the first of their many viral Costco videos.",

      "In the \"TikTok\" sketch on Saturday Night Live on October 19, the two were impersonated by Marcello Hernandez (A.J.) and Chloe Fineman (Big Justice), singing their song \"We Bring the Boom,\" while holding Costco Chicken Bakes.",
      "A.J. Befumo's entertainment experience predates his family vlog channel. Under the stage name \u201cthe American Powerchild Eric Justice,\" Befumo was a former professional wrestler who came out of retirement this year for an All-Elite Wrestling appearance on Nov. 23.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d said Big Justice on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, when asked about working with his dad. \u201cIt\u2019s not just working with my dad, it\u2019s working with my whole family. Ashley, my mom, it\u2019s so amazing that we accomplished all of this together.\u201d",
      "Why are they Called \"Costco Guys?\"",
      "The Befumos started posting more Costco-related content after their initial success. On March 1, they posted their most viewed video on their TikTok, labeling themselves as \"Costco Guys.\" The mega-hit received 59 million views and 4.5 million likes, propelling the Costco guys into stardom.",
      "Befumo also went viral for his famed love of the Costco Double Chunk Chocolate Cookie. Big Justice\u2019s favorite option \u2014 the Chicken Bake, a pastry with chicken, cheese, bacon and Caesar dressing \u2014 also receives praise from fans.",
      "Their \"BOOM or DOOM\" food review of the Costco food court received over 30 million views and 2.5 million likes in March 2024. The two have extended their food reviews beyond the store, and review food with other family members (A.J. Befumo's daughter Ashley, and wife nicknamed \"Mama Justice\") and other creators on the \"BOOM Meter.\"",
      "In an interview on Fox Business's \"The Claman Countdown\" on Nov. 22, host Liz Claman revealed to A.J. and Eric Befumo that the Costco share price had hit an all-time high, helped by sales in the food court, specifically of the Chicken Bake.",
      "Who is \"The Rizzler?\"",
      "The 3-foot-11, eight-year-old sensation doesn't share any relation to the Befumo family.",
      "Christian Joseph, known to the public as \"The Rizzler,\" has a TikTok account with his dad that first went viral when he wore an adorable Black Panther costume for Halloween. In a TikTok, he explained to his father filming why he couldn't climb a ladder.",
      "\"Cuz mommy said it's dangerous,\" said the Rizzler.",
      "The child star first started calling himself The Rizzler on TikTok in April 2024 and collaborated with Big Justice on his TikTok in June.",
      "The Rizzler has been making the \"Rizz Face\" at various sporting events, including at Game 5 of the MLB National League Championship Series, to the crowd's delight.

    "story": [
      "Selena Gomez is celebrating her Golden Globe nomination for her role in \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d hours after she reacted to criticism of her Spanish in the film.",
      "Gomez stars alongside Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n in the Netflix musical crime film \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d which arrived on the streaming platform Nov. 13. In the movie, Gomez portrays Jessi Del Monte, the wife of a cartel kingpin, and speaks Spanish.",
      "Shortly after\u00a0\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d debuted on Netflix, Gomez spoke to NPR about taking Spanish lessons for nearly half a year to prepare.",
      "\u201cI got my first job at 7, and most of my jobs from that point on were English,\u201d she told NPR. \u201cAnd I just lost (my Spanish). That\u2019s kind of the case for a lot of people, especially Mexican American people.\u201d",
      "She continued, \u201cI wish I just knew a lot more than I do. But I think that\u2019s why I try to honor my culture as much as possible \u2014 from releasing an album in Spanish to wanting to pursue this movie. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be the last thing I do in Spanish.\u201d",
      "\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d originally premiered at the 77th Cannes Film Festival in May, but now that the film is streaming and involved in awards season conversations, more people have been able to view the movie, including Mexican actor and comedian Eugenio Derbez.",
      "Derbez recently discussed \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d on an episode of the \u201cHablando de Cine Con\u201d podcast with host Gaby Meza. In a clip from the episode, which has since been removed from Spotify, shared on TikTok, Derbez called out Gomez\u2019s Spanish.",
      "\u201cSelena is indefensible,\u201d he said in Spanish. \u201cI (watched \u2018Emilia P\u00e9rez\u2019) with people, and every time she had a scene, we looked at each other to say, \u2018Wow, what is this?\u2019\u201d",
      "Meza agreed, adding, \u201cI feel like she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s saying. If she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s saying, she can\u2019t give her acting any nuance.\u201d",
      "Derbez also pointed out that the movie was directed by Jacques Audiard, who is French.",
      "The \u201cCODA\u201d star said, \u201cI liked the film, aside from the Selena (moments) that jump at you, because it has salvageable things. But I told myself, \u2018How weird that the director doesn\u2019t speak English or Spanish and the movie is in Spanish and English. And it takes place in Mexico and you don\u2019t understand the culture.\u2019 It\u2019s like if I made a film in Russian without knowing the culture or speaking Russian and talking in French.\u201d",
      "A day after Derbez\u2019s comments made headlines, Gomez responded to his critique.",
      "In the comments beneath the TikTok post, she wrote, \u201cI understand where you are coming from..I\u2019m sorry I did the best I could with the time I was given.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cDoesn\u2019t take away from how much work and heart I put into this movie.\u201d",
      "Derbez saw her reply and later penned an apology to Gomez shared on TikTok Dec. 8.",
      "On Dec. 8, he wrote, \u201cDear Selena, I truly apologize for my careless comments \u2014 they are indefensible and go against everything I stand for. As Latinos, we should always support one another. There\u2019s no excuse. I was wrong, and I deeply admire your career and your heart.\u201d",
      "He went on to say that \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d should be praised and that his remarks should not be the focus. He said his viral comments taught him an \"important lesson\" and he understands if Gomez chooses not to accept his apology.",
      "At the end of his statement, he signed it, \u201cWith all my love and admiration.\u201d",
      "Gomez appeared to move on from the back-and-forth with Derbez as she celebrated her Golden Globe nomination\u00a0Dec. 9 for her work in \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d She earned a nod for best performance by a female actor in a supporting role in any motion picture.",
      "The 32-year-old shared a video on her Instagram story of her emotional reaction the moment she heard her name read. In the clip, Gomez, who was lounging on a couch, immediately sat up and covered her face.",
      "\u201cOh my God! I can\u2019t believe it!\u201d she said.",
      "In the caption, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t even know what to write.. I\u2019m so proud of @zoesaldana and I am so grateful and honored @goldenglobes.\u201d",
      "Co-star Salda\u00f1a is also nominated in the same supporting actor category as Gomez, and Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n landed a nod for best performance by a female actor in a motion picture (musical or comedy). In total, \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d led the field with 10 nominations.",

    "summary": "Kelly Clarkson's weight loss is a topic of speculation. The singer said she made diet and exercise changes and has shared previously body and weight struggles.",
    "story": [
      "When it comes to Kelly Clarkson's weight loss journey, the singer has been open with fans about how she's changed her lifestyle in recent years. Some of the ways she's lost weight include walking, eating more protein, and medication to help with how her body processes food.",
      "Clarkson started some of these changes to her diet and exercise routines when she moved to New York City, where she hosts \"The Kelly Clarkson Show.\" She shared in an interview that she has a much more active day-to-day living in the city, which has helped with her weight loss. Around the same time, she also started trying out a high-protein diet, which can help with weight loss by keeping you feeling more full and satisfied.",
      "And the original \"American Idol\" made headlines in May this year when she revealed that she was taking a medication to assist in her weight loss. She explained that she'd had concerns about using such a drug due to problems with her thyroid but eventually decided to try it. She broke the news on her talk show.",
      "RELATED: 18 celebrities who\u2019ve opened up about taking Ozempic or weight-loss drugs",
      "Every time Clarkson makes big appearances, such as at the 2024 Rockefeller Tree Lighting and on the TODAY show in mid-December, fans seem to remark on how the star looks different.",
      "Here's what to know about Kelly Clarkson's weight loss journey based on what she's shared publicly.",
      "What drug is Kelly Clarkson taking to lose weight?",
      "Clarkson did not specify what weight-loss medication she is taking beyond that it is not Ozempic.",
      "She confirmed the rumors during a May episode of \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" when chatting with Whoopi Goldberg, who\u2019s also been open about using Mounjaro, another weight-loss drug.",
      "While the \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d winner was initially unsure about trying medication to lose weight, she said she decided to \u201cbecause my blood work got so bad.\"",
      "\u201cMy doctor chased me for like two years, and I was like, \u2018No I\u2019m afraid of it, I already have thyroid problems,\u2019\u201d she explained.",
      "\u201cEveryone thinks it\u2019s Ozempic \u2014 it\u2019s not. It\u2019s something else,\u201d she told Goldberg. \u201cBut it\u2019s something that aids in helping break down the sugar. Obviously my body doesn\u2019t do it right.\u201d",
      "She added that she didn\u2019t notice how much weight she\u2019d gained prior to starting the medication. But catching a glimpse of herself on camera one day prompted her to pause and ask herself \u201cWho the f--k is that?\u201d she recalled.",
      "\"My heaviest, I was like 203, and I\u2019m 5 foot 3 and a half,\" Clarkson continued. \"It\u2019s funny because people assume, \u2018Oh she must\u2019ve been miserable, depressed, whatever,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018No I was not.'\"",
      "\u201cI was never insecure about it, I was happy,\u201d she added.",
      "How did Kelly Clarkson lose weight?",
      "In addition to taking a weight-loss drug, Clarkson has made lifestyle changes for her long-term health.",
      "In January 2024, she credited her move to New York City for helping her get active. In an exclusive interview with People, she revealed that she's lost weight because she's now taking her wellness seriously and walking more.",
      "She did not address her gym routine but said, \u201cWalking in the city is quite the workout.\"",
      "Clarkson chose to relocate her talk show to New York from Los Angeles in 2023. \u201cI was very unhappy in L.A. and had been for several years. I needed a fresh start,\u201d Clarkson told People. California, she said, wasn't good for her mental health.",
      "In New York, she adopted a few other wellness trends, too. \"I\u2019m really into infrared saunas right now. And I just got a cold plunge because everybody wore me down,\" the \"Piece By Piece\" singer added.",
      "As for her diet, Clarkson isn't doing anything extreme.",
      "\u201cI eat a healthy mix,\u201d she told People. \u201cI dropped weight because I\u2019ve been listening to my doctor \u2014\u00a0a couple (of) years I didn\u2019t. And 90% of the time I\u2019m really good at it because a protein diet is good for me anyway. I\u2019m a Texas girl, so I like meat \u2014\u00a0sorry, vegetarians in the world!\"",
      "\u201cBut I still splurge. The other night I had a frozen yogurt with my daughter, and it was magical,\" added the Grammy winner, who shares daughter River Rose, 10, and son Remington, 8, with ex-husband Brandon Blackstock.",
      "Kelly Clarkson's thyroid and other health issues",
      "Clarkson has spoken before about her thyroid and autoimmune issues and trying to lose weight to address them.",
      "For example, she changed her diet and ended up losing about 37 pounds,\u00a0she told TODAY\u2019s Hoda Kotb in 2018.",
      "\u201cI know the industry loves the weight gone, but for me, it wasn\u2019t really the weight,\u201d Clarkson said at the time.",
      "Back then, to lose the weight, Clarkson focused on a lectin-free diet, she told Extra. Lectins are the proteins that bind carbohydrates. (Talk to a health professional before making any major changes to your diet, such as removing carbs.)",
      "Clarkson read a book about lectins and cut them out of her diet which meant no legumes, beans, whole grains, dairy and certain veggies.",
      "\"I literally read this book, and I did it for this autoimmune disease that I had and I had a thyroid issue, and now all my levels are back up,\" she said during the interview. \"Literally, I haven\u2019t worked out at all.\"",
      "During a January 2024 episode of her talk show, she revealed\u00a0she was prediabetic.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t shocked,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cI was a tiny bit overweight. ... They were like, \u2018You\u2019re prediabetic. You\u2019re right on the borderline.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018But I\u2019m not there yet.\u2019\u201d",
      "Two years after finding out, she decided to change her lifestyle habits.",
      "Having\u00a0prediabetes\u00a0means your blood sugar levels are higher than normal but still lower than the range for Type 2 diabetes, according to the\u00a0Cleveland Clinic. Exercise and a healthy diet can help reduce the risk of it progressing.",
      "Kelly Clarkson's weight struggles",
      "Throughout her years in Hollywood, the \"American Idol\" star has had to deal with a lot of commentary about her size.",
      "She told Glamour UK in 2020 that being thin doesn't always give her more confidence, adding that she got her coaching role on \"The Voice\" after gaining some weight.",
      "\u201cI got on the No. 1 television show at my heaviest point, because it was right after I had kids, and it was like they didn\u2019t care,\u201d Clarkson said.",
      "\u201cPaul (Telegdy, chairman of NBC Entertainment) hired me from NBC because he loved my personality, he loved that I connect with people and I\u2019m really raw and real. It had nothing to do with my sex appeal or my look aesthetically. It had to do with me as a person. I think it\u2019s really up to artists to force people to have that mentality.\u201d",
      "Clarkson and TODAY's Jenna Bush Hager bonded over weight struggles when Jenna and her twin sister, Barbara Pierce Bush, appeared on \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" in November 2023.",
      "During the conversation, Clarkson showed a photo of Jenna and Barbara dressed identically as kids.",
      "\u201cThose drop waist things were popular,\u201d Jenna said of the dresses she and her sister were wearing in the pic. Clarkson interjected, \u201cWhich is not good for girls with curves later on.\u201d",
      "After Jenna remarked that she and Barbara \u201cwere chubby\u201d as children, Barbara agreed: \u201cWell, there was a stage.\"",
      "Clarkson then gave Jenna a high-five, joking, \u201cI\u2019ve had many stages.\u201d"

      "Frank, 70, was \u201ctotally a girly girl\u201d growing up, she said in an interview for Urban Outfitters\u2019 blog\u00a0in 2012.",
      "\u201cI was not a jock. When I was 12, my parents got me a loom, so I was a weaver. I loved to read, I loved to do artwork,\u201d she said.",
      "Frank realized the potential for turning her creativity into a business while studying art at the University of Arizona.",
      "\u201cOne day, I met a guy who said, \u2018Anything you draw I can have made,\u2019 so we started making things from my ideas,\u201d she told the Urban Outfitters blog. \u201cI also represented other people and sold their artwork, and then we realized that I was the one with the commercial sense, because if I said \u2018Make a teddy bear or a unicorn,\u2019 that was what sold.\u201d",
      "One of her earliest businesses was a brand called Sticky Fingers, which Frank described as \u201cjewelry all made up of plastic that I glued together with glue gun.\u201d",
      "Eventually, she rebranded Sticky Fingers using her own name, and Lisa Frank, Inc. (LFI) was born. The company was established in 1979, according to public records.",
      "The company boomed, bringing in more than $1 billion in retail sales between 1990 and 2005, the\u00a0Tucson Citizen reported in 2005.",
      "In 1994, Frank married James Green, an in-house illustrator hired in 1982 who later became the company\u2019s president and CEO in 1992,\u00a0per court documents, and gifted him 49% of LFI\u2019s shares, according to the same\u00a0court documents.",
      "Green, in the documentary and on his social media pages, has taken credit for \u201cestablishing the look and feel\u201d of Lisa Frank\u2019s signature art, which persists to this day. \u201cI am not the head artist. I am\u00a0the\u00a0artist,\u201d he said in an Instagram video posted after the\u00a0documentary aired.",
      "TODAY.com\u00a0has reached out to Green for comment and has not heard back at the time of publication.",
      "Frank and Green have two sons, Hunter and Forrest. Their names were inspired by two characters from the Lisa Frank universe: Hunter the leopard and Forrest the tiger cub.",
      "\u201cWe had created both characters before the boys were born, and then when they were born, we thought, \u2018Oh my gosh, they really do fit their personalities!\u2019\u201d Frank told Urban Outfitters in 2012.",
      "Frank filed for divorce against Green in 2005, marking the beginning of a years-long legal saga involving the former couple and other Lisa Frank associates, including former executive vice president Rhonda Rowlette.",
      "Frank sued Green in 2005 to remove him as director, president and chief operating officer of LFI, and buy back his shares. The case went to trial in 2007 and ruled in favor of LFI, terminating\u00a0Green as director, per a 2009 appeal.",
      "\u201cI lost my titles, I lost my business, I lost my building, I lost everything else ... She owns everything. She owns my life\u2019s work,\u201d Green said in the documentary.",
      "Meanwhile, Frank fired Rowlette, who in turn sued her in 2006 for $2 million plus damages, saying that Frank had promised her that amount in the event that her job was terminated. LFI denied making any such promises and the claim was settled, per a\u00a0court filing.",
      "The docuseries also includes interviews with several former employees about their experiences at LFI. Many share anecdotes about times both Frank and Green allegedly treated them harshly.",
      "\u201cThey definitely felt like they were trying to break my spirit,\u201d Tony De Luz, an illustrator at LFI from 1996 to 2000, said in the documentary. \u201cI think that was the way they operated, was that they wanted people who took whatever s--- they piled on them.\u201d",
      "Green, in the documentary, denied treating employees unfairly and calls the allegations a \u201ccrock of s---.\u201d He said his ex-wife was the \u201ctyrant,\u201d not him.",
      "Why is Lisa Frank not in the \u2018Glitter & Greed\u2019 documentary?",
      "Frank is notoriously private. There are few photos available of her publicly, she seldom gives interviews and when she agreed to speak to Urban Outfitters on camera in 2012 in conjunction with LFI\u2019s former collaboration with the brand, she asked for her face to be obscured.",
      "She doesn\u2019t appear in \u201cGlitter and Greed: The Lisa Frank Story,\u201d which explores the inner workings of Lisa Frank, Inc and suggests that the behind-the-scenes reality of the company was anything but rainbows and unicorns.",
      "Director Arianna La Penne says they reached out to Frank multiple times, but she declined to be interviewed.",
      "\u201cI thought about Lisa Frank every day that I was making this ... I really wanted her to participate,\u201d La Penne says, but added she has \u201cno judgment\u201d about the media-shy Frank declining to take part.",
      "La Penne says if she did have a chance to speak to Frank, the first question she would ask her would be, \u201cWas it all worth it?\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the sense of, is she happy now with where she landed?\u201d La Penne says. \u201cBecause in this company\u2019s life, the personal and the professional were completely intertwined, so it\u2019s all connected and related. And I really would love to know what it\u2019s like in her head.\u201d",
      "Where is Lisa Frank now?",
      "Frank does not appear to have given an interview in years.",
      "However, her brand has an online presence. The Lisa Frank website continues to sell merchandise, including backpacks, wallets, makeup palettes and laptop cases, all in Frank's signature style.",
      "The website also highlights Lisa Frank\u2019s collaborations with brands including Crocs, Morphe, Casetify and Hotels.com.",
      "The brand\u2019s TikTok page, which has more than 739,000 followers, has been hinting at a Lisa Frank renaissance for a while now.",
      "One post from November 2023 shows two Lisa Frank mascots standing in front of what appears to be the revitalized rainbow-painted Lisa Frank headquarters in Tucson, Arizona.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re baaaack!\u201d reads the caption.",
      "\u201cWhen we casually make a major comeback,\u201d the brand captioned a similar TikTok post in April.",
      "One key figure in Lisa Frank\u2019s new chapter is her son, Forrest Green, who has served as Head of Brand and Chairman of LFI since 2018, according to his LinkedIn profile.",
      "Forrest Green has worked closely with his mother from a young age, according to a 2021 Bustle profile. Frank was not interviewed for the article, but Forrest Green, then 21, said on the record he was behind the brand's recently revitalized Instagram.",
      "Forrest Green said his mother used to pull him out of elementary school to sit in at meetings at LFI.",
      "\u201cOne time when I was probably 8 or 9, I closed the meeting like, \u2018All right, guys, this was awesome; what are the next steps?\u2019\u201d he told Bustle. \u201cThe licensing agent at the time looked at me and said, \u2018Well, I guess Forrest closed the meeting!\u2019\u201d",
      "In recent years, Forrest Green has worked to build the brand\u2019s social media following. He has said one of his goals is to tap into \u201890s nostalgia while redefining the Lisa Frank brand for the 21st century.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just so much possibility. More than just people saying, \u2018Make some folders again, make some stickers again,\u2019\u201d he told Bustle. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely part of the plan, but it\u2019s like people don\u2019t even know who we are at this point. Lisa Frank is a lifestyle and it needs to be treated as such.\u201d",
      "The story of Lisa Frank is no doubt complex but for Robertson, working on the documentary ultimately increased her appreciation for the brand.",
      "\"I love the Lisa Frank work now more than ever after having spent several years deep, deep, deep in the story, and after having become aware of a really complicated reality that existed behind the scenes at the company,\" she tells TODAY.com.",
      "After interviewing several former Lisa Frank employees, Robertson says when she thinks of Lisa Frank, she sees the \"passions of all these people who left a part of themselves in it. And they want us to love that work. They want it to endure through the ages.\"",
      "As for the brand's future, Robertson says she has witnessed first-hand the ability of Lisa Frank designs to captivate a new generation.",
      "\"I think they have timeless appeal,\" she says. \"I remember as a girl, the attachment and attraction that I felt towards these objects and designs. And now I have a 6-year-old daughter, and she goes absolutely nuts for them.\""

      "DAMASCUS, Syria \u2014 Jubilant Syrians waving flags clambered Monday onto a government tank abandoned in the capital city's main square and took selfies.",
      "Others defaced or tore down the omnipresent portraits of ousted President Bashar al-Assad from government buildings. At the same time, hundreds of Syrian exiles streamed back into the country from Lebanon through unguarded border crossings.",
      "And just outside Damascus, celebrating crowds tossed a noose around the towering statue of Assad's father, Hafez al-Assad, the dictator who first imposed his iron grip on Syria a half-century ago, and toppled it to the ground. Then they chained it to the back of a truck and dragged it through the streets past cheering crowds.",
      "Everywhere, it seemed, the celebrations were accompanied by the sounds of rebels firing their AK-47s into the air, by honking horns, and by the sounds of Syrians of all ages yelling \"Hurriyah! Hurriyah!\" \u2014 or \"Freedom! Freedom!\"",
      "The streets were littered in places with the discarded uniforms of Assad's soldiers, who dispersed before the\u00a0Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) militants entered Damascus and all but ended a bloody 13-year civil war that had torn this ancient land apart.",
      "Assad, who fled with his immediate family to Russia and was granted asylum by his longtime patron Vladimir Putin, was not around to see his countrymen embracing the HTS rebels who had, in a matter of days, taken over Syria.",
      "Hours after Assad fled, HTS leader Abu Mohammad al-Jolani arrived at a Damascus mosque wearing military fatigues.",
      "In recent years he\u2019s also taken to using his real name, Ahmad al-Sharaa.",
      "Al-Jolani ordered his men to not harm civilians and to stop looting, although Syrians could be seen removing furniture and other items from Assad's abandoned palaces and eyeing the fleet of luxury cars the dictator kept in a garage.",
      "One of the first things al-Jolani's forces did was burst into Assad's brutal jails and free thousands of prisoners, many of whom had been held for decades in horrific conditions under which rape and other sexual torture were rampant.",
      "But al-Jolani heads a militant group that was once Al Qaeda\u2019s Syria branch and which both the U.S. and United Nations have designated a terrorist organization. And a wary world was watching to see whether Syria was replacing one despot with another.",
      "Still, President Joe Biden on Sunday declared, \"At long last, the Assad regime has fallen.\"",
      "\u201cWe will engage with all Syrian groups, including within the process led by the United Nations, to establish a transition away from the Assad regime,\" he said.",
      "The\u00a0U.S. has about 900 American troops stationed in northern Syria and\u00a0has been closely monitoring the HTS takeover of Syria.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump delivered a different message on his\u00a0Truth Social platform\u00a0Saturday morning, writing, in capital letters, that the U.S. should \u201chave nothing to do with\u201d the situation in Syria.",
      "\u201cThis is not our fight,\" he wrote. \"Let it play out.\u201d",
      "Al-Jolani\u00a0has tried to reassure his countrymen in multiethnic and multireligious Syria that all faiths will be respected and that there will be no retribution against the low-level government functionaries and soldiers who served the Assad government.",
      "He has also vowed not to go after all of the Alawites, the minority sect that Assad's family is part of and that ran the military and government and controlled the country with a Soviet-style secret police apparatus whose main objective was stifling all dissent by any means necessary.",
      "So far, most Syrians appeared to be taking al-Jolani at his word.",
      "After Damascus fell, Syria\u2019s prime minister, Ghazi al-Jalali, said in a statement that he does not intend to leave \u201cexcept in a peaceful manner that ensures the continued functioning of public institutions and state facilities, promoting security and reassurance for our fellow citizens.\u201d",
      "He said that the government is ready to cooperate with \u201cany leadership chosen by the Syrian people.\u201d",
      "In the town of Qardaha, where the Assad family is from and where Hafez al-Assad is buried, the elders vowed in a statement Monday to cooperate with Syria's new rulers.",
      "As for the portraits of the father-son dictators that are everywhere in this coastal Syrian city, \"the attendees call for the removal of all statues and images from public squares and places,\" the elders declared.",

    "summary": "The Assad regime's fall marks a damaging defeat for Iran, the latest in a string of setbacks that have punctured assumptions about Tehran\u2019s power in the region.",
    "story": [
      "The swift collapse of Bashar al-Assad\u2019s Syrian regime represents a devastating defeat for Iran, the latest in a string of setbacks that have punctured long held assumptions in the West about Tehran\u2019s military prowess.",
      "In recent months, Iran has proved unable to thwart Israeli covert operations from targeting key figures in the regime, defend itself from damaging Israeli airstrikes, or protect an ally next door that was a linchpin in its regional proxy network, dubbed the \u201caxis of resistance.\u201d",
      "For decades, Syria has served as a vital land bridge to Iran\u2019s Hezbollah militia in Lebanon, allowing Tehran to ferry weapons to its partners across the Syrian border. After a mass uprising against Assad in 2011, Russia provided air power for Damascus and Iran propped up the brutal ruler with weapons, cash, Iranian Revolutionary Guard officers and militants from Iranian-backed proxy forces in Lebanon, Iraq and elsewhere.",
      "But when Syrian rebel forces seized Aleppo last month against poorly trained, demotivated Syrian army troops, Iran was caught off guard at a difficult moment, with its military depleted from Israeli air raids and its proxy forces in Lebanon decimated from fighting with Israel, current and former U.S. officials said. As the rebels pressed ahead, there was no concerted effort to stop the advance with Russian warplanes or Iranian-backed proxy forces.",
      "The dramatic events over the weekend marked \u201ca fundamental change in the equation of the entire Middle East,\u201d a senior Biden administration official told reporters on Sunday.\u201cAssad was effectively abandoned because his only friends ... Iran, Hezbollah and Russia, no longer had the capacity to help,\u201d the official added.",
      "Iran\u2019s weakened position has challenged prevailing assumptions in Washington and other capitals about Iran\u2019s power and resilience, as well as expectations about how a direct clash between Israel and Iran would play out, former U.S. intelligence officials and experts said.",
      "\u201cYou have a series of myths that have evaporated over the last year,\u201d said one former U.S. official.",
      "The United States and other governments had feared an Israeli attack on Iran would produce an overwhelming response against Israel by Iran\u2019s proxies. There also was a widespread view that Iran\u2019s vast missile arsenal would deter Israel from ever directly attacking, and if it did, Tehran might overwhelm Israeli air defenses in retaliation.",
      "And there were fears that a direct clash between Iran and Israel would result in an open-ended conflagration that would draw in the United States and other countries.",
      "None of those scenarios came to pass.",
      "Israeli air raids against Iran did not trigger a crippling response from Iran\u2019s proxies in Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq or Yemen. It was unclear whether those proxy forces lacked the means and the will to act more aggressively, or whether Tehran\u2019s leadership was reluctant to confront Israel directly, former officials said.",
      "With crucial help from the United States and its allies, Israel was able to shoot down most of the ballistic missiles and drones launched by Iran. Hezbollah, the Lebanese militia armed and trained by Iran, have proved no match for Israel\u2019s military and intelligence operations, which have killed much of its leadership and penetrated its communications.",
      "Those incorrect assumptions about Iran \u201cshaped and indeed constrained regional and U.S. policy on Iran,\u201d said Norman Roule,\u00a0former senior U.S. intelligence official and senior adviser to United Against Nuclear Iran, a nonprofit that focuses on combating threats posed by Iran.",
      "The loss of Syria as a reliable and subservient ally has likely irreparably damaged Iran\u2019s proxy network, which Tehran viewed as a defensive wall protecting Iran and a way of fighting countries with more powerful conventional militaries, current and former U.S. officials said.",
      "\u201cThe fall of Assad really puts a big question mark around whether the \u2018axis of resistance\u2019 is still feasible,\u201d said Alex Vatanka of the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cIran paid billions in the last two decades to establish this \u2018forward defense\u2019 model \u2014 and for a long time it delivered results,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cBut once under pressure, the model and the Arab partners of Iran have proven to lack the capacity to withstand pressure,\" Vatanka added. \"It began with Hezbollah and now Assad.\"",
      "Mohammad Ali Abtahi, a former vice president of Iran,\u00a0wrote on social media\u00a0shortly before the Assad government collapsed that the fall of the regime \u201cwould be one of the most significant events in the history of the Middle East.\u201d Abtahi added that \u201cresistance in the region would be left without support. Israel would become the dominant force.\u201d",
      "Recent events, including the failure to fend off anti-regime rebel forces in Syria over the past two weeks, have exposed a \u201crot\u201d inside Iran\u2019s military and security apparatus, Roule said.",
      "\u201cStarting with the killing of Soleimani in 2020, Iran faced a series of setbacks and defeats that exposed weaknesses and failures in Iran\u2019s intelligence and security services,\u201d Roule said, referring to Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the leader of the Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 Quds Force, who was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad in January 2020.",
      "\u201cOver the past year, Israel accelerated this rot through its killing of a large number of experienced IRGC (Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps) and Hezbollah officers involved in Syria,\u201d he said.",
      "Those officers had decades of experience in Syria and a network of contacts among the militants in Iran\u2019s proxy network, including Iraqis, Afghans, Pakistanis, Yemenis and others.",
      "\u201cWhen those officers and their \u2018rolodex\u2019 were lost, Iran\u2019s bureaucratic cohesion and efficiency suffered,\u201d Roule said.",
      "Iran\u2019s intelligence services appear incapable of giving their leaders advance warning about direct threats or disrupting hostile covert operations, according to Roule and other analysts.",
      "It was unclear why commanders in the Revolutionary Guard Corps\u2019 Quds Force, which oversees the proxy network and has worked closely with the Syrian army, did not take decisive action to rescue the Assad regime\u2019s forces.\u00a0In both Lebanon and Syria in recent months, Iran has chosen not to deploy its own forces in significant numbers to aid its partners.",
      "Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamanei, \u201chas traditionally refused to allow Iranian forces to risk themselves to protect proxies,\u201d Roule said.",
      "The loss of Syria has undermined the image Iran cultivated about its Quds Force being an elite military unit able to defeat its adversaries and protect Shiite populations abroad.",
      "Iran now may have second thoughts about the Oct. 7 attack on Israel last year by Iranian-backed Hamas militants in Gaza, which Tehran applauded at the time.\u00a0The attack, masterminded by the late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, caught Israel by surprise but set off a chain of events that have undermined Iran on multiple fronts, culminating in the demise of the Assad regime, according to Marc Polymeropoulos, a former CIA officer with experience in the Middle East.",
      "\u201cThe Iranian axis of resistance has crumbled thanks to one person, Yahya Sinwar, who started this on October 7,\u201d Polymeropoulos said.",
      "Although Iran has suffered a blow in the short term, it will most likely seek to rebuild its proxy forces, possibly by using Yemen as a hub or exploiting possible chaos in Syria after Assad\u2019s exit.",
      "The United States and Arab partners will need to cut off Iran\u2019s ability to dispatch weapons and trainers to Lebanon to ensure that Tehran does not rebuild its militant network, said Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., a former U.S. diplomat.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s in our national security interest that we cut off Iran\u2019s capabilities in Syria because that\u2019s how they were transitioning and transferring weapons to Hezbollah, through the ground as well as overflight over Iraq and Syria,\u201d Kim told MSNBC. \u201cAnd if we\u2019re able to sever this right now, this could be not just a setback but a devastating blow.\u201d",
      "With its air defenses, missile arsenal and regional status damaged, Iran will have to decide how to manage its nuclear program and how to approach the new U.S. administration under President-elect Donald Trump, who imposed severe economic sanctions on Tehran during his first term. Those sanctions have remained in place, and Iran has continued to enrich uranium to levels close to weapons-grade while refusing to fully cooperate with U.N. inspectors over its nuclear program.",
      "But Iran so far has opted to stop short of building nuclear weapons, and may look for a diplomatic compromise with the United States and other powers as it tries to regroup, experts said.",
      "\u201cI think Iran will think twice before weaponizing and will maintain the nuclear card as a bargaining chip, and for now attempt compromises with its foreign opponents,\u201d Vatanka said."

Video surfaced shortly after his disappearance showing masked men holding him at gunpoint. The U.S. government cast doubt on whether the video was authentic and suggested it may have been staged.",

      "For much of its 13 years, the horrors of Syria\u2019s grinding civil war felt unending. Now, after just 11 days, the regime of President Bashar al-Assad is gone, the dictator fleeing his country in the face of a sensational advance by rebel forces.",
      "Many Syrians are jubilant.",
      "Assad clung to power through domestic oppression, torture and murder, eventually suppressing a 2011 uprising with a mix of chemical weapons and deadly backing from Russia and Iran. That seems to be over, bringing to an end his family\u2019s iron-fist dynasty that began in 1971.",
      "However, this is far from a quick, simple fix. The rebels who toppled Assad are led by a group that the United States and others regard as a terrorist organization. And they reclaim a Syria deeply scarred by more than a decade of war \u2014 with no clear path to what happens next or how it might be governed.",
      "\u201cThere is undoubtedly justified optimism in Syria today after the overthrow of the brutalizing dictatorship of Assad,\u201d said Burcu Ozcelik, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank. \u201cWhat is simultaneously true is that Syria remains fragile and faces an uncertain future.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "Assad is gone",
      "The sensational news that spread across Syria and social media was eventually confirmed in an announcement Sunday from Russian state media: This once feared strongman had fled the country his family had ruled for more than 50 years."

    "summary": "The South Korean government ordered an overseas travel ban on President Yoon Suk Yeol as he faces investigation over a short-lived martial law declaration.",
    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 The South Korean government Monday ordered an overseas travel ban on President Yoon Suk Yeol as he faces investigation on possible rebellion charges over a short-lived martial law declaration that plunged the key U.S. ally into chaos last week.",
      "Opposition lawmakers continue to pursue impeachment for Yoon, 63, who stunned the East Asian democracy Tuesday when he declared emergency martial law, accusing the opposition-controlled parliament of paralyzing the government and sympathizing with communist North Korea, with whom South Korea technically remains at war. The martial law order banned all political activity and censored the news media.",
      "Lawmakers rushed to the National Assembly in central Seoul, pushing past martial law troops to enter the building and vote unanimously to reject the order, which Yoon lifted early Wednesday, about six hours after he announced it.",
      "It was a shocking turn of events for South Korea, which spent decades under military-authoritarian rule before it transitioned into a vibrant democracy and the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy. Lawmakers swiftly called for Yoon to leave office, backed by thousands of protesters.",
      "An impeachment motion failed to pass Saturday after lawmakers from Yoon\u2019s governing People Power Party (PPP) walked out of parliament en masse, leaving the legislature without a quorum. The opposition bloc holds 192 seats, eight short of the two-thirds majority the bill needed to pass in the 300-member unicameral legislature.",
      "In the meantime, Yoon \u2014 who took office in 2022 for a single five-year term \u2014 appears to have left his fate in the hands of his conservative PPP.",
      "Party leader Han Dong-hoon said Sunday that Yoon had effectively been suspended from duty over his \u201cunconstitutional acts.\u201d",
      "\u201cI believe it is the will of the majority South Korean people that President Yoon Suk Yeol must resign,\u201d he said in a national address, adding that he would \u201crestore order\u201d by ensuring Yoon\u2019s early departure from office.",
      "\u201cWe will minimize confusion through an orderly resignation to alleviate national and international concerns and restore the economy and the nation\u2019s dignity,\u201d he said.",
      "In the meantime, he said, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo will work in close coordination with the PPP \u201cto manage public welfare and state affairs without disruption.\" Yoon will not engage in state affairs, including foreign relations, he said.",
      "Han also said authorities would investigate Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration \u201crigorously, impartially and transparently.\u201d",
      "Though the president is generally immune from prosecution while in office, that does not include allegations of rebellion or treason.",
      "Park Se-hyun, who is leading a special headquarters\u00a0to investigate Yoon\u2019s short-lived martial law declaration, said Sunday that Yoon had been booked as a suspect on a number of charges, including treason.",
      "\u201cAn investigation is underway in accordance with the process,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "Former Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun, who has been accused of suggesting the martial law declaration to Yoon and whose resignation Yoon accepted last week, became the first person to be detained in the martial law case after he turned himself in around 1 a.m. Sunday local time (11 a.m. Saturday ET).",
      "Interior Minister Lee Sang-min, who is also under investigation, offered his resignation Sunday.",
      "In a national address Sunday, Han, the prime minister, said he felt a \u201cprofound sense of responsibility for the situation\u201d and expressed his \u201cheartfelt apologies\u201d to the public, bowing his head to show his sincerity, as is customary in Korean culture.",
      "\u201cThe government will devote itself entirely to addressing the current crisis as swiftly as possible, guided solely by the will of the people,\u201d he said.",
      "Han said the top priority was ensuring the continuity of government, citing concerns about the economy and international instability.",
      "He also said it was important that South Korea, which hosts almost 30,000 American troops, maintain its alliance with the U.S., as well as grow trilateral security ties with the U.S. and neighboring Japan.",
      "\u201cThe entire Cabinet will work tirelessly to preserve trust with our allies,\u201d Han said.",
      "He also appealed for cooperation from the opposition, saying it was \u201cimperative\u201d that the legislature pass the government\u2019s proposed budget.",
      "The liberal opposition Democratic Party criticized the response by the PPP and the prime minister as insufficient.",
      "\u201cPresident Yoon Seok Yeol must be immediately arrested, investigated and stripped of his military command authority,\u201d senior Democratic lawmaker Kim Min-seok said Sunday.",
      "Kim also questioned whether the prime minister had the constitutional authority to govern while Yoon remained in office.",
      "Yoon apologized Saturday in a brief nationally televised address, saying his actions \u201cstemmed from the urgency\u201d\u00a0he felt as president but adding that they \u201ccaused anxiety and inconvenience to the public.\u201d",
      "He said he would not evade \u201clegal and political responsibility\u201d but did not say he would resign, saying his party would decide how long he should stay in office and how state affairs would be managed.",
      "Yoon\u2019s apology is not enough, said Han Min-soo, a lawmaker from the Democratic Party and its head spokesman. He said Yoon led an insurrection and \u201cmust face the consequences and punishment for this action.\u201d",
      "\u201cI no longer refer to him as the president,\u201d Han said in an interview Saturday. \u201cI believe that Yoon Suk Yeol is now using tricks to buy time and deceive the people of South Korea and the opposition party.\u201d",
      "He said that the Democratic Party would work with other opposition parties to reintroduce the impeachment motion and that \u201cif we are stopped again, we will keep trying.\u201d",
      "\u201cI still believe that lawmakers with a conscience, even if they are members of the People Power Party, will agree to the impeachment,\u201d he said.",

      "Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based war monitor, said Saturday that Syrian troops and members of different security agencies have withdrawn from Homs, and that rebels have entered parts of the city, The Associated Press reported.",

      "\u201cOnce they get Homs, then really Damascus is cut off and they\u2019ll all be centered around Damascus and Latakia on the coast.\u201d",
