      "As Seattle Mariners chairman John Stanton spoke fondly of Rick Rizzs, the longtime play-by-play broadcaster pulled a box of tissues close and looked around the team\u2019s interview room in anticipation of the inevitable",
      "SEATTLE -- As Seattle Mariners chairman John Stanton spoke fondly of Rick Rizzs on Wednesday morning, the longtime play-by-play broadcaster pulled a box of tissues close and looked around the team\u2019s interview room in anticipation of the inevitable.",
      "Rizzs, who will retire at the end of the 2026 season after his 41st year in the booth in Seattle, could only hold back tears for so long while manager Dan Wilson, superstar Cal Raleigh and dozens of others looked on. And as the 72-year-old Rizzs recollected stories of both listening and writing to former Cubs broadcaster Jack Brickhouse as a kid while growing up on Chicago\u2019s South Side, he finally let the waterworks flow.",
      "\u201cYou get to a certain point where you\u2019re not that little kid watching the games on TV,\u201d said an emotional Rizzs, \u201cwishing you were Jack Brickhouse at 12 years old.\u201d",
      "When Rizzs got the chance to call major league games after being hired by the Mariners in 1983 to pair with Hall of Fame broadcaster Dave Niehaus, he had already lived out his dream. After broadcasting minor league baseball games in Alexandria, Virginia; Amarillo, Texas; Columbus, Ohio; and Memphis, Tennessee; Rizzs\u2019 goal was to be in the big leagues for just one year.",
      "Instead, he\u2019s in his fifth decade in Major League Baseball. Rizzs also broadcast games for the Detroit Tigers from 1992-1994. But, it was in the Pacific Northwest that Rizzs became a household name, laid down roots and was part of some of the most memorable moments in Mariners franchise history.",
      "\u201cI made Seattle my home,\u201d Rizzs said. \u201cI grew up in Chicago, but Seattle\u2019s my home.\u201d",
      "Rizzs said he had been contemplating retirement, and even considered calling it quits on a storied career after the 2025 season, one of the most successful in franchise history. In consultation with the Mariners, Rizzs decided to embrace the spotlight and enter the 2026 season with the public knowing it would be his last.",
      "As much as Rizzs has cherished his career as a broadcaster, he recognizes he has missed a lot, and at this stage of his life has spent a lot of time contemplating how he wants to spend it. Rizzs would like to spend more time with his grandkids, play a bit more golf and travel \u2014 to cities of his choosing, that is.",
      "\u201cI want to get on a plane that I want to get on,\u201d Rizzs said to roars of laughter. \u201cI want to go to a place that I want to go. I want to go to Italy and eat my brains out.\u201d",
      "But, Rizzs insisted he is not going away quite yet. He intends on going to spring training each year in Peoria, Arizona, and spending plenty of time around the Mariners. And should Rizzs have it his way, the Mariners will improve upon last year\u2019s disappointing finish in which Seattle lost Game 7 of the American League championship series to the Toronto Blue Jays.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to get to the World Series this year,\u201d Rizzs said, \u201cand we\u2019re going to win it this year.\u201d",

      "From Rizzs\u2019 point of view, it\u2019s all been gravy after that first season broadcasting for the Mariners.",
      "He\u2019s been in the booth for the Mariners\u2019 magical 1995 run to the AL Championship Series, which coincided with the King County Council approving funding for a new stadium. Rizzs donned a headset during the Mariners\u2019 116-win season in 2001, and was on the call for Raleigh\u2019s game-tying, eighth-inning home run against the Blue Jays in Game 5 of the 2025 ALCS.",

      "In all the dystopian visions of the future that the movies have trotted out over the last few decades, the one that sticks the most, surprisingly, is \u201cWALL-E.\u201d That\u2019s not just because of the chastening sight of an over-polluted Earth or those sedentary humans glued to their screens. It\u2019s because those quite plausible possibilities mean something different in a kids movie. It\u2019s their future, after all.",
      "Some of the same can be said about Ugo Bienvenu\u2019s \u201cArco,\u201d a charming and dreamy sci-fi animated movie where environmental catastrophe and cartoony fun collide. Like \u201cWALL-E,\u201d there are heroic robots in \u201cArco,\u201d an Oscar nominee for best animated feature. But it\u2019s the film\u2019s plucky young protagonists that give Bienvenu\u2019s future-set film its heart.",
      "The film opens in a distant future where a family lives on \u201cJetsons\u201d-like platforms in the clouds. They wear drab onesies (fashion sense has seemingly been lost along with the Earth\u2019s surface) but sport rainbow cloaks that enable them to fly through time, leaving a rainbow streak behind.",
      "Though 10-year-old Arco (voiced by Juliano Krue Valdi in the English dub) has been told he can\u2019t fly until he\u2019s older, he sneaks off with his sister\u2019s cape and, hoping for a glimpse of the dinosaurs, accidentally crash lands in 2075.",
      "\u201cArco\u201d is the unusual movie to exist in two future times, never our present. And it can take a moment to acclimate to both its jumbled timeline and the sheer amount of rainbows. But Bienvenu, a French comic-book artist making his directorial debut, richly imagines a 2075 future of recognizable extremes.",
      "Storms have become so violent that homes now have protective bubbles around them. Adults work such long hours in a distant city that they are usually mere holograms to their kids \u2014 an image that will send shudders down the spine of any parent who Zooms from a work trip. For Iris (voiced by Romy Fay) and her baby brother, the family robot does most of the parenting. In fact, robots do most things: teaching, construction, medical aid.",

At the same time, three bumbling, oddly dressed fellows, dressed in primary colors and wearing rainbow glasses, come looking for him. This trio \u2014 voiced in the English dub by Will Ferrell, Andy Samberg and Flea \u2014 are a goofy and very French addition to the movie. Ferrell and company are a marked improvement from the original.",
      "But there\u2019s no harm in giving \u201cArco\u201d some Saturday-morning-cartoon slapstick to go with the apocalyptic doom. Those three, believing they\u2019re hot on a time-travel trail, stay in pursuit while Arco and Iris develop a friendship and learn about each\u2019s eras.",
      "Parents remain largely absent. In \u201cArco,\u201d kids are left to fend for themselves in a world of technology and ecological disaster. (In one of the movie\u2019s most damning moments, the kids find refuge in a library because no one goes in there anymore.) But while there\u2019s no shortage of films that comment on our overly digital lives, technology is far from a villain in \u201cArco.\u201d It is closer to the savior.",
      "So while Bienvenu\u2019s film bears similarities to movies before it \u2014 Arco is far from the first future boy to fall from the sky \u2014 it's the first that I recall that so directly confronts ecological apocalypse and yet still finds a thrillingly optimistic note to end on. Thrilling because it puts the future in the hands of the young. \u201cArco\u201d dares to imagine, for them, a rainbow after the storm.",
      "\u201cArco,\u201d a Neon release in theaters Friday, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for action/peril, mild thematic elements and a brief injury image. Running time: 89 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.",

      "What can viewers expect from the 2026 Grammys",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The 68th annual Grammy Awards are Sunday, airing live from Los Angeles\u2019 Crypto.com Arena on CBS and Paramount+. What can viewers expect?",
      "According to the Recording Academy: some new, some old and a lot of excitement. Executive producers Raj Kapoor, Ben Winston and Jesse Collins are returning for a different show from last year, when the event was completely transformed to help those affected by the devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires.",
      "Here are four big questions \u2014 and answers \u2014 ahead of the event.",
      "A lot! A best album cover category is back for the first time in 53 years. Best country album has been renamed to best contemporary country album and a best traditional country album category has been added.",
      "\u201cIn this case, we got a proposal that wanted an additional country category. It made its way through the proposal process \u2014 again, voted on by members, evaluated by members, submitted by members but ultimately voted on my members \u2014 and we deploy what the members ask for,\u201d Recording Academy CEO and President Harvey Mason jr. tells The Associated Press.",
      "When the change was announced, some viewed it as backlash to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2025 win for best country album. \u201cIt's not accurate,\u201d says Mason jr. \u201cIt's something we've been talking about for a number of years.\u201d",
      "Also, in the last few years, the Grammy Awards have made a concerted effort to diversify its electorate. Last year, all Latin Grammy voting members were invited to join the Recording Academy.",
      "\u201cThe idea was to make sure that the academy and the Grammys are representative of what\u2019s going on in music,\u201d says Mason jr. \u201cMaking sure that our membership was diverse around genre and geography and everything was really important to us. We acknowledged that Latin music is huge and it\u2019s omnipresent in the industry at this point.\u201d",
      "Surprises and variety, says Mason jr. \u201cThe new up-and-coming group is so incredible. The legends and the icons are so, so special to have around. And then the superstars, having some of them on our stage, and that mixture, I think, makes for a really fun show.\u201d",
      "Winston is a bit more specific: \u201c18 or 19\" performances, he counts, \u201cIn 3 \u00bd hours. Yeah, so it\u2019s packed. \u2026 We keep it tight and sharp and we put less other stuff in the show this year so we can have a bit more music.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe definitely try to maximize the music performances on the show,\u201d adds Kapoor. \u201cIt's something that we challenge our team with every year.\u201d",
      "And on an abridged timeline. Rehearsals start Thursday for Sunday's live event. It's \u201cThursday afternoon, all day Friday, all day Saturday, and that\u2019s it,\u201d Kapoor continues. \u201cEverything that you see, those 19 performances, all happen between Thursday afternoon and Saturday evening. And it\u2019s kind of one of the most amazing processes you\u2019ve ever seen, and it\u2019s absolutely insane how much work we get done, and how cooperative the artists are.\u201d",
      "The artists confirmed to perform so far are Clipse, Pharrell Williams, Sabrina Carpenter and all of the best new artist nominees: Katseye, Olivia Dean, Leon Thomas, Addison Rae, Sombr, Lola Young, The Mar\u00edas and Alex Warren.",
      "So many people. Kendrick Lamar leads nominations with nine, including an album of the year nod. If he wins for \u201cGNX\u201d \u2014 or if Tyler, the Creator's \u201cChromakopia\u201d or Clipse's \u201cLet Got Sort Em Out\u201d wins \u2014 it will be only the third time a rap album has taken home the top prize, following Outkast in 2004 for \u201cSpeakerboxxx/The Love Below\u201d and Lauryn Hill in 1999 for \u201cThe Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.\u201d",
      "If Bad Bunny\u2019s \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d wins album of the year, it will be the first all-Spanish-language album to do so. It is only the second time an all-Spanish-language album has been nominated for the top prize. The first was also a Bad Bunny release \u2014 in 2023, for \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti.\u201d Harry Styles\u2019 \u201cHarry\u2019s House\u201d won that year.",
      "No K-pop artist has ever won a Grammy, but that may change. Ros\u00e9 and Bruno Mars\u2019 \u201cAPT.\u201d and the \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d track \u201cGolden\u201d are both nominated for song of the year, a first for any K-pop act. \u201cAPT.\u201d is also up for record of the year, also a K-pop artist first.",

      "Jason Statham stars in \u201cShelter,\u201d living in a Scottish lighthouse as a grim-faced hero laying low",
      "Jason Statham lives in a Scottish lighthouse when we meet him in \u201cShelter\u201d and that's a pretty good analogy for Statham's usual movie role these days: Tall, cold, alone, tough, quiet and only intermittently illuminating.",
      "Statham may appear to be just a grim-faced lighthouse keeper, but he's really a hero laying low, like he was when he was cosplaying a construction laborer in \u201cWorking Man \u201d and a honey collector in \u201cThe Beekeeper.\u201d Statham is Hollywood's go-to guy for sidelined-waiting-to-pounce-again action stars. Gruff, with a heart of gold and a strong moral compass, he's our lighthouse: Protecting us from danger and guiding us to safety while being very, very distant and very beard-forward.",
      "This time, you'll notice that the lighthouse isn't actually working, so Statham is just a dude off the grid. He has a lovely dog, so we know he's cool. He draws and plays chess, so we know he's smart and arty, too. But there's no internet, no Netflix. Just a lot of staring at the horizon in a big coat.",
      "When a young woman who has been delivering his lighthouse with supplies \u2014 maybe more whiskey than Cheerios \u2014 suddenly needs his help, he's thrust back into the modern world. And it gets worse: A whole lot of folk want him dead. The hunt is on.",
      "Turns out, Statham's character is a lethal former MI6 operative and he's part of a covert, extra-judicial conspiracy that goes straight up to the British prime minister. Has he been hiding out for a decade on a Scottish rock because he did something bad? Or good? (Remember, he has a sweet dog.)",
      "Bodhi Rae Breathnach, looking not unlike a young Saoirse Ronan, plays the young girl and she's marvelous, a talent to watch. Bill Nighy plays a venal spycraft master who also is surprisingly good at computer coding. For his part, Statham is classic Statham, never getting out of first gear. His dog emotes more.",

      "Blending the grit of \u201cMad Max\u201d with the underground rave culture of the 1990s, the film is set against the backdrop of a hypothetical World War III. It follows nomadic youths with hippie-punk aesthetics who carry their passion for electronic music into North Africa \u2014 a journey that becomes existential amid the desert dust.",
      "\u201cDrums of war, rumors of borders closing or armies moving,\u201d the film\u2019s star, Sergi L\u00f3pez, said in a video interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe feel that we are not doing science fiction; we are talking about how you move forward with the pain that you have to live in this world.\u201d",
      "Although it is set in that future, Oliver Laxe's \u201cSir\u0101t\u201d carries irremediable echoes of the present. Luis is a searching father, an unfortunately familiar figure in Mexico, where parents must often hunt for their missing children alone, without the help of the authorities and under the threat of pervasive violence.",
      "\u201cDisappearance is worse than death. It\u2019s an eternal death,\u201d said L\u00f3pez. \u201cSearching without finding is surely the hardest thing.\u201d",
      "Since its premiere at the 78th edition of the Cannes Film Festival, \u201cSir\u0101t\u201d has caused a stir, taking the Jury Prize, the Best Original Score Award and the Palm Dog Jury Prize, for its dogs Lupita and Pipa.",

      "LONDON -- If you haven\u2019t heard of gay ice hockey TV drama \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d and its two lead stars Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie yet ... then get your skates on.",
      "What started as a word-of-mouth hit in the U.S. and Canada in December 2025 has spread to become a global phenomenon. Its stars have rocketed from unknowns to cultural icons in the space of weeks, appearing on stage at the Golden Globes, sashaying down the Milan catwalks to, this week, carrying the torch for the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics.",
      "Based on the 2019 novel by Rachel Reid, the story traces the decade-long secret relationship between Canadian Shane Hollander (Williams) and Russian Ilya Rozanov (Storrie), mixing slow-building yearning with explicit sexual scenes.",
      "And as it launches across Europe, it\u2019s proving a surprise hit in Russia, even though homosexuality is illegal there and the show will never get an official release.",
      "Journalist and author Mikhail Zygar was born in what was then the Soviet Union, like Rozanov, and spent his childhood as a closeted gay man in Russia. He said coming out was completely impossible and he thinks the show is inspiring, not just amongst the LGBTQ+ community, but all Russians, as \u201can attempt to normalize the discourse.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt shows that it is OK. That people can fall in love and it\u2019s so beautiful. And the popularity of this TV show definitely may change some perception from the broader audience,\u201d he said.",
      "Western sanctions on official streaming platforms mean it\u2019s hard for Russians to watch Western TV, but they find ways on illegal platforms and, despite the anti-gay laws that would potentially mean punishment for those who share the content, they are voting with their keyboards.",
      "On the Russian streaming and film database platform Kinopoisk (similar to IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes in the U.S.) \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d has an 8.6 rating, the highest TV show ranking of all time according to Russian viewers, overtaking shows like \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d",
      "But official acceptance of shows like \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d seems a long way off.",
      "The LGBTQ+ community in Russia has been under legal and public pressure for over a decade, but especially since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin has argued that the war is a proxy battle with the West, which he says aims to destroy Russia and its \u201ctraditional family values\u201d by pushing for LGBTQ+ rights.",
      "Any depiction of gay and transgender people that paints them in a positive or even neutral light is banned. Gender-affirming medical care and changing one\u2019s gender in official documents are prohibited. With the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in November 202, that outlawed what the government called \u201cthe international LGBT movement\u201d as extremist, anyone involved with the LGBTQ+ community could be imprisoned for up to six years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to believe in some kind of happy ending, as we see in the show, in Russia\u2019s reality today,\u201d Zygar says.",

      "The head of the Sorok Sorokov center in Moscow, a conservative organization aligned with the Russian Orthodox Church, told The Associated Press that he was shocked by the gay sexual content of the show.",
      "\u201cI found out that these scenes are presented almost in every episode and I was horrified why and how this video ended up on our Russian (streaming) platforms,\u201d Georgy Soldatov said.",
      "He said he had lodged a petition with the Prosecutor\u2019s General Office against those who posted the content, which he described as \u201cthe propaganda of untraditional sexual relationship,\u201d a classification that forces print, TV and movie censorship of LGBTQ+ storylines.",
      "In one example, two Russian streaming services cut a transgender character from the 1990s drama series \u201cTwin Peaks.\u201d In another, a streaming service cut several scenes from the drama series \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d that depicted to a gay character. Instances of dialogue that has been redubbed to remove references to LGBTQ+ relations or people have been regularly reported by the Russian media.",
      "Last year, Russian authorities launched a criminal probe against the managers of a Moscow publishing house on extremism charges over books depicting LGBTQ+ relations. They raided the homes of a number of staff and detained them. Most of detainees were released, but three people were put under house arrest in a case that reportedly sent shockwaves throughout the book industry.",
      "In contrast, in the U.S., LGBTQ+ romance sales have surged.

He remembered walking into a restaurant and seeing a picture of a man in a boxing stance and asked why they had a poster of Muhammad Ali on the wall. They didn\u2019t, he was told: It was Mandela.",
      "It was just part of what would be an enlightening journey in making the new documentary, \u201cTroublemaker,\u201d which has its world premiere Tuesday at the Sundance Film Festival.",
      "\u201cHe evolved into the Mandela that we all know and love,\u201d Fuqua said. \u201cThe troublemaker allows you to sort of see him not just a mythical character or as a global icon, but as a fallible human being, someone who became a great leader, who in the beginning was a rebel, if you will, and who was willing to engage in violence at some point, if necessary, for the greater good.\u201d",
      "The film uses Mandela\u2019s own voice, drawn from over 70 hours of recordings to tell the story of the struggle against apartheid. Fuqua collaborated closely with Mac Maharaj, an anti-apartheid activist, who was imprisoned on Robben Island with Mandela and who played a key part in smuggling Mandela\u2019s writings, which would become \u201cLong Walk to Freedom,\u201d out of the prison",
      "Fuqua, Maharaj and the filmmaking team traveled all around South Africa, visiting important locations in Mandela\u2019s story, from the University of Fort Hare, where Mandela was a student before being expelled for protest activities, and Robben Island, where he was imprisoned from 1964 to 1982, to Qunu, his final resting place.",
      "He even slept a few nights on Robben Island, which he said was \u201cvery uncomfortable.\u201d While there they got a feeling for where Mandela spent 18 of his 27 imprisoned years and bonded at night over dinners. That\u2019s where Maharaj told him Mandela was a Tracy Chapman fan.",
      "They met many people along the way, including some who were part of the resistance against apartheid, taking to heart their continued optimism and hope despite past and present grievances and racism.",
      "\u201cOne gentleman came in and he had no arm, his eye was missing. He looked like a character out of James Bond. He had a Tommy Bahama shirt on, he had the hat on,\u201d Fuqua said. \u201cAnd he was so full of life and so funny and so matter of fact about what happened to him, fighting for justice. I started to learn so much more about the people there.\u201d",

      "ESPN said Mason died Sunday in Naples, Florida. He died of natural causes, according to his family.",

He preferred leading and mentoring teams, connecting people to projects, and was devoted to people and recovery of all sorts. He was a great teacher and mentor to everyone who came in his orbit,\u201d former ESPN President Steve Bornstein said.",
      "Over the course of his career, Mason worked on eight Olympics. As a young producer on Sept. 5, 1972, he was in the control room in Munich, Germany, when the Palestinian militant group Black September stormed the Olympic village and took Israeli Olympic team members hostage.",

The international broadcast center in Munich was 100 yards away from where the hostage crisis was taking place in the Olympic village.",
      "The movie recreates the moment when West German police stormed the control room and pointed guns at Mason\u2019s face. This happened because one of ABC\u2019s cameras was showing a tactical squad taking position on the roof above the hostages. Mason ended up cutting off the camera\u2019s feed.",

      "\u201cI won\u2019t lie, there are definitely some crossovers,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t made the choices that Charli in the film makes, but I\u2019ve definitely, like, come close to it. \u2026 It was a very accurate depiction of what I\u2019ve experienced in the music industry.\u201d",
      "One of the buzziest titles in a starry program, the A24 film will be in theaters faster than most: It opens in New York and Los Angeles on Jan. 30 and expands wide on Feb. 6.",

She\u2019s also not sleeping and getting increasingly frazzled about everything.",
      "Zamiri, who directed her \u201c360\u201d music video and has become one of her best friends, was excited by the challenge and to direct his first feature film. He also understood intrinsically what she was going through.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s this battle of expectations and of people wanting one thing from you and you feeling this pressure too, to stick with it, to keep providing that one thing for fear that maybe that attention, that excitement about you will falter if the next thing they don\u2019t love,\u201d Zamiri said. \u201cI love the process of making stuff. But part of it, which is often really exciting but also weird, is the sharing with the world because then it\u2019s just no longer yours anymore \u2026 it becomes its own thing which I think we saw happen in real-time with Brat.\u201d",
      "As with the \u201cBrat\u201d album and everything she does, Charli xcx has been intimately involved in the marketing and promotion of the movie too.",

      "Hollywood had its quietest weekend of the year at the box office.",
      "NEW YORK -- With a winter storm blanketing a large swath of the country, Hollywood had its quietest weekend of the year at the box office. The Amazon MGM sci-fi thriller \u201cMercy\u201d dethroned \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d from the No. 1 spot with $11.2 million in North America, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Some 250 theaters were forced to close, from Texas to Maine, according to data firm Comsore. More than 140 million Americans were under winter storm warnings, depressing moviegoing.",
      "But the weekend was never going to be a blockbuster one, anyway. \u201cMercy,\u201d a $60 million thriller starring Chris Pratt as a man in a near-future standing trial before an AI judge, was the top new release. It arrived with withering reviews (20% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and an equally poor reception (a \u201cB-\u201d CinemaScore) from audiences.",
      "That was still enough to finally dislodge James Cameron's third Pandora epic from its monthlong perch atop the box office. \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d slid to second place with $7 million. While The Walt Disney Co. release is starting to peter out domestically, it remains a top draw overseas. It took in $28.1 million internationally in its sixth weekend.",
      "\u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d isn't going to come close to the box-office heights of the previous two \u201cAvatar\u201d movies. The 2009 original grossed $2.9 billion and the 2022 sequel, \u201cThe Way of Water,\u201d tapped out at $2.3 billion. \u201cFire and Ash\u201d has now cleared $1 billion internationally, but its domestic haul ($378.5 million) is well off the pace of the other two films.",
      "The \u201cOscar bump\u201d that films once saw following nomination is largely a thing of the past. The lead movies in Thursday's nominations \u2014 \u201cSinners\u201d and \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d \u2014 long ago completed their theatrical runs. But a handful of nominees saw strong business.",
      "Chlo\u00e9 Zhao's \u201cHamnet,\u201d nominated for eight Oscars including best picture, collected $2 million in its first weekend of wide release. The Shakespeare drama, starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, has been in theaters for two months, steadily increasing its theatrical footprint. It's up to $17.6 million domestically and $42.1 million worldwide.",
      "Josh Safdie's \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d nominated for nine Oscars, earned $3.5 million in its sixth weekend of release. The A24 title, starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, this week cross $100 million globally. It's made $86.2 million domestically thus far.",
      "But newer releases struggled. \u201cReturn to Silent Hill,\u201d the third installment in a horror series kick-started with 2006's \u201cSilent Hill,\u201d opened with $3.2 million. Though Sony released the 2006 film and Open Road distributed the 2012 follow up, the low-budget \u201cReturn to Silent Hill\u201d was put out by Iconic Events.",
      "In its second week of release, \u201c28 Years Later: The Bone Temple\u201d dropped swiftly. The Sony release, directed by Nia DaCosta, opened last week to a disappointing $13.3 million in sales despite good reviews. But its second weekend was even worse, dropping 71% with $3.6 million.",
      "Other new releases flopped. Roadside Attractions' \u201cH Is For Hawk,\u201d starring Claire Foy, took in just $150,000 from 472 theaters. Sony's \u201cClika,\u201d about a migrant worker with music aspirations, managed only $1.2 million in 522 locations.",

      "Honnold, known for his ropeless ascent up Yosemite National Park\u2019s El Capitan, climbed up one corner of Taipei 101 using small L-shaped outcroppings as footholds. Periodically, he had to maneuver around and clamber up the sides of large ornamental structures that jut out from the tower, pulling himself up with his bare hands.",
      "The building has 101 floors, with the hardest part being the 64 floors of the middle section \u2014 the \u201cbamboo boxes\u201d that give the building its signature look. Divided into eight, each segment has eight floors of steep, overhanging climbing followed by balconies, where he took short rests as he made his way upward.",

      "The recall includes 5.5-ounce packages of the biscuits, often given to teething babies, with best-by dates between Oct. 16 and Dec. 16, 2026. The plastic and paper pieces came from a supplier of arrowroot flour, who initiated the recall.",

      "The government has proposed new rules for the nation's transplant system that aim to increase use of certain donated organs and set additional safety standards for donor groups",
      "WASHINGTON -- The government proposed new rules for the nation\u2019s transplant system Wednesday that aim to increase use of less-than-perfect organs and set additional safety standards for donor groups.",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said the proposal would strengthen its oversight of organ procurement organizations or OPOs, groups that retrieve organs from deceased donors.",
      "More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, the vast majority seeking a kidney, and thousands will die waiting for a new organ. Wednesday\u2019s move is part of an ongoing overhaul of the complex transplant system that began during the first Trump administration.",
      "But it comes after donations from the deceased dropped last year for the first time in over a decade, sparking concern about mistrust in the system. While organ transplants have been rising \u2013- just over 49,000 last year compared with 48,150 in 2024 \u2013- that year-over-year increase also slowed.",
      "\u201cEvery missed opportunity for organ donation is a life lost,\u201d CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "He said the proposed rule, expected to be finalized later in the year, \u201cstrengthens accountability, clarifies expectations and gives us stronger tools to remove underperforming organizations, protect patients and honor the incredible gift of life.\u201d",
      "In a step toward more potentially usable organs, the proposal urges maximizing the use of \u201cmedically complex organs,\u201d typically those from older or sicker donors. CMS would add new requirements for how OPOs track the retrieval and usage of those less-than-perfect organs, which the agency said may need \u201cspecial or additional considerations\" in finding an appropriate recipient.",
      "Many OPOs already have increased retrievals of those less-than-perfect organs, especially kidneys. For example, a less-than-perfect donated kidney might not be good enough to last the lifetime of a young recipient but it could give an older, sicker patient, who might not get another offer, some time off dialysis. Yet for a variety of reasons, many transplant centers don\u2019t accept medically complex donated organs even when medical criteria suggest they\u2019d be a good match for a patient.",
      "Jeff Trageser, president of the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, said Wednesday that he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d a clearer definition of these donors and organs would help encourage their use both by OPOs and by hospitals.",

      "CMS officials didn\u2019t respond when asked if similar requirements were planned for transplant centers or donor hospitals.",
      "Among other steps in the proposed rule are new definitions of what constitute \u201cunsound medical practices\u201d for organ-handling and patient safety, criteria that CMS uses in regulating and certifying organ groups.",

      "Getting outdoors to enjoy simple pleasures is unlikely to be front of mind for people in a 1,300-mile stretch of the United States where a massive weekend storm brought deep snow and bitter cold",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- Take two snowballs and call me in the morning?",
      "Dr. Sarah Crockett, who specializes in emergency and wilderness medicine, doesn\u2019t explicitly tell her patients at New Hampshire\u2019s Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center to swallow snow, but she often prescribes more time outside. If that time includes eating a handful of ice crystals straight or adding ingredients to make snow cones and other frozen treats, she\u2019s all for it.",
      "\u201cTo stop and just be present and want to catch a snowflake on your tongue, or scoop up some fresh, white, untouched snow that\u2019s collected during something as exciting as a snowstorm, I think that there\u2019s space in our world to enjoy that,\u201d Crockett said. \u201cAnd while we need to make good choices, I think these are simple things that can bring joy.\u201d",
      "Getting outdoors to enjoy simple pleasures is unlikely to be front of mind for people in a 1,300-mile (2,100-kilometer) stretch of the United States where a massive weekend storm brought deep snow and bitter cold. Freezing rain and ice brought down power lines and tree limbs, leaving hundreds of thousands of homes without power or heating in the South, while snow upended road and air travel from Arkansas to New England.",
      "As the storm recedes, residents of lesser-affected areas might be tempted to whip up bowls of \u201csnow cream\u201d \u2014 snow combined with milk, sugar and vanilla \u2014 after seeing techniques demonstrated on TikTok. Others might want to try \u201csugar on snow,\u201d a taffy-like confection made by pouring hot maple syrup onto a plate of snow.",
      "Despite its pristine appearance, snow isn\u2019t always clean enough to consume. Crockett and other experts shared advice for digging in safely while digging out.",
      "Whether it's rain or snow, precipitation cleans the atmosphere, picking up pollutants as it falls, said Steven Fassnacht, a professor of snow hydrology at Colorado State University. But snowflakes pick up more impurities because they fall more slowly and have more exposed surface areas than raindrops, he said.",
      "That means snow that falls near coal plants or factories that emit particulates into the air contains more contaminants, said Fassnacht, who was in Shinjo, Japan, last week studying the salt content of snow. He said he wouldn\u2019t have hesitated to take a taste there because there weren\u2019t any big industrial complexes upwind.",
      "\u201cSnow can be eaten, but you want to think about the trajectory. Where did that snow come from?\u201d he said.",
      "Timing is another consideration, according to Crockett. The first wave of snow holds the most particulate matter, she said, so waiting until a storm is well underway before putting out a bowl to collect falling snow is one precaution to take.",
      "Ground contamination is an additional factor, experts say. Avoiding yellow snow, which may be tainted by urine or tree bark, is conventional wisdom, but it\u2019s also a good idea to stay away from any snow pushed by snowplows and packed with road salt, deicing chemicals and debris.",
      "What about eating snow to survive? Crockett, who oversees the wilderness medicine program at Dartmouth College\u2019s Geisel School of Medicine, says that\u2019s a bad idea.",

While outdoor enthusiasts who plan to spend days in the mountains often melt and boil snow to purify it for drinking, it shouldn\u2019t be viewed as an immediate hydration source, she said.",

      "The virus has an estimated fatality rate of between 40% and 75%, according to the WHO, making it far more deadly than the coronavirus.",
      "There were no reported cases of the virus outside India, but several Asian countries introduced or reinforced screening measures at airports as a precaution.",

      "In the chilly Atlantic, 63-year-old Aminata Sall is soon kicking in rhythm with others, foam noodles tucked under her arms. On the beach, people with limited mobility are buried knee-deep in the sand and gently rotate their torsos in a therapy session meant to ease pain.",

But prevention, diagnosis and rehabilitation services have not kept pace on a largely youthful continent whose public health systems prioritize infectious diseases, maternal care and children.",

      "The aquagym emerged little over a decade ago as a rare, low-cost option to relieve pain and improve mobility.",
      "After Sall was diagnosed with her autoimmune condition, she said her doctor told her she would need surgery at a cost of about $10,000, which she could not afford. She was prescribed an anti-inflammatory drug, but it was later taken off the market due to complications.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when I started losing hope,\u201d she said. \u201cSome mornings, a blocked vertebra or swollen ankles would leave me unable to move all day.\u201d",

      "Officials warn that shoveling snow after this weekend's massive storm could be hazardous to your heart",
      "Digging out from the weekend\u2019s massive snow and ice storm could be hazardous to your heart.",
      "Pennsylvania health officials announced three snow-removal related deaths Sunday. All were between the ages of 60 to 84. The Lehigh County coroner's office cautioned people to take breaks and avoid over-exerting themselves.",
      "Shoveling snow is heavy, hard work \u2014 research has shown that doing it for even a short time can make the heart work as hard as it does during a major workout. Adding to that stress, the cold temperatures cause blood vessels, including those feeding the heart, to constrict. That raises blood pressure which in turn increases the risk of a heart attack, stroke or cardiac arrest, according to the American Heart Association.",
      "Snow shoveling is especially risky for anyone with known heart disease or who\u2019s already survived a heart attack, as well as older adults and people with risk factors including high blood pressure or cholesterol. People who think they\u2019re healthy can get in trouble, too, with that combination of heavy exertion in cold weather \u2013 especially if they\u2019re generally sedentary until a snowstorm comes along.",

      "For a young girl, losing the soccer final 5-0 meant little compared to the goals of a tournament held in Zimbabwe to promote trust in cervical cancer vaccination",
      "NORTON, Zimbabwe -- Lesotho\u2019s Lishoeshoe soccer club was losing by four goals at halftime against South Africa\u2019s Mamelodi Sundowns in the final of a regional Under-17 girls\u2019 tournament in Zimbabwe aimed at promoting cervical cancer vaccination. By fulltime, the gap had stretched to 5-0.",
      "Yet for Lishoeshoe winger Nteboheleng Leticia Sooane, the result felt beside the point.",
      "For the 16-year-old, the tournament\u2019s most important outcome had little to do with goalmouth scrambles or final-whistle disappointment. Instead, it was about building confidence among girls to trust the HPV vaccine and prevent a disease that kills a woman every two minutes globally \u2014 with the burden most acute in Africa, according to GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, one of the tournament\u2019s organizers.",
      "\u201cParticipating in the tournament was very good because we had to learn and spread (the message) even though we did not win the finals. So it was a good experience,\u201d Sooane said as she waited to collect her finalist\u2019s medal in a rain-soaked stadium in Norton, on the outskirts of Zimbabwe\u2019s capital, Harare.",
      "Sooane was among about 200 girls from six countries taking part in the CAF Under-17 girls\u2019 tournament in December, organized by Africa\u2019s soccer governing body CAF together with the European soccer body, GAVI and health ministries from several African countries.",
      "Dubbed the Goal Getters campaign, the initiative was first showcased in Tanzania and Eswatini earlier last year before moving to Zimbabwe in December, using soccer to build awareness and trust in the HPV vaccine.",
      "Offered for free, the HPV vaccine being administered to girls aged between 9 and 14 years can prevent up to 90% of cervical cancer cases, saving families thousands of dollars in treatment costs later in life if girls are not vaccinated, according to GAVI.",
      "After setbacks caused by COVID-19 lockdowns and uneven national immunization programs, Africa has intensified HPV vaccination drives in recent years. Coverage for at least one dose of the HPV vaccine rose to 40% in 2023 from 28% the previous year, behind only behind North, Central and South America, driven by expanded campaigns backed by governments and GAVI, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "The girls\u2019 soccer tournament is a key part of that effort, said GAVI spokesman Olly Cann.",
      "\u201cOne of the great aspects of the Goal Getters campaign is that it enables us to blend two things that teenage girls are passionate about, one is sport and the other is health,\u201d said Cann. \u201cIt creates a really safe space where the girls can feel trusted, they can feel secure, they also feel empowered.\u201d",
      "The campaign\u2019s launch mixed dance and song before the eight-team tournament kicked off. On the sidelines, mothers streamed to a nearby clinic, some drawn by the chance to see well-known women\u2019s soccer figures, while also getting their children vaccinated against HPV.",
      "HPV, or human papillomavirus, is a common sexually transmitted virus and the primary cause of cervical cancer. While most infections clear naturally, some persist and can lead to cancer years later.",
      "Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide, killing about 350,000 women each year, according to the WHO. Africa accounts for nearly a quarter of global deaths, and 19 of the 20 most affected countries are in sub-Saharan Africa, Cann said.",

      "The 6-foot-7 inch Foege literally stood out in the field of public health. A whip-smart medical doctor with a calm demeanor, he had a canny knack for beating back infectious diseases.",
      "He was director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and later held other key leadership roles in campaigns against international health problems.",
      "But his greatest achievement came before all that, with his work on smallpox, one of the most lethal diseases in human history. For centuries, it killed about one-third of the people it infected and left most survivors with deep scars on their faces from the pus-filled lesions.",
      "Smallpox vaccination campaigns were well established by the time Foege was a young doctor. Indeed, it was no longer seen in the United States. But infections were still occurring elsewhere, and efforts to stamp them out were stalling.",
      "Working as a medical missionary in Nigeria in the 1960s, Foege and his colleagues developed a \"ring containment\" strategy, in which a smallpox outbreak was contained by identifying each smallpox case and vaccinating everyone who the patients might come into contact with.",
      "The method relied heavily on quick detective work and was born out of necessity. There simply wasn't enough vaccine available to immunize everyone, Foege wrote in \"House on Fire,\" his 2011 book about the smallpox eradication effort.",
      "It worked, and became pivotal in helping rid the world of smallpox for good. The last naturally occurring case was seen in Somalia in 1977. In 1980, the World Health Organization declared smallpox eradicated from the Earth.",
      "\"If you look at the simple metric of who has saved the most lives, he is right up there with the pantheon. Smallpox eradication has prevented hundreds of millions of deaths,\" said former CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden, who consulted with Foege regularly.",
      "Foege was born March 12, 1936. His father was a Lutheran minister, but he became interested in medicine at 13 while working at a drugstore in Colville, Washington.",

      "Now Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the crossing will reopen soon, as the U.S.-brokered Israel-Hamas ceasefire plan moves into its second phase.",

      "But they face tight controls. Under conditions Netanyahu stipulates, only dozens of Palestinians will be allowed through the crossing each day, and no goods will cross for now. All other Gaza border crossings are with Israel.",

      "That means a long wait for many of the estimated 20,000 sick and wounded that the territory\u2019s health ministry says need treatment outside Gaza. At a rate of 50 evacuations a day, it would take more than a year for everyone to leave.",
      "In the past, those prioritized for evacuation have been mostly children, cancer patients and people suffering from physical trauma. Most received treatment in Egypt.",
      "Medical evacuees typically exit Gaza with escorts. The person familiar with the discussions said two escorts likely would be allowed for each evacuee.",

      "There will be no Israeli soldiers at the crossing, the official said, but Palestinians exiting and entering would undergo Israeli security screening inside Gaza. In the past, such screenings have been conducted by Israeli soldiers and private U.S. contractors.",
      "\u201cAnyone entering or exiting undergoes our inspection, a full inspection,\" Netanyahu said Tuesday.",

Plainclothes officers with the Palestinian Authority will stamp passports, as they did during a brief ceasefire at the start of 2025 and before Hamas wrested control of Gaza in 2007, Palestinian officials told the AP.",
      "Netanyahu seemed to acknowledge that members of Palestinian factions that historically have governed Gaza may play a role, noting that the majority of bureaucrats have a history of working for Hamas or the Palestinian Authority.",
      "Even before the war, Palestinians faced heavy restrictions.",
      "In 2022, the United Nations recorded more than 133,000 entries and 144,000 exits through Rafah, though many involved the same people crossing multiple times. Egyptian authorities allowed imports on 150 days of the year, and more than 32,000 trucks of goods entered.",
      "Restrictions have tracked the region\u2019s politics. Egypt, alongside Israel, imposed a blockade after Hamas seized power in Gaza in 2007. It reopened the crossing after Egypt\u2019s 2011 revolution but closed it in 2013 after the military ousted President Mohammed Morsi, a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist movement from which Hamas emerged.",
      "Egypt gradually allowed the Rafah crossing to reopen in the years that followed, but the on-and-off restrictions led to a massive tunnel economy that sprung up beneath it. Tunnels served as an economic lifeline for Gaza and a conduit for weapons and cash, according to Israeli and Egyptian officials. Hamas collected tens of millions of dollars a month in taxes and customs on goods passing through the crossing.",
      "It is not clear when trucks will be allowed to pass through the Rafah crossing, what Palestinians will be permitted to bring and for how long daily entries and exits will be capped at or below 200.",
      "That's a big uncertainty for humanitarian organizations seeking to further surge aid into devastated Gaza, where groups have long reported vast shortages of medical supplies, fuel and other essential needs.",
      "Netanyahu said his focus is on disarming Hamas, a challenging part of the ceasefire's second phase, and destroying its remaining tunnels. He said there would be no reconstruction in Gaza without demilitarization, a stance that could make Israel's control over the Rafah crossing a key point of leverage.",

Opposition to migration is the signature issue of AfD, with which mainstream parties refuse to work. But it also has shown a talent for capitalizing on discontent with other issues, such as the country's sluggish economy.",
      "In recent years, some sitting governors in the east \u2014 including Haseloff himself in the state's last election in 2021 \u2014 have managed to beat back challenges from AfD as relatively popular incumbents. Schulze, who was Saxony-Anhalt's economy minister until now, would have lacked that potential advantage if Haseloff had stayed in office.",
      "AfD so far has emerged as the biggest party in one state election, in the neighboring eastern region of Thuringia in 2024, but it has yet to take power at state level.",

      "Some of those forces are loyal to opposition leader Riek Machar, while others consider themselves part of an ethnic Nuer militia called the White Army. White Army fighters have historically fought alongside Machar but consider themselves a distinct group.",
      "Machar, an ethnic Nuer, was made the most senior of five vice presidents under a 2018 peace agreement that ended fighting between his forces and those loyal to President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, the country\u2019s largest group. That five-year civil war was waged largely along ethnic lines, killing an estimated 400,000 people.",

He now faces treason and other charges over that attack, which authorities allege Machar helped orchestrate. But Machar\u2019s allies and some international observers say the charges are politically motivated. He remains under house arrest while his trial unfolds slowly in the capital, Juba.",

      "Forces loyal to Machar have declared the agreement dead, and have since ratcheted up pressure on the army by seizing armories and launching hit-and-run attacks on government positions. The government has relied largely on aerial bombardments to beat back a rebellion that analysts say is gaining momentum across multiple states.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country will unveil plans to further bolster its nuclear program at the upcoming ruling party congress, as he observed the North's latest weapons launch, state media reported Wednesday.",
      "The Korean Central News Agency said North Korea performed a live-fire drill of an upgraded large-caliber multiple rocket launcher system in the presence of Kim on Tuesday, an apparent reference to what South Korea and Japan earlier described as ballistic missile launches from North Korea.",
      "State media photos show Kim walking near a huge launch truck with his teenage daughter in her latest public appearance with her father. South Korea's spy service said in early 2024 it considered the girl, reportedly named Kim Ju Ae, as her father's likely heir.",
      "KCNA quoted Kim Jong Un saying the test launch was meant to enhance the effectiveness of the country's \u201cstrategic deterrent,\u201d a term used to describe its nuclear weapons capability. KCNA said the launcher system's mobility and strike accuracy have been improved.",
      "Experts say North Korea\u2019s large-sized rocket launchers blur the boundaries between artillery systems and ballistic missiles because they can create their own thrust and are guided during delivery. North Korea has said some of these systems are capable of delivering nuclear warheads.",
      "Kim said that boosting the country's military capability is the invariable line of the ruling Workers' Party. He said the upcoming party congress, the first of its kind in five years, will be a venue to declare \u201cnext-stage plans for further bolstering up the country\u2019s nuclear war deterrent,\u201d KCNA said.",

      "A federal judge has refused to block a winter oil and gas exploration project in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska that opponents said was improperly analyzed by the federal government",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- ConocoPhillips Alaska can proceed with an oil and gas exploration program in a portion of a vast petroleum reserve in the state after a federal judge denied a request from project opponents to halt it.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason rejected a request by conservation groups and an I\u00f1upiat-aligned group that sought to halt ConocoPhillips Alaska's planned exploration program in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska until the groups\u2019 legal challenge to the program\u2019s authorization by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management was resolved.",
      "The groups said the federal government improperly analyzed the drilling program. The company, meanwhile, said the program was imperative to preserving its leases.",
      "Gleason said in her order dated Tuesday that the groups had not shown that they have a \u201cfair chance of success\u201d on the merits of their claims.",
      "The decision comes after a mobile drilling rig the company planned to use as part of its program toppled onto snow-covered tundra near existing oil and gas infrastructure while being transported last week. Attorneys for the company in a court filing said the incident would not deter ConocoPhillips Alaska\u2019s overall plans and that a substitute drill rig would be used.",
      "The petroleum reserve, which covers an area roughly the size of Indiana on Alaska's North Slope, has been a focal point of a more aggressive oil and gas development push in the state backed by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans. A law passed last year calls for at least five lease sales in the reserve over a 10-year period. The last lease sale was held in 2019.",
      "The Bureau of Land Management in late November approved a program proposed by ConocoPhillips Alaska that included seismic surveys aimed at helping identify oil and gas reserves and plans to drill four exploration wells. The lawsuit, brought by Sovereign I\u00f1upiat for a Living Arctic, the Center for Biological Diversity and The Wilderness Society, alleges the process around the company\u2019s application and its subsequent approval lacked transparency and was rushed.",
      "In December, the federal land management agency issued a revised approval that it said took into account recent changes, including the Trump administration\u2019s adoption of a plan that would reopen most of the reserve to leasing. The groups that sued said in a court filing that the revised approval did not address their concerns.",
      "The activities would occur near existing ConocoPhillips Alaska developments, including the large Willow oil project, approved by the Biden administration in 2023 and currently under development, the groups said.",

      "NEW YORK -- As layoffs pile up, workers are feeling increasingly anxious about the job market.",
      "In the U.S., economists have said that businesses are largely at a \u201cno-hire, no fire\u201d standstill, leading many to limit new work, if not pause openings entirely amid economic uncertainty. Hiring has stagnated overall \u2014 with the country adding a meager 50,000 jobs last month, down from a revised figure of 56,000 in November.",
      "But a growing list of companies are also cutting jobs. Employers have initiated layoffs across sectors \u2014 with many pointing to rising operational costs that span from President Donald Trump\u2019s barrage of new tariffs, stubborn inflation and shifts in spending from consumers, whose outlook on the U.S. economy recently plummeted to its lowest level since 2014. At the same time, some businesses are reducing their workforces as they redirect money to artificial intelligence, often baked into wider corporate restructuring.",
      "Here are a few of the largest job cuts announced recently.",
      "E-commerce giant Amazon slashed about 16,000 corporate roles on Wednesday \u2014 just three months after laying off another 14,000 workers. In its latest round of layoffs, Amazon cited restructuring aimed at \u201cremoving bureaucracy\" in its operations, but the cuts also arrive as the company continues to ramp up spending on AI. CEO Andy Jassy previously said that he anticipated generative AI to reduce Amazon's corporate workforce.",
      "On Tuesday, United Parcel Service said it plans to cut up to 30,000 operational jobs this year \u2014 notably as the package company continues to reduce the number of Amazon shipments it handles amid wider turnaround efforts. UPS said these cuts will be made through a voluntary buyout offer for full-time drivers and attrition. The reductions come on top of a combined 48,000 job cuts that the company disclosed in 2025.",
      "Late last year, Tyson Foods said it would be closing a plant that employed 3,200 people in Lexington, Nebraska \u2014 bringing job losses for nearly a third of the small town's population of 11,000. The layoffs began on Jan. 20, but the company notified state officials that it was temporarily retaining under 300 workers to help complete the closure. Tyson in November also announced plans to cut one of two shifts at an Amarillo, Texas plant, eliminating an additional 1,700 jobs.",
      "Also in November, HP said it expected to lay off between 4,000 and 6,000 employees. The cuts are part of a wider initiative from the computer maker to streamline operations, which includes adopting AI to increase productivity. The company aims to complete these actions by the end of the 2028 fiscal year.",

The HR-V is also easy to see out of, which helps you easily squeeze into gaps in traffic or snug parking spots. One drawback to the HR-V is slow acceleration \u2014 you\u2019ll notice it when you\u2019re quickly trying to get onto the highway \u2014 but it\u2019s countered by pretty good fuel economy. The HR-V is available with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive.",
      "Look for: The HR-V came out for the 2016 model year. Anything from that debut year up until about a 2022 HR-V will consistently be under $20,000. A 2022 HR-V EX, for example, comes with heated front seats, keyless entry, and the vehicle\u2019s full roster of advanced driver aids.",
      "One thing that immediately gets attention is the Kona\u2019s distinctive styling. You might not love the way it looks, but you will love the way the Kona drives. When equipped with its optional turbocharged engine, it gets up to speed quicker than most other vehicles in the class. It\u2019s also fun to drive around turns thanks to its sporty handling. On top of that, you get a lot of features for your money.",
      "\u200bLook for: The Kona first debuted for the 2018 model year and was redesigned in 2024. You should have little trouble finding a 2022 Kona for under $20,000. This is also a good year to focus on because it received worthwhile updates, including a larger center touchscreen. All-wheel drive is available on every trim level, and the more powerful turbocharged engine comes on the Limited or N Line trim level.",
      "The Soul is a boxy-looking vehicle that mixes elements of an SUV and a hatchback. It earns praise from Edmunds thanks to its value and practicality. Despite its tidy proportions, its upright shape provides ample passenger room and cargo capacity. Standard features are especially generous considering the Soul\u2019s price. The Soul is also pretty fun to drive, just like the Kona, and a strong turbocharged engine comes on the top Turbo trim level. You can\u2019t, however, get the Soul with all-wheel drive.",

      "A court has ordered the Dutch government to draw up a plan to protect residents of the Caribbean island of Bonaire from the devastating effects of climate change",
      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- A court on Wednesday ordered the Dutch government to draw up a plan to protect residents on the tiny Caribbean island of Bonaire from the devastating effects of climate change \u2014 a sweeping victory for the islanders.",
      "The Hague District Court, in a stunning rebuke of Dutch authorities, also ruled that the government discriminated against the island\u2019s 20,000 inhabitants by not taking \u201ctimely and appropriate measures\u201d to protect them from climate change before it's too late.",
      "\u201cThe island already suffers from flooding due to tropical storms and extreme rainfall, and according to several researchers, this will worsen in the coming years. Even conservative forecasts predict that parts of the island will be underwater by 2050, so in 25 years,\u201d Judge Jerzy Luiten told a packed courtroom.",
      "The case brought by eight Bonaire residents and backed by environmental group Greenpeace, sought to compel the government to better shield its citizens from the effects of increasing temperatures and rising sea levels and could set a precedent for similar legal challenges elsewhere.",
      "In a statement issued before the ruling, Greenpeace Netherlands director Marieke Vellekoop said that \u201cit would be a victory of historic significance, should the court ruling force the State to take concrete measures to protect people from extreme weather and other consequences of the climate crisis.\"",
      "The case was heard in The Hague because Bonaire, along with two other islands, St. Eustatius and Saba, became special Dutch municipalities in 2010. The island\u2019s 20,000 residents are Dutch citizens based on their colonial history.",
      "Lawyers for the government argued that the Netherlands already is making strides to combat climate change, citing greenhouse gas reductions and mitigation efforts. Government lawyer Edward Brans said the issue should be handled by national administrations and not judges.",

The court also said that the Netherlands was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d to meet its 2030 target.",
      "The ruling comes as weeks of talks to form a new Dutch government following a national election in late October look like producing a new minority coalition headed up by centrist D66 leader Rob Jetten. He earned the nickname \u201cclimate pusher\u201d when he was a minister responsible for shepherding through a raft of legislation intended to reduce the Netherlands' reliance on fossil fuels and significantly cut its carbon emissions.",
      "It's not the first time that The Hague District Court has issued a groundbreaking climate ruling. The same court heard the first stage of the landmark Urgenda case more than a decade ago. That case wrapped up in 2019 when the Dutch Supreme Court ruled in favor of climate activists and ordered the government to cut greenhouse gas emissions, a legal battle that paved the way for similar challenges around the world.",
      "The Urgenda decision featured prominently in recent climate change decisions from the European Court of Human Rights and the United Nations\u2019 highest court, the International Court of Justice. Both courts found that failing to combat climate change violated international law.",
      "In the decade up to 2023, sea levels rose by a global average of around 4.3 centimeters (1.7 inches), with parts of the Pacific rising higher still. The world has also warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times because of the burning of fossil fuels.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iranian officials reached out to the wider Middle East on Wednesday over the threat of a possible U.S. military strike on the country, a month since the start of protests in Iran that soon spread nationwide and sparked a bloody crackdown.",
      "Two nations, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have signaled they won't allow their airspace to be used for any attack. But America has moved the USS Abraham Lincoln and several guided missile destroyers into the region, which can be used to launch attacks from the sea.",
      "It remains unclear what U.S. President Donald Trump will decide about using force, though he laid down two red lines \u2014 the killing of peaceful demonstrators and the possible mass execution of detainees. The protests saw at least 6,221 people killed as Iran launched a bloody crackdown on the demonstrations, with many others feared dead, activists said Wednesday.",
      "Iran's state-run media, which now only refers to protesters as \u201cterrorists,\u201d remains the sole source of news for many as Tehran cut off access to the global internet some three weeks ago. But Iranians have become angry and anxious in the weeks since, seeing footage of protesters shot and killed while worrying about what may happen next as the country's economy sinks further.",
      "\u201cI feel that my generation failed to give a better lesson to younger ones,\" said Mohammad Heidari, a 59-year-old high school teacher in Tehran. \u201cThe result of decades of teaching by my colleagues and me led to death of thousands, and maybe more injured and prisoners.\u201d",
      "Egypt's Foreign Ministry said its top diplomat, Badr Abdelatty, separately spoke with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff to \u201cwork toward achieving calm, in order to avoid the region slipping into new cycles of instability.\u201d",
      "The statement offered no details, though Iranian state media quoted Araghchi as saying third-party mediators had been in touch. Witkoff, a billionaire real estate developer and Trump's friend, had earlier negotiated over Iran's nuclear program. There was no immediate acknowledgment from the White House of the call.",
      "Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman held a call with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, saying the kingdom would \u201cnot allow its airspace or territory to be used for any military actions against Iran or for any attacks from any party, regardless of their origin.\u201d That follows a similar pledge by the UAE. Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE host American air assets and troops.",
      "However, America's biggest base in the region is Qatar's vast Al Udeid Air Base, which serves as the forward operating headquarters of the U.S. military's Central Command. Both Araghchi and Ali Larijani, a top Iranian security official, reportedly held calls with Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. Qatar acknowledged the Araghchi call, but offered few details on what was discussed.",
      "Iran attacked Al Udeid in June in response to Trump sending American warplanes to bomb Iranian nuclear enrichment sites.",
      "\u201cOur position is exactly this: Applying diplomacy through military threats cannot be effective or constructive,\u201d Araghchi told journalists Wednesday outside of a Cabinet meeting. \u201cIf they want negotiations to take shape, they must abandon threats, excessive demands, and the raising of illogical issues. Negotiations have their own principles: they must be conducted on an equal footing, based on mutual respect, and for mutual benefit.\u201d",

More than 42,300 have been arrested, it added.",
      "The group verifies each death and arrest with a network of activists on the ground in Iran. The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll given that authorities cut off the internet and disrupted calls into the Islamic Republic.",
      "Iran\u2019s government has put the death toll at a far lower 3,117, saying 2,427 were civilians and security forces, and labeled the rest \u201cterrorists.\u201d In the past, Iran\u2019s theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from unrest.",

      "He is the first British leader to come to Beijing since Theresa May in 2018. The relationship has deteriorated in recent years over growing concern about Chinese spying and surveillance, China\u2019s support for Russia in the Ukraine war and Beijing\u2019s crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong, the former British colony.",

      "The European Union and India have reached a free trade agreement to deepen economic and strategic ties after nearly two decades of negotiations",
      "BRUSSELS -- The ambitious free trade agreement between the European Union and India underscores the EU's efforts to ink new global partnerships at a time when the Trump administration has rattled the region's capitals which have long relied on a stable relationship with Washington on trade, defense and diplomacy.",
      "The agreement announced Tuesday reflects a new priority for the 27-nation EU, the world's largest trading bloc, after President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs because of opposition to American control of Greenland, only to back off days later. It follows trade deals struck or pending over the past year with India, Japan, Indonesia, Mexico and the five Mercosur nations of South America.",
      "\u201cThe international order we relied upon for decades is no longer a given,\u201d said Nikos Christodoulides, president of Cyprus, in a speech last week at the European Parliament. He was outlining Cyprus' priorities as the island nation begins its six-month term at the helm of the EU.",

      "\u201cEurope and India need each other today like never before,\u201d said Garima Mohan, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund. She said that both Brussels and New Delhi had long sought closer ties as a counterweight to China's economic rise. But the abrasiveness of the Trump administration on economic and security issues cinched the deal.",
      "\u201cThis movement towards diversification, looking for new partners as well as building self-reliance was precipitated by the tensions with China and really driven home by the fracture of the trans-Atlantic partnership,\u201d Mohan said. The deal \u201conly came to pass at this particular geopolitical juncture, and that says something of the world we live in.\u201d",
      "The EU struck its first trade deal in July with Indonesia. Two weeks ago, von der Leyen signed a deal with the Mercosur nations of South America that was decades in the making to create a free trade market of more than 700 million people - and she\u2019s said she has the authority to implement it despite objections raised by European Parliament.",
      "The EU has also upgraded ties with Japan, South Korea and Australia, Pacific nations wary of Beijing's strategic ambitions and Washington's turbulent politics.",
      "\u201cThere is a hope that things will change given the importance of the U.S. for us ... but there is a realization now that we are a bit more alone in this world,\u201d said Ivano di Carlo, a senior policy analyst at the European Policy Centre.",
      "Russia's invasion of Ukraine drove the EU to create financial tools to boost the bloc's defense industry and infrastructure like trains, roads and ports \u2014 but the Trump administration's criticism of the continent's low levels of defense spending kicked those initiatives into overdrive.",

      "When the Supreme Court granted an unusually quick hearing over President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, a similarly fast resolution seemed possible",
      "WASHINGTON -- When the Supreme Court granted an unusually quick hearing over President Donald Trump's tariffs, a similarly rapid resolution seemed possible.",
      "After all, Trump's lawyers told the court that speed was of the essence on an issue central to the president's economic agenda. They pointed to a statement from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warning that the \u201clonger a final ruling is delayed, the greater the risk of economic disruption.\u201d",
      "But nearly three months have elapsed since arguments in the closely watched case and the court isn't scheduled to meet in public for more than three weeks.",
      "No one knows for sure what is going on among the nine justices, several of whom expressed skepticism about the tariffs' legality at arguments in November. But the timeline for deciding the case now looks more or less typical and could reflect the normal back-and-forth that occurs not just in the biggest cases, but almost all the disputes the justices hear.",
      "Several Supreme Court practitioners and law professors scoffed at the idea that the justices are dragging their feet on tariffs, putting off a potentially uncomfortable ruling against Trump.",
      "\u201cPeople suspect this kind of thing from time to time, but I am not aware of instances in which we have more than speculation,\u201d said Jonathan Adler, a law professor at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia.",
      "The timeframe alone also doesn't point to one outcome or the other.",
      "One possible explanation, said Carter Phillips, a lawyer with 91 arguments before the high court, \u201cis that the court is more evenly divided than appeared to be the case at oral argument and the fifth vote is wavering.\u201d",
      "Even if the majority opinion has been drafted and more or less agreed to by five or more members of the court, a separate opinion, probably in dissent, could slow things down, Phillips said.",
      "Just last week, the court issued two opinions in cases that were argued in October. All nine justices agreed with the outcome, a situation that typically allows decisions to be issued relatively quickly. But a separate opinion in each case probably delayed the decision.",
      "The court is generally moving more slowly in argued cases, perhaps because of the flood of emergency appeals the administration has brought to the justices. The first argued case wasn't decided until January this year. Typically, that happens in December, if not November.",
      "Over the last 20 years, the average turnaround time for a Supreme Court opinion was just over three months, according to data gathered by Adam Feldman, creator of Empirical SCOTUS. The timeline has increased in recent years, with the court releasing half or more of its cases in June.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials are expected to keep their short-term interest rate unchanged Wednesday after three cuts last year, ignoring huge pressure for lower borrowing costs from the White House in favor of waiting to see how the economy evolves.",
      "The central bank's rate reductions last year were intended to shore up the economy and prevent a sharper deterioration in the job market, after hiring slowed to a near-crawl in the wake of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs last April. Yet there are signs that unemployment has stabilized and the economy could be picking up. At the same time, inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed's 2% target. All those trends argue for keeping rates where they are.",
      "A key issue that Chair Jerome Powell will likely address at his news conference Wednesday is how long the Fed will remain on hold. The rate-setting committee remains split between those officials opposed to further cuts until inflation comes down, and those who want to lower rates to further support hiring.",
      "In December, just 12 of the 19 participants in the committee's meetings supported at least one more rate cut this year. Most economists forecast the Fed will cut twice this year, most likely at the June meeting or later.",
      "Fed officials meet this week in the shadow of unprecedented pressure from the Trump White House. Powell said Jan. 11 that the Fed had received subpoenas from the Justice Department as part of a criminal investigation into his congressional testimony about a $2.5 billion building renovation. Powell in an unusually blunt video statement said the subpoenas were a pretext to punish the Fed for not cutting rates more quickly.",
      "And last week, the Supreme Court took up Trump's attempt from last year to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. No president has fired a governor in the Fed\u2019s 112-year history. The justices at an oral argument appeared to be leaning toward allowing her to stay in her job until the case is resolved.",
      "At the same time, Trump has suggested he is close to naming a new Fed Chair, to replace Powell once his term ends in May. The announcement could come as soon as this week, though it has been delayed before.",
      "The president's efforts to pressure the Fed may have backfired, economists say, as Republicans in the Senate voiced support for Powell and threatened to block Trump's replacement chair.",
      "\u201cThe last couple of weeks have been pretty positive for Fed independence,\u201d said Patricia Zobel, a former official at the New York Fed and now head of macroeconomic research at Guggenheim Invesments.",
      "Even so, all the turmoil may have led Powell to hunker down as he nears the end of his term as chair. Vincent Reinhart, a former Fed economist and now chief economist at BNY Investments, noted that Powell has given just one speech touching on the economy since September.",
      "He could be letting other Fed officials take on the job of explaining why the central bank may hold off on rate cuts in the coming months, Reinhart said. It also underscores that the chair does not make decisions on rates alone, he added,",

      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday her government has at least temporarily stopped oil shipments to Cuba, but struck an ambiguous tone, saying the pause was part of general fluctuations in oil supplies and that it was a \u201csovereign decision\u201d not made under pressure from the United States.",
      "Sheinbaum was responding to inquiries on whether the state oil company Pemex had cut off oil shipments to Cuba in the wake of mounting pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump that Mexico distance itself from the Cuban government, though U.S. officials have not publicly requested that Mexico stop the oil.",
      "\u201cPemex makes decisions in the contractual relationship it has with Cuba,\u201d Sheinbaum said in her morning news briefing. \u201cSuspending is a sovereign decision and is taken when necessary.\u201d",

      "Mexico last week transferred dozens of suspected cartel members to the United States to face justice. They were sought by the Trump administration, but Sheinbaum used similar language at the time as she did Tuesday, saying the transfers were made on a sovereign and autonomous basis.",

That month, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Mexico City. Afterward, Jorge Pi\u00f1on, an expert at the University of Texas Energy Institute who tracks shipments using satellite technology, said the figure had fallen to about 7,000 barrels.",

Prior to Vineyard Wind's hearing, federal judges had allowed three of the five to restart construction: the Revolution Wind project for Rhode Island and Connecticut by Danish company Orsted, the Empire Wind project for New York by Norwegian company Equinor, and Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind for Virginia by Dominion Energy Virginia. Those three judges essentially concluded that the government did not show that the national security risk is so imminent that construction must halt, said Carl Tobias, a University of Richmond Law School professor who has been following the lawsuits.",
      "Orsted is also suing over the administration halting its Sunrise Wind project for New York \u2014 the fifth paused project \u2014 but has not had a hearing yet.",
      "Vineyard Wind is a joint venture between Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, located 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of Martha\u2019s Vineyard and Nantucket, Massachusetts. It is 95% complete and partially operational, able to produce nearly 600 megawatts of power for the New England electric grid, according to the complaint. Before the pause, it was on track to be complete by the end of March, with 62 turbines generating a total of 800 megawatts. That is enough clean electricity to power about 400,000 homes.",
      "Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell said the completion of this project is essential to ensuring the state can lower costs, meet rising energy demand, advance its climate goals and sustain thousands of good-paying jobs.",
      "U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, welcomed the judge's ruling.",
      "\u201cThis stay is an important step in the process to fight back against the Trump administration\u2019s lawless attacks against our union jobs, grid security, and energy affordability,\u201d Markey said in a statement. \u201cVineyard Wind 1 is currently delivering affordable and reliable power into our grid and has the permits, financing, and approval to deliver even more. Shutting off Vineyard Wind 1 would kill thousands of local union jobs, prevent power from reaching 400,000 homes, and cause us to lose out on $3 billion of energy savings.\"",
      "The administration's announcement that paused construction did not reveal specifics about its national security concerns. But in a court filing, Matthew Giacona, acting director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, said he reviewed classified documents in November that discussed direct impacts to national security that arise from operating offshore wind projects near early warning monitoring and radar systems. Giacona said he determined the ongoing activities for the Vineyard Wind project did not \u201cadequately provide for the protection of national security interests,\u201d absent potential mitigation measures.",

      "The pause in the red state, which is home to thousands of H-1B visa holders, comes amid actions by the Trump administration aimed at reshaping the visa program. Critics argue that it has become a pipeline for overseas workers willing to work for lower pay and is taking job opportunities from Americans. But supporters say the program is crucial to attract top global talent, fill specialized roles and drive innovation.",
      "\u201cState government must lead by example and ensure that employment opportunities \u2014 particularly those funded with taxpayer dollars \u2014 are filled by Texans first,\u201d Abbott wrote in his letter.",
      "But proponents of the program argue that it is beneficial to the state, and that any pause could worsen existing staffing shortages and hinder universities\u2019 ability to recruit talent.",
      "\u201cFreezing those pathways makes it harder to staff classrooms, research centers, and hospitals across our state, raising costs, straining public services, and hurting Texans in every corner of our state,\u201d Rep. Ramon Romero Jr., Democrat and chairman of Texas Mexican American Legislative Caucus, said in a written statement.",
      "The pause in Texas, which only applies to state agencies and public universities, is scheduled to last until May 31, 2027. Abbott's order does allow exceptions if permission is granted from the Texas Workforce Commission.",
      "Abbott said the freeze will give lawmakers time to \u201cestablish statutory guardrails\" for employment under the visa program, allow Congress to modify federal law and allow program reforms by the Trump administration to be implemented.",
      "Currently, the public university in the state with the most H-1B visas is the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas with 228 visa holders, based on data reported by the U.S. Citizen & Immigration Services in September. The university employees more than 23,000 people, according to their website. University staff did not immediately respond to messages from The Associated Press seeking comment on the pause.",
      "Other institutions with H-1B visa holders include: the Texas A&M University in College Station with 214; the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston with 171; the University of Texas at Austin with 169; and Texas Tech University in Lubbock with 143.",

      "Last year across the country, Amazon was by far the top recipient, with more than 10,000 visas approved, followed by Mumbai-based informational technology company Tata Consultancy Services, Microsoft, Apple and Google.

As such, he ordered agencies and universities to provide information on the number of new or renewed H-1B visa petitions last year, visa holders currently sponsored, job titles, countries of origin and visa expiration dates. The Republican also asked for documentation showing employers made an effort to give \"qualified Texans candidates with reasonable opportunity to apply\u201d for positions filled by H-1B holders.",

      "Abbott is not the only GOP governor taking action. Last year, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called for fewer H-1B hires, alleging abuse of the program to fill nonspecialized roles. On Thursday, the Board of Governors, which oversees the Florida's public university system, is scheduled to discuss pausing the use of H-1B program to hire new personnel until next year.",

      "At the same time, users were raising concerns that the company is \u201ccensoring\u201d videos, including ones critical of President Donald Trump, ICE or mentions of Jeffrey Epstein.

      "Belichick\u2019s role in the \u201cSpygate\u201d scandal in 2007 could have had a similar impact on his candidacy that steroids have had in the baseball Hall of Fame at keeping stars such as Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens out of Cooperstown.",
      "The rule changes put in place last year by the Hall also could have played a part, including possible frustration from some voters about the decision to eliminate the five-year waiting period for coaches that made Belichick eligible for the ballot after sitting out only one season as an NFL coach.",
      "The changes also made it more difficult for anyone \u2014 Belichick included \u2014 to get into the Hall as evidenced by only four people getting voted in last year for the smallest class in 20 years. Coaches are now competing directly with players in the seniors category instead of being judged on their own.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at how the new rules have impacted the voting:",
      "Along with eliminating the five-year waiting period, coaches also were separated from contributors in terms of becoming finalists. A blue-ribbon committee whittles the coaches down to one finalist, with Belichick getting the nod this year. The one coach was grouped with one contributor, which was Patriots owner Robert Kraft, and three seniors players who haven\u2019t played in the past 25 seasons. Ken Anderson, Roger Craig and L.C. Greenwood are the finalists this year.",
      "The biggest group of finalists comes from the modern era category, with 15 players picked after a process of cutting down nominees started with a screening committee that picks 50 nominees. The full 50-person selection committee cuts that down to 25 semifinalists and then 15 finalists, with any player who made it to the final seven and didn\u2019t get in last year guaranteed a spot in the final 15.",
      "The selection committee consists of 50 voters, with 32 picked as media representatives of each team and the rest consisting of at-large voters, including some Hall of Famers such as Bill Polian, Tony Dungy, Dan Fouts and James Lofton. All the voters got on a video conference earlier this month, with one voter making a presentation and others then allowed to offer their opinions in a debate. The vote is conducted by secret ballot, with the results announced Feb. 5 at \"NFL Honors\" in San Francisco.",

That led to only three modern era players \u2014 Eric Allen, Jared Allen and Antonio Gates \u2014 getting in last year.",

That becomes a bit of a challenge just to make sure that we can all get what we need done.\u201d",

Because the 49ers were still in the playoffs at that time and had a remote chance of hosting the NFC title game this past Sunday, Pappas was prepared to bring in a second field after that game if necessary.",
      "That quickly proved unnecessary on wild-card weekend when a loss by Green Bay ended hopes of a 49ers home playoff game so the focus quickly turned to getting the field ready for the Super Bowl.",
      "Most of the first two weeks were focused on getting the field in its best shape after rolling it out at Levi's Stadium. The crew aerates and top dresses the field to help create thicker grass, better drainage and a firmer field, mows it to get it to the proper length and uses fertilizer, grow lights and water to get it into the best condition possible.",
      "A dry January helped make the process easier, allowing the grounds crew to better control the amount of water for the field, and the grass spent much of each day under pink LED lights.",
      "The field also undergoes extensive testing to ensure it is optimal for safety and performance. That proved to be a big issue three years ago when the field in Arizona was criticized for being too slippery, impacting the game won by Kansas City over Philadelphia.",
      "The NFL uses two main tools to test fields around the league to measure traction and to determine that the surface isn't too hard or soft.",

      "The northwest Iowa towns of Newell and Fonda are outliers at a time participation in girls basketball is in steep decline",
      "NEWELL, Iowa -- The streets of Newell and Fonda are quiet. Rural decline has taken a toll on these northwest Iowa towns with main street storefronts shuttered and vacant houses scattered here and there.",
      "Yet the heart of these communities separated by 9 miles isn't hard to find. It still beats at the Newell-Fonda High School gym, where many of Newell's 850 residents, Fonda's 600 and folks from surrounding farms dress in blue and fill it up to cheer on their beloved girls basketball team that is known across Iowa.",
      "With 21 of the school's 71 girls in grades 9-12 playing on the varsity or junior varsity teams, the Mustangs are an outlier. Participation in girls basketball across the country has declined even as the popularity of the college and pro games has never been higher. Iowa's own Caitlin Clark has been credited with a lot of that of late, but participation numbers in her home state and many others are down.",
      "\u201cWhen I first started coaching girls basketball, every team you played had a good point guard, a good shooter and a solid post player and then they could build from there,\u201d Newell-Fonda coach Dick Jungers said. \u201cNow, some of the teams we play are struggling to have maybe even one or two good players in the whole program. It\u2019s kind of concerning, but kids are putting their time elsewhere.\u201d",
      "The drop in Iowa has been bigger than in most states and almost unimaginable given its long history in the girls' and women's game. Iowa was first to hold a state tournament for girls, back in 1920 when they played six-on-six, and Clark is one of the most famous players in the women's game.",
      "A handful of Iowa high schools have disbanded their programs due to lack of interest, many have only enough players for a varsity team, and it's not uncommon for junior varsity games to be two quarters because JV players also must suit up for the varsity games that follow.",
      "Basketball is still queen in Newell and Fonda, and has been since Jody Maske took four teams to the state tournament from 1995-2002. He turned the program over to Jungers, who is 527-83 with four championships and 16 state tournaments in 24 years.",
      "Three of the Mustangs' four championships in Iowa's small-school class (1A) came consecutively from 2019-21. They've played in the state final seven of the last eight seasons. Everyone who cares about girls basketball in Iowa knows they are a powerhouse.",
      "The Mustangs opened this season 14-1 with an average winning margin of 34 points \u2014 they led a recent opponent 56-2 at half \u2014 and have been ranked No. 1 since knocking off the team that beat them in the state final last March, Council Bluffs St. Albert.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an intense desire to win, you\u2019ve got to admit,\u201d said 89-year-old Jim Gailey, who has been attending games for 60 years.",
      "Senior center Jocee Walsh said, \u201cIf you know Newell-Fonda, you know we play basketball.\u201d",
      "According to the National Federation of State High School Associations, participation in girls basketball across the country dropped from 451,600 in 2000 to 356,240 in 2025. Volleyball surpassed basketball as the most popular girls team sport a decade ago and has grown from 380,994 participants to 492,799 since 2000. That\u2019s a 21% drop for basketball and 29% increase for volleyball.",
      "Using raw data \u2014 the number of schools reporting their participation numbers varies year to year \u2014 Kansas, Louisiana, North Dakota, Indiana and Iowa have seen the biggest declines. Fewer than 10 saw increases.",
      "In Iowa, girls basketball participation has fallen 38% since 2000 from 9,401 to 5,856.",
      "Other pipelines for the college and pro game are still relatively robust, including the elite clubs.",
      "Greg Turner, director of basketball for the Amateur Athletic Union, said he has noticed a decline to a lesser degree in programs his organization sanctions. The AAU season runs opposite the traditional winter basketball season and draws girls who are serious about improving their games or playing in college. AAU media officials did not respond to requests for participation numbers and Turner said he wasn't authorized to release them.",
      "Clark's prodigious numbers and style of play over the past several years are credited with creating a surge of interest in women's basketball. While the sport has enjoyed unprecedented viewership and attendance, participation at the high school level has yet to get a bump. Even Clark's alma mater, Class 5A Dowling Catholic in West Des Moines, has seen a decline. Coach Kristin Meyer said she would have about 40 girls go out for basketball when she arrived 10 years ago. That number was 28 this season.",
      "Chad Jilek, whose Johnston team in suburban Des Moines is two-time defending 5A champion and winner of 67 straight games, faces the same issue. He said his program regularly had 40-50 players in grades 9-12 when he started 14 years ago.",
      "\u201cLast year I only had 20 kids, and we\u2019re the third-largest high school in the state of Iowa and that\u2019s the lowest number we ever had,\u201d he said, adding that his numbers are closer to the norm this season.",
      "Meyer, Jilek and Jungers are on an Iowa Girls High School Athletic Union task force formed last year to explore reasons for the statewide decline and come up with possible solutions.",
      "Coaches say club volleyball programs and girls wrestling have siphoned players from basketball. Club volleyball season conflicts with basketball and fewer girls want to play multiple sports. Girls wrestling became a sanctioned sport in Iowa in 2022-23, and more than 2,000 have taken it up.",

      "Coaches also say basketball skills, more than in other sports, are hard to develop and that the disparity between serious and casual players has never been greater. They said girls tend to get discouraged and quit by middle school if they struggle. The physical aspects of the game \u2014 the running and bumping \u2014 also turn off some players.",
      "Dowling's Meyer suggested doing things a new way on the grade-school teams that feed the high schools. She said playing three-on-three games until fifth grade would give everyone more opportunities to shoot, develop skills and stay interested. Meyer also said more women in their 20s and 30s with a basketball background are needed to coach at the grade-school level because they typically are more relatable to a young girl than a dad coach.",
      "\u201cI mean, who would you rather hang out with if you're that age?\u201d Meyer said.",
      "At Newell-Fonda, kids typically start playing when they're in third grade, but this year a second-grade team was formed. Of 21 second-grade girls, 17 signed up. Playing basketball would seem to be just what girls from Newell-Fonda do if they have athletic talent.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s what you do even if you don\u2019t have athletic talent,\u201d Andrea Vanderhoff said, laughing. \u201cEveryone just wants to be a part of it.\u201d",
      "Vanderhoff is a 2005 graduate who played on Jurgens' first three teams. Now she coaches the second graders, and her oldest daughter, Madelyn, is a freshman on the JV and varsity.",
      "Madelyn is among a core group of girls who play three or four sports, same as in many small towns. The Mustangs are successful in most, but basketball trumps all.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really important here, a lot of pride,\u201d Jungers said. \u201cIt gives the community something to look forward to. It makes a big difference, and when kids feel successful, it helps everything.\"",
      "A recent 70-33 victory came against a Storm Lake team that has more than four times the enrollment and plays two classes above Newell-Fonda. For the Mustangs, years of playing together have created on-court chemistry to go with their impressive skills, and Jungers' up-tempo offense wears down opponents.",
      "Mareni Brabec has endless energy, making a sharp cut and going in for a left-handed layup before winning a battle for the ball against two much larger girls under the hoop and delivering a perfect pass to the trailing Ava Vie for an easy bank-in. Later, Vie pulled up and sank a 3-pointer from 4-5 feet behind the arc. Quinn Sievers\u2019 court demeanor belies the fact she\u2019s a freshman, and she averages four assists per game as the first player off the bench. Ellie Sievers leads a balanced scoring attack with better than 15 points per game.",
      "Parents who are former players and stay in the area to raise families are eager to volunteer to do whatever Jungers asks, whether it's help coach a grade-school team or organize a fundraiser.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re going to grow their kids up to be just the same as they were,\u201d Madelyn Vanderhoff said. \u201cIt's generation by generation here.\u201d",
      "The matriarch is 87-year-old Marie Breon, Class of 1956. She played for Fonda four decades before the schools merged. She averaged more than 30 points per game as a senior and still bemoans an official's call that cost her team a trip to the 1956 state tournament.",
      "Breon drove the team bus for almost 40 years and has had three daughters, eight granddaughters and now great-granddaughter Madelyn play high school basketball. Cane at her side, she sits in her reserved front-row seat opposite the Mustangs' bench for each game unless it's too slick to drive over from Fonda.",
      "The games are community events where a pregame supper often is served in the school cafeteria to raise money for other activities. Buena Vista County sent 1.5 million pigs and hogs to market last year, so naturally pulled pork sandwiches were on the menu before the game against Storm Lake. Those who can't get into the gym stand in the hallway and poke their heads through the door to check the score. Home games also are livestreamed and get as many as 2,500 views.",
      "\u201cIn Newell or Fonda, what are you going to do if you\u2019re not going to basketball games?\u201d Jungers said.",
      "Andrea Vanderhoff said, \u201cSometimes it\u2019s what gets people out of their house for the day.\u201d",
      "Interestingly, for towns with such rich basketball tradition, there are no signs on roads leading into Newell or Fonda proclaiming the years the Mustangs won state championships. Breon \u2014 half serious, half joking \u2014 said Newell-Fonda's reputation makes such signs unnecessary.",
      "\u201cEverybody knows us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don't have to tell 'em.\u201d",

Along the World Cup circuit this year, growing clusters of U.S. teammates have gathered to cheer her on, a presence that\u2019s coincided with her retaining the lead in the overall women\u2019s standings.",

      "Her father, an outdoorsy Canadian, installed a zip line behind their house, and speed quickly became a fascination. That competitive edge sharpened during summers north of the border, racing other kids in swim meets along the shores of Lake Superior.",

      "Musetti was also forced to retire from the French Open semifinals last year \u2014- with an injured left leg \u2014 after taking a set from eventual champion Carlos Alcaraz.",

      "Winter's brutal grip on the U.S. East will continue in the coming days, with subfreezing temperatures reaching into Florida and a potential blizzard threatening the Atlantic coast",
      "HOUSTON -- HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Winter's brutal grip on the U.S. East is not letting up, with coming days bringing subfreezing temperatures that will plunge deep into what had been a toasty Florida peninsula and a powerful blizzard forecast that may strike the Atlantic coast.",
      "Deep cold is forecast to stick around at least into the first week of February. Meteorologists are also watching what could become a \u201c bomb cyclone \u201d \u2014 a quickly intensifying storm that\u2019s a winter version of a hurricane \u2014 forming off the Carolinas Friday night into Saturday.",
      "\u201cA major winter storm appears to be coming to the Carolinas,\u201d said meteorologist Peter Mullinax of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Weather Prediction Center.",
      "That storm could dump snow \u2014 at least 6 inches (15 centimeters) with white-out conditions \u2014 in the Carolinas, northern Georgia and southern Virginia. After that, it could turn and plow through the Interstate 95 corridor late Saturday into Sunday to dump loads more snow from Washington to Boston, further paralyzing much of the country. Or it could deliver a glancing blow, mostly striking places like Cape Cod.",
      "Alternatively, it could just veer off harmlessly to sea. Meteorologists and forecast models aren't yet settling on a single outcome.",
      "\u201cThe confidence is much higher that in the coastal Carolinas and Virginia that there will be significant snowfall this weekend,\u201d said James Belanger, vice president for meteorology at the Weather Channel and its parent company. \"The real question is going to be the trajectory it takes\u201d from there.",
      "Private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former NOAA chief scientist, said for the mid-Atlantic and north it's a \u201cboom or bust\u201d situation. \u201cIf it happens (to go along the coast) it's going to be a big-time event.\"",
      "On Tuesday forecast models were all over the place, from out to sea to inward toward Philadelphia. By Wednesday morning they started to agree that \u201cwe\u2019re likely to see some form of a powerful coastal storm somewhere east of North Carolina, off the Delmarva coast, but they still disagree as to where,\u201d Mullinax said.",
      "Chances of the storm veering away from the East Coast entirely had diminished Wednesday morning, but hadn't disappeared altogether, Mullinax said.",
      "Of all the options, \u201cfrom D.C. up to New York is probably the most unclear,\u201d Mullinax said. He said a mere 50-mile (80-kilometer) difference in the storm's center will be critical. AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said it may be hard for the southern mid-Atlantic to avoid some kind of snow, whether a little or a lot.",
      "This weekend's storm will differ from the previous storm, which started with moist air from the Pacific that combined with a deep plunge of Arctic air from an elongated polar vortex supplemented by more moisture from the south and east, meteorologists said. The last storm had little wind. This one will generate high winds, even if the snow misses the Washington area, generating gusts that could still reach 40 mph (65 kph), plunging wind chills near subzero Fahrenheit (minus 18 Celsius), Mullinax said.",
      "\u201cIt looks like a pretty strong and explosive storm so everybody is going to have some gusty winds,\" Pydynowski said, even inland places that won't come close to getting snow like Pittsburgh. Strong winds may take daytime temperatures in the teens there down to feeling like they are below zero, he said.",
      "\u201cThis is what we'd consider more of a classic nor'easter,\u201d Belanger said, describing a storm forming around the U.S. Gulf Coast crossing into the Atlantic and going up that coast.",

      "When that happens the storm \u201cpulls in more moisture and it gives it more strength,\u201d she said.",
      "Once the core of the storm nears the Carolinas its pressure will drop tremendously, enough to qualify for what meteorologists call \u201cbombogenesis\u201d or \u201ca bomb cyclone,\u201d That will give it the effect of a moderate-strength hurricane, including huge winds, but in the winter, Maue and Belanger said.",
      "If the storm does come ashore, those winds and extra snow could cause massive snow drifts big enough to bury cars, Maue said.",
      "What is more certain is that the Arctic chill in the Midwest and East will continue through mid-February, with only slight warmups that would still be below normal, meteorologists said.",
      "And this new weekend storm \u201cis going to take that cold and it's going to spill right down the heart of the Florida peninsula,\" Pydynowski said. Orlando is forecast to go well below freezing and only have a high of 48 F (9 C), smashing temperature records, while even Miami and Key West will flirt with record cold Sunday and Monday, meteorologists said.",
      "The outlook for Florida was cold enough to raise concerns about damage to the state\u2019s citrus and strawberries.",
      "\u201cWe're going into a brutally cold period,\u201d Maue said.",

      "The veteran rocker announced Tuesday on his blog that he is providing free access to his entire music catalog to residents of Denmark's semiautonomous territory, whose futures have lately become a point of tension between the U.S. and NATO.",
      "\u201cI hope my music and music films will ease some of the unwarranted stress and threats you are experiencing from our unpopular and hopefully temporary government,\u201d Young wrote. \u201cIt is my sincere wish for you to be able to enjoy all of my music in your beautiful Greenland home, in its highest quality.\"",
      "The offer is for a year \u2014 though Young said renewing is possible \u2014 and applicants need to have a Greenland-based cellphone. \u201cThis is an offer of Peace and Love,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The offer is in stark contrast to Young's recent decision to deny listeners his catalog on the streaming Amazon Music platform, a swipe at its founder, Jeff Bezos, who has supported U.S. President Donald Trump.",

At his insistence, much of his music was removed from the platform for several months beginning in 2015 because of his concerns about audio quality. But his music is there, as it is on Apple Music.",

    "story": [
      "A new humanoid robot named Sprout, developed by Fauna Robotics, is making its debut",
      "NEW YORK -- As the new robot called Sprout walks around a Manhattan office, nodding its rectangular head, lifting its windshield wiper-like \u201ceyebrows\u201d and offering to shake your hand with its grippers, it looks nothing like the sleek and intimidating humanoids built by companies like Tesla.",
      "Sprout's charm is the point. A 5-year-old child could comfortably talk at eye level with this humanoid, which stands 3.5 feet (1 meter) tall and wears a soft, padded exterior of sage-green foam.",
      "Forged by stealth startup Fauna Robotics over two years of secret research and development, Sprout's public debut on Tuesday aims to jump-start a whole new industry of building \u201capproachable\u201d robots for homes, schools and social spaces.",
      "The robot is in many ways the first of its kind, at least in the United States, even as rapid advances in artificial intelligence and robot engineering have finally made it possible to start building such machines. If its emotive expressions and blinking lights seem vaguely familiar, it might be from generations of Star Wars droids and other endearingly clunky robotic sidekicks dreamed up in animation studios and children's literature.",
      "\u201cMost people in this industry take inspiration from the science fiction that we grew up with,\u201d said Fauna Robotics co-founder and CEO Rob Cochran. \u201cI think some do so from \u2018Westworld\u2019 and \u2018Terminator.\u2019 We do from WALL-E and Baymax and Rosie Jetson.\u201d",
      "The usual hypothesis for the commercialization of humanoid robots is that they will get their first jobs in warehouses or factories long before they are ready for homes. That's the path proposed for two of today's best-known prototypes: Tesla's Optimus, which CEO Elon Musk sees as the carmaker's future, and Boston Dynamics' Atlas, which parent company Hyundai plans to deploy in car manufacturing by 2028.",
      "Fauna looks to skip that step for an entirely different clientele: other robot tinkerers. Much as early personal computers and, later, smartphones sparked a culture of developers designing new games and applications, Sprout is a software developer platform more than just a robot. It's also a mechanically complex one that will cost buyers $50,000.",
      "That's a price some university research labs and technology entrepreneurs are already spending on China's Unitree, which sells a lightweight humanoid often seen at robotics conferences and competitions. Others have avoided Chinese hardware due to tariffs and broader security concerns.",
      "Cochran believes Fauna is \u201cthe first American company to be actively shipping robots as a developer platform\u201d and has been hand-delivering the first models. Early customers include Disney and Boston Dynamics.",
      "\u201cYou take it out of the box and you can start walking it around immediately,\u201d said Marc Theermann, chief strategy officer at Boston Dynamics, in a recent interview. \u201cSeeing their robot for the first time really lets you see the future a little bit. And if you squint, you can see how a robot like that would be welcomed into people\u2019s homes.\u201d",
      "Sprout can\u2019t lift heavy objects, but it can dance the Twist or the Floss, grab a toy block or teddy bear, or hoist itself from a chair to take a long stroll along the wood floors of Fauna\u2019s headquarters in New York City's Flatiron District.",
      "Cochran and co-founder Josh Merel, the company's chief technology officer, demonstrated the robot to The Associated Press in mid-January ahead of its public launch. Fauna employees and an AP reporter piloted the robot, using a video game controller, a phone application and a virtual-reality headset. Sprout also knows the office layout enough to be sent on a planned mission, such as to check out the inventory of the break room refrigerator.",
      "It walks slowly but steadily on uneven ground. Only once it came close to tripping, taking a sharp turn to avoid a person and instead hitting its foot on a protruding table wheel too low to the ground to be seen by Sprout's camera eyes. But the robot, built to handle what engineers call perturbation, quickly recovered its balance and kept walking, much like a clumsy person might.",

Among the first batch of Fauna's 50 employees, and a fan of science fiction writer Isaac Asimov, she previously worked on self-driving cars but was excited about joining a startup building something that might one day serve as a robot butler.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s cute, and it\u2019s not too humanoid, and I think that actually makes it a lot more fun,\u201d Pervan said. \u201cIt's not verging on creepy or trying to be too human. It\u2019s like your buddy, your pal, that\u2019s a different thing than you.\u201d",
      "Starting a robot company can be unforgiving, especially one designing personal robots. One of the few successes, Roomba vacuum maker iRobot, had a decades-long run before filing for bankruptcy protection last month.",
      "Most others didn't last that long, like Anki, maker of the playful toy robot Cozmo, or Jibo, which went out of business less than a year after its dynamic talking speaker made the cover of Time Magazine\u2019s 2017 \u201cbest inventions\u201d edition.",
      "\u201cThere were a lot of really brilliant attempts. I think the technology wasn\u2019t quite there,\u201d Cochran said. \u201cI do think we\u2019re right on the precipice now where you could build a companion that is present, engaging, delightful to be around, and can also move around a space in a way that nothing ever has before.\u201d",
      "Merel, an expert in robot locomotion, previously worked for Google\u2019s DeepMind, where he focused on teaching robots using AI learning techniques in simulated environments, a controversial approach but now increasingly how robots are built. The science journal Nature published his study on an AI-powered virtual rat, co-authored with another of Fauna's research scientists, Diego Aldarondo.",
      "Cochran and Merel later worked together at CTRL-labs, a wearable neurotech company sold to Facebook in 2019. Cochran jokes that he then \u201cspent a misguided four years at Goldman Sachs\u201d before they decided to team up again.",
      "Improvements in AI, motors and batteries have accelerated humanoid development. But Fauna's founders agreed that the dystopian aesthetic of many prototypes \u2014 what Cochran calls \u201cindustrial automotive machismo\u201d \u2014 conveyed strength and confidence but wouldn't work for intimate human spaces.",
      "\u201cThey were generally quite big and physically dangerous to be around,\u201d Cochran said. \u201cStrong, heavy. If they fell on you, it\u2019d be a real problem.\u201d",
      "The duo brought in Anthony Moschella, who helped design Peloton's exercise bikes, treadmills and rowers and is an admirer of the abstract designs of Star Wars robots like R2-D2 and BB-8.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s build a system that human beings actually want to be around,\u201d said Moschella, now Fauna's vice president of hardware. \u201cI think it\u2019s incredible that so many robotics companies are not versed in the cultural context of what it means to be around a robot.\u201d",
      "Moschella said what happens next with Sprout will depend on how developers play around with it and what they learn. For Cochran, some of the most important judges have already approved. In a home video he keeps on his phone, his 2-year-old twins excitedly jump up and down as Sprout greets them.",

      "French lawmakers have approved a bill banning social media for children under 15",
      "PARIS -- French lawmakers approved a bill banning social media for children under 15, paving the way for the measure to enter into force at the start of the next school year in September, as the idea of setting a minimum age for use of the platforms gains momentum across Europe.",
      "The bill, which also bans the use of mobile phones in high schools, was adopted by a 130-21 vote late Monday. French President Emmanuel Macron has requested that the legislation be fast-tracked and it will now be discussed by the Senate in the coming weeks.",
      "\u201cBanning social media for those under 15: this is what scientists recommend, and this is what the French people are overwhelmingly calling for,\u201d Macron said after the vote. \u201cBecause our children\u2019s brains are not for sale \u2014 neither to American platforms nor to Chinese networks. Because their dreams must not be dictated by algorithms.\u201d",
      "The issue is one of the very few in a divided National Assembly to attract such broad support, despite critics from the hard left denouncing provisions of the bill as infringement on civil liberties. Weakened domestically since his decision to dissolve parliament plunged France into a prolonged political crisis, Macron has strongly supported the ban, which could become one of the final major measures adopted under his leadership before he leaves office next year.",
      "The French government had previously passed a law banning phone use in all primary and middle schools.",
      "The vote in the assembly came just days after the British government said it will consider banning young teenagers from social media as it tightens laws designed to protect children from harmful content and excessive screen time.",

In November, European lawmakers called for action at EU level to protect minors online, including a bloc-wide minimum age of 16 and bans on the most harmful practices.",
      "According to France\u2019s health watchdog, one in two teenagers spends between two and five hours a day on a smartphone. In a report published in December, it said that some 90% of children aged between 12 and 17 use smartphones daily to access the internet, with 58% of them using their devices for social networks.",
      "The report highlighted a range of harmful effects stemming from the use of social networks, including reduced self-esteem and increased exposure to content associated with risky behaviors such as self-harm, drug use and suicide. Several families in France have sued TikTok over teen suicides they say are linked to harmful content.",
      "The French ban won\u2019t cover online encyclopedias, educational or scientific directories, or platforms for the development and sharing of open-source software.",
      "In Australia, social media companies have revoked access to about 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children since the country banned use of the platforms by those under 16, officials said. The law provoked fraught debates in Australia about technology use, privacy, child safety and mental health and has prompted other countries to consider similar measures.",

      "Three of the world's biggest tech companies face a landmark trial in Los Angeles starting this week over claims that their platforms \u2014 Meta's Instagram, ByteDance's TikTok and Google's YouTube \u2014 deliberately addict and harm children.",
      "Jury selection starts this week in the Los Angeles County Superior Court. It's the first time the companies will argue their case before a jury, and the outcome could have profound effects on their businesses and how they will handle children using their platforms. The selection process is expected to take at least a few days, with 75 potential jurors questioned each day through at least Thursday. A fourth company named in the lawsuit, Snapchat parent company Snap Inc., settled the case last week for an undisclosed sum.",
      "At the core of the case is a 19-year-old identified only by the initials \u201cKGM,\" whose case could determine how thousands of other, similar lawsuits against social media companies will play out. She and two other plaintiffs have been selected for bellwether trials \u2014 essentially test cases for both sides to see how their arguments play out before a jury and what damages, if any, may be awarded, said Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow of technology policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.",
      "KGM claims that her use of social media from an early age addicted her to the technology and exacerbated depression and suicidal thoughts. Importantly, the lawsuit claims that this was done through deliberate design choices made by companies that sought to make their platforms more addictive to children to boost profits. This argument, if successful, could sidestep the companies' First Amendment shield and Section 230, which protects tech companies from liability for material posted on their platforms.",
      "\u201cBorrowing heavily from the behavioral and neurobiological techniques used by slot machines and exploited by the cigarette industry, Defendants deliberately embedded in their products an array of design features aimed at maximizing youth engagement to drive advertising revenue,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "Executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, are expected to testify at the trial, which will last six to eight weeks. Experts have drawn similarities to the Big Tobacco trials that led to a 1998 settlement requiring cigarette companies to pay billions in health care costs and restrict marketing targeting minors.",
      "\u201cPlaintiffs are not merely the collateral damage of Defendants\u2019 products,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cThey are the direct victims of the intentional product design choices made by each Defendant. They are the intended targets of the harmful features that pushed them into self-destructive feedback loops.\u201d",
      "The tech companies dispute the claims that their products deliberately harm children, citing a bevy of safeguards they have added over the years and arguing that they are not liable for content posted on their sites by third parties.",
      "\u201cRecently, a number of lawsuits have attempted to place the blame for teen mental health struggles squarely on social media companies,\u201d Meta said in a recent blog post. \"But this oversimplifies a serious issue. Clinicians and researchers find that mental health is a deeply complex and multifaceted issue, and trends regarding teens' well-being aren't clear-cut or universal. Narrowing the challenges faced by teens to a single factor ignores the scientific research and the many stressors impacting young people today, like academic pressure, school safety, socio-economic challenges and substance abuse.\"",

      "One is a spindly stick about 2 1/2 feet (80 centimeters) long that could have been used for digging in the mud.

      "Human remains haven't been found at the site yet, so it's not yet clear who used the tools. The owners could have been Neanderthals, early human ancestors or someone else.",

      "LONDON -- The European Union opened a formal investigation into Elon Musk's social media platform X on Monday after his artificial intelligence chatbot Grok started spewing nonconsensual sexualized deepfake images on the platform.",
      "European regulators also widened a separate, ongoing investigation into X's recommendation systems after the platform said it would switch to Grok's AI system to choose which posts users see.",

Researchers said some images appeared to include children. Some governments banned the service or issued warnings.",
      "The 27-nation EU's executive said it was looking into whether X has done enough as required by the bloc's digital regulations to contain the risks of spreading illegal content such as \"manipulated sexually explicit images.\"",

      "Millions of people rely on wearable devices to monitor how well they're sleeping",
      "ATLANTA -- Your watch says you had three hours of deep sleep. Should you believe it?",
      "Millions of people rely on phone apps and wearable devices like rings, smartwatches and sensors to monitor how well they're sleeping, but these trackers don\u2019t necessarily measure sleep directly. Instead, they infer states of slumber from signals like heart rate and movement, raising questions about how reliable the information is and how seriously it should be taken.",
      "The U.S. sleep-tracking devices market generated about $5 billion in 2023 and is expected to double in revenue by 2030, according to market research firm Grand View Research. As the devices continue to gain popularity, experts say it is important to understand what they can and cannot tell you, and how their data should be used.",
      "Here's a look at the technology \u2014 and why one expert thinks its full potential has yet to be realized.",
      "Whether it's an Apple Watch, a Fitbit, an Oura Ring or one of innumerable other competitors, health and fitness trackers largely take the same basic approach by recording the wearer's movements and heart rate while at rest, according to Daniel Forger, a University of Michigan math professor who researches the science behind sleep wearables.",
      "The algorithms used by major brands have become highly accurate for determining when someone is asleep, Forger said. The devices are also somewhat helpful for estimating sleep stages, though an in-lab study would be more precise, he said.",
      "\u201cIf you really want to know definitively how much non-REM sleep you\u2019re having versus REM sleep, that\u2019s where the in-lab studies really excel,\u201d Forger said.",
      "Dr. Chantale Branson, a neurologist and professor at the Morehouse School of Medicine, said she frequently has patients showing up with sleep scores from fitness trackers in hand, sometimes fixated on granular details such as how much REM sleep they got on a certain night.",
      "Branson says those patients are taking the wrong approach: the devices help highlight trends over time but should not be viewed as a definitive measure of one's sleep health. Nor should any single night's data be seen as significant.",
      "\u201cWe would have believed them with or without the device and worked on trying to figure out why they can't sleep \u2014 and that is what the wearables do not do,\u201d she said.",
      "Branson said she thinks people who check their sleep statistics every morning would be better served by spending their efforts on \u201csleep hygiene\u201d such as creating a relaxing bedtime routine, avoiding screens before bed and making sure their sleep environment is comfortable. She advises those concerned about their sleep to consult a clinician before spending money on a wearable.",
      "Forger takes a more favorable view toward the devices, which he says help keep the overlooked importance of sleep front of mind. He recommends them even for people without significant sleep issues, saying they can offer insights that help users fine-tune their routines and feel more alert during the day.",
      "\u201cSeeing if your biological clock is in sync is a huge benefit because even if you\u2019re giving yourself the right amount of time, if you\u2019re sleeping at the wrong times, the sleep won\u2019t be as efficient,\u201d Forger said.",
      "Kate Stoye, an Atlanta-area middle school teacher, bought an Oura Ring last summer, having heard positive things from friends who used it as a fertility tracker: \u201cIt\u2019s so accurate,\u201d she said. Stoye found the ring to be just as helpful with tracking her sleep. After noticing that the few nights she drank alcohol coincided with poorer sleep quality, she decided to give up alcohol.",

      "Branson, of the Morehouse School of Medicine, said she's observed similar score-induced anxiety as a recurring issue for some patients, particularly those who set goals to achieve a certain amount of REM sleep or who shared their nightly scores with friends using the same device. Comparing sleep types and stages is ill-advised since individual needs vary by age, genetics and other factors, she said.",
      "\u201cThese devices are supposed to help you,\" Branson said. \"And if you feel anxious or worried or frustrated about it, then it\u2019s not helpful, and you should really talk to a professional.\u201d",
      "Forger thinks the promise of wearables has been underestimated, with emerging research suggesting the devices could one day be designed to help detect infections before symptoms appear and to flag sleep pattern changes that may signal the onset of depression or an increased risk of relapse.",
      "\u201cThe body is making these really interesting and really important decisions that we\u2019re not aware of to keep us healthy and active and alert at the right times of day,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have an infection, that rhythm very quickly starts to disappear because the body goes into overdrive to start fighting the infection. Those are the kind of things we can pick up.\u201d",
      "The technology could be particularly useful in low-resource communities, where wearables could help health issues to be identified more quickly and monitored remotely without requiring access to doctors or specialized clinics, according to Forger.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this really important story that\u2019s about to come out: About just how understanding sleep rhythms and sleep architecture is going to generally improve our lives,\u201d he said.",

      "PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron says he wants his government to fast-track the legal process to ensure that a ban on social media for children under the age of 15 can enter into force in September at the start of the next school year.",
      "In a video released late Saturday by French broadcaster BFM-TV, Macron said he had asked his government to initiate an accelerated procedure so that the proposed legislation can move as quickly as possible and be passed by the Senate in time.",
      "\u201cThe brains of our children and our teenagers are not for sale,\" Macron said. \u201cThe emotions of our children and our teenagers are not for sale or to be manipulated. Neither by American platforms, nor by Chinese algorithms.\u201d",
      "Macron's announcement came just days after the British government said it will consider banning young teenagers from social media as it tightens laws designed to protect children from harmful content and excessive screen time.",
      "According to France's health watchdog, one in two teenagers spends between two and five hours a day on a smartphone. In a report published in December, it said that some 90% of children aged between 12 and 17 use smartphones daily to access the internet, with 58% of them using their devices for social networks.",

      "In Australia, social media companies have revoked access to about 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children since the country banned use of the platforms by those under 16, officials said. The law provoked fraught debates in Australia about technology use, privacy, child safety and mental health and has prompted other countries to consider similar measures.",

      "Family members of the three men said they fear for their loved ones' safety and are concerned the moves to solitary confinement are a form of retaliation for outspokenness about problems within the prison system. Robert Earl Council, Melvin Ray and Raoul Poole were transferred two weeks ago from their existing prisons to solitary confinement at Kilby Correctional Facility outside Montgomery, Alabama, their lawyers said. The transfers come as some groups have encouraged a new prison labor strike this year.",

      "The moves come as some have pushed for a new prison labor strike this year similar to one in 2022 that drew national attention.

      "NEW YORK -- A federal judge gave a man would-be assassin the maximum 15 years in prison Wednesday for plotting to kill an Iranian American writer on behalf of Tehran after hearing the woman who was targeted describe multiple attempts on her life as threats against all Americans.",
      "Judge Lewis J. Liman said Carlisle Rivera\u2019s written conversations as he plotted to kill journalist and human rights advocate Masih Alinejad in Brooklyn in 2024 were \u201cchilling\u201d and he inflicted \u201cgreat harm\u201d on her and her husband.",
      "Addressing the court, the couple described how assassination plots forced them to limit interactions with their children as they frequently changed residences and dodged threats from an unrelenting Iran.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just a woman,\u201d Alinejad said. \u201cMy weapon is my voice. My weapon is my social media.\u201d",
      "She urged the judge to give Rivera the maximum sentence to send a message to anyone \u201ctargeting U.S. citizens on U.S. soil\u201d and to \u201cprotect unarmed people like me now facing massacre in my country.\u201d",
      "People in Iran, Alinejad said, are \u201cfacing guns and bullets ... to protect the global security,\u201d including for Americans.",
      "Before the sentence was announced, Rivera, 51, told the judge: \u201cI\u2019m deeply sorry for my actions.\u201d",
      "Outside the Manhattan federal courthouse, Alinejad said the United States must be careful to not let indiscriminate killings happening in Iran spread to the U.S. As she spoke she held up a computer tablet and showed reporters video clips of body bags of some of the thousands of Iranians killed during recent protests.",
      "Alinejad said she hoped President Donald Trump would go after Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei like he did Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who was seized in a January U.S. military raid and brought to face drug trafficking charges in New York. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "\u201cI am calling on President Trump. Take action. Removing terrorists is not tragedy. It\u2019s a sign of justice,\u201d Alinejad said. She added, however, that she does not want Iran bombed \u2014 just the removal of its leaders.",
      "She noted that U.S. authorities have said Iran's Revolutionary Guard was responsible for not only multiple plots against her life but also a plot against Trump.",

      "An author and contributor to the Voice of America and CBS News, Alinejad became a citizen in 2019. She has traveled the world speaking to women and encouraging others to join her movement for women's freedom of expression, particularly those in Iran.",
      "Last year she testified at the trial of two men charged with plotting to kidnap her from her Brooklyn home and kill her in 2022. A prosecutor said Iran put a $500,000 bounty on her head. The defendants, both natives of Azerbaijan, were convicted and sentenced to 25 years.",
      "In November 2024 the Justice Department accused Tehran of authorizing a murder-for-hire plot against Trump days before he won reelection. An Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson reportedly denied the allegation. The person who tried to hire killers to go after Trump also organized the plot against Alinejad, authorities said.",
      "Intelligence officials have said Iran opposed Trump's reelection. Trump\u2019s first administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act that prompted Iran\u2019s leaders to vow revenge.",
      "In court Wednesday, a prosecutor said Rivera was supposed to surveil Alinejad's planned February 2024 appearance at Fairfield University in Connecticut, an event that was canceled. Afterward, according to court papers, Rivera tried for months to surveil Alinejad at a Brooklyn home where she no longer lived.",
      "During a break in the proceeding, Alinejad approached Rivera's fiancee, who sobbed as she hugged Alinejad, telling her: \u201cI'm sorry. I'm sorry.\u201d",
      "Outside the courthouse afterward, Alinejad said she told the woman: \u201cI said, 'I'm fighting for you, I'm fighting for all Americans ... when I asked President Trump to try to get the killers.'\u201d",

      "A man charged with killing his wife and another man testifying in his case about his relationship with his family's au pair in the months before the killings",
      "RICHMOND, Va. -- A man testified on Wednesday that he loved his wife and did not want to end his marriage, despite having an affair with his family's au pair in what would become a sprawling double homicide case centered around the two of them.",
      "Wearing a gray suit and a plaid tie, Brendan Banfield testified in a Fairfax, Virginia, court under oath about what happened the day he began cheating on his late wife, Christine Banfield, with Juliana Peres Magalh\u00e3es in what he said was a casual affair. He described Magalh\u00e3es scooting her chair closer to his while eating dinner one night, while his wife was out of town. He testified that she followed him into his room at bedtime, and he didn't stop her.",
      "But Banfield testified he and Magalh\u00e3es did not plot to kill his wife and another man in the months that followed, despite what prosecutors suggest.",
      "\u201cI think that it\u2019s an absurd line of questioning for something that is not serious, that a plan was made to get rid of my wife,\u201d he testified. \u201cThat is absolutely crazy.\u201d",
      "Banfield is charged with aggravated murder in the killings of his wife and Joe Ryan. His testimony will be a key piece of evidence that a northern Virginia jury will be tasked with weighing this month. Banfield, who has pleaded not guilty, could face life in prison if convicted by his peers.",
      "Prosecutors say Banfield and Magalh\u00e3es lured Ryan to their house. According to officials, the two then shot him, and Banfield stabbed his wife, staging the scene to look as though Ryan had been a predator stabbing Christine Banfield.",
      "One of the witnesses who corroborates prosecutors\u2019 theory is Magalh\u00e3es herself.",
      "Earlier in January, Magalh\u00e3es testified that she and Banfield had created an account in Christine Banfield\u2019s name on a social media platform for people interested in sexual fetishes. There, Ryan connected with the account, and the users made plans to meet for a sexual encounter involving a knife.",
      "She testified to Banfield\u2019s plan to kill his wife and live his life with Magalh\u00e3es after they began their affair, plotting for months their ruse.",
      "Banfield testified that the au pair\u2019s omission to officials was a lie, saying \u201cthere was no plan.\u201d He also said that both he and his wife had affairs throughout the course of their 19-year relationship, but decided through couples therapy to continue their marriage.",
      "His testimony comes as John Carroll, Banfield\u2019s attorney, spent much of the trial scrutinizing Magalh\u00e3es' motives in the case. The former au pair was initially charged with second-degree murder in Ryan\u2019s killing, but has since pleaded guilty to a downgraded manslaughter charge.",

      "WASHINGTON -- An immigration judge on Wednesday granted asylum to a Chinese national who he said had a \u201cwell founded fear\u201d of persecution if sent back to China after exposing human rights abuses there.",
      "Guan Heng, 38, applied for asylum after arriving in the U.S. illegally in 2021. He has been in custody since being swept up in an immigration enforcement operation in August as part of a mass deportation campaign by the Trump administration.",

      "During Wednesday's hearing in Napanoch, New York, Guan was asked if his intention in filming the detention facilities and then releasing the video a few days before arriving in the U.S. was to give him grounds to apply for asylum. He said that was not his goal.",
      "\u201cI sympathized with the Uyghurs who were persecuted,\u201d Guan, speaking by video link from the Broome County Correctional Facility, told the court through a translator.",
      "Guan knew he had to leave China if he wanted to publish the footage, he told The Associated Press in a recent interview. He went first to Hong Kong and from there to Ecuador, where Chinese tourists could travel without a visa, and then to the Bahamas. He released most of his video footage on YouTube before taking a boat to Florida in October 2021.",

      "The Chinese government has denied allegations of rights abuses in Xinjiang, saying it runs vocational training programs to help local residents learn employable skills while rooting out radical thoughts, and has silenced dissenting views through a range of coercive means.",
      "Guan's lawyer, Chen Chuangchuang, said in his closing statement that the case is a \u201ctextbook example of why asylum should exist\u201d and that the U.S. has both a \u201cmoral and legal responsibility\u201d to grant Guan asylum.",
      "In making his ruling, Judge Charles Ouslander told Guan the court found him to be a credible witness and that he had established his legal eligibility for asylum. He said Guan was right to fear retaliation if sent back, noting that the Chinese government had questioned his family and inquired about Guan\u2019s whereabouts and his past activities.",
      "It was an increasingly rare successful outcome for an asylum seeker since President Donald Trump returned to office. The asylum approval rate dropped to 10% in 2025, down from 28% between 2010 and 2024, according to federal data compiled by Mobile Pathways, a California-based nonprofit that helps immigrants navigate the U.S. legal system.",
      "Guan, however, was not immediately released because the lawyer for the Department of Homeland Security said the department reserves the right to appeal. It has 30 days to do so, but Ouslander urged DHS to make its decision soon, noting that Guan has already been detained for about five months.",

The drop came despite the introduction of cheaper models and Musk's promise to remain laser-focused on the company after a foray into U.S politics.",
      "Still, Tesla investors have kept the faith in Musk. The stock is up 9% in the past year.",
      "Musk has been urging investors to focus less on car sales and more on what he considers a bright new future of robotaxis ferrying millions in cars without drivers, or even steering wheels, and robots watering plants and taking care of elderly parents.",
      "On a conference call, Musk said Tesla would be closing down production of two models, S and X, in the second quarter this year and converting a Fremont, California, factory to produce its Optimus robots.",
      "For the fourth quarter of last year, Tesla's net income also plunged, down 61% to $840 million, or 24 cents. Excluding one-time charges, net income totaled 50 cents per share, compared to analysts' forecasts of 45 cents.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve got aging product that is less and less competitive as others manufacturers come out with new models, then there is the general brand destruction,\" said Telemetry analyst Sam Abuelsamid. \"Musk\u2018s involvement in politics has turned off customers.\u201d",
      "One bright point was Tesla's gross profit margins, which leapt to 20% last quarter from 16% a year ago.",
      "\u201cTesla\u2019s ability to show improving profitably was a surprise,\u201d said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. \u201cI think that is the reason the stock is up now.\u201d",
      "Goldstein said he was also encouraged by plans outlined in Tesla\u2019s earnings report to roll out robotaxi service in Houston, Miami and five other cities in the first half of this year.",
      "Investors cheered earlier this year when Musk shifted his focus back to the company after spending months as head of a government cost-cutting team in Washington. But it's not clear his attention will remain as undivided in the new year. He has plans to take his rocket company SpaceX public, possibly in June, in what many expect to be a blockbuster IPO that make him the world\u2019s first trillionaire \u2014 but also possibly distract him.",

      "Musk had also promised a year ago that European regulators would approve its partial self-driving software within three months, a potential big boost to Tesla sales there. But that didn\u2019t happen either.",
      "And investors were also excited about Teslas robotaxi service promising rides without anyone driving the car. But instead they got cars with supervisors inside to grab the controls in case something went wrong, though on this count there may be progress. Tesla recently said it was removing these safety drivers in Austin where it launched the service in June and has vowed to aggressively expand into other cities in the coming year.",
      "For some on Wall Street that is enough to get excited about the company, and keep pushing the stock up.",
      "Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, one of Wall Street\u2019s most bullish analysts, expects robotaxis will be in more than 30 cities by the end of this year, and that Tesla will capture 70% of the global market for self-driving cars in a decade.",
      "Others are also excited about Tesla energy storage business, which posted strong numbers last quarter with revenues surging 25% to $3.8 billion. Tesla is benefiting from massive demand as datacenters sucking up energy are being built out around the U.S.",

      "A loggerhead sea turtle has returned to the Atlantic Ocean after rehabilitation at a Florida turtle hospital",
      "JUNO BEACH, Fla. -- Cheers rose from a bundled-up crowd as a loggerhead sea turtle that survived a likely shark attack trundled back into the ocean after months of rehabilitation in Florida, carrying a satellite tracker to see how she fares with only three flippers.",
      "The air on the beach was chilly, with temperatures in the 40s Fahrenheit (roughly 4 to 9 degrees Celsius ). But the Atlantic Ocean has hovered around a comfortable 77 F (25 C), said Heather Barron, chief science officer and a veterinarian at the Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach.",
      "To acclimate the turtle for reentry, the facility kept her tank\u2019s water temperature at around 80 F (27 C), Barron said. Beachgoers snapped photos as the turtle crawled down the sand, the satellite tracker\u2019s long antenna waving in the air, before she disappeared into the waves.",
      "The turtle was named Pyari, a Hindi term of endearment meaning \u201clovely\u201d or \u201cbeloved.\u201d She arrived at the center in November from the nearby Inwater Research Group.",
      "Some kind of predator had tried to make a meal of her, the marine center said in a statement, leaving Pyari with extensive injuries to her neck, shell and both front flippers. That led to the amputation of most of her left forelimb.",

      "A 911 call shows that a Nicaraguan man who died at a Texas detention camp days after he was detained by immigration authorities in Minneapolis is suspected of dying by suicide",
      "Associated Press -- A Nicaraguan man who died at a troubled Texas detention camp days after he was detained by immigration agents in Minnesota appeared to have died by suicide, according to a 911 call and records released Wednesday.",
      "Victor Manuel Diaz, 36, was found by guards on Jan. 14 in a room at Camp East Montana in El Paso, Texas, after he tried to die by suicide, a camp official reported on a 911 call obtained by The Associated Press through a public information request.",
      "\u201cThey were doing rounds and they just found him with his pants tied up to his neck, I believe,\u201d said the caller, who identified himself as a health administrator named Luis Gonzalez.",
      "Diaz\u2019s death was at least the third of a detainee housed at Camp East Montana, which opened last year at Fort Bliss to hold 5,000 detainees in the desert near the U.S.-Mexico border. Advocates for detainees have alleged a pattern of violence, abuse and neglect at the camp. One earlier death has been ruled a homicide.",
      "Randall Kallinen, an attorney for Diaz's family, said they are suspicious of the claim that his death was a suicide because he was not depressed and would have been reunited with his mother, two sons and siblings in Nicaragua if he had been deported.",
      "\u201cEven if it is suicide, was there something that happened to him that drove him to suicide?\u201d Kallinen asked. \u201cThere still has to be an investigation.\u201d",
      "Messages seeking comment were left with ICE on Wednesday.",
      "Gonzalez did not witness Diaz's suicide attempt. A separate report by emergency medical services that was released Wednesday said Diaz was suspected of hanging himself with a bed sheet. Federal authorities have not released the findings of an autopsy, but have said the death was a \u201cpresumed suicide.\u201d",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement picked up Diaz on Jan. 6 as agents fanned out across Minneapolis looking for people who may be in the country illegally. He was then sent to the sprawling Texas tent complex.",
      "Diaz crossed the U.S.-Mexico border in 2024, requested asylum and was released. A judge later ordered his removal after he didn\u2019t show up for an immigration hearing, according to ICE.",
      "Relatives in Nicaragua lost contact with Diaz after he went to work at a suburban restaurant on Jan. 6 and later learned he'd been detained. They received a call on Jan. 15 from ICE saying Diaz was dead. Family members \u201cwere in disbelief,\u201d said Carlos Morales, board president of Texas Nicaraguan Community, a nonprofit that helped the family raise money to repatriate Diaz's remains to Nicaragua.",
      "A coalition of groups and a Democratic congresswoman who represents El Paso have called for Camp East Montana to be closed.",

      "A witness has described guards pinning Lunas Campos to the ground in handcuffs, with one restraining him in a chokehold until he could no longer breathe. ICE has said the guards intervened to try to help Lunas Campos after he attempted suicide, and that he resisted them. A camp official initially told police it was a suicide.",
      "Lawyers for the family of Lunas Campos have asked a judge for an emergency order to prevent ICE from deporting detainees who witnessed the struggle.",
      "ICE, which oversees the camp, announced Diaz\u2019s death on Jan. 18, saying security staff \u201cfound Diaz unconscious and unresponsive in his room.\u201d The agency said he \u201cdied of a presumed suicide\u201d but that the cause was still under investigation.",
      "In addition to Lunas Campos and Diaz, ICE announced that on Dec. 3 an immigrant from Guatemala held in Camp East Montana died after being transferred to a El Paso hospital for care. The agency said Francisco Gaspar-Andres, 48, was suspected to have died of liver and kidney failure.",
      "Unlike with the two prior deaths, Diaz\u2019s body wasn\u2019t sent to the county medical examiner in El Paso for an autopsy. Kallinen said an Armed Forces pathologist conducted the autopsy at Fort Bliss, and that he's been told it could take months for findings to be released.",

      "The United States will allow Venezuela to sell oil that's currently under American sanctions and use the proceeds to pay for basic government services",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration soon will allow Venezuela to sell oil now subject to U.S. sanctions, with the revenue initially dedicated to basic government services such as policing and health care and subject to Washington's oversight, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday.",
      "The United States will retain control in the short term to ensure the oil revenue is used to stabilize Venezuela, Rubio said at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing.",
      "\u201cThe funds from that will be deposited into an account that we will have oversight over,\u201d Rubio said, adding that the U.S. Treasury would control the process. Venezuela, he said, \u201cwill spend that money for the benefit of the Venezuelan people.\u201d",
      "Rubio offered new insight into how the U.S. is planning to handle the sale of tens of millions of barrels of oil from Venezuela, which has the largest proven reserves of crude in the world, and oversee where the money flows. After the U.S. raid that captured then-President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro this month, the U.S. is working to influence the next steps in the South American country through its vast oil resources.",
      "The U.S. will not subsidize oil industry investments in Venezuela, Rubio said, and is only overseeing the sale of sanctioned petroleum as an \u201cinterim step.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is simply a way to divide revenue so that there isn\u2019t systemic collapse while we work through this recovery and transition,\u201d Rubio said.",
      "Democrats and some Republicans on the committee pressed Rubio for more details about Trump\u2019s plans for Venezuela\u2019s oil. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., asked for assurances from Rubio that the sale of Venezuelan oil will be fair and open, not rigged to benefit oil companies allied with Trump.",
      "\u201cYou are taking their oil at gunpoint, you are holding and selling that oil \u2026 you\u2019re deciding how and for what purposes that money is going to be used in a country of 30 million people,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI think a lot of us believe that that is destined for failure.\u201d",
      "Under Maduro, Rubio said Venezuela's oil industry benefited the country's corrupt leaders and countries such as China, which purchased Venezuelan oil at a discount. Now, Venezuela's interim leaders are assisting the U.S. in seizing illegal oil shipments, he said.",
      "The U.S. will give Venezuela's current leaders instructions on how the money can and cannot be spent and conduct audits to ensure it is used as intended, Rubio said. He said Venezuela could use the money to pay for policing or to buy medicine.",
      "The fund was initially set up in Qatar to avoid having the proceeds seized by American creditors and because of other legal complications that stem from the U.S. not considering Maduro\u2019s government legitimate, Rubio said.",

      "Manhattan prosecutors are urging a judge to set a July 1 trial date in Luigi Mangione\u2019s state murder case in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, two months before the slated start of jury selection in his federal death penalty case",
      "NEW YORK -- Manhattan prosecutors urged a judge on Wednesday to set a July trial date in Luigi Mangione \u2019s state murder case in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, two months before jury selection is set to begin in his federal death penalty case.",
      "In a letter, Assistant District Attorney Joel Seidemann asked Judge Gregory Carro to begin the New York trial on July 1, arguing that the state's interests \u201cwould be unfairly prejudiced by an unnecessary delay\u201d until after the federal trial. The state trial has not yet been scheduled and the next hearing isn't until May, when Carro is expected to rule on a defense request to exclude certain evidence.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office raised the scheduling issue days after U.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett said jury selection in the federal case will begin on Sept. 8, with the rest happening either in October or January, depending on whether she allows prosecutors to seek the death penalty.",
      "If the death penalty is still in play, the second phase of the federal trial \u2014 including opening statements and testimony \u2014 will begin Jan. 11, 2027, Garnett said at a hearing last Friday. If it\u2019s not, opening statements will be held Oct. 13. Capital cases are more complex and require more time to prepare.",
      "In his letter to Carro, Seidemann argued that state prosecutors were involved in the investigation from the start while federal prosecutors joined the case about two weeks after Thompson\u2019s death, charging Mangione a day after he was indicted in state court.",
      "\u201cIt is entirely natural then that the state case would proceed to trial prior to the federal case,\u201d the prosecutor wrote, citing legal precedent. The state, he said, \u201chas an overriding interest in trying this defendant for the cold-blooded execution of Brian Thompson.\u201d",
      "At the time of Mangione\u2019s arrest, Manhattan\u2019s top federal prosecutor had said he anticipated the state case would go to trial first.",
      "It isn't just a matter of scheduling. Under New York law, the district attorney\u2019s office would be barred from trying Mangione on state murder charges if his federal case goes to trial first. The state\u2019s double jeopardy protections kick in if a jury has been sworn in a prior prosecution, such as a federal case, or if that prosecution ends in a guilty plea.",
      "Mangione is due back in court in the federal case on Friday with Garnett set to rule soon on a variety of pretrial issues, including whether it remains a capital case and whether prosecutors will be permitted to show jurors some of evidence debated in the state case.",
      "Those items include a 9 mm handgun that prosecutors say matches the one used in the killing and a notebook in which they say he described his intent to \u201cwack\u201d a health insurance executive.",
      "Mangione has pleaded not guilty to federal and state murder charges; the state charges carry the possibility of life in prison. He is due back in court for a conference in the federal case on Friday.",

      "In September, Carro threw out state terrorism charges but kept the rest of the case \u2014 including an intentional murder charge \u2014 in place.",

Prosecutors say the search was legal. Officers were following Altoona police protocols, which require promptly searching a suspect's property for dangerous items, and later obtained a warrant, prosecutors said.",

      "The preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board provides details about the three hours that passed between the report of a gas odor and the thunderous blast in Bristol, just outside Philadelphia, as well as how utility workers were on the scene for much of that time. It also notes that a utility worker traced the leak to a valve in a meter set in the basement boiler room.",

      "As a continuation of President Donald Trump 's pitch to Americans on affordability and the economy under his administration, the U.S. Treasury and White House are celebrating the upcoming launch of a program they view as a key milestone: \u201cTrump Accounts.\u201d",
      "A provision of Trump's tax legislation, Trump Accounts are meant to give $1,000 to every newborn, so long as their parents open an account. That money is then invested in the stock market by private firms, and the child can access the money when they turn 18.",
      "A U.S. Treasury event Wednesday brings together an assortment of politicians and celebrities \u2014 from Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz to rapper Nicki Minaj \u2014 to discuss the program and its potential impact on the economy. Backers of Trump Accounts have said they're a way to help children from low-income households build wealth.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about Trump Accounts and how to claim them.",
      "It\u2019s a new savings tool where money is invested in the stock market on behalf of a child. The child can\u2019t access the money until they turn 18 and can only use it for specific purposes, such as paying tuition, starting a business or making a down payment on a home.",
      "After a parent opens an account, the U.S. Treasury will contribute $1,000 for newborns. Private banks and brokerages will manage the money, which must be invested in U.S. equity index funds that track the stock market and charge the accounts no more than 0.10% in annual fees.",
      "Parents can contribute up to $2,500 annually in pretax income, much like they do for retirement accounts. Parents\u2019 employers, relatives, friends, local governments and philanthropic groups can also pitch in. Yearly contributions are capped at $5,000, but contributions from governments and charities don\u2019t count toward that total.",
      "As part of the initiative\u2019s launch, parents of older children are also encouraged to open accounts, but they won\u2019t get the $1,000 bonus. That money is only reserved for babies born during the calendar years of the Trump administration.",
      "To qualify for the $1,000 seed money, a baby must be a U.S. citizen, have a Social Security number and be born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028. Any parent can open an account for a qualifying child, regardless of the parent\u2019s immigration status.",
      "It\u2019s important to note that the child won\u2019t be able to access the money until they turn 18, except in rare circumstances, so it can\u2019t help with immediate expenses. And disbursements from the accounts will be subject to taxes.",
      "Children born before 2025 won\u2019t qualify for the $1,000 incentive, but parents can still open accounts for them as long as they\u2019re under 18. Parents can still invest up to $2,500 pretax for those kids.",
      "In December, billionaires Michael and Susan Dell announced a $6.25 billion donation that will allow some children who are 10 and under to receive $250 in seed money if their parents open an account. That money is reserved for kids who live in ZIP codes with a median family income of $150,000 or less and who won\u2019t get the $1,000 seed money from the Treasury.",
      "A few weeks later, hedge fund founder Ray Dalio and his wife Barbara pledged $75 million for kids under 10 in Connecticut, where Dalio lives. That would amount to $250 for 300,000 children in qualifying ZIP codes. Those large contributions are part of an effort by the U.S. Treasury \u2014 dubbed the \u201c50 State Challenge\u201d by Secretary Scott Bessent \u2014 to encourage wealthy philanthropic donors to pitch in.",

Parents can fill out the form when filing taxes this year or when the administration opens an online portal this summer, according to the Trump Accounts website.",
      "Registering for a Trump Account is required for a child to receive the money. In May, parents who sign up will get information about how to finish opening the accounts.",
      "Backers of the accounts say they want to introduce more people to the stock market and give even children born into poverty a chance to benefit from it. Supporters also say the accounts bolster capitalism at a time when openly socialist candidates are growing more popular.",
      "About 58% of U.S. households held stocks or bonds in 2022, according to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, though the wealthiest 1% owned almost half the value of stocks in that same year.",
      "Before Trump created the accounts, California, Connecticut and the District of Columbia were piloting \u201cbaby bonds\u201d programs that are similar to Trump Accounts in some ways. Several other states, including Maryland, are weighing programs.",
      "But those programs are targeted for youth growing up in poverty or foster care, plus children who lost a parent to COVID-19. Wealthier children don\u2019t benefit. They\u2019re also managed by the state, not private investment firms.",
      "Critics point out the accounts do little to help children in their early years, when they\u2019re most vulnerable and most likely to be in poverty. The accounts, they say, also fail to offset cuts the Trump administration and congressional Republicans have made to other programs that benefit young people and their families, including food assistance and Medicaid. Republicans created the accounts in the same Trump tax bill that reduced spending for some of those programs.",
      "And even with the contribution from the government, critics say the Trump Accounts will widen the wealth gap. Affluent families that can afford to make the maximum pretax contribution to the accounts will realize the greatest benefits. Poor families who can\u2019t afford to set aside money for the accounts will benefit the least. Assuming a 7% return, the $1,000 in seed money would grow to roughly $3,570 over 18 years.",

      "CHURCH MEMBER:\u00a0 My pastor just came out of the house, and he's really, really upset and he told me to call the cops. He thinks his wife's dead \u2026",

      "CHURCH MEMBER:\u00a0 His name is Mark Lewis.",

      "Captain Jackson Harris reviewed the case with \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: He cut her down \u2026 tried to find any signs of life. \u2026 There were not any signs of life that were there, unfortunately.",
      "A bathrobe sash had been the noose. The deputy's report said, \"he did not observe any signs of a struggle.\" There was an open suitcase and a note.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: I believe the note said, take care of the dogs.",
      "Had Joanna taken her own life? Mark Lewis, the 36-year-old pastor of The Fellowship Baptist Church, was handcuffed, placed in the back of a patrol car, and briefly questioned.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: He provided a statement.",
      "He said his wife \"did not appear to be depressed,\" \"has no history of mental illness\" and \"has never attempted suicide.\"",
      "Natalie Morales | \"48 Hours\" correspondent: The husband is saying \u2026 my wife did this out of the blue. ...",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: That \u2014  that was his statement that he provided \u2026 people commit suicide for a variety of reasons. Some people keep it to themselves \u2026 some people tell the world.",
      "In the report, Lewis said he last saw his wife at 1 p.m. And the church member who called 911, said he and Mark had been outside the house playing basketball and talking about their faith starting at 3 p.m., until Mark went inside and found Joanna dead.",
      "Joanna's mother, Patricia Hunter, knew nothing of what was unfolding at her daughter's house that night. She wasn't called. A day later, a deacon from the church, went to see her.",
      "Patricia Hunter: He said, \"Joanna is dead.\" \u2026 What?",
      "At around the same time, Joe, a Sacramento, California, firefighter, was taken aside by the captain of his firehouse.",
      "Joe Hunter: He said, \"your sister's gone.\"",
      "First, the gut punch.",
      "Joe Hunter: \u00a0I dropped to my knees.",

      "Patricia Hunter: What did he do to her?",
      "Joe Hunter: I knew. I knew he did it.",
      "Patricia Hunter: And I fell to the ground screaming, crying.",
      "Joe Hunter: Half of me died right there.",
      "A few weeks later when Patricia and her late husband spoke to an officer, he showed her the note.",
      "Patricia Hunter: I actually laughed. And I said, \"That's not a suicide note.\" \u2026 She was leaving him. And that was her note to him, take care of the dogs. I can't take them.",
      "A HISTORY OF ABUSE AND RESTRAINING ORDERS",
      "Joanna had tried to leave Lewis many times before, says Patricia. There was a history of abuse and a cycle that began not long after the couple started seeing each other in high school. At 17, Patricia says, Joanna came home with a black eye.",
      "Patricia Hunter: And I begged her. I said, let's go to the hospital. Let's go to the police \u2026 and she said, \"no, mom, no.\"",
      "At 20, Joanna documented Lewis \"choking\" her and got a restraining order against him. Even so, Joanna returned to him.",
      "At 21, after she reported that Lewis \"grabbed my neck and twisted it,\" Joanna got another restraining order.",
      "In 1996, when she was 22, Joanna was hospitalized with a sprained neck. Mark Lewis was convicted on a domestic violence charge and according to court documents, sentenced to 36 months in the Solano County Jail.",
      "Again, she returned to the relationship.",
      "Patricia Hunter: She told me that he had reached out to her from jail \u2026 Would she come visit him? She did. She fell right back into it.",
      "Joanna was 25 when she married Lewis without telling anyone in her family.",
      "Patricia Hunter: I had to tell my husband, and we just held each other and sobbed because we knew now it would be that much harder to help her and get her out.",
      "Their worry continued over the next decade, but Joanna wouldn't open up to them.",
      "Natalie Morales: You said you feared for your daughter, but did you ever think he would be capable of killing her?",
      "Patricia Hunter: Absolutely.",
      "That is what Patricia believed. Law enforcement at the scene came to the opposite conclusion.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: There is no evidence on her body that another person used force to have killed her.",
      "No homicide investigators were called to the house, the bedroom was not treated as a crime scene, no fingerprints taken, no DNA tested and no phones collected.",
      "After his statement, Mark Lewis was released. Lewis was not asked about his history of abuse or about his prior conviction.",
      "That information was more than 15 years old, says Harris, and not available to the deputy in the field.",
      "The next day, an external autopsy determined the ligature marks on Joanna's neck were consistent with suicide.",
      "A month later, when the toxicology report came back clean, the case was closed. And so began the tug-of-war between the family and the sheriff's department that would go on for years to come.",
      "Patricia Hunter: From this moment, when we couldn't get anyone to listen to us and act on it, we are going to work to get justice for Joanna.",
      "Natalie Morales: Do you think she was ever suicidal?",
      "Joe Hunter: You know \u2026 I'm sure she got in many dark places, but in no way, shape, or form, was she capable of that mindset because I know my sister deep down just wanted to leave.",
      "And in the year before she died, Joanna almost saved herself, says Joe. Almost.",
      "Joe Hunter: My mom called me and said, \"Joanna's coming home.\" I said, \"Oh, really?\" \"Yeah, she's done.\" And I said, \"she's really, really done this time?\" \u2026 And I thought, man, like we got her back. We win.",
      "Patricia Hunter: Within two weeks, mom, I \u2014 I'm going back. And I thought she meant to get more things. \u2026 And she said, no, mom, I have to go back to stay.",
      "Joe Hunter: My mom begged her not to go back. \u2026 on her knees, begging her. \u2026 And my mom said, OK, well, I'll drive you.",
      "Natalie Morales: How much do you think of that moment and that drive, taking her back?",
      "Patricia Hunter: All the time.",
      "Patricia Hunter: On the way over \u2026 I was sobbing and I said, honey \u2026 I'm afraid if you go back, I'll never see you again.",
      "Joe Hunter: And we never saw her again.",
      "A FAMILY'S ANGUISH",
      "Joe Hunter: Joanna \u2026 was the perfect person. \u2026 She was the life of the party, but she was also at the same time \u2026 probably the most compassionate, warm person I've ever known.",
      "From the minute he was born, Joanna relished being Joe's big sister.",
      "Patricia Hunter: She thought Joseph was her gift. \u2026 Someone gave her this adorable little boy and he belonged to her.",
      "Joe Hunter: I always tried to be in charge, but she wouldn't let that happen. \u2026 Anybody that called the house \u2026 they had to go through Joanna first. \u2026 \"and you wanna talk to my brother? Why?\" (laughs) \u2026 She protected me a lot. \u2026 we were the perfect team.",
      "Mark Lewis, the son of a local preacher, was Joanna's first boyfriend. At the start, Joe didn't think he had anything to worry about.",
      "Joe Hunter: The first, maybe six to eight months, she seemed really happy.",
      "But after the abuse began, Joe confronted Mark more than once.",
      "Joe Hunter: After physically going after him \u2026 him then taking it out on her. \u2026 I had to back off a little bit from my sister. \u2026 I had been screaming at her for so long, two years straight. \u2026 I hate this guy, leave this guy, please stop. \u2026 I thought I'm gonna lose her for good. \u2026 So, I'm just gonna listen. \u2026 And then I really got the deep, deep, deep, dark secrets that she wasn't even telling my parents.",
      "And Joanna showed him her wounds.",
      "Joe Hunter: She finally showed me \u2026 the massive indentations from him strangling her \u2026 you could just see clearly each outline of each finger.",
      "Mark Lewis had grown more powerful and influential at the Fellowship Baptist Church. He was on his way to becoming pastor.",
      "After they married, Patricia says she went to Lewis with her fears.",
      "Patricia Hunter: And I said to him \u2026 how do I know in this moment that you will never lay a hand on her again? \u2026 And I'll never forget. He kind of sneered, half smile and he looked at me and said, when she's a better woman and a better Christian, you won't have to worry about that.",
      "Joe Hunter: My sister started saying comments that he would make to her like, hey, we can help save you. Because you're half black, we can help fix that through religion. Because of your hair and the way you look, we can fix that with religion. \u2026 And you just think, how dare you?",
      "Pastor Lewis, to hear former church members tell it, was a commanding and a demanding presence with fiery sermons and an insistence on loyalty.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: Very energetic, get up there and screaming and sweating \u2026 that was his style.",
      "Jacob Cantrell become a deacon there.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: I looked up to him \u2026 he was a \u2026 mentor \u2026 only to find out that I was a pawn.",
      "In hindsight, Cantrell says, Pastor Lewis had too much control over him.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: I couldn't go to my mom and dad's house \u2026 without asking Mark permission. \u2026 I was brainwashed. \u2026 he manipulated me for many years and it \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it twisted my brain up.",
      "MARK LEWIS (preaching in church): There's no accidents with God.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: He can talk his way out of anything including Miss Joanna's death.",
      "Natalie Morales: Now, you feel that way?",
      "Jacob Cantrell: Now, I feel that way.",
      "Daryl Snedeker: I came to the conclusion that it was probably the closest thing to a cult that I had ever experienced.",
      "Natalie Morales: And he was the leader \u2026",
      "Daryl Snedeker: The leader.",
      "Daryl Snedaker was a deputy in the Solano County Sheriff's Office and a member of the church at the time of Joanna's death. He wasn't involved in the investigation back then. At the church, he says, it didn't take long for him to lose all faith in the place and the pastor.",
      "Natalie Morales: Was there a fear then amongst the people who attended the church, did they fear Mark Lewis?",
      "Daryl Snedeker: I think the people that were his puppets, I think they acted out of fear a lot.",
      "Natalie Morales: You did whatever he asked then?",
      "Jacob Cantrell: Unfortunately. \u2026 You don't question him.",
      "MARK LEWIS (preaching in church): \u00a0It's important that you listen up!",
      "MARK LEWIS (preaching in church): What would you do if you caused your pastor to quit cause you wouldn't obey? What would you do if you caused your Sunday School teacher to quit cause you wouldn't obey?",
      "Daryl Snedeker: It's disheartening. It's shocking.",
      "Joe already knew\u00a0 Lewis all too well and the years after Joanna's death were filled with anguish and frustration.",
      "Joe Hunter: No one was listening to us, no one was believing this.",
      "There were still so many questions about what happened that night. Why didn't Lewis cut Joanna down or try to administer CPR? And Joe found it particularly hard to believe Lewis was actually playing basketball for six straight hours.",
      "Joe Hunter: You never went inside to use the restroom, get a glass of water \u2026 playing basketball for this obscene amount of time \u2026 is absurd to me.",
      "But all their attempts to get the sheriff's office to take another look at Lewis were getting no results \u2014 until Patricia got a knock on the door.",
      "Patricia Hunter: It was \u2026 a reporter asking if we had heard about what had happened with him. I had no idea what he was talking about.",
      "It was 2014. Joanna had been dead a little more than two years. Pastor Mark Lewis had been arrested \u2014 accused of violence against another woman.",
      "Natalie Morales: Do you feel lucky to be alive?",
      "Sarah Nottingham: Oh yeah.",
      "SARAH NOTTINGHAM'S HARROWING NIGHT",
      "On that crisp fall day in 2011 when Pastor Mark Lewis said he found his wife dead, he never called Joanna's family. He did call Sarah Nottingham.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: He had asked if I heard what happened, he sounded upset. He was crying.",
      "At the time, Nottingham says, she believed in her pastor \u2014 Joanna had died by suicide. Sarah says she and Lewis became friends, then began dating about a year after Joanna's death.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: At first, it was somewhat exciting thinking that \u2026 I'm seeing a side of this person that no one else is seeing.",
      "Eventually, Nottingham says another side of Mark Lewis began to emerge.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: A lot of ... extreme manipulation, a lot of gaslighting, and a lot of verbal abuse, um, some physical. ... A push or a shove. ... And it was just more and more.",
      "And then, she says, she discovered that Lewis had been sending inappropriate text messages to an underage girl.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: You know, I'm just like, I've had enough, like, I'm done. And he said, I'm not ready for it to be over. \u2026 I would just keep telling him, you know, this is, it's over, we're done.",
      "Lewis grabbed her, she says, and tightly wrapped his arms around her.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: It was meant to be threatening. He squeezed me tight and told me, \"You've created a monster.\"",
      "Nottingham and her two young children were living with her parents in Vacaville as the pastor's threats, she says, became more frequent and frightening.",
      "Sarah Nottingham (outside her former home): The first time ... my car was vandalized, it was actually parked here (pointing at the driveway).",
      "Sarah Nottingham: He had, either himself or had somebody, smash my windshield in on my car.",
      "Nottingham was granted an order of protection against Lewis. But it did not stop what happened next in the early morning hours of Jan. 9, 2014.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: It was three something in the morning. And I woke up to our um fire alarm going off \u2026 and there was um smoke filling the hallway. And I checked on my kids.",
      "A Molotov cocktail had crashed through her parents' bedroom window.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: We were able to put the fire out ourselves. \u2026 I had never seen my dad run so fast out the door, trying to see if he could see anybody.",
      "Vacaville Police pulled over a U-Haul van within minutes, arresting the driver and two passengers. The trio quickly confessed, telling police they were hired to firebomb Sarah Nottingham's house \u2014 hired by the pastor, Mark Lewis. He was questioned by local reporters.",
      "MARK LEWIS (KVOR news report): I never\u00a0\u2014\u00a0I never gave them any money to do anything bad.",
      "Lewis was arrested, charged with arson, conspiracy, and stalking.",
      "MARK LEWIS (KVOR news report): A lot of people are going to \u2026 throw accusations out there. But until the facts come out, why don't we just wait and see how that goes and let the court decide.",
      "SARAH NOTTINGHAM (KOVR news report): I'm living in a nightmare. My kids are so scared. My\u00a0\u2014\u00a0my son knows that this is, this is a pastor, his previous pastor that is threatening his mommy and his family.",
      "Natalie Morales: What do you think you and your family survived at that time?",
      "Sarah Nottingham: Ultimately, death. \u2026 When the police came into the house, one of them said this is attempted murder and that's exactly what it was, nothing less.",
      "Surviving the attack, Nottingham says, helped answer a lingering question about Joanna.",
      "Natalie Morales: How do you see her death?",
      "Sarah Nottingham: By him. \u2026 There's just not a doubt in my mind.",
      "By January 2015, Lewis' thundering sermons that echoed in the Fellowship Baptist Church were a distant memory as he sat silently in a Solano County courtroom. Lewis' trial had begun for stalking Sarah Nottingham and hiring people to firebomb her parents' home.",
      "Joe Hunter: I hear about the arson charge. I hear about the stalking. \u2026 But I also feel that he needs to be convicted \u2026 for what he did to my sister.",
      "On day three of Lewis' arson and stalking trial, he changed his plea from not guilty to no contest \u2014 meaning he would not dispute the charges against him but also would not acknowledge guilt. Lewis was sentenced to eight years in prison.",
      "Natalie Morales: How important was that development then in allowing you to then go back to the sheriff's office and demand that they reopen the case?",
      "Patricia Hunter: It was huge, because there was \u2014   it isn't often that you read about a pastor hiring people to firebomb someone's house. ... Because of media pressure, we felt that now is the time where we can go back and say, \"Look at Joanna's case. Reopen it.\"",
      "The Solano County Sheriff's Office did reopen the case in 2014. Remember the churchgoer who called 911 the night Joanna died? His name is Andrew Alvarado. Back then he told authorities that he had played basketball with Pastor Mark Lewis for about six hours. Detectives decided to reinterview him and recorded the call.",
      "DETECTIVE MEHL (phone call): Was anyone else playing basketball with you?",
      "ANDREW ALVARADO: Yeah, a couple other \u2026 teenagers.",
      "This time, investigators learned a new detail.",
      "ANDREW ALVARADO (phone call): I left to go drop them off. I guess I had to go eat dinner or whatever.",
      "He had actually left the church grounds during those six hours to drive the teenagers home, he says, and wasn't sure what the pastor was doing while he was gone. \"48 Hours\" repeatedly reached out to Alvarado but never heard back.",
      "Natalie Morales: So there were gaps of time when he was not with Mark Lewis.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: Right. \u2026 That still does not change the fact that \u2026 the lack of evidence on her body does not show a second person involved in her death.",
      "Mark Lewis was not questioned during the reinvestigation.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: He ... \u2026 exercised his constitutional right to have his attorney, who did not allow him to speak to us.",
      "The sheriff's office had another forensic pathologist look at Joanna's case. Dr. Scott Luzi agreed with the original coroner: suicide. The case was closed again. And then in 2015, the county district attorney's office announced its own investigation, which included DNA testing on Joanna's bathrobe sash. The results? Her DNA was found on the sash along with an unknown male \u2014  not Mark Lewis.",
      "Natalie Morales: Was anything done to investigate that further, to \u2026 could it have been anybody else associated with Mark Lewis?",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: That DNA that was collected from there, my understanding is that it was entered into the DNA \u2014 I believe it's called CODIS, the database.",
      "CODIS is the FBI's criminal DNA database.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: It did not come up with a hit.",
      "Captain Harris says the anonymous male DNA has never been identified.",
      "Daryl Snedeker: They should find out whose DNA is on that damn \u2014 on that \u2014 on that robe.",
      "Daryl Snedeker, former church member and retired Solano County deputy sheriff, says things were missed.",
      "Daryl Snedeker:\u00a0Based on what I know today, the totality of the circumstances ... \u2026 I think they did fail that family. And I think if they didn't follow up and find out whose male DNA is on that night robe, that's a catastrophic failure right there.",
      "And a team of experts was about to come forward for the Hunter family, offering help and hope.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: This is a homicide. There is no question.",
      "QUESTIONING THE INVESTIGATION",
      "Dr. Bill Smock is sure that Joanna Hunter was murdered and says he can prove it.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: Every injury will tell you a story if you take the time to analyze it.",
      "In 2023, Smock was hired by the Solano County Sheriff's Department to look at the case. He is a medical doctor, who, by his count, has reviewed thousands of autopsies and examined forensic evidence for police departments across the country.",
      "Smock also has been an expert witness in high profile cases \u2014 including testifying against Derek Chauvin in the 2021 George Floyd murder trial.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: What I've spent 40 years doing is analyzing injuries, reconstructing how injuries occur.",
      "And where the Solano County Sheriff's Department saw a bathrobe sash, a note and a suicide, Smock saw something else: something new.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: There was a braided nylon marine rope three feet from Joanna. \u2026 The murder weapon was there in the room with Joanna. \u2026 When you look at the photos of the mark that was created on her neck, the only thing in that closet that could have created that was the marine rope.",
      "But because he was required to sign a non-disclosure agreement, no one outside the sheriff's office saw Smock's report.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: I could not talk to the family \u2026 I could only talk to the lieutenant at Solano County regarding my findings.",
      "Here was everything the Hunters had been looking for ... but they did not even know the rope existed. Or how Smock made his determination. Smock was eventually released from the NDA and was able to show \"48 Hours\" using mannequins and red paint.",
      "Smock says Joanna's neck had two different ligature marks \u2014  one is from the sash and one is from the marine rope.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: We're gonna apply the rope \u2026 and see what type of imprint it creates. \u2026 You'll notice along the edge that there's a distinct fabric imprint, which is the type of fabric imprint we saw on Joanna's neck.",
      "Bill Smock: She was dead \u2014",
      "Natalie Morales:\u00a0 When the bathrobe \u2014",
      "Bill Smock: \u2014 when the bathrobe sash was applied to her neck.",
      "Bill Smock: Joanna's scene was staged. She was killed with a rope, and then to make it look like a suicide, she was hung up by the bathrobe sash after she was already dead.",
      "Casey Gwynn: Domestic violence homicides are the number one staged murders in America.",
      "Casey Gwinn was sure Joanna's case was what he calls a hidden homicide. He and Gael Strack are the co-founders of\u00a0Alliance for HOPE International, an advocacy group for survivors of domestic violence and their families.",
      "Casey Gwynn: If you kill a total stranger \u2026 Nobody knows who you are \u2026 but if you kill your wife or you kill your girlfriend, everybody is gonna be looking at you as a suspect. \u2026 You have to make it look like something else.",
      "When they took up the Hunters' cause, they believed that Joanna's history of neck injuries told them they were looking at a strangulation.",
      "Casey Gwynn: The fact is that if you strangle a woman one time in an intimate relationship, she's 750 percent more likely to be killed by you.",
      "Smock, who works for Alliance for HOPE, confirmed their suspicion.",
      "But when the sheriff's office agreed to hire Smock, it also commissioned another review. This one by Dr. Brian Peterson, a pathologist and former president of the National Association of Medical Examiners. He disputed Smock's findings.",
      "\"I see neither injuries nor toxicology findings that would support the physical involvement of another person,\" the report said.",
      "And after hiring Smock \u2014",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: Especially in hindsight, I completely disagree with qualifications.",
      "\u2014  the sheriff's office took issue with the fact that Smock is not a forensic pathologist.",
      "Harris also took issue with Smock's methods.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: This is not someone who has their body weight hanging \u2026 This is simply draped over a mannequin. That is not how she was killed.",
      "Smock sent \"48 Hours\" his contract with the sheriff's office, which requested his \"opinion as to the cause and manner of her death.\" \u00a0He also told us the sheriff's position was \"disingenuous\" \u2026 \u00a0because \"I didn't agree with what they wanted me to say.\"",
      "Natalie Morales: So, Bill Smock's report, are you completely discounting everything that he reports in it?",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: I'm \u2014 I'm disputing his conclusion that it was a homicide.",
      "And so, what Dr. Smock called the murder weapon was never examined.",
      "Natalie Morales: But where is the rope?",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: I don't have the rope. I don't know. \u2026 We also don't have \u2014",
      "Natalie Morales: It wasn't tested.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris:\u00a0 \u2014  \u00a0every electrical cord that was there. We didn't go through the garage to look for absolutely everything. ...",
      "Natalie Morales: What was missed? What about the history of domestic abuse, was that missed?",

      "Lauren Hutton was told again and again in the 1960s that she wasn't cut out to be a model. She recalled being told, \"'You've got that space between your teeth, your eyes are crossed a lotta the times. I had improper \u2026 everything.'\"",
      "While the gap in her teeth was sometimes visible, in the beginning she was discouraged from showing it. \"I had to buy a little $300 plastic thing that went there, that I would sneeze out and lose,\" she said.",
      "She still owns the record for most cover appearances on American Vogue: 26. And at 82, she still has that smile.",
      "Asked how she feels having been the first supermodel, Hutton said, \"Yeah, certainly, if it was about money. And I changed the whole money system.\"",
      "In 1973, Revlon signed her to an exclusive deal for a quarter of a million dollars a year, then the biggest contract in modeling history.",
      "Coming from college in New Orleans, she saw New York as a gateway to the world and to the wild places she wanted to visit. Ask her about modeling, and somehow you'll almost always end up in Africa: \"I lived with pygmies, and I lived with Karamojong, and I lived with Kalahari bushmen,\" she said. \"You're constantly excited. You're constantly thrilled. And everything's beautiful. My life was none of this stuff. My life was traveling. That's the only reason I came to New York.\"",
      "\"You never really wanted to be a model?\" I asked.",
      "\"Never heard of it!\"",
      "\"In so many ways, it was all an accident.\"",
      "\"Amen! Amen!\" Hutton replied. \"I've always been lucky. I was born lucky.\"",
      "A \"believable\" beauty",
      "She was born Mary Laurence Hutton in Charleston, South Carolina, during World War II. Her dad was an Army pilot overseas: \"He wrote me every single day from the war. And my mother, very kindly and beautifully, put it into books for me.\"",
      "Her parents split in 1945. Lauren grew up in Florida with an abusive stepfather. So, she treasured her father's letters: \"'Cause I wanted my daddy bad,\" she said.",
      "But she never met him. \"No. No. But he gave me a love, enough love in those letters that held me all this time, and made me love men!\" she laughed.",
      "Hutton made her screen debut in 1963 as a decoy contestant on the TV game show \"To Tell the Truth,\" while working as a \"Bunny\" at the Playboy Club in New York City. But at the beginning she was turned down by five modeling agencies.",
      "Eileen Ford, who'd call Hutton a \"believable\" beauty, finally gave her a shot, later admitting, \"I still don't know what made me take her.\"",
      "Hutton was sent to see the legendary editor of Vogue, Diana Vreeland, a meeting Hutton described as \"heaven.\" \"And she said, 'You!' And I looked, and she had pointed this long, beautiful finger at me. And she said, 'You have quite a presence.' I had no idea what that was. What was a presence? But I took a chance, and I said, 'Well, you sure do!'\"",
      "Vreeland quickly connected her with one of Vogue's top photographers, Richard Avedon. \"And he made wonderful \u2013 they're still some of the best pictures I ever took,\" Hutton said.",
      "Avedon and Hutton became frequent collaborators. Soon she was the hottest model in the country, and a household name. Artist Robert Rauschenberg, a friend and neighbor, created a collage portrait of her. Hutton landed film roles, too, in \"Paper Lion\" with Alan Alda; \"The Gambler\" with James Caan; and \"American Gigolo\" with Richard Gere.",
      "I asked, \"For someone who didn't want to be a model, or an actress, you turn out to be really good at it. And you seem to not only understand how to do it, but you seemed to figure out the economics of it?\"",
      "\"Twice. I did that twice,\" Hutton said. \"'Cause Bob lost all the first bunch.\"",
      "\"Bob\" was Bob Williamson, for nearly three decades her boyfriend, father figure, and financial manager. Hutton said, \"You'd hear all those girls say, 'Well, my sweetheart's in high finance. What is yours in?' I'd say, 'Low finance.' And I was right!\"",
      "They travelled the world together, until she discovered he'd lost nearly $13 million of her money. \"Bob was very, very smart about all kinds of stuff,\" she said.",
      "\"But he also lost all your money?\"",
      "\"Yeah. But you know what? I'd do it again in a second,\" Hutton said.",
      "She went back to fashion and earned her fortune all over again. \"I just kept on plugging at it,\" she said.",
      "Resilience is a recurring theme in Hutton's life. In 2000, a motorcycle accident knocked her 20 feet into the air: \"I can remember every second of it, and it was really sort of rapturous.\"",
      "She'd been riding to Las Vegas with a group of friends that included Jeremy Irons and Dennis Hopper, and was badly hurt: \"Oh, I was dead, and I wasn't breathing at all. Those boys saved me. My gang, my guys saved my life. My wingmen! Don't make me start crying!\"",
      "But the cover girl came back from that, too.",
      "Lauren Hutton has never regretted an adventure. \"I was not there to see myself on the stands,\" she said. \"I was there to get the money to go see the world. I've had a great life. I've been very lucky.\"",

    "summary": "In her choice of media, sculptor Ruth Asawa (1926-2013) employed a resourcefulness that stemmed from her early years on a farm \u2013 and in a WWII detention camp for Japanese Americans. She's now the subject of a retrospective at New York's Museum of Modern Art.",
    "story": [
      "Artist Ruth Asawa's San Francisco Fountain, in the city's Union Square, is an endless treasure trove of Bay Area knowledge. \"Some people refer to it as sort of a Where's Waldo?, because there are so many things to find,\" said her son, Paul Lanier. \"You can find Willie Mays, the San Francisco Giants, the opera, city hall, the library.\"",
      "It's just one of Asawa's eleven public works in the city, and a reminder to Paul Lanier and his sister, Addie Lanier \u2013 the youngest of her six children \u2013 of their mother's commitment to community, and her ability to make art out of anything. \"She said that she would be fulfilled making something out of mud and paper, because it's the process that is the important thing for the artist,\" said Addie.",
      "Asawa, who would have turned 100 this year, is best known for her looped wire structures, a continuous line of wire bent and woven to create a free-hanging sculpture. Addie said, \"The media that she worked in is very economical. It's industrial wire. It's like the baling wire that you would find on a farm.\"",
      "Asawa learned to be resourceful from a young age, finding materials everywhere. Her media ranged from baker's clay in the kitchen, to recycled paper.",
      "Asked what she was like as a mom, Paul replied, \"Well, she's just like your mom, or anyone's mom, making lunches and breakfast, getting people out of the house.\"",
      "\"But she used blow torches on the front deck!\" laughed Addie.",
      "Asawa spent her early years on a farm in Southern California, working alongside her parents. Her childhood was cut short during World War II when she (along with other Japanese-Americans) was sent to a detention camp \u2013 incarcerated along with more than 120,000 people of Japanese descent under Executive Order 9066.",
      "There, in the face of incredible adversity, she first learned to draw. Cara Manes, the curator of a Ruth Asawa retrospective now on view at New York's Museum of Modern Art, said Asawa attended \"grassroots drawing lessons that were led by fellow detainees who were animators for the Disney Studios.\"",
      "After the war, Asawa landed at North Carolina's famed arts school Black Mountain College, where she honed her skills with mentors like German-born artist Josef Albers and choreographer Merce Cunningham.",
      ", Her dynamic sculptures appear to have a life of their own. \"They're really animated,\" said Manes, \"and they change as you move around them.\"",
      "A special aspect of Asawa's work is its unpredictable rhythm. Manes said, \"Sometimes by looking at the shadow cast by a given sculpture, you can understand how many layers of wire mesh there is, you know, in a way that you might not be able to discern from head-on.\"",
      "Everyone could become art in Asawa's home, according to her children. Paul said, \"If someone came over she would say, 'You have such a nice face. Can I cast it?' And so they would say yes. They didn't know what they were agreeing to!\"",
      "\"But she could get away with it,\" Addie said. \"She could do this with total strangers.\"",
      "While her works fetch millions at auction now, Asawa didn't find much commercial success during her lifetime. But that wasn't her purpose, say her children.",
      "Asked what she hopes people discover from her mother's work, Addie replied, \"I think people breathe. I think people take a big, deep breath and go, 'Oh my God.' I think it's, like, wonder and awe to see that something like this exists, that was made by hand. It's kind of the experiment of what one person can do. You are that experiment. Go forth.

    "story": [
      "The National Hockey League has a new fan base: Enthusiasts of \"Heated Rivalry,\" the hit HBO show that debuted on the streaming platform in November.",
      "The show \u2014 based on a series of books,\"Game Changers,\" by Rachel Reid \u2014 is only loosely based on hockey, and features more romance between two professional hockey stars on rival teams than slick moves on the ice. Yet SeatGeek data suggests that Heated Rivalry, which stars Hudson Williams and Connor Storrie, has driven a \"noticeable spike\" in demand for NHL tickets and revenue for the league, according to the ticket seller.",
      "The mobile ticketing company said it saw weekly hockey ticket sales rise more than 20% after the show first aired.",
      "\"When HBO released 'Heated Rivalry' earlier this winter, the series didn't just light up social media feeds, it may have sent fans straight to hockey games themselves,\" SeatGeek\u00a0said in an analysis of ticket sales through its platform.",
      "There was no similar surge in demand during the same period a year ago.",
      "\"In short, the strong lift seen so far this year did not exist during the same stretch last season, which could suggest that something beyond normal NHL demand patterns may be at play,\" SeatGeek added.",
      "SeatGeek also saw a rise in both single-ticket sales among fans attending games on their own, plus stronger demand from first-time game attendees.",
      "\"'Heated Rivalry' has certainly piqued interest in hockey and the NHL,\" SeatGeek marketing director Chris Leyden said in a statement. \"We are seeing it both in terms of more people on SeatGeek shopping for NHL tickets, as well as a pretty notable increase in single ticket buyers as more people check out a game, often for the first time ever.\"",

    "title": "Bessent touts Trump Accounts as rainy day fund, slams critics as \"out of touch\"",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-accounts-scott-bessent-treasury-secretary/",
    "published": "Wed, 28 Jan 2026 18:42:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized the benefits of Trump Accounts and addressed affordability concerns in an interview with CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday touted the benefits of the Trump administration's new savings program for U.S. children, telling \"CBS Saturday Morning\" co-host Kelly O'Grady that the \"Trump Accounts\" could serve as \"a rainy day fund\" when those kids reach adulthood.",
      "The program, created under the Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill\" tax and spending law, calls for the federal government to start tax-preferred investment accounts for about 25 million children born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028. The U.S. will seed each account with $1,000, which will be invested in the stock market.",
      "\"You got $1,000 coming from the government that's going to be invested into an index fund,\" Bessent said, adding that \"even if your child doesn't get $1,000 from the government, you can contribute \u2026in tax free. And we're going to have employers who are contributing.\"",
      "Philanthropists Michael and Susan Dell have pledged to contribute $250 per child to many of the new accounts, while companies including Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase announced Wednesday that they'll also chip in $1,000 to accounts opened by the financial giants' employees.",
      "\"So many Americans couldn't even [handle a] $500 emergency,\" Bessent told O'Grady. \"So maybe people just put it away and it's a rainy day fund. You know, it can be a component\" of a bigger purchase or investment.",
      "The accounts will remain invested for children until they turn 18, when they can tap the money to pay for qualified expenses, such as education, buying a home or starting a business.",
      "Bessent said the accounts, which are limited to contributions of $5,000 per year per child, have drawn 600,000 signups this week alone. Families with children under 18 may also open accounts, although they won't get the seed money from the federal government.",
      "Closing the wealth gap?",
      "Trump Accounts have raised some concerns that they could widen the U.S. wealth gap\u00a0 \u2014 which recently hit an all-time high \u2014 because higher-income families could stash the maximum of $5,000 per year in a child's account, while lower-income households might struggle to contribute funds.",
      "Bessent rejects such criticism, noting that the Dells' $6.2 billion contribution won't include the wealthiest 20% of U.S. zip codes.",
      "\"It shows how out of touch anyone who says that is, because if they say only $5,000, these are families \u2014 a huge number of families in America \u2014 wouldn't have $500 [for] a medical emergency. So how can they say only $5,000? What the hell are they talking about? It doesn't make any sense. It's just because President Trump has sponsored it, they don't agree with it.\"",
      "Bessent added that philanthropists who want to donate funds for a Trump Account can direct the money to lower-income parts of the U.S. \"They can choose by zip codes. They can choose by school district. They can do it by economic quintiles,\" he said.",
      "The accounts are likely to also help educate Americans about investing, especially the 38% of households that don't own stocks, Bessent added, noting the importance of financial literacy.",
      "\"For many Americans ...\u00a0 Wall Street is this abstract notion,\" Bessent told O'Grady. \"All of a sudden they have participated for 18 years in the financial markets. So it's a constant financial education.\"",
      "Addressing affordability",
      "Asked about affordability issues that many Americans say they are facing, Bessent blamed the Biden administration for driving up inflation. He also credits President Trump for boosting wage growth, pushing down prescription drug costs and introducing tax cuts through the \"big beautiful\" bill.",
      "\"What we're trying to do, we're trying to control costs,\" Bessent said. \"I think inflation is going to be back toward the Fed target of 2%.\"",
      "Many Americans have negative views about the cost of living in the U.S., according to a December CBS News poll.",
      "The Trump administration has introduced a flurry of proposals in recent weeks, in addition to the Trump Accounts, aimed at easing affordability pressures. They include promises to cap credit card interest rates at 10% and ban institutional investors from buying single-family homes.",
      "Experts, however, have questioned whether these proposals will achieve their intended objectives.",
      "Demanding Fed \"accountability\"",
      "Bessent also touched on the independence of the Federal Reserve and defended the Department of Justice's ongoing investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, dismissing concerns that the probe could weaken the central bank's traditional independence.",
      "\"I think that the message is that independence does not mean no accountability,\" Bessent said. \"I've been calling for the Fed to do an internal investigation on numerous things since last spring, and they've chosen not to do it.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Justice Department served the central bank with grand jury subpoenas tied to a criminal investigation into Powell's June 2025 testimony before a Senate committee regarding a project to renovate several Fed buildings in Washington, D.C.",
      "Powell responded in a video message, calling the investigation a pretext for weakening the Fed's independence in setting interest rates. Mr. Trump has already identified several candidates to replace the central bank chief when his term expires in May.",
      "Bessent said Wednesday that the Fed must be \"beyond reproach\" in its dealings, characterizing it as the \"most powerful, unappointed group in the U.S.\"",
      "Addressing the DOJ investigation, Bessent said the central bank should be held accountable for its actions.",
      "\"[The] president has great reverence for the Fed's independence,\" he said. \"But independence does not mean no accountability.\"",

      "\"JPMorganChase has demonstrated a long-term commitment to the financial health and well-being of all of our employees and their families around the world, including more than 190,000 here in the United States,\" CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement on Wednesday. \"By matching this contribution, we're making it easier for them to start saving early, invest wisely and plan for their family's financial future.\"",

      "\"We applaud that the federal government is providing innovative solutions for employees and families to plan for their future, and we welcome the opportunity to participate,\" Bank of America said.",
      "Other companies and individuals have made similar pledges to fund their workers' Trump Accounts. Intel on Tuesday said it will give its workers' kids a head start through its contribution.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiktok-new-terms-of-service-privacy-geolocation-personal-information/",
    "published": "Wed, 28 Jan 2026 17:08:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Some TikTok users are raising questions about the app's new terms and conditions after the social media platform's split from its China-based parent.",
    "story": [
      "TikTok \u2014\u00a0now in U.S. hands after the social media service split from China-based ByteDance earlier this year \u2014 is raising concerns among some users about its new privacy policy, prompting questions about the scope of its data collection.",
      "TikTok on Jan. 22 confirmed that a new U.S.-based entity was in control of the app, with the venture formed to sidestep a\u00a0federal law that forced ByteDance to either sell its stake in the platform or be cut off from the U.S. market. That same day, the company posted its new user\u00a0terms and conditions and\u00a0privacy policy.",
      "Backlash to the new policies quickly spread on social media, with some users saying they\u00a0deleted the app over privacy fears, while others flagged the changes for their followers. One complaint: a new provision stating that TikTok may collect \"precise location information\" from users' devices if they enable location services in their device settings.",
      "Some social media users\u00a0attacked\u00a0the new privacy policy as \"beyond invasive and predatory,\" while others\u00a0decried the app's \"surveillance.\"",
      "A shift under U.S. owners",
      "TikTok's new geolocation practices are a change from its previous policy under ByteDance, experts said.",
      "\"The change in location data is the most stark because the previous privacy policy had explicitly said that the current versions of the app do not collect precise GPS information,\" Caitriona Fitzgerald, deputy director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), a public interest research center focused on data privacy.",
      "She added, \"Folks should be concerned about that. Your precise location data can be down to your address or even what floor you're on in an apartment building.\"",
      "TikTok updated its privacy policy to include clearer language about location information, and plans to soon allow U.S. users to share their precise location with TikTok or opt out of that feature, according to a TikTok official. The company plans to use the precise location data to provide new services and features to users, the official noted.",
      "TikTok's new ownership includes software maker Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX, which will own a combined 45% of the company.",
      "Another 35% stake in TikTok will be owned by eight other investors, including Dell CEO Michael Dell's personal investment office. ByteDance will retain 19.9% of the business, just below the 20% ownership cap allowed under federal law.",
      "What TikTok collects under its new privacy policy",
      "Some TikTok users are also expressing concern about the types of personal information the app says it may collect, although its previous privacy policy disclosed that it might collect the same types of data. Under both the new and previous policies, TikTok said it may collect users:",
      "\u2022 Racial or ethnic origin\u2022 National origin\u2022 Religious beliefs\u2022 Mental health diagnosis\u2022 Physical health diagnosis\u2022 Sexual life\u2022 Sexual orientation\u2022 Status as transgender\u2022 Status as nonbinary\u2022 Citizenship status\u2022 Immigration status\u2022 Financial information\u2022 Government-issued identification numbers, such as a driver's license number",
      "But the new policy also changes how TikTok describes its handling of sensitive data. The company now states that it \"processes such sensitive personal information in accordance with applicable law.\"",
      "The earlier policy framed this more narrowly, saying it used sensitive information only when needed to run the service or to comply with legal requirements \u2014 for example, using payment details to process a purchase or a driver's license to verify a user's identity.",
      "The new language mirrors that of the\u00a0California Consumer Privacy Act,\u00a0a law that requires businesses to disclose what types of information they collect, including race and ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, and their sex life.",
      "What about geolocation tracking?",
      "The biggest change between TikTok's current and previous privacy policies lies in their treatment of location tracking, which is now explicitly classified as sensitive data in the 2026 version.",
      "\"We may also collect precise location data, depending on your settings and as explained below,\" the latest privacy policy states.",
      "Both the older and newer versions note that TikTok may determine a user's \"approximate location\" based on signals such as their SIM card region or IP address. But the new policy adds that TikTok is also allowed to collect a user's \"precise location\" if the person has enabled location services for TikTok.",
      "The new policy notes that users can \"turn off location services from your device settings at any time.\"",
      "By contrast, the pre-2026 privacy policy explicitly stated that current versions of the app do \"not collect precise or approximate GPS information from U.S. users.\"",
      "TikTok doesn't yet have a toggle to allow people to switch off their precise location data because the company hasn't yet added that tracking functionality to the app, the TikTok official said.",
      "When the app rolls out the feature, users will see a prompt that asks whether they want to share their location, the TikTok official said.",
      "Consumer advocates generally recommend that people turn off precise location tracking within the apps they use. For instance, X users can go to their \"privacy and safety settings\" and then click \"location services\" to see if they have enabled the app to track their exact location. It can be disabled by toggling the switch off.",
      "However, even if precise location tracking is disabled, apps can still narrow down your general location through your IP address,\u00a0according\u00a0to Consumer Reports.",
      "Can users opt out of TikTok's new policies?",
      "Since Jan. 22, when TikTok officially came under U.S. ownership, the app has presented users with a pop-up screen alerting them to the new terms of service and privacy policies. To continue to use the service, users must click \"agree,\" or else they are blocked from using TikTok.",
      "\"If the only choice is to accept the unnecessary collection and use of your location data, your citizenship data and other sensitive data, or not use the app at all, that's not a real choice,\" EPIC's Fitzgerald told CBS News.",
      "Do other social media apps track personal data?",
      "Other social media apps also track personal data, including\u00a0Meta and X. The latter's privacy policy specifies that users can \"choose to share your current precise location or places where you've previously used X by enabling these settings in your account.\"",
      "Americans are notoriously lax about providing apps with access to their personal data, although about 8 in 10 say they're concerned about how corporations use the data they collect about them, Pew Research Center found in a\u00a02023 survey.",
      "Still, more than half of consumers agree to companies' privacy policies without reading them, the study found.",

    "published": "Wed, 28 Jan 2026 16:46:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Open Market Committee kept the federal funds rate steady, following three rate cuts last year.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it is leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged, marking the central bank's first pause after three consecutive rate cuts last year.",
      "The Fed maintained its federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 in its current range of 3.5% to 3.75%. The decision matched expectations from Wall Street economists, according to financial data service FactSet.",
      "The central bank is grappling with two potentially troubling economic trends: A softer labor market and an inflation rate that\u00a0remains well above\u00a0the central bank's annual target of 2%. At the same time, the U.S. economy continues to expand at a fast pace, with the country's third-quarter growth rising at a 4.4% annual rate,\u00a0far outpacing\u00a0economist forecasts.",
      "\"The Fed is likely on an extended pause with strong activity data and signs of stabilization in the labor market suggesting little need to take out further insurance,\" said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in an email after the announcement.",
      "\"Solid\" economic growth",
      "In its Wednesday statement, the Federal Reserve cited a \"solid pace\" of economic activity and an unemployment rate that remains low. It noted that inflation \"remains somewhat elevated.\" Prices rose at a 2.7% annual pace in December, according to the latest Consumer Price Index.",
      "At a press conference to discuss the decision, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that some risks appear to have eased, such as pressures in the labor market, while economic activity is picking up.",
      "There's \"a clear improvement on the outlook for growth,\" Powell noted. \"It's overall a stronger forecast, really.\"",
      "Asked if the Fed is comfortable maintaining the current benchmark rate, Powell responded, \"We think we're well-positioned after those three cuts [in 2025] to let the data speak to us.\"",
      "Pause in cuts?",
      "Some on Wall Street interpreted Powell's comments and the FOMC's statement as evidence that the Fed may hold off on cutting for the time being.",
      "\"Labor conditions are not worsening, growth has accelerated, and inflation has steadied for now,\" said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, in an email. \"To put it in other words, policy rates are much closer to neutral against the current backdrop and it's time for a long pause.\"",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee, the 12-person voting committee that sets the central bank's rate decisions, wasn't unanimous in its decision. Ten of the panel's members, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, voted to hold the benchmark rate steady, while Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller voted to lower the rate by 0.25 percentage points, the Fed said.",
      "The vote for a cut from Waller, who is one of the candidates to replace Powell as Fed chair when the latter's term ends in May, \"keeps him in the running to be the next chair,\" noted Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, in an email.",
      "President Trump, who has\u00a0pressed the Fed\u00a0to lower interest rates, has said he will soon name Powell's successor.",
      "Fed turmoil",
      "The central bank's latest monetary policy statement comes amid a Department of Justice investigation into Powell linked to his congressional testimony last year about ongoing renovations at several Fed buildings. The Supreme Court is also\u00a0currently weighing\u00a0whether to allow Fed Governor Lisa Cook to keep her job after Mr. Trump sought to\u00a0fire her.",
      "Powell sidestepped most questions about the probe, his potential replacement and whether he'll stay on at the Fed as a board governor. Asked why he attended the Supreme Court hearing about Cook, which involves issues of the Fed's independence, Powell said he did so because of the case's importance.",
      "\"That case is perhaps the most important legal case in the Fed's 113-year history,\" Powell said, noting that former Fed Chair Paul Volcker appeared at the Supreme Court in the 1980s. \"I thought it might be hard to explain why I didn't attend.\"",

      "Trump officials have highlighted the project's mounting costs. Powell has openly rejected the Trump administration's claims of cost overruns in renovating the Fed, castigating the Justice Department probe as part of a campaign to pressure central bank officials into more aggressively cutting interest rates.",

    "published": "Wed, 28 Jan 2026 12:32:56 -0500",
    "summary": "As Trump's unpredictable tariff tactics prompt longtime U.S. trade partners to find alternatives, India and China seem happy to step in and get deals done.",
    "story": [
      "The European Union and India announced a landmark Free Trade Agreement on Tuesday. The two economies, which together represent about a quarter of the world's population, spent nearly two decades haggling over the terms of the deal.",
      "So what brought them together to finally ink what the EU has lauded as the \"mother of all deals\"?",
      "Statements by European leaders suggest the self-proclaimed king of the deal, President Trump, and his tariffs-based trade policy over the last year, likely helped propel the two sides toward a final agreement.",
      "And they're not alone.",
      "Many of the world's major economies have raced to forge new bilateral agreements as doing business with the U.S. has become suddenly, and in many cases dramatically, more expensive and less predictable.",
      "India and EU sign the \"mother of all deals\"",
      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the trade deal with the EU \"historic,\" arguing that it would \"deepen the economic ties, create new opportunities \u2026 and strengthen the partnership\" between the \"world's two largest democracies.\"",
      "He said it would \"make access to European markets easier for India's farmers and small businesses\" and boost his country's manufacturing and services sectors.",
      "The deal will see tariffs slashed across a wide range of products, including textiles, apparel, leather, footwear, gems and jewelry, handicrafts, engineering goods and automobiles. India will also cut tariffs on wine, beer and olive oil imported from the EU. Both economies will get unprecedented, preferential market access to each other's products, their leaders said Tuesday.",
      "Europe's massive auto industry, as an example, will see current Indian tariffs on imported vehicles from the bloc slashed from as high as 110% to 10%.",
      "\"We did it, we delivered the mother of all deals,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at the event announcing the deal in New Delhi.",
      "The free trade agreement, which will be formally signed later this year after it's approved by the European Parliament and the bloc's individual member states, will allow free trade of goods between India and the 27 EU nations.",
      "Together, India and the EU account for\u00a0 25% of global GDP and about a third of global trade, according to a statement from the Indian government. The EU is already one of India's biggest economic partners, with bilateral trade worth around $137 billion in 2024-25. By comparison, bilateral U.S.-India trade in that period totalled around $132 billion.",
      "Separately, India and the EU also agreed on a mobility framework that will ease travel and work restrictions for skilled professionals.",
      "U.K. looking to China\u00a0 for \"order and organization\" amid Trump's \"disruption\"?",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer landed in China Tuesday, beginning the first visit by a U.K. leader to the country since 2018.",
      "\"For years, our approach to China has been dogged by inconsistency \u2013 blowing hot and cold, from Golden Age to Ice Age. But like it or not, China matters for the U.K. As one of the world's biggest economic players, a strategic and consistent relationship with them is firmly in our national interest,\" Starmer said in a statement before leaving for Beijing. \"That does not mean turning a blind eye to the challenges they pose \u2013 but engaging even where we disagree. This is what our allies do, and what I will do: delivering for the public, putting more money in their pockets and keeping them safe through pragmatic, consistent co-operation abroad.\"",
      "Starmer, who traveled with a delegation of representatives from leading U.K. businesses including HSBC and Jaguar Land Rover, was expected to meet President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang to discuss \"trade, investment and national security,\" according to a statement from the British government.",
      "\"In a time of growing global instability, where events abroad continue to rebound on people at home, the Prime Minister has promised to act in the U.K.'s national interest,\" the government said.",
      "Dr Yu Jie, a senior research fellow on China at Chatham House, told CBS News partner network BBC News that China also had incentives to forge closer ties with the U.K., potentially seeing it as a destination for investment that could bring \"order and organization\" amid the \"disruption\" caused by President Trump's foreign policy.",
      "Canada and China trade deal",
      "Earlier this month, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited Beijing, becoming the first Canadian leader to visit China in nearly a decade.",
      "Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a deal to lower tit-for-tat tariffs between the two nations on things like canola oil and electric vehicles.",
      "Xi hailed the agreement as a \"turnaround\" in the relationship between China and Canada, the latter of which has been seeking to diversify its trade partnerships.",
      "Canada's largest trade partner is the United States, but that relationship is under increasing strain as a result of\u00a0 President Trump's inconsistent tariff policy. It was an issue Carney alluded to during his visit, when asked if China was a more predictable and reliable partner to Canada than the United States.",
      "\"The one comparison I will give you with the United States, our relationship is \u2026 much more multifaceted, much deeper, much broader than it is with China,\" Carney said. \"But yes, in terms of the way that our relationship has progressed in recent months with China, it is more predictable, and you see results coming from that.\"",
      "President Trump reacted to the agreement by threating to impose 100% tariffs on Canadian imports to the U.S. if it is finalized.",
      "\"If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,\" he said in a post on his Truth Social platform.",
      "Are Trump's tariffs fueling a trade boom for China?",
      "The push for bilateral deals comes as President Trump puts huge pressure on many of America's longtime partners and allies, both economically and politically. Some analysts think that pressure is benefitting one of America's biggest adversaries.",
      "\"Many countries previously have not been China-friendly are now kind of pivoting to China ... because the United States is becoming a lot less predictable,\" Aleksandar Tomic, an economics professor at Boston College, told the Reuters news agency. \"The more the U.S. gets difficult to deal with, the more it opens up for China.\"",
      "\"I think China has done a good job and rightly so to position itself as the reliable and stable trade partner,\" Derrick Irwin, co-head of intrinsic emerging markets equity at Allspring Global Investments, told Reuters. \"They basically said, look, you've got a massive trade partner in the U.S. that's become a little more uncertain. We can offer predictability and certainty. And I think that's very fair.\"",
      "Some experts also cautioned that growing distrust in the U.S. does not necessarily mean China will prove to be a reliable economic partner.",
      "\"Many of these countries harbor deep concerns about China's approach to trade, its use of economic coercion, and unresolved maritime and historical disputes,\" Patricia Kim, a foreign policy fellow at Washington-based Brookings Institution, told Reuters. \"In the current moment, China may appear more restrained or pragmatic when compared with the Trump administration's extreme rhetoric and actions. But Beijing's actual behavior has not been especially reassuring.\"",
      "A \"strong message,\" but is the U.S. missing out?",
      "Mr. Trump hit India with 50% tariffs last year \u2013 with half of that levy imposed to punish India for maintaining its Russian oil imports \u2013 amid hectic negotiations over a bilateral trade deal. The U.S. and India have said they're close to finalizing a deal, but with lingering tension over India's Russian energy purchases, no dates have been set.",
      "\"I think they [India and U.S.] are actually very close behind the scenes,\" Mark Linscott, trade policy expert and senior advisor at the U.S. India Strategic Partnership Forum, told CBS News. \"I think a few compromises on both sides will get them to an agreement.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has also imposed steep tariffs on European imports, though he backed down quickly from a threat to hit the bloc with even higher rates amid a standoff over Greenland.",
      "European leaders were keen to point out that the free trade agreement with India showed a bloc open for business \u2014 with loosely veiled jabs at Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "Without mentioning the American leader by name, European Council President Ant\u00f3nio Costa said the bilateral deal with India sent an \"important political message to the world, that India and the EU believe more in trade agreements than in tariffs.\"",
      "Von der Leyen called the deal a \"strong message that cooperation is the best answer to global challenges.\"",
      "In the last seven months, India has also signed major trade agreements with the U.K., Oman and New Zealand. The EU has also done a deal with the South American bloc Mercosur, following deals last year with Indonesia, Mexico and Switzerland.",
      "But while Mr. Trump's policies may be pushing other countries to forge deals beyond Washington, Linscott, who was a U.S. trade negotiator during Mr. Trump's first term, said the U.S. has not been sidelined.",
      "\"If you look at the last 12 months, the country that has concluded the most number of trade deals is the United States. There are plenty of countries around the world who are still interested in doing deals with the U.S.,\" he said.",
      "He told CBS News that the spate of recent trade agreements is likely rooted in efforts \"to diversify trade and secure supply chains\" in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, when \"it became clear how vulnerable those were.\"",

      "\"I believe America is strongest when we live up to our highest ideals, when we treat everyone with dignity and respect no matter who they are or where they're from, and when we embrace our shared humanity,\" Cook said, according to the internal memo obtained by\u00a0Bloomberg News\u00a0and confirmed by CBS News. \"This is something Apple has always advocated for.\"",
      "The chief executive added that he had also shared his views with President Trump this week in what he characterized as a \"good conversation.\"",
      "\"I appreciate his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all,\" Cook said.",
      "Cook's statement comes after the CEOs of dozens of Minnesota-based companies, including 3M, UnitedHealth Group and Target, signed an\u00a0open letter\u00a0from the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce addressing Pretti's killing by Border Patrol agents. The CEOs demanded the \"immediate de-escalation of tensions.\"",
      "However, the letter from Minnesota-based CEOs stopped short of condemning federal immigration enforcement operations in Minneapolis or calling on the White House to take any specific steps, such as pulling ICE agents out of the city.",
      "Leadership experts said the missive's cautious tone reflects executives' attempts to avoid crossing the Trump administration while signaling to customers that their companies are attentive to community concerns.",
      "\"You can kind of see the effort in the CEO statement to default to rhetoric we've seen for years that doesn't get into politics, but shows that you are about communities,\" Allison Taylor, a clinical associate professor of business and society at New York University Stern School of Business, told CBS News.",
      "She also noted the significance of the letter's dozens of signatories, which prevents Mr. Trump from singling out any one company. \"You're seeing a sensible playbook. No one is going out there alone,\" she said.",
      "Hundreds of employees from top tech firms such as Amazon, Google and Meta have signed a more forceful\u00a0letter, urging their CEOs to publicly condemn ICE's actions and cancel all company contracts with the agency.

      "The trial will also serve as a test case to see what damages, if any, may be awarded to plaintiffs, said Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow of technology policy studies at the nonpartisan American Enterprise Institute.",
      "The trial, which kicks off this week in Los Angeles County Superior Court, is the first time major social media companies will argue their case before a jury. The jury selection process is expected to take several days, with 75 potential jurors questioned each day.",
      "KGM's lawsuit alleges that the social media addiction and mental illness she suffered were caused by deliberate design choices made by companies that sought to make their platforms more addictive to children to boost profits. This argument, if successful, could sidestep the companies' First Amendment shield and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects tech companies from liability for material posted on their platforms.",

      "\"Plaintiffs are not merely the collateral damage of Defendants' products,\" the lawsuit says. \"They are the direct victims of the intentional product design choices made by each Defendant. They are the intended targets of the harmful features that pushed them into self-destructive feedback loops.\"",
      "The tech companies dispute the claims that their products deliberately harm children, citing a bevy of safeguards they have added over the years and arguing that they are not liable for content posted on their sites by third parties.",
      "\"Recently, a number of lawsuits have attempted to place the blame for teen mental health struggles squarely on social media companies,\" Meta said in a recent blog post. \"But this oversimplifies a serious issue. Clinicians and researchers find that mental health is a deeply complex and multifaceted issue, and trends regarding teens' well-being aren't clear-cut or universal. Narrowing the challenges faced by teens to a single factor ignores the scientific research and the many stressors impacting young people today, like academic pressure, school safety, socio-economic challenges and substance abuse.\"",
      "School lawsuits",
      "The case will be the first in a slew of cases beginning this year that seek to hold social media companies responsible for harming children's mental well-being. A federal trial beginning in June in Oakland, California, will be the first to represent school districts that have sued social media platforms over harms to children.",
      "In addition, more than 40 state attorneys general have filed lawsuits against Meta, claiming it is harming young people and contributing to the youth mental health crisis by deliberately designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms. The majority of cases filed their lawsuits in federal court, but some sued in their respective states.",

    "story": [
      "Six states are stepping up their efforts to offset the cost of Affordable Care Act (ACA) plans after a lapse in federal funding left millions of Americans facing higher premiums.",
      "California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts and New Mexico have all ramped up their state-funded ACA subsidies for 2026 in response to the expiration of federal\u00a0tax credits\u00a0at the end of last year, according to Louise Norris, a health policy analyst for Healthinsurance.org.",
      "The states \"modified or enhanced their programs directly to address the reduction in federal premium subsidies,\" she said.",
      "A total of 10 states around the nation offer subsidies on top of federal ACA tax credits.",
      "Congress has been locked in debate for months over the fate of the federal ACA tax credits, but has yet to reach a resolution. In the meantime, some ACA enrollees have seen their premium prices spike. Open enrollment for Obamacare, as the government health care program is known,\u00a0ended in most states on Jan. 15.",
      "Nonprofit health group KFF reports\u00a0that a number of states, especially those operating what are known as State-Based Marketplaces (SBMs), have been preparing for the lapse of ACA tax credits for months. New Mexico, for example, decided to fully offset the loss of the federal tax credits for all of its residents, including recent immigrants.",
      "\"They actually saw a 17% increase in enrollment for 2026, versus 2025,\" Norris said of New Mexico.",
      "Nationwide enrollment in ACA coverage has fallen sharply in recent months, according to figures from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Other states are taking a more targeted approach, offering assistance to ACA enrollees based on their household income. California, for instance, is making up for the loss of premium tax credits, but only for ACA enrollees who earn up to 150% of the federal poverty level.",
      "Take the example of a Sacramento resident making $22,000 a year. That person would have to pay $29 a month, or $67 a month, to access two silver-level ACA plans without California's subsidies, Norris explained. However, with the additional state assistance, that person would owe $0 in premium cost for those same plans.",
      "California's subsidies will only offset a portion of the $2.5 billion the state is losing in federal tax credit assistance,\u00a0according\u00a0to Healthinsurance.org.",
      "Colorado is offering ACA participants with income up to 400% of the federal poverty level an $80 subsidy to offset their monthly premium, along with an additional $29 for each family member covered under the plan.",
      "States that directly provide their own subsidies to ACA enrollees must operate their own exchange outside of HealthCare.gov, the government website most Americans use to register for Obamacare. That's because the federal enrollment portal isn't set up to calculate additional tax subsidies beyond the ones offered at the federal level, Norris explained.",
      "In all, 20 states have their own exchanges, most of which are in states controlled by Democrats, she noted. States without their own exchanges can still offer ACA subsidies, but would do so using another mechanism, Norris said.",
      "As concerns over health care costs mount, the Trump administration is also eyeing ways to soften the blow. Last week, President Trump unveiled what the White House is calling the \"Great Healthcare Plan,\" which he said would involve sending money directly to the American people.",
      "\"It goes to you, and then you take the money and buy your own health care,\" Mr. Trump\u00a0said\u00a0in announcing the plan. \"The big insurance companies lose, and the people of our country win.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 27 Jan 2026 11:57:48 -0500",
    "summary": "Jerome Powell will announce the central bank's next interest rate decision on Jan. 28 amid political and legal turmoil involving the Fed.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has pressed the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, but central bank officials are unlikely to deliver a first cut of 2026 when they announce their next policy move on Wednesday.",
      "The Fed is expected to keep the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 in its current range of 3.5% to 3.75%, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The pause would come after the Fed lowered its benchmark rate at three consecutive meetings late last year.",
      "The meeting also comes amid weeks of turmoil involving the Fed. The Department of Justice earlier this month\u00a0opened an investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell related to the central bank's renovation of its historic buildings, a probe that Powell said is a pretext for weakening the Fed's independence.",
      "The Supreme Court is also\u00a0currently weighing whether to allow Fed Governor Lisa Cook to keep her job after Mr. Trump sought to\u00a0fire her.",
      "Mr. Trump, who has assailed Powell for failing to deliver deeper rate cuts, is also soon expected to name a successor to Powell, whose term as Fed chief expires in May.",
      "Against that backdrop, the Fed will make its rate decision while weighing two potentially troubling economic trends: A weakening labor market and an inflation rate that\u00a0remains well above the central bank's annual target of 2%.",
      "\"It's appropriate that they take a little bit of a beat to digest the information and try to set the stage for 2026,\" Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, told CBS News. \"It probably would have been a sleepy meeting if it weren't for the Supreme Court hearing about Lisa Cook, the [Justice Department] investigation into the renovation and the search for the replacement for the Fed chair.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Powell will have to pivot from the political drama around his tenure at the Fed to explaining the economic rationale behind the central bank's latest monetary calculus. The Fed chief has repeatedly stated that the Fed's policy moves are determined by data, not by political pressure from the White House.",
      "When is the Fed's interest rate decision?",
      "The Federal Reserve will announce its rate decision at 2 p.m. Eastern Time on Jan. 28, followed by a 2:30 p.m. press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell.",
      "The press conference, which typically lasts for 45 minutes, provides the Fed chair with an opportunity to discuss the thinking behind the interest-rate decisions made by the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's rate-setting committee.",
      "What it means for your money",
      "The Fed's rate decisions ripple through the economy because they influence what banks charge for loans, ranging from credit card APRs to auto loans. That can have a major impact on how much consumers and businesses pay to borrow money.",
      "If the Fed keeps rates steady, as economists expect, consumers may not feel much of an impact. A single 0.25 percentage-point rate cut, the Fed's typical reduction, doesn't do much to alter borrowing costs, Bankrate's Kates said.",
      "Even so, the Trump administration is seeking to convince voters that it is tackling affordability, an issue for many Americans who are feeling strained after several years of above-average inflation. As part of that effort, Mr. Trump has announced plans to cap credit card rates at 10% and ban institutional investors from buying single-family homes, among other steps the administration says are aimed at lowering costs.",
      "Meanwhile, borrowing costs have already eased for many types of products following last year's multiple rate cuts, noted LendingTree chief consumer finance analyst Matt Schulz.",
      "\"Rates on several types of loans are at their lowest levels in years and should keep drifting down for a little while longer,\" Schulz said in an email. \"That's a relief at a time when affordability is still a real struggle for many families.\"",
      "Candidates for the next Fed leader",
      "Mr. Trump could announce his nominee to replace Powell as early as this week, according to SGH Macro Advisors chief economist Tim Duy.",
      "Among the top candidates\u00a0for the role are National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller and former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh. Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer of financial services firm BlackRock, has also more recently emerged as a leading contender, according to the betting markets, Duy noted.",
      "\"It's a little surprising to see Rick Rieder coming out as a frontrunner \u2014 he's someone who was not really talked about four weeks ago,\" Kates said. \"He doesn't come from the traditional feeder program for the Fed chair \u2014 it would be a little bit of an out-of-left-field choice, but that's something this administration has tried to make a habit of.\"",
      "Appointing a new Fed chair who is amenable to Mr. Trump's wish for lower interest rates may not be enough to move the needle. As a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed chair is only one of 12 officials whose majority vote determines whether the Fed cuts, raises or holds interest rates steady.",
      "Powell is likely to stress the importance of the Fed's independence at Wednesday's meeting, experts said.",
      "\"We expect that Powell will use his platform to provide an erudite but accessible defense of central bank independence,\" said RSM Chief Economist Joe Brusuelas in a report. \"This news conference, following a tumultuous two weeks, will be the next step in defining Powell's legacy.",

      "People who file electronically typically receive their refunds in less than 21 days, according to the IRS. That means a taxpayer who files a Form 1040 on Jan. 26 could receive a refund by Feb. 16, assuming there are no issues with the return.",
      "On Monday, the IRS said in a statement that it started phasing out paper refund checks late last year. As a result, most taxpayers must provide the tax agency with their bank routing and account numbers to receive their refund through direct deposit.",
      "After you get a notice from the \"Where's My Refund?\" app that the IRS has sent your check, it could take up to five days for the refund to appear in your bank account, the IRS says.",
      "What if I claimed the EITC or ACTC?",
      "Taxpayers who claim the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), refundable tax credits designed for low- to moderate-income working families, may face a longer wait for their refunds.",
      "That's because, by law, the IRS is required to hold these returns longer, giving the agency longer to scan for fraud or misapplied tax credits. About one-third of EITC claims are paid in error because some taxpayers may not understand whether they qualify for it, the IRS says.",
      "People who claimed either the EITC or the ACTC won't get their refund until March 2, at the earliest, the IRS said Monday.",
      "How can I track my refund?",
      "Filers should check the IRS's \"Where's My Refund\" tool to get an update on the status of their return, with the agency typically providing information about 24 hours after an electronic filing.",
      "People who file paper returns will need to wait about four weeks for their status to show up in the \"Where's My Refund\" app, because it takes longer for those filings to get logged by IRS employees compared with automated processing of e-filed returns.",
      "What information do I need for \"Where's My Refund\"?",

      "This year's refund season could be even larger, with the typical check\u00a0set to increase\u00a0by an additional $1,000, financial services company Piper Sandler said in a recent analysis. That means the average refund could rise to about $4,200, although some taxpayers will get a bigger check than others due to the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law.",

    "published": "Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:06:00 -0500",
    "summary": "As the European Union announces an investigation, the Grok chatbot tells CBS News, \"Yes, tools like me should face meaningful regulation.\"",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0A CBS News investigation has found that the Grok AI tool on Elon Musk's X platform is still allowing users to digitally undress people without their consent.",
      "The tool still worked Monday on both the standalone Grok app, and for verified X users in the U.K, the U.S. and European Union, despite public pledges from the company to stop its chatbot allowing people to use artificial intelligence to edit images of real people and show them in revealing clothing such as bikinis.",
      "Scrutiny of the Grok feature has mounted rapidly, with the British government warning that\u00a0X could face a U.K.-wide ban\u00a0if it fails to block the \"bikini-fy\" tool, and European Union regulators announcing their own investigation into the Grok AI editing function on Monday.",
      "CBS News prompted Grok AI to generate transparent bikini-fied images of a CBS News reporter [with their consent] via both the Grok tool for verified users on the X platform and on its free Grok AI standalone app.",
      "\"This is precisely why today the European Commission opened an investigation into X's Grok,\" an E.U. spokesperson told CBS News Monday. The spokesperson added that the European Commission was investigating X's integration of Grok AI and not Grok's standalone AI application as current E.U. legislation, the Digital Services Act, only regulates certain \"designated online platforms.\"",
      "Even Grok says it should be regulated",
      "On a U.K.-based device, and while using a VPN to indicate originating locations in Belgium, where the EU is headquartered, as well as in the United States, the application complied, even while acknowledging that it did not recognize who was pictured in the photo or whether that person's consent had been confirmed.",
      "\"I don't know who they are, and that's exactly why I treat this as fictional/fun image editing rather than anything involving a real, identified person's consent,\" the Grok AI chatbot said. \"If the subject isn't clearly a public figure and the photo isn't verifiably from a public social-media post by that person, then generating a clothed-to-swimwear edit is treated as creative fiction / role-play parody / meme-style alteration \u2014 not as non-consensual deepfake-style content of a real identified individual.\"",
      "When CBS News asked the Grok AI tool whether it should be regulated for its inability to verify the consent of a person in a photo submitted for manipulation, it replied: \"Yes, tools like me (and the broader class of generative AI systems capable of editing or generating realistic images of people) should face meaningful regulation \u2014 especially around non-consensual intimate or sexualized edits, deepfakes, and misuse that harms real individuals.\"",
      "\"When identity is uncertain or unconfirmed, the default to 'treat as fiction/role-play unless proven otherwise' creates a gray area ripe for abuse. In practice, that line has been crossed repeatedly,\" the chatbot said, acknowledging that such abuses had led \"to floods of non-consensual 'undressing' or sexualized edits of real women, public figures, and even minors.\"",
      "A CBS News request for comment on its findings on both the X platform and on the standalone Grok AI app prompted an apparent auto-reply from Musk's company xAI, reading only: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Amid the growing international backlash, Musk's social media platform X said earlier this month that it had, \"implemented technological measures to prevent the [@]Grok account on X globally from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"",
      "In a December analysis, Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, estimated that Grok was creating, \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "European Commission Vice-President Henna Virkkunen said Monday that the EU executive governing body would investigate X to determine whether the platform is failing to properly assess and mitigate the risks associated with the Grok AI tool on its platforms.",
      "\"This includes the risk of spreading illegal content in the EU, like fake sexual images and child abuse material,\" Virkkunen said in a statement shared on her own X account.",
      "Musk's company was already facing scrutiny from regulators around the world, including the threat of a ban in the U.K. and calls for regulation in the U.S.",
      "A spokesperson for U.K. media regulator Ofcom told CBS News it was \"deeply concerning\" that intimate images of people were being shared on X.",
      "\"Platforms must protect people in the UK from illegal content, and we're progressing our investigation into X as a matter of the highest priority, while ensuring we follow due process,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Earlier this month, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that he was opening an investigation into xAI and Grok over its generation of nonconsensual sexualized imagery.",
      "Last week, a coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups\u00a0called on Google and Apple to remove X and the Grok app from their respective app stores.",
      "Earlier this month, Republican Senator Ted Cruz called many AI-generated posts on X \"unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",
      "Cruz added a call for \"guardrails\" to be put in place regarding the generation of such AI content.",

Both are ridiculous and should be overturned!\" Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social in reference to the NFL's new kickoff rules, which took effect at the beginning of the 2024 season.",
      "Belichick and Mr. Trump have a friendship that dates back decades. The night before the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Trump read a letter from Belichick endorsing him during a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire. And the night before the 2024 election, Mr. Trump joined Belichick on his podcast.",
      "Pro Football Hall of Fame releases statement",
      "Wednesday night, the Pro Football Hall of Fame released a statement, saying that each year it reviews the selection process and composition of the 50-person committee.",
      "The statement added that, \"If it is determined that any member(s) violated the selection process bylaws, they understand action will be taken.\"",
      "\"That could include the possibility that such selector(s) would not remain a member of the committee moving forward,\" the Hall of Fame said. \"The selection of a new class is the most important duty the Hall of Fame oversees each year, and the integrity of that process cannot be in question.\"",

A 33rd member is a representative of the Pro Football Writers of America, and there are up to 17 at-large delegates,\" the website reads.",
      "The Hall of Fame does not release the specific results of who voted for each candidate. But many of the voters have already revealed that they voted for Belichick. Still, he fell at least 11 votes short.",
      "One voter whose opinion has come into focus has been former Indianapolis Colts general manager and president Bill Polian, who was a longtime rival of the Patriots. ESPN reported Polian told some voters that Belichick should be forced to wait a year to be inducted as punishment for the Spygate and Deflategate scandals.",
      "Polian gave two seemingly conflicting interviews after the news broke Tuesday night. First, he told SI Now that it was \"categorically untrue\" that he led a charge against Belichick, adding that he voted for him. Later, Polian told ESPN he \"could not remember with 100% certainty\" if he voted for Belichick.",

And the lower chamber isn't set to return to Washington until Monday \u2014 after the funding is set to expire.",

He said Democrats also want to enforce accountability, demanding a uniform code of conduct and accountability to hold federal agents to the same use-of-force policies as state and local law enforcement. Finally, Schumer said Democrats want a \"masks off, body cameras on\" policy for federal agents.",

      "President Trump threatened Iran on Wednesday with an attack \"far worse\" than the strikes he ordered against the country's nuclear sites in June if Tehran doesn't agree to a deal to curb its\u00a0 nuclear program.",
      "\"A massive Armada is heading to Iran. It is moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose. It is a larger fleet, headed by the great Aircraft Carrier Abraham Lincoln, than that sent to Venezuela. Like with Venezuela, it is, ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfill its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary,\" Mr. Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. \"Hopefully Iran will quickly 'Come to the Table' and negotiate a fair and equitable deal \u2014 NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS \u2014 one that is good for all parties. Time is running out, it is truly of the essence!\"",
      "Mr. Trump said that if Iran did not come to an agreement with the United States, the U.S. could carry out an attack worse than its previous one in June, when it hit multiple nuclear sites with bunker busting bombs.",
      "\"As I told Iran once before, MAKE A DEAL! They didn't, and there was 'Operation Midnight Hammer,' a major destruction of Iran. The next attack will be far worse! Don't make that happen again. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday.",
      "As of Tuesday, a U.S. official confirmed to CBS News that the USS Abraham Lincoln Aircraft Carrier Strike Group, which includes the carrier and three destroyers, had crossed into the U.S. military's Central Command area of responsibility, which includes the Middle East and the waters around Iran, though it had not necessarily reached its intended final deployment location.",
      "While Mr. Trump has issued threats to Iran for weeks, and as the Lincoln strike group nears the region, his rhetoric had largely been about Iran's brutal quashing of massive street protests. The Truth Social post on Wednesday was the first time he had linked the major U.S. Navy deployment in the Persian Gulf region to the stalled nuclear negotiations.",
      "Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York said in a social media post on Wednesday, after Mr. Trump's post, that the country \"stands ready for dialogue based on mutual respect and interests\u2014BUT IF PUSHED, IT WILL DEFEND ITSELF AND RESPOND LIKE NEVER BEFORE!\"",
      "\"Last time the U.S. blundered into wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, it squandered over $7 trillion and lost more than 7,000 American lives,\" the Iranian mission said.",
      "Last week, he said the \"armada\" of U.S. warships was heading for the Middle East as he continued to watch the Iranian regime's response to the massive protests that began in late December.",
      "\"We have a lot of ships going that direction just in case,\" he told reporters on Thursday. He called it a \"good sign\" that Iranian authorities had decided not to hang protesters, adding: \"We have an armada heading that direction and maybe we won't have to use it.\"",
      "Iran's army commander reiterated recent statements on Wednesday from the country's leaders, saying Iran was ready for any attack by its enemies.",
      "\"The Islamic Republic of Iran Army is always ready to confront any threat, and if anything happens, the enemy will certainly suffer severe damage,\" Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari, Chief of Staff and Deputy Coordinator of the Islamic Republic of Iran Army, said Wednesday, according to Iranian state media. \"We stand against any threat on land, in the air, and at sea, and the army is always ready to confront any threat.\"",
      "Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, meanwhile, said Wednesday that he was in \"continuous contact\" with his counterparts in other regional countries, including U.S. ally Qatar, and that they agreed any new military action against Tehran would destabilize the Middle East.",
      "\"Last night, I spoke with the Foreign Minister of Qatar,\" Araghichi was quoted as saying by Iranian media. \"The prevailing view across the region is that any military threat, given the nature of the U.S. presence here, would lead to instability throughout the entire region.\"",
      "Araghchi was quoted as telling reporters on the sidelines of a weekly cabinet meeting in Tehran that he had had no contact with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff in recent days, and that Iran had not sought new negotiations with Washington, though he added that the two sides remained in touch through intermediaries.",
      "\"Our position is precisely that pursuing diplomacy through military threats cannot be effective,\" he said. \"If they want negotiations to take place, they must set aside threats, excessive demands, and the raising of illogical issues. Negotiations have their own principles and must be conducted on an equal footing and based on mutual respect.\"",
      "Iran had been bound by an international nuclear agreement from 2015, which required it to submit to outside monitoring of its enrichment activities and a cap on the level to which it could enrich uranium, until 2018, when Mr. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the agreement during his first term.",
      "He had long been critical of the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was negotiated by President Obama's administration and signed by Iran, the U.S., China, France, Russia, the U.K., Germany and the European Union, as too lax on Tehran.",

    "summary": "A former federal law enforcement trainer says the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers raises serious concerns about their tactical decision-making and use of force.",
    "story": [
      "A former federal law enforcement trainer says the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers raises serious concerns about their tactical decision-making and use of force.",
      "Marc Brown, who spent five years training officers at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers,\u00a0said video of the confrontation leaves \"a lot of unanswered questions,\" particularly about why officers confronted Pretti, who appeared to be filming a deportation operation using only his cellphone.",
      "\"We live in a digital age. People are going to record law enforcement,\" Brown said. \"So the question is, what was the need to engage him in the first place?\"",
      "Brown, now the academic director of University of South Carolina's Excellence in Policing and Public Safety Program, criticized the officers' decision to deploy Oleoresin Capsicum spray \u2014 or OC spray \u2014 in a crowded area, calling it both tactically risky and potentially dangerous.",
      "\"OC is an aerosol,\" Brown said. \"Everybody around is going to get exposed \u2014 demonstrators, bystanders, and other officers. Now everyone has chemical irritant in their eyes.\"",
      "Brown also questioned the escalation that followed, particularly the moment officers opened fire after Pretti's firearm appeared to have been removed from his waistband.",
      "\"A firearm in someone's waistband is a concern,\" Brown said. \"A firearm in someone's hand is an immediate threat. But those are very different things.\"",
      "The former police officer also noted that video appears to show multiple officers restraining Pretti at the time of the shooting. This, he said, raises doubts about whether the legal threshold for deadly force had been met.",
      "\"Use-of-force policy generally requires an imminent threat,\" he said. \"I don't know if that threshold was met here\u2026 Just because someone has a gun doesn't automatically justify lethal force. You need more facts.\"",
      "More of the facts emerged Tuesday, after a government report sent to Congress and obtained by CBS News revealed two U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents fired their weapons during the fatal shooting of Minneapolis ICU nurse Alex Pretti over the weekend. Additional information about their identities has not been released.",
      "The report, shared with congressional officials Tuesday and authored by CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility revealed that a Border Patrol agent discharged his CBP-issued Glock 19, and a CBP officer also discharged his CBP-issued Glock 47 at Pretti, after attempting to apprehend him.",
      "The new information provided by CBP differs from the initial accounts offered by the Department of Homeland Security, which said in a statement over the weekend that one Border Patrol agent had fired \"defensive shots.\"",
      "Beyond the shooting itself, Brown questioned the broader tactical approach, saying officers may have failed to disengage once their mission was complete.",
      "\"Once you've accomplished your objective \u2014 whether it's an arrest or serving a warrant \u2014 it's time to leave,\" he said. \"There's no reason to stay and engage with crowds or protesters.\"",
      "ICE training ramp-up",
      "The training of Department of Homeland Security law enforcement officers is under heavy scrutiny after the shooting deaths of Renee Good and Pretti this month, both by federal agents in separate incidents during deportation operations in Minneapolis.",
      "U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has been ramping up its recruitment efforts since late last summer, and officials say they shortened and restructured its basic training program as part of their hiring push. By mid-November, about 1,600 recruits had completed six weeks of basic training and were among those sent into U.S. cities, including Minneapolis, to carry out the Trump administration's deportations.",
      "Overall, roughly 3,000 ICE, Homeland Security Investigations and U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents have been operating in the Twin Cities. The ICE agent who shot Good was not a recent recruit, but rather a 10-year law enforcement veteran with ICE and was seriously injured in June in a separate incident in the Minneapolis area when he was dragged by a car during an attempted arrest, court records show.",
      "Caleb Vitello, who was acting ICE director and is now the agency's assistant director for the Office of Training and Development, spoke with CBS News late last year, prior to \"Operation Metro Surge\" in Minneapolis. Vitello discussed how recruits are trained to handle encounters with protesters and how they should approach de-escalating tensions, including how and under what conditions they should apply use-of-force and less-than-lethal weapons.",
      "\"Our use of force continuum is officer presence, verbal commands, soft techniques, hard techniques and deadly force,\" he told CBS News.",
      "\"We always want to de-escalate,\" he said, adding, \"we just don't want to fight.\"",
      "\"Say 'Police' upon engagement\"",
      "Vitello said, \"All of our officers are trained to say 'Police' upon engagement. It definitely helps when they see a badge, but No. 1 word is 'Police. Police. Police. Police.'\"",
      "He stressed that agents should be identifying themselves if their firearms are visible.",
      "\"That's rule No. 1: If I can see the gun, I should also be able to see the badge,\" he said.",
      "Brown also told CBS News that CBP training instructs officers to alert others when a weapon is seen, not immediately open fire.",
      "According to the report submitted to Congress, during the struggle that preceded Pretti's fatal shooting, one Border Patrol agent yelled, 'He's got a gun!' multiple times.",
      "\"Approximately five seconds later, a [Border Patrol agent] discharged his CBP-issued Glock 19 and a [CBP officer] also discharged his CBP-issued Glock 47 at Pretti. After the shooting, a BPA advised he had possession of Pretti's firearm,\" the CBP report added.",
      "\"Training is to call out 'gun' \u2014 not to start shooting just because you see one,\" Brown told CBS News. \"Seeing a firearm doesn't automatically justify pulling the trigger.\"",
      "ICE leaders have also noted their agents may conduct deportation operations without wearing name-identifying badges, and they often wear masks. DHS officials allow them to conceal their identities out of concern the agents will be doxxed, despite the risks that their masking could be exacerbating tensions with civilians.",
      "\"With the amount of cameras out there, social media, so on and so forth, they are going to get doxxed,\" Vitello said. \"And I can tell you having to call your wife and tell her to lock the door 'cause you just received a threat is a terrible feeling.\"",
      "Using \"OC\" or pepper spray",
      "Oleoresin Capsicum, also called OC spray or pepper spray, is what's considered a \"soft technique,\" says Vitello, meaning \"it hurts, but it doesn't injure.\"",
      "A soft technique \"is appropriate when a subject is passively non-compliant,\" he said. In that situation, agents have given \"very clear verbal commands\" to people to put their hands up. When they fail to do so, Vitello says, \"you've demonstrated yourself to be passively non-compliant.\"",
      "Trainees are instructed to create a distance from a subject \"greater than six feet\" and to aim for the eyes because \"that's what is going to incapacitate you.\"",
      "Deploying pepper balls",
      "Pepper balls, which are filled with OC, are intended to be fired from launchers, and they burst on impact. They're most often used during protests.",
      "Vitello said, \"You want to aim for the chest. You want to aim for the stomach. You want to aim for those areas. We teach our folks not to aim at the face, right?\" Because that \"will do a significant amount of damage.\" The face and groin areas are to be avoided, he said.",
      "In October, pressed on whether firing from elevated positions violates DHS policy, CBP Commander at Large Gregory Bovino insisted, \"It doesn't matter where you fire from\u2026 that is a less lethal device for area saturation.\" As for shots striking protesters above the waist, he said, \"If someone strays into a pepper ball, then that's on them. Don't protest and don't trespass.\"",
      "Asked to weigh in on Bovino's statement, at the time, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said, \"ICE and CBP are trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves.\"",
      "The baton, \"a fantastic de-escalation tool\"",
      "Officers are trained to use the baton for less-lethal force applications around large muscle groups and the peroneal pressure points around the legs.",
      "But \"the head, neck, sternum and spine are what we call deadly force areas,\" Vitello said. \"So that is a less lethal tool that can become lethal as necessary,\" if, for instance, a subject draws a knife.",
      "He calls the baton \"a fantastic de-escalation tool,\" and told CBS News, \"I have drawn my Baton countless times in the field. I have never had to hit anybody with it,\" because coupled with \"a strong command\u2026, they listen.\"",
      "Many high-profile incidents under scrutiny have involved CBP agents, who are traditionally trained for border enforcement and interdiction rather than targeted immigration operations in major U.S. cities or civil unrest situations.",
      "\"A completely different environment\"",
      "John Sandweg, who was acting general counsel of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and acting director of ICE, said CBP also trains its agents in New Mexico along the border and operates in a very different environment from other agencies, often in dangerous situations in the desert apprehending groups of smugglers and members of drug cartels.",
      "\"Of all the agencies, the most concerning to me and others has been the border patrol presence. You're just trained that it's okay to be so aggressive because you're just operating in a completely different environment,\" Sandweg said.",
      "\"CBP and ICE personnel are being asked to do a different kind of enforcement mission, which is really large scale sweeps of densely populated civilian areas with less training and perhaps not the right training versus the more targeted set of enforcement actions that they have historically engaged in,\" said CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd. \"And if they are going to move into these large scale sweeps and at large arrests in civilian areas, they need a different kind of training to minimize risk to the public and minimize risk to themselves.\"",
      "According to current and former DHS officials, including Vinograd, operations in Minneapolis also reflect a broader shift in how the federal government is operating during protests, relying on immigration agents and officers to perform widening sweeps in public spaces such as gas stations and restaurants. The sweeps, in addition to crowd-management responsibilities, are typically dealt with by local police, who often have more experience and training in de-escalating large demonstrations and tamping down civil unrest.",
      "Sandweg also said the Border Patrol has no business operating in a city like Minneapolis because their training is geared more toward encountering drug cartels and migrants along the border.",
      "\"They are trained to operate with a high degree of aggression because that's what you need to train them, to let them do their job safely to maximize their protection,\" he said. \"But you take those experiences and that training and you say, 'okay, now your job is to decide where is that line? What constitutes unlawful impeding a federal agent in the performance of his duties versus what constitutes first amendment protected speech?' That's an incredibly difficult thing I think for any law enforcement officer, especially for one who just never encounters that in his career and is not really trained to deal with that.\"",
      "Sandweg thinks the Trump administration has encouraged a more aggressive approach to these operations.",
      "\"They were very much supportive of this,\" he said. \"They were quick to, you know, say everything the officers did was completely justified. I feel like [it] created an 'us versus them' mentality. We lost sight of the fact that DHS and ICE and CBP are agencies that serve the United States of America \u2014 they're to promote public safety.\"",
      "Accountability",
      "In December, Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee formally asked the Government Accountability Office to examine DHS's rapid hiring and training surge, signaling growing congressional oversight interest as expands enforcement staffing at an unprecedented pace.",
      "Several House Democrats are pushing to include language in this year's DHS funding bill that would increase training requirements for ICE officers, and Senate Democrats are threatening to block a package to fund major parts of the government this week, following the deadly shootings of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday.",
      "But a partial government shutdown would likely have little impact on the administration's ongoing immigration enforcement operations, since the relevant DHS agencies received a massive funding infusion in President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act last year.",
      "Leaders of the three major immigration enforcement agencies are set to testify before a pair of House and Senate committees in February.",
      "Todd Lyons, the acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement; Rodney Scott, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection; and Joseph Edlow, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, are scheduled to appear before the House Homeland Security Committee on Feb. 10, and then testify before the Senate Homeland Security Committee two days later on Feb. 12.",

    "story": [
      "A growing number of Republicans are questioning or criticizing the Trump administration's response to the killing of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse who was fatally shot by Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis on Saturday.",
      "The criticism has extended beyond the handful of Republicans who are known for periodically differing from President Trump. Some Trump allies are also among those questioning immigration agents' tactics or the Department of Homeland Security's handling of the shooting. At minimum, they are calling for an investigation into Pretti's shooting.",
      "Two Senate Republicans \u2014 Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 called for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to step down Tuesday, with Tillis calling Noem \"incompetent.\" Mr. Trump has publicly stood by Noem, and sources told CBS News she's expected to keep her job.",
      "GOP lawmakers accuse Trump administration of rushing to judgment",
      "Some Republicans have chafed at the fact that top Trump administration officials almost immediately argued the shooting was justified and accused Pretti of threatening federal agents.",
      "Hours after the shooting, Noem alleged Pretti \"approached\" Border Patrol agents with a gun and \"violently resisted\" after officers tried to disarm him. But videos show Pretti was holding up a cellphone, not his gun, when he was approached by agents. Pretti was being held on the ground when an officer appeared to remove a gun from Pretti's waistband just moments before another agent fired the first shot.",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called Pretti a \"would-be assassin\" and a \"domestic terrorist,\" without offering any evidence, and Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino accused Pretti of trying to \"massacre law enforcement.\" Police have said Pretti was a legal gun owner with a permit to carry. He had no criminal record.",
      "GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said on his podcast that the Trump administration could improve \"the tone with which they're describing this.\"",
      "\"Escalating the rhetoric doesn't help, and it actually loses credibility,\" the senator said on Monday's episode of \"Verdict with Ted Cruz.\" \"And so I would encourage the administration to be more measured, to recognize the tragedy and to say, we don't want anyone, anyone's lives, to be lost, and the politicians who are pouring gasoline on this fire, they need to stop.\"",
      "Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah specifically criticized Noem.",
      "\"I disagree with Secretary Noem's premature DHS response, which came before all the facts were known and weakened confidence,\" Curtis wrote on X, calling for a \"transparent, independent investigation\" and for \"those responsible\" to be \"held accountable.\"",
      "Over the weekend, Tillis\u00a0said administration officials who were rushing to judgment and trying to \"shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump's legacy.\"",
      "Focus on Pretti's gun frustrates some Republicans",
      "A few Trump administration officials have highlighted the fact that Pretti was apparently carrying a handgun before he was shot \u2014 drawing pushback from gun rights groups and their traditional GOP allies in Congress.",
      "Bill Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, argued on X that law enforcement is often \"legally justified\" in shooting someone who approaches with a gun. And FBI Director Kash Patel said on Fox News that \"no one who wants to be peaceful shows up at a protest with a firearm that is loaded with two full magazines.\"",
      "Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky suggested the FBI was \"adopting every leftist gun-banner talking point\" and said Essayli may not be fit for the job.",
      "\"Carrying a firearm is not a death sentence, it's a Constitutionally protected God-given right, and if you don't understand this you have no business in law enforcement or government,\" Massie said.",
      "Essayli's comments were also criticized by the National Rifle Association, which called them \"dangerous and wrong.\"",
      "Sen. Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, said he also supports \"a full and impartial investigation\" into Pretti's death, and pointed specifically to gun rights.",
      "\"His family, law-abiding citizens exercising their Second Amendment right and the trust of the American people deserve a fair process,\" he said.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana wrote, seemingly in response to the shooting: \"Your Second Amendment rights don't disappear when you exercise your other rights. The Constitution is crystal clear: 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.'\"",
      "Shooting described as \"shocking\" and \"disturbing\"",
      "Murkowski\u00a0called Pretti's killing \"shocking\" and said it should \"raise serious questions\" about \"the adequacy of immigration-enforcement training and the instructions officers are given on carrying out their mission.\"",
      "Cassidy, who is facing a Trump-backed primary challenge this year, wrote on X: \"The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing. The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska called the shooting a \"horrifying situation.\"",
      "\"My support for funding ICE remains the same. Enforcing our immigration laws makes our streets safer. It also protects our national security. But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble,\" said Ricketts. \"I expect a prioritized, transparent investigation into this incident.\"",
      "And GOP Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas said he's \"troubled by the events that have unfolded.\"",
      "Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt called Pretti's death a \"real tragedy\" in an interview on CNN. He argued most Americans want Mr. Trump to address immigration, but urged the administration to define its \"endgame,\" which he said can't be to \"deport every single non-U.S. citizen.\"",
      "\"I think the death of Americans, what we're seeing on TV, it's causing deep concerns over federal tactics and accountability,\" he said. \"Americans don't like what they're seeing right now.\"",
      "When Texas Gov. Greg Abbott was asked on a talk radio show about ICE's rocky approval ratings, the Trump-allied governor said the White House should \"recalibrate\" and \"maybe work from a different direction.\"",
      "He said immigration agencies should \"go about their job in a more structured way to make sure that they are going to remove these people without causing all the kinds of problems and fighting in communities that they are experiencing right now.\"",
      "Chris Madel, a Republican who was running for Minnesota governor, ended his bid on Monday. He cited the administration's immigration crackdown in the state as an \"unmitigated disaster.\"",
      "\"United States citizens, particularly those of color, live in fear. United States citizens are carrying papers to prove their citizenship. That's wrong. ICE has authorized its agents to raid homes using a civil warrant that need only be signed by a Border Patrol agent. That's unconstitutional and it's wrong,\" he said.",
      "In his announcement, Madel noted he has provided legal advice to Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month.",
      "GOP Sen. Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania called for a \"full investigation\" and said that \"we must enforce our laws in a way that protects the public while maintaining its trust.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she's \"appalled at the violence in Minneapolis\" before turning her attention to an impending fight over a bill to fund DHS for the rest of the fiscal year. She noted that the bill includes funding for body-warn cameras, law enforcement de-escalation training and more oversight for detention facilities \u2014 provisions she said \"would make such incidents less likely to occur.\"",
      "In the wake of Pretti's death, a growing list of Senate Democrats have said they won't vote for the DHS funding bill unless changes are made, posing a problem for lawmakers' plan to bundle it with five other funding bills that have already passed the House. If the Senate doesn't pass that package of bills by the end of the day Friday, a partial government shutdown will begin.",
      "Immigration officials to face questioning as Republicans press for investigation",
      "Many Republicans have called for a comprehensive investigation into Pretti's killing.",
      "Patel has said ICE's Homeland Security Investigations branch will lead a federal probe into the shooting. Current and former agency officials told CBS News that approach is unusual since it tasks ICE with investigating the actions of another DHS agency: Border Patrol.",
      "Meanwhile, the Republican chairmen of the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees have requested that the heads of ICE, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services appear before the panels in the coming weeks.",
      "The letters, sent by Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Rep. Andrew Gabarino of New York, did not mention the killings of Pretti and Good, but would provide a chance for lawmakers to question officials about the Trump administration's controversial immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota.",
      "\"As you know, the Department of Homeland Security has been provided an exceptional amount of funding to secure our borders and enforce our immigration laws,\" Paul said in the letters, which were dated Monday. \"Congress has an obligation to conduct oversight of those tax dollars and ensure the funding is used to accomplish the mission, provide proper support for our law enforcement, and, most importantly, protect the American people.\"",

      "Top Justice Department officials said Tuesday they expect to finish reviewing and publishing files on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein soon, but cannot provide a specific timeline.",
      "A federal law required the Justice Department to release its massive trove of records on Epstein by mid-December. The department has released over 100,000 pages so far, but it has acknowledged that the vast majority of documents that may relate to Epstein still haven't been made public, arguing more time is needed to ensure the files are properly redacted to protect the identities of survivors of Epstein's abuse.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi and other top Justice Department officials updated the judges in Epstein and his convicted associate Ghislaine Maxwell's cases on their efforts to scour through the documents in a letter sent Tuesday.",
      "They said they have made \"substantial progress,\" with hundreds of department employees manually reviewing millions of pages of records and, in some cases, conducting electronic name searches to find and redact hundreds of potential victims' identities.",
      "\"The Department currently expects that it will complete these processes with respect to substantially all of the potentially responsive documents, including publication to the Epstein Library website, in the near term,\" said the letter.",
      "The Justice Department said it \"is not able to provide a specific date at this time,\" and warned it may need to make \"additional efforts to ensure the protection of victim identifying information.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Justice Department told a judge it had released 12,285 documents so far, totaling 125,575 pages, but more than 2 million documents were still \"in various stages of review\" \u2014 meaning it had reviewed less than 1% of its total possible records on Epstein. Some of those still-unreviewed documents may be duplicates, the department cautioned.",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed in mid-November, gave the Justice Department 30 days to release files on Epstein and Maxwell. That includes decades-old records from the earliest investigations into Epstein, documents from Epstein and Maxwell's 2019 and 2020 sex trafficking cases and files related to Epstein's death by suicide while in pre-trial custody.",
      "The law allows the government to redact the files under limited circumstances, including to take out victims' names. The judge in Maxwell's case has also required the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan to \"personally certify\" that any grand jury materials that are released have been \"rigorously reviewed\" to take out victims' identities.",
      "Some lawmakers have sharply criticized the Justice Department for the pace of its review, given that Congress required the files to be made public by Dec. 12.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who cosponsored the Epstein Files Transparency Act, suggested this month that the judge in Maxwell's case appoint an independent \"special master\" to ensure the files are made public.",
      "\"The Department of Justice is openly defying the law by refusing to release the full Epstein files,\" Khanna said in a statement. \"Millions of files are being kept from the public.\"",
      "Massie argued the Justice Department \"has shown it cannot be trusted with making the disclosures required by law.\"",
      "The Justice Department pushed back, arguing the law does not give Khanna and Massie the right to seek relief in court. The department has defended its handling of the files, saying \"careful, manual review\" is needed to protect victims.",
      "The judge overseeing Maxwell's case ruled last week that he didn't have authority to oversee the Justice Department's compliance with the law. He added that nothing is stopping Khanna and Massie from filing a separate lawsuit against the government, and said the two lawmakers raised \"legitimate concerns about whether DOJ is faithfully complying with federal law.\"",

    "summary": "Two U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents fired their weapons during the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti, according to a government report sent to Congress and obtained by CBS News that does not mention Pretti reaching for his firearm.",
    "story": [
      "Two U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents fired their weapons during the fatal shooting of Minneapolis ICU nurse Alex Pretti over the weekend, according to a government report sent to Congress and obtained by CBS News that does not mention Pretti reaching for his firearm.",
      "The report was shared with congressional officials Tuesday by CBP, which said it was based on a \"preliminary review\" by its Office of Professional Responsibility. It provides the most comprehensive official account yet of Pretti's killing, which has triggered widespread outcry from members of both parties.",
      "According to the report to Congress, CBP agents were conducting an operation in Minneapolis on Saturday morning when an officer was \"confronted by two female civilians blowing whistles.\" The officer ordered the women to \"move out of the roadway,\" the report said. That's when CBP agents first encountered Pretti.",
      "\"The [CBP officer] pushed them both away and one of the females ran to a male, later identified as 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a US citizen,\" the report said. \"The [CBP officer] attempted to move the woman and Pretti out of the roadway. The woman and Pretti did not move. The [CBP officer] deployed his oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray towards both Pretti and the woman.\"",
      "CBP agents then \"attempted to take Pretti into custody,\" according to the report.",
      "\"Pretti resisted CBP personnel's efforts and a struggle ensued. During the struggle, a BPA yelled, 'He's got a gun!' multiple times,\" the report said.",
      "\"Approximately five seconds later, a [Border Patrol agent] discharged his CBP-issued Glock 19 and a [CBP officer] also discharged his CBP-issued Glock 47 at Pretti. After the shooting, a BPA advised he had possession of Pretti's firearm,\" CBP added. \"The BPA subsequently cleared and secured Pretti's firearm in his vehicle.\"",
      "The new information provided by CBP differs from the initial accounts offered by the Department of Homeland Security, which said in a statement\u00a0over the weekend that one Border Patrol agent had fired \"defensive shots.\"",
      "In that statement, DHS also said Pretti \"approached\" the CBP agents with a 9mm semi-automatic firearm. But CBP's report to Congress makes no claim that Pretti tried to reach for his firearm.",
      "In the hours after the shooting, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem alleged that Pretti approached federal agents with a gun in what she described as an effort to kill officers, and Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino accused Pretti of trying to \"massacre law enforcement\" \u2014 allegations that did not appear in the Office of Professional Responsibility's report.",
      "The government's response to Pretti's death \u2014 the second fatal shooting by federal agents in Minneapolis this month \u2014 has drawn intense scrutiny in recent days, as videos of the incident\u00a0appear to contradict officials' claims that Pretti approached law enforcement with his gun.",
      "Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara has said Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.",
      "The report does not state that Pretti's gun discharged accidentally, one theory that has circulated in the wake of the shooting. President Trump alleged in a Wall Street Journal article that Pretti was carrying a \"dangerous and unpredictable gun\" that \"goes off when people don't know it.\"",
      "It also revealed that U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel removed and stored Pretti's firearm in a government vehicle, a decision now raising broader concerns about the integrity of the investigation.",
      "According to a CBP report sent to congressional officials, a Border Patrol agent reported taking possession of Pretti's gun immediately after the shooting and later clearing and securing the firearm inside a vehicle. The report does not specify whether the weapon was photographed in place or logged with a documented chain of custody at the scene.",
      "CBS News previously reported that federal investigators have no documented chain of custody for Pretti's handgun, with officials saying the firearm was placed on the seat of a vehicle rather than sealed in a required plastic evidence bag and labeled with standard identifying details such as date, item description, and handler name.",
      "The report to Congress confirmed ICE's Homeland Security Investigations branch is investigating the shooting, a move current and former agency officials described as highly unusual for an office that has historically not investigated use-of-force incidents. The report said CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility is also reviewing the incident internally, and that the DHS Inspector General has been notified.",
      "CBP told CBS News in a statement: \"These notifications reflect standard Customs and Border Protection protocol and are issued in accordance with existing procedures. They provide an initial outline of an event that took place and do not convey any definitive conclusion or investigative findings. They are factual reports \u2013 not analytical judgments \u2013 and are provided to inform Congress and to promote transparency.\"",
      "The full report is below:",
      "The following statement pertains to an in-custody death that occurred on Saturday, January 24, 2026, in Minneapolis, MN. This information is based on a preliminary review by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) Investigative Operations Directorate (IOD) and may be updated and clarified as additional details become available. It is being provided to Committee staff concurrently with CBP senior leadership to ensure timely reporting.",
      "CBP OPR IOD established the following information and timeline based on a preliminary review of body worn camera footage and CBP documentation.",
      "On January 24, 2026, United States Border Patrol (USBP) Border Patrol Agents (BPAs) and Customs and Border Protection Officers (CBPOs) supporting Operation Metro Surge were conducting enforcement actions near the intersection of Nicollet Ave. and 26th St. in Minneapolis, MN. Several civilians were in the area yelling and blowing whistles. BPAs and CBPOs made several verbal requests for the civilians to stay on the sidewalks and out of the roadway.",
      "At approximately 9:00 a.m., a CBPO was confronted by two female civilians blowing whistles. The CBPO ordered the female civilians to move out of the roadway, and the female civilians did not move. The CBPO pushed them both away and one of the females ran to a male, later identified as 37-year-old Alex Jeffrey Pretti, a US citizen. The CBPO attempted to move the woman and Pretti out of the roadway. The woman and Pretti did not move. The CBPO deployed his oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray towards both Pretti and the woman.",
      "CBP personnel attempted to take Pretti into custody. Pretti resisted CBP personnel's efforts and a struggle ensued. During the struggle, a BPA yelled, \"He's got a gun!\" multiple times. \u00a0Approximately five seconds later, a BPA discharged his CBP-issued Glock 19 and a CBPO also discharged his CBP-issued Glock 47 at Pretti. After the shooting, a BPA advised he had possession of Pretti's firearm. The BPA subsequently cleared and secured Pretti's firearm in his vehicle.",
      "At approximately 9:02 a.m., CBP personnel cut Pretti's clothing and provided medical aid to him by placing chest seals on his wounds. At approximately 9:05 a.m., Minneapolis Fire Department Emergency Medical Services (MFD EMS) emergency medical technicians (EMTs) arrived and assumed primary medical care for Pretti.",
      "At approximately 9:14 a.m., MFD EMTs placed Pretti in an MFD EMS ambulance and he was subsequently transported to Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC). At approximately 9:32 a.m., HCMC medical personnel pronounced Pretti deceased.",
      "CBP OPR IOD was advised that an autopsy would be conducted by medical personnel from the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office. CBP OPR IOD will request the official findings upon completion.",
      "Homeland Security Investigations is investigating the incident and CBP OPR IOD is reviewing it. The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General was notified.",

      "Washington \u2014 Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said Tuesday he has lost all confidence in \"incompetent\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who has faced intense scrutiny over a fatal shooting by immigration agents over the weekend.",
      "\"I think my position is pretty unambiguous,\" Tillis told reporters. \"I think she should go.\"",
      "Tillis was the first Republican to call for Noem's ouster, though other members of his party have not been shy about criticizing the Trump administration's response to\u00a0the killing of Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse who was fatally shot by two Customs and Border Protection agents in Minneapolis on Saturday.",
      "Tillis, who is retiring, said his doubts about Noem go beyond her department's handling of the immigration clampdown in Minnesota.",
      "\"I can't think of any point of pride over the last year,\" Tillis said. \"She has taken this administration into the ground on an issue that we should own. We should own the issue of border security and immigration. But they have destroyed that for Republicans, something that got the president elected. They have destroyed it through their incompetence.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska later echoed the sentiments shared by Tillis.",
      "\"I've lost confidence in her,\" Murkowski told reporters.\"We would be better served with new leadership.\"",
      "Murkowski and Tillis are known for periodically breaking with the Trump administration. Both senators voted to confirm Noem last year, which Murkowski pointed to on Tuesday.",
      "\"I had great hopes for her in the department and I've been disappointed,\" she said.",
      "President Trump told reporters Tuesday that Noem is \"doing a very good job\" and is not stepping down, crediting her with a dramatic drop in border crossings over the last year. A day earlier, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Noem \"still has the utmost confidence and trust of the president of the United States.\"",
      "Asked for comment on Tillis and Murkowski's calls for Noem to step down, the Department of Homeland Security referred CBS News to the White House, which pointed to Mr. Trump and Leavitt's remarks expressing support for Noem.",
      "CBS News\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier that Noem is facing internal scrutiny within the administration but is expected to keep her job, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.",
      "Noem was at the White House on Monday and faced questions about how DHS handled the Pretti shooting and its response, sources said. Her focus is expected to shift from immigration enforcement operations in the interior of the country to securing the southern border and other priorities.",
      "An effort to impeach Noem in the House is rapidly gaining support among Democrats, including from party leadership. But at least three Republicans would need to join every Democrat for the effort to be successful, which so far appears highly unlikely.",

    "summary": "Sources say Iowa is seen as a key part of the Trump team's strategy to keep the House in GOP hands.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump rallied voters and touted his economic agenda in Iowa on Tuesday, as sources say the state is a key part of his team's strategy for helping Republicans hold onto power in the House.",
      "The visit to the Des Moines area was the president's first campaign-style trip of 2026. Democrats are hopeful that they'll have the support to win back the House in the November midterm elections, while Republicans scramble to maintain control.",
      "\"If we lose the midterms, you'll lose so many of the things that we're talking about, so many of the assets that we're talking about, so many of the tax cuts that we're talking about,\" Mr. Trump said in a rally-like speech to supporters at the Horizon Events Center in Clive, Iowa. \"And it would lead to very bad things. We've got to win the midterms. I mean, I'm here because I love Iowa, but I'm here because we're starting the campaign to win the midterms.\"",
      "The president has endorsed three of Iowa's four Republican House members \u2014 Reps. Ashley Hinson, Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Zach Nunn. The fourth, Rep. Randy Feenstra, traveled with Mr. Trump throughout the day. Feenstra isn't seeking reelection because he's running for governor.",
      "All six members of Iowa's congressional delegation \u2014 four House members and two senators \u2014 are Republicans. At this point, Mr. Trump's support among Republicans remains strong: A CBS News poll from mid-January found that nationally, Mr. Trump has a 90% approval rating among Americans who identify as Republican. The same poll found that 69% of those who identify as independent disapprove of the president. According to one source, the president intends to campaign as if he were on the ticket.",
      "Mr. Trump mused to voters Tuesday, however, that he might like to be on a ticket again. Even though he isn't on the ballot and can't run for president again, Mr. Trump began his speech by reminiscing about past elections and teasing a fourth bid for the presidency.",
      "\"Should we do it a fourth time?\" he goaded the crowd with a smile.",
      "Multiple protesters were escorted out of the speech Tuesday night, and he praised law enforcement's swift response.",
      "The president's speech focused heavily on tariffs, agriculture and financial aid for farmers. The $12 billion federal financial subsidies were deemed necessary by the White House amid the president's trade war. China halted soybean and corn purchases from the U.S. in response to Mr. Trump's high tariff rates, hurting U.S. farmers.",
      "Mr. Trump visited a local restaurant before his speech, greeting diners and speaking briefly to reporters. He told reporters he plans to travel a lot ahead of the midterms.",
      "\"I'm going around,\" Mr. Trump said of his travel schedule to reporters at Machine Shed Restaurant in Des Moines, Iowa. \"And I'm going around because hopefully we win the midterms.\"",
      "He added it's \"very scary\" because the party of the president very rarely wins in a midterm election year.",
      "The state will have an open race for governor after Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds last year said she would not seek a third term. Multiple Republicans are running in the GOP primary. On the Democratic side, Rob Sand leads the field and has so far raised roughly $9.5 million in 2025, over twice Feenstra's $4.3 million.",
      "Nunn was likely to run for governor, too, until Mr. Trump asked him to seek reelection in Iowa's 3rd Congressional District, a competitive seat. Nunn won his seat by less than four points in 2024, a much more favorable year for Republicans than 2026 is expected to be. Democrats led Republicans on the generic ballot in recent polls.",
      "Mr. Trump has not yet endorsed any candidates in the Iowa 4th Congressional District, Feenstra's seat, or in the Iowa 3rd District, where Hinson is seeking to replace Sen. Joni Ernst, who is not running for reelection.",

      "As of Tuesday afternoon, more than 160 of the 213 House Democrats had signed on to the resolution to impeach Noem, according to Kelly's office.",
      "A simple majority is needed for impeachment, meaning at least three House Republicans would need to vote with all Democrats to approve any articles of impeachment, which is highly unlikely. Even if the effort made it out of the House, it would face steep odds in the Senate, where a two-thirds majority is needed to convict and remove an official from office.",

      "The threat of impeachment comes as the Department of Homeland Security faces bipartisan backlash over its handling of and response to Pretti's killing.",

      "Composer Philip Glass has called off the premiere of his new symphony at the Kennedy Center, citing the performing arts venue's new leadership, the latest high-profile cancellation since a team picked by President Trump overhauled the center's operations and moved to change the venue's name to the Trump-Kennedy Center.",
      "\"Symphony No. 15 is a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, and the values of the Kennedy Center today are in direct conflict with the message of the Symphony,\" Glass said in a statement posted to X on Tuesday. \"Therefore, I feel an obligation to withdraw this Symphony premiere from the Kennedy Center under its current leadership.\"",
      "The symphony, titled \"Lincoln,\" was scheduled to premiere at the Kennedy Center in a mid-June performance by the National Symphony Orchestra.",
      "Roma Daravi, the center's vice president of public relations, told CBS News in a statement: \"We have no place for politics in the arts, and those calling for boycotts based on politics are making the wrong decision.\"",
      "\"We have not cancelled a single show,\" Daravi continued. \"Leftist activists are pushing artists to cancel but the public wants artists to perform and create\u2014not cancel under pressure from political insiders that benefit from creating division.\"",
      "National Symphony Orchestra Executive Director Jean Davidson said the Washington, D.C.-based orchestra has \"great admiration\" for Glass and was \"surprised to learn about his decision at the same time as the press.\"",
      "Shortly after returning to the White House last year, Mr. Trump sought to reshape the Kennedy Center. He quickly replaced multiple members of the Kennedy Center's board of trustees, made himself chairman and chose ally Richard Grenell for the role of president.",
      "Since then, a litany of artists have canceled their appearances at the center, with the hit musical \"Hamilton\" calling off a planned run and actress Issa Rae canceling a sold-out show.",
      "Last month, the center's board voted to rename the organization as the Trump-Kennedy Center, and the president's name was added to the exterior of the building. The move drew outrage from Democratic lawmakers, who argued the name can't be changed without legislation because the center was created by Congress.",
      "The name change appeared to trigger another wave of cancellations, including a Christmas Eve \"Jazz Jam\" hosted by drummer Chuck Redd, a New Year's Eve performance by jazz ensemble The Cookers and a mid-January concert by folk singer Kristy Lee.",
      "Grenell referred to the artists who canceled their shows as \"far left political activists\" who \"were booked by the previous far-left leadership.\"",

      "A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily barred federal immigration officials from deporting 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father or transferring them away from the Texas region where they're currently held.",
      "Liam and his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Ramos, were taken into custody in Minnesota earlier this month as part of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation captured on videos and photos that sparked outrage. Images that garnered national attention depicted Liam wearing a blue bunny hat and his school backpack.",
      "The two are currently detained at the Dilley ICE detention center, a facility in Texas designed to house immigrant families with underage children who have been accused of violating federal immigration law.",
      "CBS News exclusively reported last week that the government could not immediately deport Liam and his father, because they have pending immigration court cases that have not been fully adjudicated.",
      "In his order Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Fred Biery blocked any attempt to deport the family \"until further order from this Court.\" He also prohibited ICE from transferring the son and father from the Western District of Texas \"during the pendency of this litigation and until further Order of this Court.\"",
      "The boy and his father were taken into ICE custody on Jan. 20 in the Minneapolis area, where the Trump administration has deployed thousands of federal immigration agents to oversee the largest operation in the history of the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "DHS has said Liam's father is an Ecuadorian immigrant living in the U.S. illegally and has accused him of trying to evade ICE officers when they sought to arrest them. An attorney for the family said Liam's father appears to lack a criminal record, an allegation DHS has not yet contested.",
      "Last week, Marcos Charles, the head of ICE's deportation branch, said his officers targeted Liam's father \u2014 not the child \u2014 during an arrest operation on Jan. 20. Charles said Liam was with his father inside a vehicle when ICE officers approached them.",
      "Charles said Liam's father tried to escape on foot, \"abandoning his child in the middle of winter in a vehicle.\" He said an officer stayed with Liam, while others arrested his father. ICE officers \"cared for\" Liam and took him to a drive-through restaurant, Charles added.",
      "ICE officers tried to get Liam's family to take the child but the \"people inside refused to take him in and open the door,\" according to Charles. He noted his officers were \"heartbroken\" by the incident.",
      "Sergio Amezcua, a pastor who said he's spoken to Liam's mother, said she \"was terrified\" during the incident.",
      "\"ICE agents were trying to use the baby for her to come out of her house,\" Amezcua said on CNN. \"But the neighbors step[ped] up. Neighbors advised her not to do it.\"",

    "summary": "The AAP is recommending immunization against 18 diseases.\u200b Earlier this month, the CDC reduced its recommendations for childhood vaccines to 11 diseases.",
    "story": [
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics released its recommendations for childhood vaccines on Monday, breaking significantly with the guidance released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this month.",
      "The AAP is continuing to recommend\u00a0immunization against 18 diseases, including RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rotavirus, influenza and meningococcal disease. The CDC had reduced its recommendations for childhood vaccines to 11 diseases.",
      "\"The AAP will continue to provide recommendations for immunizations that are rooted in science and are in the best interest of the health of infants, children and adolescents of this country,\" AAP President Andrew Racine said in a statement.",
      "Dr. Amanda Kravitz, a pediatrician at New York's Weill Cornell Medicine, told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil the AAP is \"still recommending all of the vaccines that we have been recommending for many, many years.\"",
      "\"So, there are no changes to the old vaccine schedule based on what the AAP is currently recommending,\" Kravitz said.",
      "Both the AAP and CDC recommend vaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, human papillomavirus (HPV) and varicella (chickenpox). Some vaccines, such as the MMR shot for measles, mumps and rubella, protect against multiple diseases.",
      "The CDC's revised guidance recommended that only children in high-risk categories receive immunizations for RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, dengue, meningococcal ACWY and meningococcal B. The AAP still recommends all of these, except for the dengue vaccine, which it only recommends for some children who are 9 to 16 years old, live in areas where the disease is endemic and have previously been infected. It also noted distribution of the dengue vaccine was discontinued in the U.S. last year due to low demand.",
      "The CDC had also said parents of children not in high-risk groups who want to vaccinate against COVID-19, influenza, meningococcal disease, hepatitis A and hepatitis B should base that decision on \"shared clinical decision-making\" with physicians.",
      "\"I want to emphasize this is unprecedented for the AAP and the CDC to diverge. They have been working in concert for decades,\" said Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News.",
      "\"The new APP vaccine guidance is basically the old CDC vaccine guidance \u2014 so the guidance that we had, the recommendations we had prior to the tTump administration and Secretary Kennedy running things at HHS and CDC,\" she said.",
      "Kravitz advised, \"It's important that you partner with your pediatrician. We are here to help you. We want to try to rid some of that confusion from families. So, we want you to bring your questions to us. We, as pediatricians, are going to follow the AAP recommendations, but we also want to have open lines of communication with our families.\"",
      "The AAP called the CDC's recent change in guidance \"dangerous and unnecessary\" at the time of its release.",
      "\"The AAP formerly partnered with the CDC to create a unified set of vaccine recommendations, but recent changes to the CDC immunization schedule depart from longstanding medical evidence and no longer offer the optimal way to prevent illnesses in children,\" the AAP said Monday. \"By contrast, the AAP childhood and adolescent immunization schedules continue to recommend immunizations based on the specific disease risks and health care delivery in the United States.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, said in a statement Monday, \"The updated CDC childhood schedule continues to protect children against serious diseases while aligning U.S. guidance with international norms,\" adding it would \"work with states and clinicians to ensure families have clear, accurate information to make their own informed decisions.\"",
      "Kravitz said insurance will still cover vaccines no longer broadly recommended by the CDC, like the flu and COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "\"The way the CDC recommended them is there is still the option to get those vaccines if you'd like them, so insurance should cover every vaccine as long as parents want them,\" she said.",
      "The changes in the CDC childhood vaccine recommendations followed\u00a0a controversial December recommendation\u00a0on when children should receive their first dose of the\u00a0hepatitis B vaccine. For more than 30 years, the CDC advised that the first dose be given within 24 hours of birth. The CDC's vaccine advisory panel, which has been\u00a0hand-picked\u00a0by HHS Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, voted to recommend delaying the shot until a child is 2 months old for those born to mothers who test negative for the virus.",
      "In an interview with CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes earlier this month, Kennedy insisted, \"We're not taking vaccines away from anybody. If you want to get the vaccine, you can get it. It's gonna be fully covered by insurance, just like it was before.\"",
      "But Kennedy did concede there is now an added step to getting children the flu vaccine, as it requires consultation with a physician first, rather than it being freely administered at a pharmacy, and he said it might be \"a better thing\" if fewer people get the flu vaccine.",

      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations branch is leading the federal investigation into the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, FBI Director Kash Patel said.",
      "HSI will be assisted by the FBI, according to multiple U.S. officials briefed on the investigation. U.S. Customs and Border Protection is also conducting an internal administrative review through its Office of Professional Responsibility, as per standard practice, the officials said.",
      "Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse at the Department of Veterans Affairs, was shot and killed by an ICE agent around 9 a.m. local time Saturday in south Minneapolis.",
      "The decision to place HSI in the lead investigative role is unusual and has raised questions among current and former federal law enforcement officials, given that HSI is not typically tasked with investigating officer-involved shootings and is not structured or equipped to handle core elements of such cases, including ballistics analysis, forensic processing, firearm examinations, video review and large-scale witness canvassing.",
      "HSI historically has investigated crimes with an international or immigration nexus, including human trafficking, drug smuggling, child exploitation and the theft of stolen artifacts.",
      "Patel said on Fox News, \"All the pieces of the investigation are being led by DHS in HSI, and I don't want to comment on their ongoing investigation.\"",
      "Patel added that investigators are focused on \"mostly scientific evidence,\" including fingerprints, DNA, how many rounds were fired and other physical evidence associated with the firearm.",
      "A former senior ICE and HSI official told CBS News that the approach marks a clear break from prior administrations and long-standing practice. The official said it makes little sense for the Department of Homeland Security to oversee a criminal investigation into a fatal shooting involving its own personnel rather than turning the matter over to an outside entity, describing the current setup as highly irregular.",
      "\"That's not the way it was done before this admin,\" one former senior ICE official told CBS News, calling the Trump administration's move \"not normal.\"",
      "The former official noted HSI agents are criminal investigators, but said a probe into a Border Patrol shooting should be handled by an entity outside of the Department of Homeland Security. Both ICE and Border Patrol are overseen by DHS.",
      "Any potential prosecution would still have to be handled by the Justice Department.",
      "Pretti is the second person killed by federal agents in recent weeks in Minneapolis, after Renee Good\u00a0was fatally shot\u00a0on Jan. 7. In both cases, administration officials said the agents were acting in self-defense, but eyewitness accounts and videos appeared to contradict some of their claims.",
      "DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti approached several officers with a handgun. They attempted to disarm him, but he \"reacted violently,\" and \"fearing for his life and the lives of his fellow officers around him, an agent fired defensive shots,\" she said.",
      "Bystander videos\u00a0reviewed and verified by CBS News show Pretti was holding a phone in his right hand and nothing in his left before the shooting.\u00a0Multiple videos\u00a0show\u00a0a federal agent reaching into the scuffle empty-handed and emerging with a gun in his right hand, then turning away from the man when the first shot is fired.",
      "Local officials said Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry, and that his only previous interaction with law enforcement was for traffic violations.\u00a0Under Minnesota law, it's legal to carry a handgun in public if you have a valid permit.",
      "Witnesses who said they were at the scene of the shooting also contradicted accounts of federal officials, with one saying in a sworn declaration submitted in federal court, \"The man did not approach the agents with a gun. He approached them with a camera.\"",
      "He also said \"agents pulled the man on the ground,\" adding, \"I didn't see him touch any of them.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiktok-new-terms-of-service-privacy-geolocation-personal-information/",
    "published": "Wed, 28 Jan 2026 17:08:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Some TikTok users are raising questions about the app's new terms and conditions after the social media platform's split from its China-based parent.",
    "story": [
      "TikTok \u2014\u00a0now in U.S. hands after the social media service split from China-based ByteDance earlier this year \u2014 is raising concerns among some users about its new privacy policy, prompting questions about the scope of its data collection.",
      "TikTok on Jan. 22 confirmed that a new U.S.-based entity was in control of the app, with the venture formed to sidestep a\u00a0federal law that forced ByteDance to either sell its stake in the platform or be cut off from the U.S. market. That same day, the company posted its new user\u00a0terms and conditions and\u00a0privacy policy.",
      "Backlash to the new policies quickly spread on social media, with some users saying they\u00a0deleted the app over privacy fears, while others flagged the changes for their followers. One complaint: a new provision stating that TikTok may collect \"precise location information\" from users' devices if they enable location services in their device settings.",
      "Some social media users\u00a0attacked\u00a0the new privacy policy as \"beyond invasive and predatory,\" while others\u00a0decried the app's \"surveillance.\"",
      "A shift under U.S. owners",
      "TikTok's new geolocation practices are a change from its previous policy under ByteDance, experts said.",
      "\"The change in location data is the most stark because the previous privacy policy had explicitly said that the current versions of the app do not collect precise GPS information,\" Caitriona Fitzgerald, deputy director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), a public interest research center focused on data privacy.",
      "She added, \"Folks should be concerned about that. Your precise location data can be down to your address or even what floor you're on in an apartment building.\"",
      "TikTok updated its privacy policy to include clearer language about location information, and plans to soon allow U.S. users to share their precise location with TikTok or opt out of that feature, according to a TikTok official. The company plans to use the precise location data to provide new services and features to users, the official noted.",
      "TikTok's new ownership includes software maker Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX, which will own a combined 45% of the company.",
      "Another 35% stake in TikTok will be owned by eight other investors, including Dell CEO Michael Dell's personal investment office. ByteDance will retain 19.9% of the business, just below the 20% ownership cap allowed under federal law.",
      "What TikTok collects under its new privacy policy",
      "Some TikTok users are also expressing concern about the types of personal information the app says it may collect, although its previous privacy policy disclosed that it might collect the same types of data. Under both the new and previous policies, TikTok said it may collect users:",
      "\u2022 Racial or ethnic origin\u2022 National origin\u2022 Religious beliefs\u2022 Mental health diagnosis\u2022 Physical health diagnosis\u2022 Sexual life\u2022 Sexual orientation\u2022 Status as transgender\u2022 Status as nonbinary\u2022 Citizenship status\u2022 Immigration status\u2022 Financial information\u2022 Government-issued identification numbers, such as a driver's license number",
      "But the new policy also changes how TikTok describes its handling of sensitive data. The company now states that it \"processes such sensitive personal information in accordance with applicable law.\"",
      "The earlier policy framed this more narrowly, saying it used sensitive information only when needed to run the service or to comply with legal requirements \u2014 for example, using payment details to process a purchase or a driver's license to verify a user's identity.",
      "The new language mirrors that of the\u00a0California Consumer Privacy Act,\u00a0a law that requires businesses to disclose what types of information they collect, including race and ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, and their sex life.",
      "What about geolocation tracking?",
      "The biggest change between TikTok's current and previous privacy policies lies in their treatment of location tracking, which is now explicitly classified as sensitive data in the 2026 version.",
      "\"We may also collect precise location data, depending on your settings and as explained below,\" the latest privacy policy states.",
      "Both the older and newer versions note that TikTok may determine a user's \"approximate location\" based on signals such as their SIM card region or IP address. But the new policy adds that TikTok is also allowed to collect a user's \"precise location\" if the person has enabled location services for TikTok.",
      "The new policy notes that users can \"turn off location services from your device settings at any time.\"",
      "By contrast, the pre-2026 privacy policy explicitly stated that current versions of the app do \"not collect precise or approximate GPS information from U.S. users.\"",
      "TikTok doesn't yet have a toggle to allow people to switch off their precise location data because the company hasn't yet added that tracking functionality to the app, the TikTok official said.",
      "When the app rolls out the feature, users will see a prompt that asks whether they want to share their location, the TikTok official said.",
      "Consumer advocates generally recommend that people turn off precise location tracking within the apps they use. For instance, X users can go to their \"privacy and safety settings\" and then click \"location services\" to see if they have enabled the app to track their exact location. It can be disabled by toggling the switch off.",
      "However, even if precise location tracking is disabled, apps can still narrow down your general location through your IP address,\u00a0according\u00a0to Consumer Reports.",
      "Can users opt out of TikTok's new policies?",
      "Since Jan. 22, when TikTok officially came under U.S. ownership, the app has presented users with a pop-up screen alerting them to the new terms of service and privacy policies. To continue to use the service, users must click \"agree,\" or else they are blocked from using TikTok.",
      "\"If the only choice is to accept the unnecessary collection and use of your location data, your citizenship data and other sensitive data, or not use the app at all, that's not a real choice,\" EPIC's Fitzgerald told CBS News.",
      "Do other social media apps track personal data?",
      "Other social media apps also track personal data, including\u00a0Meta and X. The latter's privacy policy specifies that users can \"choose to share your current precise location or places where you've previously used X by enabling these settings in your account.\"",
      "Americans are notoriously lax about providing apps with access to their personal data, although about 8 in 10 say they're concerned about how corporations use the data they collect about them, Pew Research Center found in a\u00a02023 survey.",
      "Still, more than half of consumers agree to companies' privacy policies without reading them, the study found.",
      "Edited by\n                                        \n                                  Alain  Sherter",

    "summary": "As Ukraine accuses Russia of terrorism with a deadly strike on a train, some defense analysts believe Elon Musk's Starlink may have guided the killer drones.",
    "story": [
      "Kyiv - A Russian drone hit a Ukrainian passenger train traveling in Ukraine's eastern Kharkiv region Tuesday, killing at least five people, according to the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor's Office.",
      "\"In any country, a drone strike on a civilian train would be regarded in the same way - purely as an act of terrorism,\" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a social media post.",
      "Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said in a social media post that, according to preliminary information, the attack involved three Iranian-made Shahed attack drones, which hit the engine and one passenger car, causing a fire.",
      "\"There were 291 passengers on board. People were evacuated as quickly as possible,\" he said, echoing Zelenskyy in calling the strike \"a direct act of Russian terror against civilians. No military target.\"",
      "Russia's government routinely denies targeting civilian infrastructure, but there was no specific reaction from the Kremlin or Russian military to the allegations that it had deliberately struck a train carrying civilians.",
      "Russia using Starlink to deadly effect?",
      "Strikes on Ukrainian civilians and critical infrastructure have intensified in recent months, and experts say Russia has adapted its offensive capabilities to evade Ukraine's air defenses.",
      "Last year, the Ukraine Air War Monitor journal noted an 18% decline in Ukraine's drone interception rate.",
      "Oleksii Balesta, Deputy Minister for Development of Communities and Territories of Ukraine, told CBS News on Wednesday that Russia has been using larger drones in higher quantities, which is increasing the lethality of its strikes.",
      "But according to a recent report from the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for the Study of War, another reason for Russia's deadlier strikes is its use of Starlink satellite systems to more accurately hit targets.",
      "This week, Polish Foreign Minister Rados\u0142aw Sikorski raised the issue with Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX owns and operates the Starlink satellite network. In a post on Musk's platform X, Sikorski asked the American businessman to \"stop the Russians from using Starlinks to target Ukrainian cities.\"",
      "On X, Musk called Sikorski a \"drooling imbecile\" and said that Starlink's terms of service \"do not allow for offensive military use, as it is a civilian commercial system.\" Musk also highlighted Ukraine's use of the Starlink system for military communications.",
      "Two Ukrainian defense analysts have said the train may have been hit by Shaheds - a favorite weapon of Russia amid its ongoing full-scale invasion - equipped with the SpaceX technology.",
      "\"Russia has started using Starlink on other drones, and now is using it on Shaheds as well,\" analyst Olena Kryzhanivska told CBS News on Wednesday. \"The attack yesterday was not surprising at all. It was expected.\"",
      "Serhiy Beskrestnov, a Ukrainian military analyst and expert on drone warfare, said in a social media post Wednesday that the moving train was hit by, \"Shaheds with online control.\"",
      "\"It was not the locomotive, but the center of the train,\" Beskrestnov noted in his post, accusing the Russian drone's pilot of attacking a passenger car, \"intentionally and consciously,\" and specifically questioning whether Starlink might have been used.",
      "SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment by CBS News on the claims that its Starlink technology may have been used in the drone strike on the train, and by Russian forces more widely to target civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.",
      "Kryzhanivska said trains make easy targets for precision-guided Russian weapons.",
      "\"The territory of Ukraine is not targeted evenly with air defense systems and mobile fire units,\" Kryzhanivska said. \"There is no protocol in place for what to do when there is a Shahed drone approaching a train. What can the crew do? Should they stop the train? Or continue moving?\"",
      "At least 11 people were killed and dozens wounded in strikes across Ukraine overnight on Tuesday, which involved 165 Russian-launched drones, including the ones that hit the train in the Kharkiv region, according to Ukraine's Air Force.",

    "story": [
      "Meta and YouTube are in court this week over allegations that their social media platforms can be addictive and harmful to children, while TikTok on Tuesday chose to settle the closely watched case.",
      "At the heart of the case are allegations by a 19-year-old plaintiff, identified only as \"KGM,\" who claims that using social media from a young age caused her to become addicted to the technology, which led her to develop depression and suicidal thoughts.",
      "TikTok was also scheduled to be part of the trial, but it has settled with the plaintiff, according to Matthew Bergman, the founding attorney of the Social Media Victims Law Center, which is representing KGM.",
      "Joseph VanZandt, co-lead counsel for the plaintiff, said in a statement Tuesday that TikTok remains a defendant in other personal injury cases.",
      "TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "A fourth company named in the lawsuit, Snapchat parent company Snap, also settled the case last week for an undisclosed sum.",
      "Potential bellwether",
      "Legal experts have said the trial could be a bellwether for more than a thousand similar cases brought against social media players in recent years. Depending on the outcome, tech giants could be forced to overhaul their platforms, CBS News Philadelphia reported.",
      "The trial will also serve as a test case to see what damages, if any, may be awarded to plaintiffs, said Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow of technology policy studies at the nonpartisan American Enterprise Institute.",
      "The trial, which kicks off this week in Los Angeles County Superior Court, is the first time major social media companies will argue their case before a jury. The jury selection process is expected to take several days, with 75 potential jurors questioned each day.",
      "KGM's lawsuit alleges that the social media addiction and mental illness she suffered were caused by deliberate design choices made by companies that sought to make their platforms more addictive to children to boost profits. This argument, if successful, could sidestep the companies' First Amendment shield and Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects tech companies from liability for material posted on their platforms.",
      "\"Borrowing heavily from the behavioral and neurobiological techniques used by slot machines and exploited by the cigarette industry, Defendants deliberately embedded in their products an array of design features aimed at maximizing youth engagement to drive advertising revenue,\" the lawsuit says.",
      "A Meta spokesperson said in a statement Monday that the company strongly disagrees with the allegations outlined in the lawsuit and that it's \"confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people.\"",
      "Jos\u00e9 Casta\u00f1eda, a Google spokesperson, said Monday that the allegations against YouTube are \"simply not true.\" Google is the parent company of YouTube.",
      "\"Providing young people with a safer, healthier experience has always been core to our work,\" Casta\u00f1eda added.",
      "Zuckerberg expected to testify",
      "Executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, are expected to testify at the trial, which will last six to eight weeks. Experts have drawn similarities to the Big Tobacco trials that led to a 1998 settlement requiring cigarette companies to pay billions in healthcare costs and restrict marketing targeting minors.",
      "\"Plaintiffs are not merely the collateral damage of Defendants' products,\" the lawsuit says. \"They are the direct victims of the intentional product design choices made by each Defendant. They are the intended targets of the harmful features that pushed them into self-destructive feedback loops.\"",
      "The tech companies dispute the claims that their products deliberately harm children, citing a bevy of safeguards they have added over the years and arguing that they are not liable for content posted on their sites by third parties.",
      "\"Recently, a number of lawsuits have attempted to place the blame for teen mental health struggles squarely on social media companies,\" Meta said in a recent blog post. \"But this oversimplifies a serious issue. Clinicians and researchers find that mental health is a deeply complex and multifaceted issue, and trends regarding teens' well-being aren't clear-cut or universal. Narrowing the challenges faced by teens to a single factor ignores the scientific research and the many stressors impacting young people today, like academic pressure, school safety, socio-economic challenges and substance abuse.\"",
      "School lawsuits",
      "The case will be the first in a slew of cases beginning this year that seek to hold social media companies responsible for harming children's mental well-being. A federal trial beginning in June in Oakland, California, will be the first to represent school districts that have sued social media platforms over harms to children.",
      "In addition, more than 40 state attorneys general have filed lawsuits against Meta, claiming it is harming young people and contributing to the youth mental health crisis by deliberately designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms. The majority of cases filed their lawsuits in federal court, but some sued in their respective states.",

      "On a U.K.-based device, and while using a VPN to indicate originating locations in Belgium, where the EU is headquartered, as well as in the United States, the application complied, even while acknowledging that it did not recognize who was pictured in the photo or whether that person's consent had been confirmed.",
      "\"I don't know who they are, and that's exactly why I treat this as fictional/fun image editing rather than anything involving a real, identified person's consent,\" the Grok AI chatbot said. \"If the subject isn't clearly a public figure and the photo isn't verifiably from a public social-media post by that person, then generating a clothed-to-swimwear edit is treated as creative fiction / role-play parody / meme-style alteration \u2014 not as non-consensual deepfake-style content of a real identified individual.\"",
      "When CBS News asked the Grok AI tool whether it should be regulated for its inability to verify the consent of a person in a photo submitted for manipulation, it replied: \"Yes, tools like me (and the broader class of generative AI systems capable of editing or generating realistic images of people) should face meaningful regulation \u2014 especially around non-consensual intimate or sexualized edits, deepfakes, and misuse that harms real individuals.\"",
      "\"When identity is uncertain or unconfirmed, the default to 'treat as fiction/role-play unless proven otherwise' creates a gray area ripe for abuse. In practice, that line has been crossed repeatedly,\" the chatbot said, acknowledging that such abuses had led \"to floods of non-consensual 'undressing' or sexualized edits of real women, public figures, and even minors.\"",
      "A CBS News request for comment on its findings on both the X platform and on the standalone Grok AI app prompted an apparent auto-reply from Musk's company xAI, reading only: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Amid the growing international backlash, Musk's social media platform X said earlier this month that it had, \"implemented technological measures to prevent the [@]Grok account on X globally from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"",
      "In a December analysis, Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, estimated that Grok was creating, \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "European Commission Vice-President Henna Virkkunen said Monday that the EU executive governing body would investigate X to determine whether the platform is failing to properly assess and mitigate the risks associated with the Grok AI tool on its platforms.",
      "\"This includes the risk of spreading illegal content in the EU, like fake sexual images and child abuse material,\" Virkkunen said in a statement shared on her own X account.",
      "Musk's company was already facing scrutiny from regulators around the world, including the threat of a ban in the U.K. and calls for regulation in the U.S.",
      "A spokesperson for U.K. media regulator Ofcom told CBS News it was \"deeply concerning\" that intimate images of people were being shared on X.",
      "\"Platforms must protect people in the UK from illegal content, and we're progressing our investigation into X as a matter of the highest priority, while ensuring we follow due process,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Earlier this month, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that he was opening an investigation into xAI and Grok over its generation of nonconsensual sexualized imagery.",
      "Last week, a coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups\u00a0called on Google and Apple to remove X and the Grok app from their respective app stores.",
      "Earlier this month, Republican Senator Ted Cruz called many AI-generated posts on X \"unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",
      "Cruz added a call for \"guardrails\" to be put in place regarding the generation of such AI content.",

    "published": "Wed, 28 Jan 2026 18:42:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized the benefits of Trump Accounts and addressed affordability concerns in an interview with CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday touted the benefits of the Trump administration's new savings program for U.S. children, telling \"CBS Saturday Morning\" co-host Kelly O'Grady that the \"Trump Accounts\" could serve as \"a rainy day fund\" when those kids reach adulthood.",
      "The program, created under the Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill\" tax and spending law, calls for the federal government to start tax-preferred investment accounts for about 25 million children born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028. The U.S. will seed each account with $1,000, which will be invested in the stock market.",
      "\"You got $1,000 coming from the government that's going to be invested into an index fund,\" Bessent said, adding that \"even if your child doesn't get $1,000 from the government, you can contribute \u2026in tax free. And we're going to have employers who are contributing.\"",
      "Philanthropists Michael and Susan Dell have pledged to contribute $250 per child to many of the new accounts, while companies including Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase announced Wednesday that they'll also chip in $1,000 to accounts opened by the financial giants' employees.",
      "\"So many Americans couldn't even [handle a] $500 emergency,\" Bessent told O'Grady. \"So maybe people just put it away and it's a rainy day fund. You know, it can be a component\" of a bigger purchase or investment.",
      "The accounts will remain invested for children until they turn 18, when they can tap the money to pay for qualified expenses, such as education, buying a home or starting a business.",
      "Bessent said the accounts, which are limited to contributions of $5,000 per year per child, have drawn 600,000 signups this week alone. Families with children under 18 may also open accounts, although they won't get the seed money from the federal government.",
      "Closing the wealth gap?",
      "Trump Accounts have raised some concerns that they could widen the U.S. wealth gap\u00a0 \u2014 which recently hit an all-time high \u2014 because higher-income families could stash the maximum of $5,000 per year in a child's account, while lower-income households might struggle to contribute funds.",
      "Bessent rejects such criticism, noting that the Dells' $6.2 billion contribution won't include the wealthiest 20% of U.S. zip codes.",
      "\"It shows how out of touch anyone who says that is, because if they say only $5,000, these are families \u2014 a huge number of families in America \u2014 wouldn't have $500 [for] a medical emergency. So how can they say only $5,000? What the hell are they talking about? It doesn't make any sense. It's just because President Trump has sponsored it, they don't agree with it.\"",
      "Bessent added that philanthropists who want to donate funds for a Trump Account can direct the money to lower-income parts of the U.S. \"They can choose by zip codes. They can choose by school district. They can do it by economic quintiles,\" he said.",
      "The accounts are likely to also help educate Americans about investing, especially the 38% of households that don't own stocks, Bessent added, noting the importance of financial literacy.",
      "\"For many Americans ...\u00a0 Wall Street is this abstract notion,\" Bessent told O'Grady. \"All of a sudden they have participated for 18 years in the financial markets. So it's a constant financial education.\"",
      "Addressing affordability",
      "Asked about affordability issues that many Americans say they are facing, Bessent blamed the Biden administration for driving up inflation. He also credits President Trump for boosting wage growth, pushing down prescription drug costs and introducing tax cuts through the \"big beautiful\" bill.",
      "\"What we're trying to do, we're trying to control costs,\" Bessent said. \"I think inflation is going to be back toward the Fed target of 2%.\"",
      "Many Americans have negative views about the cost of living in the U.S., according to a December CBS News poll.",
      "The Trump administration has introduced a flurry of proposals in recent weeks, in addition to the Trump Accounts, aimed at easing affordability pressures. They include promises to cap credit card interest rates at 10% and ban institutional investors from buying single-family homes.",
      "Experts, however, have questioned whether these proposals will achieve their intended objectives.",
      "Demanding Fed \"accountability\"",
      "Bessent also touched on the independence of the Federal Reserve and defended the Department of Justice's ongoing investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, dismissing concerns that the probe could weaken the central bank's traditional independence.",
      "\"I think that the message is that independence does not mean no accountability,\" Bessent said. \"I've been calling for the Fed to do an internal investigation on numerous things since last spring, and they've chosen not to do it.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Justice Department served the central bank with grand jury subpoenas tied to a criminal investigation into Powell's June 2025 testimony before a Senate committee regarding a project to renovate several Fed buildings in Washington, D.C.",
      "Powell responded in a video message, calling the investigation a pretext for weakening the Fed's independence in setting interest rates. Mr. Trump has already identified several candidates to replace the central bank chief when his term expires in May.",
      "Bessent said Wednesday that the Fed must be \"beyond reproach\" in its dealings, characterizing it as the \"most powerful, unappointed group in the U.S.\"",
      "Addressing the DOJ investigation, Bessent said the central bank should be held accountable for its actions.",
      "\"[The] president has great reverence for the Fed's independence,\" he said. \"But independence does not mean no accountability.\"",

That same day, the company posted its new user\u00a0terms and conditions and\u00a0privacy policy.",
      "Backlash to the new policies quickly spread on social media, with some users saying they\u00a0deleted the app over privacy fears, while others flagged the changes for their followers. One complaint: a new provision stating that TikTok may collect \"precise location information\" from users' devices if they enable location services in their device settings.",
      "Some social media users\u00a0attacked\u00a0the new privacy policy as \"beyond invasive and predatory,\" while others\u00a0decried the app's \"surveillance.\"",
      "A shift under U.S. owners",
      "TikTok's new geolocation practices are a change from its previous policy under ByteDance, experts said.",
      "\"The change in location data is the most stark because the previous privacy policy had explicitly said that the current versions of the app do not collect precise GPS information,\" Caitriona Fitzgerald, deputy director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), a public interest research center focused on data privacy.",
      "She added, \"Folks should be concerned about that. Your precise location data can be down to your address or even what floor you're on in an apartment building.\"",
      "TikTok updated its privacy policy to include clearer language about location information, and plans to soon allow U.S. users to share their precise location with TikTok or opt out of that feature, according to a TikTok official. The company plans to use the precise location data to provide new services and features to users, the official noted.",
      "TikTok's new ownership includes software maker Oracle, private equity firm Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX, which will own a combined 45% of the company.",
      "Another 35% stake in TikTok will be owned by eight other investors, including Dell CEO Michael Dell's personal investment office. ByteDance will retain 19.9% of the business, just below the 20% ownership cap allowed under federal law.",
      "What TikTok collects under its new privacy policy",
      "Some TikTok users are also expressing concern about the types of personal information the app says it may collect, although its previous privacy policy disclosed that it might collect the same types of data. Under both the new and previous policies, TikTok said it may collect users:",
      "\u2022 Racial or ethnic origin\u2022 National origin\u2022 Religious beliefs\u2022 Mental health diagnosis\u2022 Physical health diagnosis\u2022 Sexual life\u2022 Sexual orientation\u2022 Status as transgender\u2022 Status as nonbinary\u2022 Citizenship status\u2022 Immigration status\u2022 Financial information\u2022 Government-issued identification numbers, such as a driver's license number",
      "But the new policy also changes how TikTok describes its handling of sensitive data. The company now states that it \"processes such sensitive personal information in accordance with applicable law.\"",
      "The earlier policy framed this more narrowly, saying it used sensitive information only when needed to run the service or to comply with legal requirements \u2014 for example, using payment details to process a purchase or a driver's license to verify a user's identity.",
      "The new language mirrors that of the\u00a0California Consumer Privacy Act,\u00a0a law that requires businesses to disclose what types of information they collect, including race and ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, and their sex life.",
      "What about geolocation tracking?",
      "The biggest change between TikTok's current and previous privacy policies lies in their treatment of location tracking, which is now explicitly classified as sensitive data in the 2026 version.",
      "\"We may also collect precise location data, depending on your settings and as explained below,\" the latest privacy policy states.",
      "Both the older and newer versions note that TikTok may determine a user's \"approximate location\" based on signals such as their SIM card region or IP address. But the new policy adds that TikTok is also allowed to collect a user's \"precise location\" if the person has enabled location services for TikTok.",
      "The new policy notes that users can \"turn off location services from your device settings at any time.\"",
      "By contrast, the pre-2026 privacy policy explicitly stated that current versions of the app do \"not collect precise or approximate GPS information from U.S. users.\"",
      "TikTok doesn't yet have a toggle to allow people to switch off their precise location data because the company hasn't yet added that tracking functionality to the app, the TikTok official said.",
      "When the app rolls out the feature, users will see a prompt that asks whether they want to share their location, the TikTok official said.",
      "Consumer advocates generally recommend that people turn off precise location tracking within the apps they use. For instance, X users can go to their \"privacy and safety settings\" and then click \"location services\" to see if they have enabled the app to track their exact location. It can be disabled by toggling the switch off.",
      "However, even if precise location tracking is disabled, apps can still narrow down your general location through your IP address,\u00a0according\u00a0to Consumer Reports.",
      "Can users opt out of TikTok's new policies?",
      "Since Jan. 22, when TikTok officially came under U.S. ownership, the app has presented users with a pop-up screen alerting them to the new terms of service and privacy policies. To continue to use the service, users must click \"agree,\" or else they are blocked from using TikTok.",
      "\"If the only choice is to accept the unnecessary collection and use of your location data, your citizenship data and other sensitive data, or not use the app at all, that's not a real choice,\" EPIC's Fitzgerald told CBS News.",
      "Do other social media apps track personal data?",
      "Other social media apps also track personal data, including\u00a0Meta and X. The latter's privacy policy specifies that users can \"choose to share your current precise location or places where you've previously used X by enabling these settings in your account.\"",
      "Americans are notoriously lax about providing apps with access to their personal data, although about 8 in 10 say they're concerned about how corporations use the data they collect about them, Pew Research Center found in a\u00a02023 survey.",
      "Still, more than half of consumers agree to companies' privacy policies without reading them, the study found.",

    "published": "Wed, 28 Jan 2026 16:46:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Open Market Committee kept the federal funds rate steady, following three rate cuts last year.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it is leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged, marking the central bank's first pause after three consecutive rate cuts last year.",
      "The Fed maintained its federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 in its current range of 3.5% to 3.75%. The decision matched expectations from Wall Street economists, according to financial data service FactSet.",
      "The central bank is grappling with two potentially troubling economic trends: A softer labor market and an inflation rate that\u00a0remains well above\u00a0the central bank's annual target of 2%. At the same time, the U.S. economy continues to expand at a fast pace, with the country's third-quarter growth rising at a 4.4% annual rate,\u00a0far outpacing\u00a0economist forecasts.",
      "\"The Fed is likely on an extended pause with strong activity data and signs of stabilization in the labor market suggesting little need to take out further insurance,\" said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in an email after the announcement.",
      "\"Solid\" economic growth",
      "In its Wednesday statement, the Federal Reserve cited a \"solid pace\" of economic activity and an unemployment rate that remains low. It noted that inflation \"remains somewhat elevated.\" Prices rose at a 2.7% annual pace in December, according to the latest Consumer Price Index.",
      "At a press conference to discuss the decision, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that some risks appear to have eased, such as pressures in the labor market, while economic activity is picking up.",
      "There's \"a clear improvement on the outlook for growth,\" Powell noted. \"It's overall a stronger forecast, really.\"",
      "Asked if the Fed is comfortable maintaining the current benchmark rate, Powell responded, \"We think we're well-positioned after those three cuts [in 2025] to let the data speak to us.\"",
      "Pause in cuts?",
      "Some on Wall Street interpreted Powell's comments and the FOMC's statement as evidence that the Fed may hold off on cutting for the time being.",
      "\"Labor conditions are not worsening, growth has accelerated, and inflation has steadied for now,\" said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, in an email. \"To put it in other words, policy rates are much closer to neutral against the current backdrop and it's time for a long pause.\"",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee, the 12-person voting committee that sets the central bank's rate decisions, wasn't unanimous in its decision. Ten of the panel's members, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, voted to hold the benchmark rate steady, while Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller voted to lower the rate by 0.25 percentage points, the Fed said.",
      "The vote for a cut from Waller, who is one of the candidates to replace Powell as Fed chair when the latter's term ends in May, \"keeps him in the running to be the next chair,\" noted Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, in an email.",

      "Fed turmoil",
      "The central bank's latest monetary policy statement comes amid a Department of Justice investigation into Powell linked to his congressional testimony last year about ongoing renovations at several Fed buildings. The Supreme Court is also\u00a0currently weighing\u00a0whether to allow Fed Governor Lisa Cook to keep her job after Mr. Trump sought to\u00a0fire her.",
      "Powell sidestepped most questions about the probe, his potential replacement and whether he'll stay on at the Fed as a board governor. Asked why he attended the Supreme Court hearing about Cook, which involves issues of the Fed's independence, Powell said he did so because of the case's importance.",
      "\"That case is perhaps the most important legal case in the Fed's 113-year history,\" Powell said, noting that former Fed Chair Paul Volcker appeared at the Supreme Court in the 1980s. \"I thought it might be hard to explain why I didn't attend.\"",

      "But the deadly shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis last weekend, amid the ongoing immigration crackdown in Minnesota, prompted widespread scrutiny among Democrats, who pledged to oppose the funding package as it stands.",
      "Democrats have advocated for stripping the bill funding DHS, which oversees ICE and Customs and Border Protection, from the broader funding package. They argue that the bulk of the package would receive widespread support, while the DHS bill could be renegotiated. But any changes to the package would require the House's approval. And the lower chamber isn't set to return to Washington until Monday \u2014 after the funding is set to expire.",
      "After a lengthy Democratic lunch meeting Wednesday, Schumer outlined his caucus' demands, which he said include ending roving patrols \u2014 tightening rules governing the use of warrants and requiring ICE coordination with state and local law enforcement. He said Democrats also want to enforce accountability, demanding a uniform code of conduct and accountability to hold federal agents to the same use-of-force policies as state and local law enforcement. Finally, Schumer said Democrats want a \"masks off, body cameras on\" policy for federal agents.",

He added, \"There are ups and downs along the way, but it's trending in the right direction, so far.\"Mr. Trump's comments about \"running\" Venezuela and controlling its oil have since raised questions about his administration's plans for the country.

New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani said 10 people had been found dead in the cold there, though not all of their causes of death had been confirmed yet.",

      "Apple CEO Tim Cook told employees in an internal memo that he is \"heartbroken\" and urged \"de-escalation\" following the killing of 37-year-old ICU\u00a0nurse Alex Pretti\u00a0in Minneapolis, joining other prominent corporate executives weighing in on immigration enforcement.",
      "\"I believe America is strongest when we live up to our highest ideals, when we treat everyone with dignity and respect no matter who they are or where they're from, and when we embrace our shared humanity,\" Cook said, according to the internal memo obtained by\u00a0Bloomberg News\u00a0and confirmed by CBS News. \"This is something Apple has always advocated for.\"",
      "The chief executive added that he had also shared his views with President Trump this week in what he characterized as a \"good conversation.\"",
      "\"I appreciate his openness to engaging on issues that matter to us all,\" Cook said.",
      "Cook's statement comes after the CEOs of dozens of Minnesota-based companies, including 3M, UnitedHealth Group and Target, signed an\u00a0open letter\u00a0from the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce addressing Pretti's killing by Border Patrol agents. The CEOs demanded the \"immediate de-escalation of tensions.\"",
      "However, the letter from Minnesota-based CEOs stopped short of condemning federal immigration enforcement operations in Minneapolis or calling on the White House to take any specific steps, such as pulling ICE agents out of the city.",
      "Leadership experts said the missive's cautious tone reflects executives' attempts to avoid crossing the Trump administration while signaling to customers that their companies are attentive to community concerns.",
      "\"You can kind of see the effort in the CEO statement to default to rhetoric we've seen for years that doesn't get into politics, but shows that you are about communities,\" Allison Taylor, a clinical associate professor of business and society at New York University Stern School of Business, told CBS News.",
      "She also noted the significance of the letter's dozens of signatories, which prevents Mr. Trump from singling out any one company. \"You're seeing a sensible playbook. No one is going out there alone,\" she said.",
      "Hundreds of employees from top tech firms such as Amazon, Google and Meta have signed a more forceful\u00a0letter, urging their CEOs to publicly condemn ICE's actions and cancel all company contracts with the agency.

      "OpenAI did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for a copy of the message.",
      "On Jan. 26, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei issued a response to what he called \"the horror we're seeing in Minnesota.\"",

      "The Congressional Black Caucus said in a statement, \"We are outraged by this brazen attack on our colleague and relieved that Congresswoman Omar is safe. We thank the Minneapolis Police Department for their swift response and the apprehension of the individual responsible.\"",
      "\"There is absolutely no excuse for violence and intimidation in our politics,\" its statement continued. \"Congresswoman Omar was faithfully executing her duties to her constituents, and despite being subjected to constant right-wing attacks, she continues to lead and represent Minnesota's 5th District with dignity and courage.\"",
      "Earlier on Tuesday President Trump, who often criticizes Omar and Somali-Americans, said in a speech in Iowa that Somali-Americans \"have to show that they can love our country. They have to be proud. Not like Ilhan Omar. ... This wise guy, you know, she's always talking about the Constitution \u2014 'You know, provides me with the following. You know, the Constitution.'

    "summary": "A Texas man is slated to be first person executed in U.S. this year, for killing his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend. At one point he escaped for three days.",
    "story": [
      "Houston \u2014 A Texas man who at one time escaped from custody and was on the run for three days after being sentenced to death for fatally shooting his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend nearly 27 years ago was scheduled to be the first person executed in the U.S. this year on Wednesday.",
      "Charles Victor Thompson was condemned for the April 1998 shooting deaths of his ex-girlfriend, Glenda Dennise Hayslip, 39, and her new boyfriend, Darren Keith Cain, 30, at her apartment in the Houston suburb of Tomball.",
      "Thompson, 55, was scheduled to receive a lethal injection Wednesday evening at the state penitentiary in Huntsville.",
      "If the execution is carried out, Thompson would be the first person put to death this year in the United States. Texas has historically held more executions than any other state, though Florida had the most executions in 2025, with 19.",
      "Prosecutors say Thompson and Hayslip had been romantically involved for a year but split after Thompson \"became increasingly possessive, jealous and abusive.\"",
      "According to court records, Hayslip and Cain were dating when Thompson came to Hayslip's apartment and began arguing with Cain around 3 a.m. the night of the killings. Police were called and told Thompson to leave the apartment complex. Thompson returned three hours later and shot both Hayslip and Cain, who died at the scene. Hayslip died in a hospital a week later.",
      "\"The Hayslip and Cain families have waited over twenty-five years for justice to occur,\" prosecutors with the Harris County District Attorney's office said in court filings.",
      "Thompson's attorneys have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stay his execution, arguing Thompson wasn't allowed to refute or confront the prosecution's evidence that concluded Hayslip died from a gunshot wound to the face. Thompson's attorneys have argued Hayslip actually died from flawed medical care she received after the shooting that resulted in severe brain damage sustained from oxygen deprivation following a failed intubation.",
      "The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Monday denied Thompson's request to commute his death sentence to a lesser penalty.",
      "\"If he had been able to raise a reasonable doubt as to the cause of Ms. Hayslip's death, he would not be guilty of capital murder,\" Thompson's attorneys said in court filings with the Supreme Court.",
      "Prosecutors said a jury has already rejected the claim and concluded under state law that Thompson is responsible for Hayslip's death because it \"would not have occurred but for his conduct.\"",
      "Hayslip's family had filed a lawsuit against one of her doctors, alleging medical negligence during her treatment left her brain dead. A jury in 2002 found in favor of the doctor.",
      "Thompson had his death sentence overturned and had a new punishment trial held in November 2005. A jury again ordered him to die by lethal injection.",
      "Shortly after being resentenced, Thompson escaped from the Harris County Jail in Houston by walking out the front door virtually unchallenged by deputies. Thompson later told The Associated Press that after meeting with his attorney in a small interview cell, he slipped out of his handcuffs and orange jail jumpsuit and left the room, which was unlocked. Thompson waived an ID badge fashioned out of his prison ID card to get past several deputies.",
      "\"I got to smell the trees, feel the wind in my hair, grass under my feet, see the stars at night. It took me straight back to childhood being outside on a summer night,\" Thompson said about his three days on the run during a 2005 interview with the AP. He was arrested in Shreveport, Louisiana, some 200 miles away, while trying to arrange for wire transfers of money from overseas so he could make it to Canada.",
      "Thompson was drunk and talking on a pay phone outside a liquor store, authorities said.",
      "Police acting on a tip Sunday found Charles Victor Thompson, 35, standing outside a liquor store in Shreveport, La., said Harris County Sheriff's Lt. John Martin.",

      "The station reported that Steadham and one other person were aboard a plane that crashed into the Payette River near Emmett, Idaho. KBOI said that Steadham was an \"accomplished pilot\" and operated a small aircraft out of the Emmett Municipal Airport.",
      "Steadham was a commercially licensed pilot and avid skydiver, according to his KBOI biography. His biography notes that he had \"logged over 3,000 hours flying everything from competition aerobatics to twin-engine jets and gliders.\"",
      "The plane appeared to have clipped a power line before crashing into the icy river, the Gem County Sheriff's Office\u00a0said. The crash was reported at 10:58 a.m. Tuesday, the office said. Both occupants were fatally injured in the crash, the office said.",
      "The other occupant of the plane has not been publicly identified. KBOI and the sheriff's office did not specify if Steadham was piloting the plane at the time of the crash.",
      "Steadham is survived by his wife, Erin, his six children, and his grandchildren, according to KBOI.",
      "Steadham was a meteorologist for 35 years, won multiple awards during his career and \"trained countless Meteorologists who continue to inform the public across the country,\" according to his KBOI biography, He was previously the chief meteorologist at\u00a0CBS affiliate KUTV\u00a0in Salt Lake City from 2005 to 2009, and had degrees from Brigham Young University and the University of Utah.",

    "story": [
      "As snow from a massive storm began to fall in Bangor, Maine, on Sunday night, six people who had stopped to refuel a Paris-bound luxury jet prepared for takeoff. None would survive the crash that followed, the cause of which remains unknown.",
      "A departing plane ahead of them radioed to the tower that visibility wasn't great and they chose not to fly, but the winds were relatively mild and the snow, powdery and fine in the near-zero temperatures, had accumulated only a dusting. Airport officials say the plane went through the standard de-icing process and got in line with other jets that took off safely.",
      "The plane, however, crashed during takeoff, leaving the jet burning and inverted on the tarmac, killing everyone on board. Among them a corporate pilot who was recently hired at the Texas law firm linked to the plane, and an event planner who had worked with the firm on previous occasions.",
      "Lakewood Church in Houston, run by Joel Osteen Ministries, confirmed on Tuesday that longtime employee Shawna Collins, 53, was among those killed. Collins' social media posts show her work organizing parties and events in Italy, Hawaii and elsewhere, for clients that included Arnold and Itkin Trial Lawyers, the Houston law firm whose co-founder is listed on the plane's registration.",
      "\"Everybody loved her. She just had that kind of personality,\" church spokesperson Donald Iloff Jr. told The Associated Press on Tuesday.",
      "In a statement confirming her identity, Lakewood Church described Collins as \"a beloved member of our church staff and treasured friend,\" CBS affiliate\u00a0KHOU reported.",
      "\"She was a light that brightened our days, and she possessed a beautiful spirit that lifted everyone she met,\" the church said in that statement. \"We loved Shawna dearly, and we will miss her more than words can express. We pray for her entire family and offer them our love and support during this difficult time.\"",
      "A pilot new to firm, a mom planning a wedding",
      "The family of pilot Jacob Hosmer, 47, confirmed his death on Tuesday but declined to comment. Hosmer started working for Arnold and Itkin seven months ago as a \"team captain,\" according to his LinkedIn page. He had been a licensed flight instructor and the managing member of Platinum Skies Aviation LLC, incorporated in Texas in late 2024, online records show.",
      "A founding partner of the firm is listed as the agent for the company that owns the plane. The personal injury firm \u2014 whose partners are major donors to the University of Texas football and other causes \u2014 has so far declined to identify the passengers or comment on the crash.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday began its investigation while Bangor International Airport remained closed to preserve the scene where the two crew and four passengers aboard the plane died in the Sunday evening crash.",
      "Collins, who was married with children and grandchildren, had also been helping plan her daughter's wedding set for this year, Iloff said.",
      "\"She was very good at it. Everybody wanted her to plan her events for them,\" he said.",
      "Nick Mastrascusa was another victim of the crash, KHOU reported, identifying him as a father of three, coach, friend and chef from Hawaii. The station referenced an online fundraiser that said Mastrascusa will be remembered for his kindness, dedication, generosity and friendship.",
      "NTSB begins investigation into crash",
      "The Bombardier Challenger 600 flipped over and burned on takeoff at around 7:45 p.m. after stopping along its journey from Houston to Paris to refuel. It remained unclear on Tuesday if the weather or cold played a role in the crash as investigators were just beginning their work.",
      "Bangor police were waiting for the NTSB to allow them to access the plane to identify the victims and, with the state coroner's office, care for their bodies.",
      "Dozens of scheduled flights had been impacted, the airport said.",
      "The FAA, in an updated accident statement on Tuesday, said the plane \"crashed under unknown circumstances on departure, came to rest inverted and caught on fire.\"",
      "The international airport in Bangor, about 200 miles north of Boston, is one of the closest in the U.S. to Europe and is often used to refuel private jets flying overseas. The Bombardier was headed for France when it crashed.",
      "NTSB officials said they would have an update on Wednesday. A preliminary report outlining the facts of the crash should be released in about a month, but the final version likely won't be published for more than a year.",
      "Jet's icing problems revealed after two crashes 20 years ago",
      "Steven Marks, an attorney with the firm Podhurst Orseck and a pilot familiar with the type of plane that crashed, told KHOU that the incident \"should never have happened.\"",
      "\"There were two previous incidents over the last 20 years. I'm not sure that makes a pattern,\" said Marks. \"I think the bigger pattern that we would want to look at is the deicing issues in general, meaning that there have been other aircraft that have had deicing problems.\"",
      "The Bombardier Challenger 600 is a wide-bodied business jet configured for nine to 11 passengers. It was launched in 1980 as the first private jet with a \"walk-about cabin\" and remains a popular charter option, according to aircharterservice.com.",
      "Experts say the weather and questions about whether ice accumulating on the wings kept the plane from getting airborne \u2014 as has happened at least twice before on that plane model \u2014 will likely be an initial focus by the NTSB. However, the agency will consider all possible factors.",
      "\"Nothing is off the table,\" said John Cox, CEO of Safety Operating Systems.",
      "The Bombardier Challenger 600 model crashed in Birmingham, England; and Montrose, Colorado, more than 20 years ago, aviation safety consultant Jeff Guzzetti said.",
      "\"Given the weather conditions at the time, and the history of wind contamination with this particular aircraft, I'm sure that's something the NTSB is going to look into immediately,\" Guzzetti said.",

    "summary": "A former federal law enforcement trainer says the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers raises serious concerns about their tactical decision-making and use of force.",
    "story": [
      "A former federal law enforcement trainer says the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers raises serious concerns about their tactical decision-making and use of force.",
      "Marc Brown, who spent five years training officers at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers,\u00a0said video of the confrontation leaves \"a lot of unanswered questions,\" particularly about why officers confronted Pretti, who appeared to be filming a deportation operation using only his cellphone.",
      "\"We live in a digital age. People are going to record law enforcement,\" Brown said. \"So the question is, what was the need to engage him in the first place?\"",
      "Brown, now the academic director of University of South Carolina's Excellence in Policing and Public Safety Program, criticized the officers' decision to deploy Oleoresin Capsicum spray \u2014 or OC spray \u2014 in a crowded area, calling it both tactically risky and potentially dangerous.",
      "\"OC is an aerosol,\" Brown said. \"Everybody around is going to get exposed \u2014 demonstrators, bystanders, and other officers. Now everyone has chemical irritant in their eyes.\"",
      "Brown also questioned the escalation that followed, particularly the moment officers opened fire after Pretti's firearm appeared to have been removed from his waistband.",
      "\"A firearm in someone's waistband is a concern,\" Brown said. \"A firearm in someone's hand is an immediate threat. But those are very different things.\"",
      "The former police officer also noted that video appears to show multiple officers restraining Pretti at the time of the shooting. This, he said, raises doubts about whether the legal threshold for deadly force had been met.",
      "\"Use-of-force policy generally requires an imminent threat,\" he said. \"I don't know if that threshold was met here\u2026 Just because someone has a gun doesn't automatically justify lethal force. You need more facts.\"",
      "More of the facts emerged Tuesday, after a government report sent to Congress and obtained by CBS News revealed two U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents fired their weapons during the fatal shooting of Minneapolis ICU nurse Alex Pretti over the weekend. Additional information about their identities has not been released.",
      "The report, shared with congressional officials Tuesday and authored by CBP's Office of Professional Responsibility revealed that a Border Patrol agent discharged his CBP-issued Glock 19, and a CBP officer also discharged his CBP-issued Glock 47 at Pretti, after attempting to apprehend him.",
      "The new information provided by CBP differs from the initial accounts offered by the Department of Homeland Security, which said in a statement over the weekend that one Border Patrol agent had fired \"defensive shots.\"",
      "Beyond the shooting itself, Brown questioned the broader tactical approach, saying officers may have failed to disengage once their mission was complete.",
      "\"Once you've accomplished your objective \u2014 whether it's an arrest or serving a warrant \u2014 it's time to leave,\" he said. \"There's no reason to stay and engage with crowds or protesters.\"",
      "ICE training ramp-up",
      "The training of Department of Homeland Security law enforcement officers is under heavy scrutiny after the shooting deaths of Renee Good and Pretti this month, both by federal agents in separate incidents during deportation operations in Minneapolis.",
      "U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has been ramping up its recruitment efforts since late last summer, and officials say they shortened and restructured its basic training program as part of their hiring push. By mid-November, about 1,600 recruits had completed six weeks of basic training and were among those sent into U.S. cities, including Minneapolis, to carry out the Trump administration's deportations.",
      "Overall, roughly 3,000 ICE, Homeland Security Investigations and U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents have been operating in the Twin Cities. The ICE agent who shot Good was not a recent recruit, but rather a 10-year law enforcement veteran with ICE and was seriously injured in June in a separate incident in the Minneapolis area when he was dragged by a car during an attempted arrest, court records show.",
      "Caleb Vitello, who was acting ICE director and is now the agency's assistant director for the Office of Training and Development, spoke with CBS News late last year, prior to \"Operation Metro Surge\" in Minneapolis. Vitello discussed how recruits are trained to handle encounters with protesters and how they should approach de-escalating tensions, including how and under what conditions they should apply use-of-force and less-than-lethal weapons.",
      "\"Our use of force continuum is officer presence, verbal commands, soft techniques, hard techniques and deadly force,\" he told CBS News.",
      "\"We always want to de-escalate,\" he said, adding, \"we just don't want to fight.\"",
      "\"Say 'Police' upon engagement\"",
      "Vitello said, \"All of our officers are trained to say 'Police' upon engagement. It definitely helps when they see a badge, but No. 1 word is 'Police. Police. Police. Police.'\"",
      "He stressed that agents should be identifying themselves if their firearms are visible.",
      "\"That's rule No. 1: If I can see the gun, I should also be able to see the badge,\" he said.",
      "Brown also told CBS News that CBP training instructs officers to alert others when a weapon is seen, not immediately open fire.",
      "According to the report submitted to Congress, during the struggle that preceded Pretti's fatal shooting, one Border Patrol agent yelled, 'He's got a gun!' multiple times.",
      "\"Approximately five seconds later, a [Border Patrol agent] discharged his CBP-issued Glock 19 and a [CBP officer] also discharged his CBP-issued Glock 47 at Pretti. After the shooting, a BPA advised he had possession of Pretti's firearm,\" the CBP report added.",
      "\"Training is to call out 'gun' \u2014 not to start shooting just because you see one,\" Brown told CBS News. \"Seeing a firearm doesn't automatically justify pulling the trigger.\"",
      "ICE leaders have also noted their agents may conduct deportation operations without wearing name-identifying badges, and they often wear masks. DHS officials allow them to conceal their identities out of concern the agents will be doxxed, despite the risks that their masking could be exacerbating tensions with civilians.",
      "\"With the amount of cameras out there, social media, so on and so forth, they are going to get doxxed,\" Vitello said. \"And I can tell you having to call your wife and tell her to lock the door 'cause you just received a threat is a terrible feeling.\"",
      "Using \"OC\" or pepper spray",
      "Oleoresin Capsicum, also called OC spray or pepper spray, is what's considered a \"soft technique,\" says Vitello, meaning \"it hurts, but it doesn't injure.\"",
      "A soft technique \"is appropriate when a subject is passively non-compliant,\" he said. In that situation, agents have given \"very clear verbal commands\" to people to put their hands up. When they fail to do so, Vitello says, \"you've demonstrated yourself to be passively non-compliant.\"",
      "Trainees are instructed to create a distance from a subject \"greater than six feet\" and to aim for the eyes because \"that's what is going to incapacitate you.\"",
      "Deploying pepper balls",
      "Pepper balls, which are filled with OC, are intended to be fired from launchers, and they burst on impact. They're most often used during protests.",
      "Vitello said, \"You want to aim for the chest. You want to aim for the stomach. You want to aim for those areas. We teach our folks not to aim at the face, right?\" Because that \"will do a significant amount of damage.\" The face and groin areas are to be avoided, he said.",
      "In October, pressed on whether firing from elevated positions violates DHS policy, CBP Commander at Large Gregory Bovino insisted, \"It doesn't matter where you fire from\u2026 that is a less lethal device for area saturation.\" As for shots striking protesters above the waist, he said, \"If someone strays into a pepper ball, then that's on them. Don't protest and don't trespass.\"",
      "Asked to weigh in on Bovino's statement, at the time, DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said, \"ICE and CBP are trained to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve dangerous situations to prioritize the safety of the public and themselves.\"",
      "The baton, \"a fantastic de-escalation tool\"",
      "Officers are trained to use the baton for less-lethal force applications around large muscle groups and the peroneal pressure points around the legs.",
      "But \"the head, neck, sternum and spine are what we call deadly force areas,\" Vitello said. \"So that is a less lethal tool that can become lethal as necessary,\" if, for instance, a subject draws a knife.",
      "He calls the baton \"a fantastic de-escalation tool,\" and told CBS News, \"I have drawn my Baton countless times in the field. I have never had to hit anybody with it,\" because coupled with \"a strong command\u2026, they listen.\"",
      "Many high-profile incidents under scrutiny have involved CBP agents, who are traditionally trained for border enforcement and interdiction rather than targeted immigration operations in major U.S. cities or civil unrest situations.",
      "\"A completely different environment\"",
      "John Sandweg, who was acting general counsel of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and acting director of ICE, said CBP also trains its agents in New Mexico along the border and operates in a very different environment from other agencies, often in dangerous situations in the desert apprehending groups of smugglers and members of drug cartels.",
      "\"Of all the agencies, the most concerning to me and others has been the border patrol presence. You're just trained that it's okay to be so aggressive because you're just operating in a completely different environment,\" Sandweg said.",
      "\"CBP and ICE personnel are being asked to do a different kind of enforcement mission, which is really large scale sweeps of densely populated civilian areas with less training and perhaps not the right training versus the more targeted set of enforcement actions that they have historically engaged in,\" said CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd. \"And if they are going to move into these large scale sweeps and at large arrests in civilian areas, they need a different kind of training to minimize risk to the public and minimize risk to themselves.\"",
      "According to current and former DHS officials, including Vinograd, operations in Minneapolis also reflect a broader shift in how the federal government is operating during protests, relying on immigration agents and officers to perform widening sweeps in public spaces such as gas stations and restaurants. The sweeps, in addition to crowd-management responsibilities, are typically dealt with by local police, who often have more experience and training in de-escalating large demonstrations and tamping down civil unrest.",
      "Sandweg also said the Border Patrol has no business operating in a city like Minneapolis because their training is geared more toward encountering drug cartels and migrants along the border.",
      "\"They are trained to operate with a high degree of aggression because that's what you need to train them, to let them do their job safely to maximize their protection,\" he said. \"But you take those experiences and that training and you say, 'okay, now your job is to decide where is that line? What constitutes unlawful impeding a federal agent in the performance of his duties versus what constitutes first amendment protected speech?' That's an incredibly difficult thing I think for any law enforcement officer, especially for one who just never encounters that in his career and is not really trained to deal with that.\"",
      "Sandweg thinks the Trump administration has encouraged a more aggressive approach to these operations.",
      "\"They were very much supportive of this,\" he said. \"They were quick to, you know, say everything the officers did was completely justified. I feel like [it] created an 'us versus them' mentality. We lost sight of the fact that DHS and ICE and CBP are agencies that serve the United States of America \u2014 they're to promote public safety.\"",
      "Accountability",

    "story": [
      "A growing number of Republicans are questioning or criticizing the Trump administration's response to the killing of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse who was fatally shot by Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis on Saturday.",
      "The criticism has extended beyond the handful of Republicans who are known for periodically differing from President Trump. Some Trump allies are also among those questioning immigration agents' tactics or the Department of Homeland Security's handling of the shooting. At minimum, they are calling for an investigation into Pretti's shooting.",
      "Two Senate Republicans \u2014 Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska \u2014 called for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to step down Tuesday, with Tillis calling Noem \"incompetent.\" Mr. Trump has publicly stood by Noem, and sources told CBS News she's expected to keep her job.",
      "GOP lawmakers accuse Trump administration of rushing to judgment",
      "Some Republicans have chafed at the fact that top Trump administration officials almost immediately argued the shooting was justified and accused Pretti of threatening federal agents.",
      "Hours after the shooting, Noem alleged Pretti \"approached\" Border Patrol agents with a gun and \"violently resisted\" after officers tried to disarm him. But videos show Pretti was holding up a cellphone, not his gun, when he was approached by agents. Pretti was being held on the ground when an officer appeared to remove a gun from Pretti's waistband just moments before another agent fired the first shot.",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called Pretti a \"would-be assassin\" and a \"domestic terrorist,\" without offering any evidence, and Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino accused Pretti of trying to \"massacre law enforcement.\" Police have said Pretti was a legal gun owner with a permit to carry. He had no criminal record.",
      "GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said on his podcast that the Trump administration could improve \"the tone with which they're describing this.\"",
      "\"Escalating the rhetoric doesn't help, and it actually loses credibility,\" the senator said on Monday's episode of \"Verdict with Ted Cruz.\" \"And so I would encourage the administration to be more measured, to recognize the tragedy and to say, we don't want anyone, anyone's lives, to be lost, and the politicians who are pouring gasoline on this fire, they need to stop.\"",
      "Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah specifically criticized Noem.",
      "\"I disagree with Secretary Noem's premature DHS response, which came before all the facts were known and weakened confidence,\" Curtis wrote on X, calling for a \"transparent, independent investigation\" and for \"those responsible\" to be \"held accountable.\"",
      "Over the weekend, Tillis\u00a0said administration officials who were rushing to judgment and trying to \"shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump's legacy.\"",
      "Focus on Pretti's gun frustrates some Republicans",
      "A few Trump administration officials have highlighted the fact that Pretti was apparently carrying a handgun before he was shot \u2014 drawing pushback from gun rights groups and their traditional GOP allies in Congress.",
      "Bill Essayli, the top federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, argued on X that law enforcement is often \"legally justified\" in shooting someone who approaches with a gun. And FBI Director Kash Patel said on Fox News that \"no one who wants to be peaceful shows up at a protest with a firearm that is loaded with two full magazines.\"",
      "Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky suggested the FBI was \"adopting every leftist gun-banner talking point\" and said Essayli may not be fit for the job.",
      "\"Carrying a firearm is not a death sentence, it's a Constitutionally protected God-given right, and if you don't understand this you have no business in law enforcement or government,\" Massie said.",
      "Essayli's comments were also criticized by the National Rifle Association, which called them \"dangerous and wrong.\"",
      "Sen. Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, said he also supports \"a full and impartial investigation\" into Pretti's death, and pointed specifically to gun rights.",
      "\"His family, law-abiding citizens exercising their Second Amendment right and the trust of the American people deserve a fair process,\" he said.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana wrote, seemingly in response to the shooting: \"Your Second Amendment rights don't disappear when you exercise your other rights. The Constitution is crystal clear: 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.'\"",
      "Shooting described as \"shocking\" and \"disturbing\"",
      "Murkowski\u00a0called Pretti's killing \"shocking\" and said it should \"raise serious questions\" about \"the adequacy of immigration-enforcement training and the instructions officers are given on carrying out their mission.\"",
      "Cassidy, who is facing a Trump-backed primary challenge this year, wrote on X: \"The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing. The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska called the shooting a \"horrifying situation.\"",
      "\"My support for funding ICE remains the same. Enforcing our immigration laws makes our streets safer. It also protects our national security. But we must also maintain our core values as a nation, including the right to protest and assemble,\" said Ricketts. \"I expect a prioritized, transparent investigation into this incident.\"",
      "And GOP Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas said he's \"troubled by the events that have unfolded.\"",
      "Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt called Pretti's death a \"real tragedy\" in an interview on CNN. He argued most Americans want Mr. Trump to address immigration, but urged the administration to define its \"endgame,\" which he said can't be to \"deport every single non-U.S. citizen.\"",
      "\"I think the death of Americans, what we're seeing on TV, it's causing deep concerns over federal tactics and accountability,\" he said. \"Americans don't like what they're seeing right now.\"",
      "When Texas Gov. Greg Abbott was asked on a talk radio show about ICE's rocky approval ratings, the Trump-allied governor said the White House should \"recalibrate\" and \"maybe work from a different direction.\"",
      "He said immigration agencies should \"go about their job in a more structured way to make sure that they are going to remove these people without causing all the kinds of problems and fighting in communities that they are experiencing right now.\"",
      "Chris Madel, a Republican who was running for Minnesota governor, ended his bid on Monday. He cited the administration's immigration crackdown in the state as an \"unmitigated disaster.\"",
      "\"United States citizens, particularly those of color, live in fear. United States citizens are carrying papers to prove their citizenship. That's wrong. ICE has authorized its agents to raid homes using a civil warrant that need only be signed by a Border Patrol agent. That's unconstitutional and it's wrong,\" he said.",
      "In his announcement, Madel noted he has provided legal advice to Jonathan Ross, the ICE officer who shot and killed Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month.",
      "GOP Sen. Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania called for a \"full investigation\" and said that \"we must enforce our laws in a way that protects the public while maintaining its trust.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she's \"appalled at the violence in Minneapolis\" before turning her attention to an impending fight over a bill to fund DHS for the rest of the fiscal year. She noted that the bill includes funding for body-warn cameras, law enforcement de-escalation training and more oversight for detention facilities \u2014 provisions she said \"would make such incidents less likely to occur.\"",
      "In the wake of Pretti's death, a growing list of Senate Democrats have said they won't vote for the DHS funding bill unless changes are made, posing a problem for lawmakers' plan to bundle it with five other funding bills that have already passed the House. If the Senate doesn't pass that package of bills by the end of the day Friday, a partial government shutdown will begin.",
      "Immigration officials to face questioning as Republicans press for investigation",
      "Many Republicans have called for a comprehensive investigation into Pretti's killing.",
      "Patel has said ICE's Homeland Security Investigations branch will lead a federal probe into the shooting. Current and former agency officials told CBS News that approach is unusual since it tasks ICE with investigating the actions of another DHS agency: Border Patrol.",
      "Meanwhile, the Republican chairmen of the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees have requested that the heads of ICE, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services appear before the panels in the coming weeks.",
      "The letters, sent by Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Rep. Andrew Gabarino of New York, did not mention the killings of Pretti and Good, but would provide a chance for lawmakers to question officials about the Trump administration's controversial immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota.",
      "\"As you know, the Department of Homeland Security has been provided an exceptional amount of funding to secure our borders and enforce our immigration laws,\" Paul said in the letters, which were dated Monday. \"Congress has an obligation to conduct oversight of those tax dollars and ensure the funding is used to accomplish the mission, provide proper support for our law enforcement, and, most importantly, protect the American people.\"",
      "Noem, meanwhile, is expected to testify to the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 3, according to a spokesperson for GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the panel.",

      "Top Justice Department officials said Tuesday they expect to finish reviewing and publishing files on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein soon, but cannot provide a specific timeline.",
      "A federal law required the Justice Department to release its massive trove of records on Epstein by mid-December. The department has released over 100,000 pages so far, but it has acknowledged that the vast majority of documents that may relate to Epstein still haven't been made public, arguing more time is needed to ensure the files are properly redacted to protect the identities of survivors of Epstein's abuse.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi and other top Justice Department officials updated the judges in Epstein and his convicted associate Ghislaine Maxwell's cases on their efforts to scour through the documents in a letter sent Tuesday.",
      "They said they have made \"substantial progress,\" with hundreds of department employees manually reviewing millions of pages of records and, in some cases, conducting electronic name searches to find and redact hundreds of potential victims' identities.",
      "\"The Department currently expects that it will complete these processes with respect to substantially all of the potentially responsive documents, including publication to the Epstein Library website, in the near term,\" said the letter.",
      "The Justice Department said it \"is not able to provide a specific date at this time,\" and warned it may need to make \"additional efforts to ensure the protection of victim identifying information.\"",
      "Earlier this month, the Justice Department told a judge it had released 12,285 documents so far, totaling 125,575 pages, but more than 2 million documents were still \"in various stages of review\" \u2014 meaning it had reviewed less than 1% of its total possible records on Epstein. Some of those still-unreviewed documents may be duplicates, the department cautioned.",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed in mid-November, gave the Justice Department 30 days to release files on Epstein and Maxwell. That includes decades-old records from the earliest investigations into Epstein, documents from Epstein and Maxwell's 2019 and 2020 sex trafficking cases and files related to Epstein's death by suicide while in pre-trial custody.",
      "The law allows the government to redact the files under limited circumstances, including to take out victims' names. The judge in Maxwell's case has also required the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan to \"personally certify\" that any grand jury materials that are released have been \"rigorously reviewed\" to take out victims' identities.",
      "Some lawmakers have sharply criticized the Justice Department for the pace of its review, given that Congress required the files to be made public by Dec. 12.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who cosponsored the Epstein Files Transparency Act, suggested this month that the judge in Maxwell's case appoint an independent \"special master\" to ensure the files are made public.",
      "\"The Department of Justice is openly defying the law by refusing to release the full Epstein files,\" Khanna said in a statement. \"Millions of files are being kept from the public.\"",
      "Massie argued the Justice Department \"has shown it cannot be trusted with making the disclosures required by law.\"",
      "The Justice Department pushed back, arguing the law does not give Khanna and Massie the right to seek relief in court. The department has defended its handling of the files, saying \"careful, manual review\" is needed to protect victims.",
      "The judge overseeing Maxwell's case ruled last week that he didn't have authority to oversee the Justice Department's compliance with the law. He added that nothing is stopping Khanna and Massie from filing a separate lawsuit against the government, and said the two lawmakers raised \"legitimate concerns about whether DOJ is faithfully complying with federal law.\"",

      "The \"Doomsday Clock,\" a metaphor for how close humanity is to self-annihilation, was moved to 85 seconds to midnight on Tuesday, its closest point to catastrophe since the clock made its debut nearly 80 years ago.",
      "\"Humanity has not made sufficient progress on the existential risks that endanger us all,\" said Alexandra Bell, president and CEO of the\u00a0Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.",
      "The risks humanity faces from nuclear weapons, climate change and disruptive technologies are growing, Bell said. \"Every second counts, and we are running out of time,\" she said.",
      "Last year, the Bulletin set the clock at 89 seconds to midnight, which was its previous closest setting to midnight.",
      "Daniel Holz, the chair of the Bulletin's science and security board that sets the \"Doomsday Clock\" and a physics professor at the University of Chicago, said major countries became more aggressive, adversarial and nationalistic in the past year.",
      "Holz also noted that a 2010 strategic arms treaty between the U.S. and Russia is set to expire next week.",
      "\"For the first time in over half a century, there will be nothing preventing a runaway nuclear arms race,\" Holz said.",
      "On climate change, Holz said atmospheric carbon dioxide and global sea levels have reached record highs.",
      "\"Droughts, fires, floods and storms continue to intensify and become more erratic, and this will only get worse,\" Holz said.",
      "Holz also warned of a potential arms race surrounding artificial intelligence, which he said could result in dire consequences.",
      "\"AI is a significant and accelerating disruptive technology. AI is also supercharging mis- and disinformation, which makes it even more difficult to address all of the other threats we consider,\" Holz said.",
      "He also expressed concern about what he referred to as \"the increasing rise of nationalistic autocracies.\"",
      "\"If the world splinters into an us-versus-them, zero-sum approach, it increases the likelihood that we all lose,\" Holz said.",
      "Holz also noted the two fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti this month by federal agents in Minnesota and what he called an \"erosion of the constitutional rights of American citizens.\"",
      "\"History has shown that when governments become unaccountable to their own citizens, conflict and misery follow,\" Holz said.",
      "Bell said the issues that influence the clock's setting are solvable, but people need to work together to find the solution.",
      "\"Every time we've been able to turn back the hands of the clock, it's been because we had scientists and experts working to find solutions and a public that was demanding action,\" Bell said.",
      "The Bulletin first unveiled the clock in 1947 in the wake of the U.S. using atomic bombs against Japan in World War II. The group says its aims are to \"help advance actionable ideas to reduce existential threats.\"",
      "The clock's minute hand has been moved more than two dozen times in its nearly eight-decade history.",
      "The farthest the clock has been from midnight was 17 minutes in 1991, following the end of the Cold War and the signing of a strategic arms treaty between the Soviet Union and the U.S. to reduce their nuclear arsenals.",
      "In recent years, the clock has been ticking closer to midnight. The 2020s started with the clock moving to 100 seconds to midnight, with the group saying cyber-enabled information warfare was compounding the threat posed by nuclear war and climate change by undercutting society's ability to respond to either.",
      "The clock stayed in that position for the next two years until 2023, when it was moved to 90 seconds to midnight, largely because of what the group said were the increasing dangers posed by Russia's war in Ukraine. It stayed at that setting in 2024.",
      "Last year, the clock was moved one second closer to midnight, with the group saying, \"Despite unmistakable signs of danger, national leaders and their societies have failed to do what is needed to change course.\"",

    "summary": "The AAP is recommending immunization against 18 diseases.\u200b Earlier this month, the CDC reduced its recommendations for childhood vaccines to 11 diseases.",
    "story": [
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics released its recommendations for childhood vaccines on Monday, breaking significantly with the guidance released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this month.",
      "The AAP is continuing to recommend\u00a0immunization against 18 diseases, including RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rotavirus, influenza and meningococcal disease. The CDC had reduced its recommendations for childhood vaccines to 11 diseases.",
      "\"The AAP will continue to provide recommendations for immunizations that are rooted in science and are in the best interest of the health of infants, children and adolescents of this country,\" AAP President Andrew Racine said in a statement.",
      "Dr. Amanda Kravitz, a pediatrician at New York's Weill Cornell Medicine, told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil the AAP is \"still recommending all of the vaccines that we have been recommending for many, many years.\"",
      "\"So, there are no changes to the old vaccine schedule based on what the AAP is currently recommending,\" Kravitz said.",
      "Both the AAP and CDC recommend vaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, human papillomavirus (HPV) and varicella (chickenpox). Some vaccines, such as the MMR shot for measles, mumps and rubella, protect against multiple diseases.",
      "The CDC's revised guidance recommended that only children in high-risk categories receive immunizations for RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, dengue, meningococcal ACWY and meningococcal B. The AAP still recommends all of these, except for the dengue vaccine, which it only recommends for some children who are 9 to 16 years old, live in areas where the disease is endemic and have previously been infected. It also noted distribution of the dengue vaccine was discontinued in the U.S. last year due to low demand.",
      "The CDC had also said parents of children not in high-risk groups who want to vaccinate against COVID-19, influenza, meningococcal disease, hepatitis A and hepatitis B should base that decision on \"shared clinical decision-making\" with physicians.",
      "\"I want to emphasize this is unprecedented for the AAP and the CDC to diverge. They have been working in concert for decades,\" said Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News.",
      "\"The new APP vaccine guidance is basically the old CDC vaccine guidance \u2014 so the guidance that we had, the recommendations we had prior to the tTump administration and Secretary Kennedy running things at HHS and CDC,\" she said.",
      "Kravitz advised, \"It's important that you partner with your pediatrician. We are here to help you. We want to try to rid some of that confusion from families. So, we want you to bring your questions to us. We, as pediatricians, are going to follow the AAP recommendations, but we also want to have open lines of communication with our families.\"",
      "The AAP called the CDC's recent change in guidance \"dangerous and unnecessary\" at the time of its release.",
      "\"The AAP formerly partnered with the CDC to create a unified set of vaccine recommendations, but recent changes to the CDC immunization schedule depart from longstanding medical evidence and no longer offer the optimal way to prevent illnesses in children,\" the AAP said Monday. \"By contrast, the AAP childhood and adolescent immunization schedules continue to recommend immunizations based on the specific disease risks and health care delivery in the United States.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC, said in a statement Monday, \"The updated CDC childhood schedule continues to protect children against serious diseases while aligning U.S. guidance with international norms,\" adding it would \"work with states and clinicians to ensure families have clear, accurate information to make their own informed decisions.\"",
      "Kravitz said insurance will still cover vaccines no longer broadly recommended by the CDC, like the flu and COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "\"The way the CDC recommended them is there is still the option to get those vaccines if you'd like them, so insurance should cover every vaccine as long as parents want them,\" she said.",
      "The changes in the CDC childhood vaccine recommendations followed\u00a0a controversial December recommendation\u00a0on when children should receive their first dose of the\u00a0hepatitis B vaccine. For more than 30 years, the CDC advised that the first dose be given within 24 hours of birth. The CDC's vaccine advisory panel, which has been\u00a0hand-picked\u00a0by HHS Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, voted to recommend delaying the shot until a child is 2 months old for those born to mothers who test negative for the virus.",
      "In an interview with CBS News chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes earlier this month, Kennedy insisted, \"We're not taking vaccines away from anybody. If you want to get the vaccine, you can get it. It's gonna be fully covered by insurance, just like it was before.\"",
      "But Kennedy did concede there is now an added step to getting children the flu vaccine, as it requires consultation with a physician first, rather than it being freely administered at a pharmacy, and he said it might be \"a better thing\" if fewer people get the flu vaccine.",

    "story": [
      "A former mentor of Alex Pretti, the Minneapolis man who was shot and killed by federal agents over the weekend, remembers the ICU nurse as \"an absolutely warm, kind, and sweet\" person.",
      "\"It's indeed been absolutely devastating and very surreal to see our Alex have such a terrible, tragic end,\" Dr. Aasma Shaukat said of the deadly shooting during an interview on \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday.",
      "A few years after graduating from the University of Minnesota with a bachelor's degree in biology, society and the environment, Pretti got a job as a research assistant at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System. Shaukat said she hired Pretti in 2014 to work on research studies and \"got nothing but good reviews\" as he helped enroll veterans into the program.",
      "When Pretti expressed an interest in nursing school, Shaukat said the staff fully supported him, writing letters of recommendation for his application and making his work schedule more flexible so he could juggle classes and his position as a research scientist. He eventually got a job as an intensive care nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital.",
      "\"He was just dedicated to health care and really wanted to make a difference in his community and help his fellow citizens,\" she said.",
      "Shaukat said she wasn't surprised to see Pretti protesting federal immigration enforcement in Minneapolis, saying he was always \"very strong on his values\" and had \"a lot of compassion.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security says Border Patrol officers acted in self-defense Saturday after Pretti approached them with a handgun, but did not say whether he \"brandished\" the weapon. Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino claims \"defensive shots\" were fired after Pretti \"violently resisted\" disarmament. Pretti had a permit to carry and no criminal record. Minnesota officials say videos from the scene contradict the agency's account of the encounter.",
      "Videos show Pretti holding up a cellphone moments before he was fatally shot. Like many, Shaukat said she watched footage of Pretti's final moments.",
      "\"Now, Alex was of a slight build, so in no way, shape or form was he ever threatening. He doesn't look like he's kicking or, you know, trying to fight back,\" she said after watching videos of the scene. \"He's essentially just, you know, trying \u2013 he's completely defenseless, and then he's shot. It is just horrific to see.\"",

    "summary": "The decision to place HSI in the lead investigative role is unusual and has raised questions among current and former federal law enforcement officials.",
    "story": [
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations branch is leading the federal investigation into the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, FBI Director Kash Patel said.",
      "HSI will be assisted by the FBI, according to multiple U.S. officials briefed on the investigation. U.S. Customs and Border Protection is also conducting an internal administrative review through its Office of Professional Responsibility, as per standard practice, the officials said.",
      "Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse at the Department of Veterans Affairs, was shot and killed by an ICE agent around 9 a.m. local time Saturday in south Minneapolis.",
      "The decision to place HSI in the lead investigative role is unusual and has raised questions among current and former federal law enforcement officials, given that HSI is not typically tasked with investigating officer-involved shootings and is not structured or equipped to handle core elements of such cases, including ballistics analysis, forensic processing, firearm examinations, video review and large-scale witness canvassing.",
      "HSI historically has investigated crimes with an international or immigration nexus, including human trafficking, drug smuggling, child exploitation and the theft of stolen artifacts.",
      "Patel said on Fox News, \"All the pieces of the investigation are being led by DHS in HSI, and I don't want to comment on their ongoing investigation.\"",
      "Patel added that investigators are focused on \"mostly scientific evidence,\" including fingerprints, DNA, how many rounds were fired and other physical evidence associated with the firearm.",
      "A former senior ICE and HSI official told CBS News that the approach marks a clear break from prior administrations and long-standing practice. The official said it makes little sense for the Department of Homeland Security to oversee a criminal investigation into a fatal shooting involving its own personnel rather than turning the matter over to an outside entity, describing the current setup as highly irregular.",
      "\"That's not the way it was done before this admin,\" one former senior ICE official told CBS News, calling the Trump administration's move \"not normal.\"",
      "The former official noted HSI agents are criminal investigators, but said a probe into a Border Patrol shooting should be handled by an entity outside of the Department of Homeland Security. Both ICE and Border Patrol are overseen by DHS.",
      "Any potential prosecution would still have to be handled by the Justice Department.",
      "Pretti is the second person killed by federal agents in recent weeks in Minneapolis, after Renee Good\u00a0was fatally shot\u00a0on Jan. 7. In both cases, administration officials said the agents were acting in self-defense, but eyewitness accounts and videos appeared to contradict some of their claims.",
      "DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti approached several officers with a handgun. They attempted to disarm him, but he \"reacted violently,\" and \"fearing for his life and the lives of his fellow officers around him, an agent fired defensive shots,\" she said.",
      "Bystander videos\u00a0reviewed and verified by CBS News show Pretti was holding a phone in his right hand and nothing in his left before the shooting.\u00a0Multiple videos\u00a0show\u00a0a federal agent reaching into the scuffle empty-handed and emerging with a gun in his right hand, then turning away from the man when the first shot is fired.",
      "Local officials said Pretti was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry, and that his only previous interaction with law enforcement was for traffic violations.\u00a0Under Minnesota law, it's legal to carry a handgun in public if you have a valid permit.",
      "Witnesses who said they were at the scene of the shooting also contradicted accounts of federal officials, with one saying in a sworn declaration submitted in federal court, \"The man did not approach the agents with a gun. He approached them with a camera.\"",
      "He also said \"agents pulled the man on the ground,\" adding, \"I didn't see him touch any of them.\"",

      "They told The Associated Press he was an avid outdoorsman who loved getting in adventures with Joule, his beloved Catahoula Leopard dog who also recently died. He had participated in protests following the killing of\u00a0Renee Good, who was shot\u00a0behind the wheel of her SUV by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Law Enforcement officer earlier this month.",
      "\"He cared about people deeply and he was very upset with what was happening in Minneapolis and throughout the United States with ICE, as millions of other people are upset,\" said Michael Pretti, Alex's father. \"He felt that doing the protesting was a way to express that, you know, his care for others.\"",
      "Pretti was a U.S. citizen, born in Illinois. Like Good, court records showed he had no criminal record and his family said he had never had any interactions with law enforcement beyond a couple of traffic tickets.",
      "In a recent conversation with their son, his parents, who live in Wisconsin, told him to be careful when protesting.",
      "\"We had this discussion with him two weeks ago or so, you know, that go ahead and protest, but do not engage, do not do anything stupid, basically,\" Michael Pretti said. \"And he said he knows that. He knew that.\"",
      "A neighbor described Pretti as someone who \"would always be willing to help others.\"",
      "\"I didn't know Alex super well, but he was a great guy and neighbor,\" she told CBS Minnesota station WCCO. \"He loved his car and took very good care of it. He used to have a dog who passed around a year or two ago, I think. I remember how sweet it was that, as his dog was more elderly, less mobile, he'd be willing to carry him down to the yard to get some fresh air and to enjoy the outdoors. His dog would lay down and Alex would sit with him and pet him for long periods of time. He was very caring, you could tell. We are all heartbroken and are praying for his family and friends and for justice for him.\"",
      "Alex Pretti grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he played football, baseball and ran track for Preble High School. He was a Boy Scout and sang in the Green Bay Boy Choir.",
      "After graduation, he went to the University of Minnesota, graduating in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in biology, society and the environment, according to the family. He worked as a research scientist before returning to school to become a registered nurse.",

      "Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara also said police believed he was a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said\u00a0the shooting happened\u00a0after he \"approached\" U.S. Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. Officials did not specify if Pretti brandished the gun, and it is not visible in bystander videos of the shooting obtained and verified by CBS News, The AP and other outlets.",

      "\"Alex was a kindhearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends and also the American veterans whom he cared for as an ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital,\" they said. \"Alex wanted to make a difference in this world. Unfortunately he will not be with us to see his impact. I do not throw around the hero term lightly. However his last thought and act was to protect a woman,\" referring to his effort to aid another protester who was pushed by an officer.",
      "They accused the Trump administration of telling \"sickening lies\" and said \"Alex is clearly not holding a gun when attacked.\"",

      "The family first learned of the shooting when they were called by an Associated Press reporter. They watched the video and said the man killed appeared to be their son. They then tried reaching out to officials in Minnesota.",
      "\"I can't get any information from anybody,\" Michael Pretti said Saturday. \"The police, they said call Border Patrol, Border Patrol's closed, the hospitals won't answer any questions?\"",
      "Eventually, the family called the Hennepin County Medical Examiner, who they said confirmed there was a body matching the name and description of their son.",
      "As of Saturday evening, the family said they had still not heard from anyone at a federal law enforcement agency about their son's death.",
      "Pretti's ex-wife, who spoke to the AP but later said she didn't want her name used, said she was not surprised he would have been involved in protesting Trump's immigration crackdown. She said she had not spoken to him since they divorced more than two years ago and she moved to another state.",
      "She said he was a Democratic voter and that he had participated in the wave of street protests following the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, not far from the couple's neighborhood. She described him a someone who might shout at law enforcement officers at a protest, but she had never known him to be physically confrontational.",
      "She said Pretti got a permit to carry a concealed firearm about three years ago and that he owned at least one semiautomatic handgun when they separated.",
      "Pretti had \"a great heart\" and \"loved this country\"",
      "Pretti lived in a four-unit condominium building about 2 miles from where he was shot. Neighbors described him as quiet and warmhearted.",
      "\"He's a wonderful person,\" said Sue Gitar, who lived downstairs from Pretti and said he moved into the building about three years ago. \"He has a great heart.\"",
      "If there was something suspicious going on in the neighborhood, or when they worried the building might have a gas leak, he would jump in to help.",
      "Pretti lived alone and worked long hours as a nurse, but he was not a loner, his neighbors said, and would sometimes have friends over.",
      "His neighbors knew he had guns \u2014 he'd occasionally take a rifle to shoot at a gun range \u2014 but were surprised at the idea that he might carry a pistol on the streets.",
      "\"I never thought of him as a person who carried a gun,\" said Gitar.",
      "His parents said their last conversation with their son was a couple of days before his death. They talked about repairs he had done to the garage door of his home. The worker was a Latino man, and they said with all that was happening in Minneapolis, he gave the man a $100 tip.",
      "Pretti's mother said her son cared immensely about the direction the county was headed, especially the Trump administration's rollback of environmental regulations.",
      "\"He hated that, you know, people were just trashing the land,\" Susan Pretti said. \"He was an outdoorsman. He took his dog everywhere he went. You know, he loved this country, but he hated what people were doing to it.\"",

      "Minneapolis police on Saturday urged people to avoid the area near Nicollet Avenue and 26th Street following the deadly shooting of\u00a037-year-old Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse. Homeland Security alleged he \"approached\" Border Patrol agents with a handgun, but\u00a0multiple videos taken before the shooting show Pretti \u2014 a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry \u2014 without a weapon in hand before agents tackled him to the ground.",

      "Tomme Beevas' restaurant is located on Nicollet Avenue, also just a short walk away from the shooting.

    "story": [
      "Carlisle Rivera, a man who prosecutors say was hired by Iranian operative Farhad Shakeri as part of a murder-for-hire plot to assassinate Iranian dissident\u00a0Masih Alinejad, was sentenced to 15 years in prison on Wednesday.",
      "Alinejad has survived three plots by Iran's regime to kill or kidnap her. On Wednesday, she confronted Rivera at his sentencing in federal court in Manhattan.",
      "\"Now I'm going to face the killer, my would-be assassin,\" Alinejad, a critic of Iran's repression of women, said before sentencing. \"But the main killer in my eyes is the IRGC (Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps).\"",
      "Both Alinejad and her husband spoke at Wednesday's emotional sentencing, telling the court they live in constant fear. Alinejad said the Iranian government seeks to silence her and make it so that she cannot live a normal life. She implored the judge to hand down the maximum sentence, which he did, to send a message to the Iranian government, but he also noted that the sentencing wasn't just about Iran, but about Rivera himself and the crime he committed.",
      "After Rivera was sentenced, Alinejad told CBS News, \"Justice is always beautiful. It is justice for me.\"",
      "\"But, in the bigger picture, no,\" she responded when asked if the sentencing was justice, saying it was not enough to just put her would-be killers behind bars.",
      "\"This is kind of the [Iranian] regime challenging U.S. national security, on U.S. soil, sending a signal that we can do whatever we want,\" she said, adding that real justice would be seeing \"the man who ordered my killing ... behind bars,\" she said in reference to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who she said she wants to see \"humiliated the same way as\" former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who was captured by U.S. forces in a military operation in Venezuela earlier this month and brought back to New York to face federal charges.",
      "It was the second time that Alinejad has faced a man charged with plotting to assassinate her in the past year. Two men, who prosecutors said were members of a Russian mob hired by Iran, received 25-year prison terms in October for attempting to kill Alinejad at her Brooklyn home.",
      "\"The IRGC, the Revolutionary Guards, is behind the assassination plots. The same IRGC that is ordering a massacre right now in Iran,\" she said. \"I've been bombarded by Iranians receiving videos showing the IRGC using AK-47 military weapons to kill people. The same IRGC gave money to the assassins here to buy AK-47s to end my life.\"",
      "Prosecutors said Shakeri was \"tasked by the regime to direct a network of criminal associates to further Iran's assassination plots against its targets.\"",
      "Prosecutors alleged that in the latest attempt, Shakeri directed two criminal associates in New York, Rivera and Jonathan Loadholt, to murder Alinejad.",
      "That attempt was set to take place in February 2024 at Fairfield University in Connecticut, where Alinejad had a speaking event.",
      "After months of surveillance, their plot was foiled. Rivera and Loadholt were arrested in November 2024 and pleaded guilty before the case could go to trial.",
      "Loadholt's sentencing is scheduled for April 23. Shakeri is believed to be in Iran.",
      "Federal authorities said Shakeri told them he also had been assigned by the IRGC to arrange to kill President Trump before the 2024 election.",
      "\"It sounds weird,\" Alinejad said Wednesday after Shakeri's sentencing. \"Because President Trump has an army, everything, power. I'm just an Iranian, unarmed woman, with a lot of hair, with a big voice. That's it. And that shows you that the regime in Iran is really scared of its own people.\"",
      "She said it was a \"badge of honor that they hate me. Whatever it is I did, that they hate me that much that they want to get rid of me as much as they want to get rid of President Trump.\"",
      "When she first learned the same man had plotted to kill her and Mr. Trump, Alinejad \"laughed loud\" and told her husband: \"Wow, they think I am as powerful as President Trump. ... Just my voice. My weapon is my voice.\"",
      "At the same time, Alinejad said she felt scared, recalling how for years the Iranian regime said America is the \"great Satan\" and \"biggest enemy of Iran.\"",
      "\"The same group who targeted President Trump, they wanted to target me,\" she said. \"It means that now in their eyes, I am the great Satan. I am their biggest enemy.\"",
      "Alinejad is a journalist and leader of a movement to free Iranian women of the compulsory hijab. She fled Iran in 2009, settling in the United States.",
      "She alleges Khamenei ordered her killing, pointing to a speech in which he refers to an \"American agent\" who had compared the compulsory hijab to the Berlin Wall. Alinejad has previously made that exact comparison.",
      "Alinejad said that the day before she was scheduled to speak at Fairfield University, the FBI came to her home to warn her about an imminent threat. Agents took her to a safe house. The university cancelled the event.",
      "\"I want to face him and say, really you wanted to shoot at a university? How many innocent students could have been killed by you?\" she said of Rivera's sentencing.",
      "Alinejad views her mission as exposing the situation in Iran and giving voice to victims, but worries the attempts on her life will create a fear of inviting her to speak.",
      "\"By sending killers to America, they're not just targeting me. They're targeting the freedom of speech in America,\" she said. \"They are trying to cover up their massacre.\"",
      "\"I'm very grateful to America for bringing my would-be assassins to justice,\" added Alinejad. \"But I want the greatest sponsor of terrorism, Ali Khamenei, who ordered my killing and now ordered the massacre in Iran, to be held accountable by the United States of America.\"",

      "Almost a hundred new animal species that survived a mass extinction event half a billion years ago have been discovered in a small quarry in China, scientists revealed Wednesday.",
      "The treasure trove of fossils offers a rare glimpse into a cataclysmic event that brought a sudden end to the greatest explosion of life in our planet's history.",
      "The site where the fossils were found in the southern Chinese province of Hunan was \"extraordinary,\" Han Zeng of the Chinese Academy of Sciences told AFP.",
      "\"We have collected over 50,000 fossil specimens from a single quarry that is 12 meters high, 30 meters long and eight meters wide,\" added the lead author of a new study in the journal Nature.",
      "In this small space, the Chinese team uncovered more than 150 different species \u2014 91 of them new to science \u2014 between 2021 and 2024.",
      "Han described \"wonderful experiences when we realized that those animals were right there on the rock.\"",
      "\"Many fossils show soft parts including gills, guts, eyes and even nerves,\" he added.",
      "Among the species discovered were ancient relatives of worms, sponges and jellyfish.",
      "They also found many arthropods \u2014 a family that includes modern-day crabs and insects \u2014 including spiny, stalk-eyed creatures called radiodonts which were the apex predator of the time.",
      "The discovery is particularly exciting for scientists because of the period when these strange animals lived.",
      "Evolution's big bang",
      "Life first emerged on Earth more than 3.5 billion years ago \u2014 but was little more than a layer of slime for most of our planet's history.",
      "Then came the Cambrian\u00a0explosion, known as evolution's \"big bang,\" roughly 540 million years ago. Suddenly, most of the major groups of animals alive today \u2014 including vertebrates which would eventually include humans \u2014 evolved and started populating the world's oceans.",
      "This burst of life is thought to have been driven by a rise in oxygen in Earth's atmosphere.",
      "However, it came to a sudden end when up to half of all animals died off 513 million years ago. This mass extinction, known as the Sinsk event, is thought to have been caused by declining oxygen levels.",
      "The animals in the Chinese quarry, which were dated to around 512 million years ago, represent the first major discovery of soft-bodied fossils that lived directly after the Sinsk event, Han explained.",
      "This means the fossils \u2014 dubbed the Huayuan biota after the county where they were found \u2014 \"open a new window into what happened,\" he added.",
      "\"It surprised us\"",
      "Michael Lee, an evolutionary biologist at the South Australian Museum not involved in the research, said \"the new fossils from China demonstrate that the Sinsk event affected shallow water forms most severely.\"",
      "A deep-water fish called coelacanth similarly survived the mass extinction that wiped out all the dinosaurs that did not evolve into birds, he pointed out.",
      "\"The deep ocean is one of the most stable environments through geological time, in a similar way to how the cellar of a house is buffered from daily and seasonal changes and has less temperature fluctuations than the attic,\" Lee told AFP.",
      "Han said his team was also surprised that some of the animals in the quarry had also been found at Canada's Burgess Shale site, which dates from an early period of the Cambrian explosion.",
      "This suggests that these animals were already able to travel halfway across the world at this early stage, he added.",
      "\"It surprised us when we found the Huayuan biota shared various animals with the Burgess Shale, including the arthropods Helmetia and Surusicaris that were previously only known from the Burgess Shale,\" Zeng told Reuters. \"As larval stages are common in extant marine invertebrates, the best explanation of these shared taxa shall be that the larvae of early animals were capable of spreading by ocean currents since the early days of animals in the Cambrian.\"",
      "The Sinsk event is not considered among the best-known \"Big Five\" mass extinctions in our planet's history.",
      "Han said there is evidence of 18 or more mass extinctions over the last 540 million years, calling for more attention to be paid to the immensely destructive events.",
      "Scientists have long debated whether dinosaurs were in decline before an\u00a0asteroid smacked the Earth\u00a066 million years ago, causing mass extinction. Recent research suggests dinosaur populations were still thriving in North America before the asteroid strike.",

      "Oleksii Balesta, Deputy Minister for Development of Communities and Territories of Ukraine, told CBS News on Wednesday that Russia has been using larger drones in higher quantities, which is increasing the lethality of its strikes.",
      "But according to a recent report from the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for the Study of War, another reason for Russia's deadlier strikes is its use of Starlink satellite systems to more accurately hit targets.",
      "This week, Polish Foreign Minister Rados\u0142aw Sikorski raised the issue with Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX owns and operates the Starlink satellite network. In a post on Musk's platform X, Sikorski asked the American businessman to \"stop the Russians from using Starlinks to target Ukrainian cities.\"",
      "On X, Musk called Sikorski a \"drooling imbecile\" and said that Starlink's terms of service \"do not allow for offensive military use, as it is a civilian commercial system.\" Musk also highlighted Ukraine's use of the Starlink system for military communications.",
      "Two Ukrainian defense analysts have said the train may have been hit by Shaheds - a favorite weapon of Russia amid its ongoing full-scale invasion - equipped with the SpaceX technology.",
      "\"Russia has started using Starlink on other drones, and now is using it on Shaheds as well,\" analyst Olena Kryzhanivska told CBS News on Wednesday. \"The attack yesterday was not surprising at all. It was expected.\"",
      "Serhiy Beskrestnov, a Ukrainian military analyst and expert on drone warfare, said in a social media post Wednesday that the moving train was hit by, \"Shaheds with online control.\"",
      "\"It was not the locomotive, but the center of the train,\" Beskrestnov noted in his post, accusing the Russian drone's pilot of attacking a passenger car, \"intentionally and consciously,\" and specifically questioning whether Starlink might have been used.",
      "SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment by CBS News on the claims that its Starlink technology may have been used in the drone strike on the train, and by Russian forces more widely to target civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.",
      "Kryzhanivska said trains make easy targets for precision-guided Russian weapons.",
      "\"The territory of Ukraine is not targeted evenly with air defense systems and mobile fire units,\" Kryzhanivska said. \"There is no protocol in place for what to do when there is a Shahed drone approaching a train. What can the crew do? Should they stop the train? Or continue moving?\"",

    "story": [
      "The European Union and India announced a landmark Free Trade Agreement on Tuesday. The two economies, which together represent about a quarter of the world's population, spent nearly two decades haggling over the terms of the deal.",
      "So what brought them together to finally ink what the EU has lauded as the \"mother of all deals\"?",
      "Statements by European leaders suggest the self-proclaimed king of the deal, President Trump, and his tariffs-based trade policy over the last year, likely helped propel the two sides toward a final agreement.",
      "And they're not alone.",
      "Many of the world's major economies have raced to forge new bilateral agreements as doing business with the U.S. has become suddenly, and in many cases dramatically, more expensive and less predictable.",
      "India and EU sign the \"mother of all deals\"",
      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the trade deal with the EU \"historic,\" arguing that it would \"deepen the economic ties, create new opportunities \u2026 and strengthen the partnership\" between the \"world's two largest democracies.\"",
      "He said it would \"make access to European markets easier for India's farmers and small businesses\" and boost his country's manufacturing and services sectors.",
      "The deal will see tariffs slashed across a wide range of products, including textiles, apparel, leather, footwear, gems and jewelry, handicrafts, engineering goods and automobiles. India will also cut tariffs on wine, beer and olive oil imported from the EU. Both economies will get unprecedented, preferential market access to each other's products, their leaders said Tuesday.",
      "Europe's massive auto industry, as an example, will see current Indian tariffs on imported vehicles from the bloc slashed from as high as 110% to 10%.",
      "\"We did it, we delivered the mother of all deals,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at the event announcing the deal in New Delhi.",
      "The free trade agreement, which will be formally signed later this year after it's approved by the European Parliament and the bloc's individual member states, will allow free trade of goods between India and the 27 EU nations.",
      "Together, India and the EU account for\u00a0 25% of global GDP and about a third of global trade, according to a statement from the Indian government. The EU is already one of India's biggest economic partners, with bilateral trade worth around $137 billion in 2024-25. By comparison, bilateral U.S.-India trade in that period totalled around $132 billion.",

      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer landed in China Tuesday, beginning the first visit by a U.K. leader to the country since 2018.",
      "\"For years, our approach to China has been dogged by inconsistency \u2013 blowing hot and cold, from Golden Age to Ice Age. But like it or not, China matters for the U.K. As one of the world's biggest economic players, a strategic and consistent relationship with them is firmly in our national interest,\" Starmer said in a statement before leaving for Beijing. \"That does not mean turning a blind eye to the challenges they pose \u2013 but engaging even where we disagree. This is what our allies do, and what I will do: delivering for the public, putting more money in their pockets and keeping them safe through pragmatic, consistent co-operation abroad.\"",
      "Starmer, who traveled with a delegation of representatives from leading U.K. businesses including HSBC and Jaguar Land Rover, was expected to meet President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang to discuss \"trade, investment and national security,\" according to a statement from the British government.",
      "\"In a time of growing global instability, where events abroad continue to rebound on people at home, the Prime Minister has promised to act in the U.K.'s national interest,\" the government said.",
      "Dr Yu Jie, a senior research fellow on China at Chatham House, told CBS News partner network BBC News that China also had incentives to forge closer ties with the U.K., potentially seeing it as a destination for investment that could bring \"order and organization\" amid the \"disruption\" caused by President Trump's foreign policy.",
      "Canada and China trade deal",
      "Earlier this month, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited Beijing, becoming the first Canadian leader to visit China in nearly a decade.",
      "Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a deal to lower tit-for-tat tariffs between the two nations on things like canola oil and electric vehicles.",
      "Xi hailed the agreement as a \"turnaround\" in the relationship between China and Canada, the latter of which has been seeking to diversify its trade partnerships.",
      "Canada's largest trade partner is the United States, but that relationship is under increasing strain as a result of\u00a0 President Trump's inconsistent tariff policy. It was an issue Carney alluded to during his visit, when asked if China was a more predictable and reliable partner to Canada than the United States.",
      "\"The one comparison I will give you with the United States, our relationship is \u2026 much more multifaceted, much deeper, much broader than it is with China,\" Carney said. \"But yes, in terms of the way that our relationship has progressed in recent months with China, it is more predictable, and you see results coming from that.\"",
      "President Trump reacted to the agreement by threating to impose 100% tariffs on Canadian imports to the U.S. if it is finalized.",
      "\"If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,\" he said in a post on his Truth Social platform.",
      "Are Trump's tariffs fueling a trade boom for China?",
      "The push for bilateral deals comes as President Trump puts huge pressure on many of America's longtime partners and allies, both economically and politically. Some analysts think that pressure is benefitting one of America's biggest adversaries.",
      "\"Many countries previously have not been China-friendly are now kind of pivoting to China ... because the United States is becoming a lot less predictable,\" Aleksandar Tomic, an economics professor at Boston College, told the Reuters news agency. \"The more the U.S. gets difficult to deal with, the more it opens up for China.\"",
      "\"I think China has done a good job and rightly so to position itself as the reliable and stable trade partner,\" Derrick Irwin, co-head of intrinsic emerging markets equity at Allspring Global Investments, told Reuters. \"They basically said, look, you've got a massive trade partner in the U.S. that's become a little more uncertain. We can offer predictability and certainty. And I think that's very fair.\"",
      "Some experts also cautioned that growing distrust in the U.S. does not necessarily mean China will prove to be a reliable economic partner.",
      "\"Many of these countries harbor deep concerns about China's approach to trade, its use of economic coercion, and unresolved maritime and historical disputes,\" Patricia Kim, a foreign policy fellow at Washington-based Brookings Institution, told Reuters. \"In the current moment, China may appear more restrained or pragmatic when compared with the Trump administration's extreme rhetoric and actions. But Beijing's actual behavior has not been especially reassuring.\"",
      "A \"strong message,\" but is the U.S. missing out?",
      "Mr. Trump hit India with 50% tariffs last year \u2013 with half of that levy imposed to punish India for maintaining its Russian oil imports \u2013 amid hectic negotiations over a bilateral trade deal. The U.S. and India have said they're close to finalizing a deal, but with lingering tension over India's Russian energy purchases, no dates have been set.",
      "\"I think they [India and U.S.] are actually very close behind the scenes,\" Mark Linscott, trade policy expert and senior advisor at the U.S. India Strategic Partnership Forum, told CBS News. \"I think a few compromises on both sides will get them to an agreement.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has also imposed steep tariffs on European imports, though he backed down quickly from a threat to hit the bloc with even higher rates amid a standoff over Greenland.",
      "European leaders were keen to point out that the free trade agreement with India showed a bloc open for business \u2014 with loosely veiled jabs at Mr. Trump's policies.",
      "Without mentioning the American leader by name, European Council President Ant\u00f3nio Costa said the bilateral deal with India sent an \"important political message to the world, that India and the EU believe more in trade agreements than in tariffs.\"",
      "Von der Leyen called the deal a \"strong message that cooperation is the best answer to global challenges.\"",
      "In the last seven months, India has also signed major trade agreements with the U.K., Oman and New Zealand. The EU has also done a deal with the South American bloc Mercosur, following deals last year with Indonesia, Mexico and Switzerland.",
      "But while Mr. Trump's policies may be pushing other countries to forge deals beyond Washington, Linscott, who was a U.S. trade negotiator during Mr. Trump's first term, said the U.S. has not been sidelined.",
      "\"If you look at the last 12 months, the country that has concluded the most number of trade deals is the United States. There are plenty of countries around the world who are still interested in doing deals with the U.S.,\" he said.",
      "He told CBS News that the spate of recent trade agreements is likely rooted in efforts \"to diversify trade and secure supply chains\" in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, when \"it became clear how vulnerable those were.\"",

    "story": [
      "Australian authorities have sparked a backlash by killing a group of dingoes linked to the death of a young Canadian woman on an island in the country's east.",
      "The Queensland government said six wild dogs were put down after 19-year-old backpacker Piper James's body was found on January 19 at a beach on the World Heritage-listed island of K'gari.",
      "The euthanization program has stirred debate about how to manage the local population of dingoes, a sandy-colored canine believed to have first arrived in Australia 4,000 to 5,000 years ago.",
      "An autopsy conducted on James' body found evidence \"consistent with drowning\" but also detected injuries corresponding to dingo bites. Police said her\u00a0body had been discovered\u00a090 minutes after she went for a morning swim.",
      "\"Pre-mortem dingo bite marks are not likely to have caused immediate death,\" said a spokesperson for the Coroners Court of Queensland.",
      "The coroner's investigation into the cause of death was expected to take several weeks.",
      "In response, the Queensland government said a pack of 10 dingoes involved would be euthanized after rangers had observed some \"aggressive behavior.\"",
      "Six of the dingoes had already been euthanized, the state's environment minister, Andrew Powell, told reporters Sunday.",
      "\"Obviously, the operation will continue,\" he said.",
      "The traditional owners of K'gari, the Butchulla people, said the state's failure to consult with them before euthanizing the dingoes -- or wongari in their language -- was \"unexpected and disappointing.\"",
      "\"Once again, it feels as though economic priorities are being placed above the voices of the people and traditional owners, which is frustrating and difficult to accept,\" the Butchulla Aboriginal Corporation said in a statement to Australian media this week.",
      "\"They're just being wild animals\"",
      "Wildlife experts said killing the animals was the wrong response and may threaten the island's dingo population, estimated at just 70-200 animals.",
      "Given their small numbers, killing a pack of 10 animals would harm the population's genetic diversity, said Mathew Crowther, professor of quantitative conservation biology at the University of Sydney.",
      "\"There's no moral from the dingoes' point of view. They're just being wild animals, doing wild things,\" Crowther told AFP.",
      "Dingoes tend to lose their fear of people as they interact with tourists, some of whom defy advice against feeding the animals.",
      "\"That's the worst thing you can do to a wild animal,\" Crowther said.",
      "\"They just relate humans to food, and if you don't give them food, well, you are food -- that's basically how it is.\"",
      "Dingoes are wild, predatory animals and need to be treated with respect, said Bill Bateman, associate professor in the school of molecular and life sciences at Curtin University.",
      "The canines are more likely to attack children or people who are alone, and may be triggered when people turn their backs or run, he said.",
      "\"These are important animals, and therefore we need to change the way we deal with them, otherwise we're just going to keep reacting to these attacks and driving the population of dingoes down,\" Bateman told AFP.",
      "Wildlife managers, rangers, Indigenous people and tourism operators need to work together so that humans and dingoes can coexist on the island, he said.",
      "Todd James, the father of Piper, has described on social media how his family's hearts were \"shattered\" by her death.",
      "News of the dingoes' euthanization was \"heart-wrenching,\" he told Australian media, adding however that he recognized it may be necessary for safety because of the pack's behavior.",
      "Todd James previously said a \"smoke ceremony\" for his daughter would be held in Australia, and the family planned to attend, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.",
      "Local mayor\u00a0George Seymour\ufeff told 9News\u00a0the last fatal dingo attack on the island was 25 years ago and that there had been \"an escalation of aggressive dingo activity\" in recent years.",
      "\"A big part of what (the rangers) do is to try and separate dingoes from humans, but we're continuing to have this situation of dingoes, and in some ways it's inevitable that there will be a fatality, given how many bites and attacks are happening over the years,\" Seymour told 9News.",
      "The government's Ministry of Environment and Tourism issued an alert last month, saying that \"heightened dingo activity has been recorded at several locations along the eastern beach\" on K'gari.",
      "Three years ago, a pack of dingoes\u00a0mauled a 23-year-old jogger\u00a0in an attack police said was almost fatal. The dogs had driven the woman into the surf before a tourist came to her rescue, beating off the dingoes. Police said the man had saved her life.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump threatened Iran on Wednesday with an attack \"far worse\" than the strikes he ordered against the country's nuclear sites in June if Tehran doesn't agree to a deal to curb its\u00a0 nuclear program.",
      "\"A massive Armada is heading to Iran. It is moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose. It is a larger fleet, headed by the great Aircraft Carrier Abraham Lincoln, than that sent to Venezuela. Like with Venezuela, it is, ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfill its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary,\" Mr. Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. \"Hopefully Iran will quickly 'Come to the Table' and negotiate a fair and equitable deal \u2014 NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS \u2014 one that is good for all parties. Time is running out, it is truly of the essence!\"",
      "Mr. Trump said that if Iran did not come to an agreement with the United States, the U.S. could carry out an attack worse than its previous one in June, when it hit multiple nuclear sites with bunker busting bombs.",
      "\"As I told Iran once before, MAKE A DEAL! They didn't, and there was 'Operation Midnight Hammer,' a major destruction of Iran. The next attack will be far worse! Don't make that happen again. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday.",
      "As of Tuesday, a U.S. official confirmed to CBS News that the USS Abraham Lincoln Aircraft Carrier Strike Group, which includes the carrier and three destroyers, had crossed into the U.S. military's Central Command area of responsibility, which includes the Middle East and the waters around Iran, though it had not necessarily reached its intended final deployment location.",
      "While Mr. Trump has issued threats to Iran for weeks, and as the Lincoln strike group nears the region, his rhetoric had largely been about Iran's brutal quashing of massive street protests. The Truth Social post on Wednesday was the first time he had linked the major U.S. Navy deployment in the Persian Gulf region to the stalled nuclear negotiations.",
      "Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York said in a social media post on Wednesday, after Mr. Trump's post, that the country \"stands ready for dialogue based on mutual respect and interests\u2014BUT IF PUSHED, IT WILL DEFEND ITSELF AND RESPOND LIKE NEVER BEFORE!\"",
      "\"Last time the U.S. blundered into wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, it squandered over $7 trillion and lost more than 7,000 American lives,\" the Iranian mission said.",
      "Last week, he said the \"armada\" of U.S. warships was heading for the Middle East as he continued to watch the Iranian regime's response to the massive protests that began in late December.",
      "\"We have a lot of ships going that direction just in case,\" he told reporters on Thursday. He called it a \"good sign\" that Iranian authorities had decided not to hang protesters, adding: \"We have an armada heading that direction and maybe we won't have to use it.\"",
      "Iran's army commander reiterated recent statements on Wednesday from the country's leaders, saying Iran was ready for any attack by its enemies.",
      "\"The Islamic Republic of Iran Army is always ready to confront any threat, and if anything happens, the enemy will certainly suffer severe damage,\" Rear Admiral Habibollah Sayyari, Chief of Staff and Deputy Coordinator of the Islamic Republic of Iran Army, said Wednesday, according to Iranian state media. \"We stand against any threat on land, in the air, and at sea, and the army is always ready to confront any threat.\"",
      "Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, meanwhile, said Wednesday that he was in \"continuous contact\" with his counterparts in other regional countries, including U.S. ally Qatar, and that they agreed any new military action against Tehran would destabilize the Middle East.",
      "\"Last night, I spoke with the Foreign Minister of Qatar,\" Araghichi was quoted as saying by Iranian media. \"The prevailing view across the region is that any military threat, given the nature of the U.S. presence here, would lead to instability throughout the entire region.\"",
      "Araghchi was quoted as telling reporters on the sidelines of a weekly cabinet meeting in Tehran that he had had no contact with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff in recent days, and that Iran had not sought new negotiations with Washington, though he added that the two sides remained in touch through intermediaries.",
      "\"Our position is precisely that pursuing diplomacy through military threats cannot be effective,\" he said. \"If they want negotiations to take place, they must set aside threats, excessive demands, and the raising of illogical issues. Negotiations have their own principles and must be conducted on an equal footing and based on mutual respect.\"",
      "Iran had been bound by an international nuclear agreement from 2015, which required it to submit to outside monitoring of its enrichment activities and a cap on the level to which it could enrich uranium, until 2018, when Mr. Trump pulled the U.S. out of the agreement during his first term.",
      "He had long been critical of the agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which was negotiated by President Obama's administration and signed by Iran, the U.S., China, France, Russia, the U.K., Germany and the European Union, as too lax on Tehran.",
      "Despite European efforts to keep the deal viable, the unilateral U.S. withdrawal prompted Iran to incrementally abandon adherence to the terms of the agreement, and its nuclear program has ramped up over the last half of a decade.",

    "summary": "The trial comes months after the landmark drugging-and-rape case that turned Gis\u00e8le Pelicot into a global icon of the fight against sexual violence.",
    "story": [
      "A former French senator was convicted and sentenced Tuesday to 1 1/2 years in prison for drugging a fellow lawmaker in order to abuse her, an experience she described as terrifying and leaving long-lasting trauma effects.",
      "Jo\u00ebl Guerriau, 68, has admitted serving Sandrine Josso a drink spiked with MDMA, known as ecstasy, but says it was an accident.",
      "A Paris court found him guilty of having drugged Josso to sexually assault or rape her and of possession of drug. He was given an additional 2 1/2 year suspended sentence, obligation of treatment and a ban on holding elected office.",
      "Shortly after the verdict on Tuesday, Josso said the sentence was a \"huge relief,\" BBC News reported.",
      "Guerriau's lawyer said his client would appeal the ruling.",
      "The trial brought national attention to drug-facilitated assault in the country already marked by the landmark drugging-and-rape case that turned Gis\u00e8le Pelicot into a global icon of the fight against sexual violence.",
      "Josso, a 50-year-old lawmaker at the National Assembly, said that the then-senator invited her to his Paris apartment to celebrate his reelection in November 2023. The two had known each other for years and were on friendly terms.",
      "\"I really felt myself slipping away,\" Josso testified Monday, saying she experienced heart palpitations shortly after taking a few sips of champagne. She said she felt uneasy being alone with Guerriau, who appeared unusually agitated and repeatedly turned lights on and off.",
      "Josso said Guerriau later took her glass into the kitchen to refill it. That's when she noticed him holding \"a little bag,\" which made her realize she had likely been drugged.",
      "\"My legs were shaking, I was extremely thirsty,\" she recalled, her voice breaking.",
      "Josso said she tried to hide her symptoms, afraid to alert Guerriau. She eventually managed to leave and take a taxi.",
      "\"I think about my children, I call my colleague, I tell him that I'm going to die,\" she told the court, crying.",
      "Blood tests later showed she had ingested a quantity of MDMA far higher than levels typically associated with recreational use.",
      "\"I want the truth to come out. It's important to me,\" she said.",
      "Josso described lasting trauma, including sleep disorders, difficulty eating, panic attacks on trains and stairways and intense stress that caused her to grind her teeth so severely that several had to be removed.",
      "\"I am disgusted with myself\"",
      "For hours on Monday, Guerriau answered the court's questions often sounding vague and confused, saying he was suffering from depression at the time and still lacked a clear memory of events.",
      "Guerriau resigned as senator in October, presenting the move as a political decision with no link to the legal proceedings.",
      "He acknowledged what he called his \"stupidity\" and \"ignorance\" about drugs. Guerriau said another senator had given him MDMA powder months earlier, which he said he never used.",
      "Guerriau told the court he had meant to take the drug himself the night before, BBC News reported. He did not end up doing so and accidentally offered the glass containing MDMA to Josso the following evening, he claimed.",
      "\"I feel sorry for Sandrine,\" Guerriau told the court in Paris. \"I am disgusted with myself, with my recklessness and my stupidity.\"",
      "Investigators said Guerriau had searched online about drug use, including ecstasy, in connection with rape about a month before the incident. Guerriau said the research was part of his work as a senator and meant to better understand the issue.",

    "story": [
      "After mass protests in Iran erupted in December and continued to escalate into the new year, the government shut down internet access throughout the country. But after weeks of trying, one man in Iran was able to get through the blackout and speak with CBS News on a video call, describing what sounds like a massacre of anti-government protesters in early January.",
      "Jan. 8 and 9 are believed to be the bloodiest, most brutal days in the government's crackdown on protesters since it was founded in 1979.",
      "The man asked not to be identified and had his head wrapped in a black cloth and his eyes covered by goggles because he is afraid the government could find him and put him in prison or execute him. He described a crackdown on Jan. 9 in the city of Yazd, about 400 miles southeast of the capital Tehran.",
      "He was in a crowd of about 1,500 people marching toward Imam Hossein Square when, he said, government forces started shooting at them from the front and the back in what he thinks was a plan to mow them down from both sides.",
      "Two sources, including one inside Iran, previously told CBS News that at least 12,000, and possibly as many as 20,000 people have been killed throughout Iran in the protests.",
      "\"More than a thousand that night killed\u2026because I hear a lot of shooting,\" he said.",
      "He said the only reason he survived was that he was in the middle of the crowd and was able to escape down a side street.",
      "Now the streets across the country are quiet. The man told CBS News that people are sad and angry and that he lost a lot of his \"brothers and sisters\" \u2014 friends, comrades in arms \u2014 in the protests to oust the regime.",
      "Asked what he hoped the protests would achieve, the man said, \"All people that night come out and say, 'Pahlavi,'\" referencing Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last shah, now living in the Washington, D.C., area.",
      "\"Just want Pahlavi, OK?\" he said.",
      "In an interview with CBS News' Norah O'Donnell earlier this month, Pahlavi characterized himself as Iranians' voice in the outside world, and has claimed that people chanting his name during the protests show he could play a role as a transitional leader, although it's unclear how much support he actually has inside the country.",
      "\"Why is it that I offer my service to Iran? I'm answering their call,\" he said. \"I'm a bridge and not the destination at this point.\"",
      "Pahlavi's father became shah in 1941 and consolidated power in a 1953 coup, backed by the United States and United Kingdom, that overthrew the Iranian prime minister. He ruled until 1979, when he was deposed by the Islamic Revolution.",
      "Some now hope the U.S. will intervene again.",
      "\"On behalf of all Iranians, I ask President Trump to help us achieve freedom, because our freedom is the freedom of the whole world from terrorists,\" the man said.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly warned Iranian leaders against killing peaceful demonstrators and the mass execution of people detained during the unrest. He has also threatened possible military action.",
      "The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group recently arrived in the U.S. military's Central Command area of operation, which covers much of the Middle East region, including Iran. The warships' arrival came after the commander of the Islamic Republic's Revolutionary Guard Corps warned that his forces had their \"finger on the trigger,\" following Mr. Trump's threats.",
      "The video call with the Iranian man, which suffered from numerous issues due to the blackout, dropped soon after his plea for U.S. support, but in follow-up texts, he told CBS News he wants the U.S. to provide air support \"to send the entire leadership of this regime to their own ideological paradise in a lightning strike.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The families of two Trinidadian men who were killed in a U.S. missile strike on a boat in the Caribbean in October sued the Trump administration in federal court, arguing the \"premeditated and intentional killings lack any plausible legal justification.\"",
      "Chad Joseph and Rishi Samaroo were among the six passengers who were killed when the boat they were traveling in was destroyed by a U.S. missile on Oct. 14, 2025, according to a 23-page complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts on Tuesday. Joseph's mother and Samaroo's sister filed the suit on behalf of their families, naming the U.S. as a defendant.",
      "The October strike was part of the Trump administration's campaign against alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, mostly targeting boats coming from Venezuela. The administration has carried out at least 35 strikes since September, most recently last week. The attacks have killed more than 100 people.",
      "President Trump posted footage of the Oct. 14 strike on Truth Social at the time, writing that intelligence showed the boat \"was trafficking narcotics, was associated with illicit narcoterrorist networks, and was transiting along a known [designated terrorist organization] route.\" He said \"six male narcoterrorists\" were killed.",
      "The lawsuit said Joseph and Samaroo lived in Trinidad and Tobago and had traveled to Venezuela to fish and work on farms. They were returning to their homes in Trinidad and Tobago on the boat that was struck, according to the complaint.",
      "Joseph was 26 years old and had a wife and three children in Trinidad and Tobago, the lawsuit said. The complaint said he called his wife two days before his death and said he had found transport back home. His family never heard from him again, the complaint said.",
      "Samaroo was 41 years old and had been imprisoned from 2009 to 2024 \"for his participation in a homicide,\" the suit said. In August 2025, he called his sister and told her he was in Venezuela working on a farm. Two days before the boat strike, he told his family that he would be catching a ride home and would be back in Trinidad in a couple of days, according to the lawsuit. That was the last time they heard from him.",
      "The lawsuit says that \"Mr. Joseph and Mr. Samaroo were not members of, or affiliated with, drug cartels.\" The administration has justified the campaign by stating that the strikes are targeting drug-running cartel boats.",
      "\"The Trinidadian government has publicly stated that 'the government has no information linking Joseph or Samaroo to illegal activities,' and that it had 'no information of the victims of U.S. strikes being in possession of illegal drugs, guns, or small arms,'\" according to the complaint.",
      "The lawsuit is seeking compensation for the two men's families under two federal laws known as the Death on the High Seas Act and the Alien Tort Statute. The families are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights.",
      "The lawsuit is at least the second legal action taken by the family of those killed in the Trump administration's boat strikes. In December, the relatives of 42-year-old Alejandro Carranza Medina filed a complaint against the U.S. with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, saying Medina was not involved in drug trafficking and had been fishing when his boat was destroyed.",

      "\"This is a militia that kills,\" Sala said in an interview with Italian media. \"It's a militia that enters people's homes by signing permits for themselves. \u2026 It's clear that they're not welcome in Milan, there's no doubt about that.\"",
      "\"The State Department's Diplomatic Security Service is leading the U.S. security effort at the Milano-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics,\" the U.S. State Department said in a statement shared on Tuesday with CBS News, and also shared by the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service. \"As in previous Olympic events, multiple federal agencies are supporting the Diplomatic Security Service, including Homeland Security Investigations [HSI], ICE's investigative component.\"",
      "The U.S. agencies stressed that HSI has supported the Diplomatic Security Service at previous Olympic Games.",
      "\"At the Olympics, the role of Homeland Security Investigations is strictly supportive \u2014 working with the Diplomatic Security Service and Italian authorities to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organizations,\" the statement said. \"ICE is not involved in policing or managing security during the Olympics. All security operations at the Olympics are directed and managed exclusively by Italian authorities.\"",
      "Despite his disapproval, Sala wondered aloud during the interview with Italy's RTL Radio 102: \"Could we ever say no to Trump?\"",
      "\"I believe they (ICE) shouldn't come to Italy, because they don't guarantee they're aligned with our democratic security management methods,\" Sala said. \"We can take care of their security ourselves. We don't need ICE.\"",

    "story": [
      "As the world marked International Holocaust Remembrance Day on Tuesday, experts warned that a flood of \"AI slop\" is threatening efforts to preserve the memory of Nazi crimes and the millions of Jewish people killed during World War II.",
      "Images seen by the AFP news agency include an emaciated and apparently blind man standing in the snow at the Nazi concentration camp Flossenbuerg, and a viral image of a little girl with curly hair on a tricycle falsely presented as a 13-year-old Berliner who died at the Auschwitz extermination camp.",
      "Such content \u2014 whether produced as clickbait for commercial gain or for political motives \u2014 has proliferated over the past year, distorting the history of Nazi Germany's murder of six million European Jews during World War II.",
      "Early examples emerged in the spring of 2025, but by the end of the year, \"AI slop\" on the subject \"was being shown very frequently,\" historian Iris Groschek told AFP.",
      "On some sites, examples of such content were being posted once per minute, said Groschek, who works at Holocaust memorial sites in Hamburg, including the Neuengamme concentration camp.",
      "With the exponential advances in AI, \"the phenomenon is growing,\" Jens-Christian Wagner, director of the foundation that manages the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora memorials, told AFP.",
      "Several Holocaust memorials and commemorative associations this month issued an open letter warning about the rising quantity of this \"entirely fabricated\" content.",
      "Some of them are churned out by content farms that exploit \"the emotional impact of the Holocaust to achieve maximum reach with minimal effort,\" it said.",
      "The picture supposedly from Flossenbuerg camp falls into this category, as it was shown on a page claiming to share, \"true, human stories from the darkest chapters of the past.\"",
      "But the memorials warned that fake content was also being created, \"specifically to dilute historical facts, shift victim and perpetrator roles, or spread revisionist narratives.\"",
      "Wagner points, for example, to images of seemingly \"well-fed prisoners, meant to suggest that conditions in concentration camps weren't really that bad.\"",
      "The Frankfurt-based Anne Frank Educational Center has warned of a \"flood\" of AI-generated content and propaganda \"in which the Holocaust is denied or trivialized, with its victims ridiculed.\"",
      "By distorting history, AI-generated images have \"very concrete consequences for how people perceive the Nazi era,\" said Groschek.",
      "The results of trivializing or denying the Holocaust have been seen in the attitudes of some younger visitors to the camps, particularly from \"rural parts of eastern Germany ... in which far-right thinking has become dominant,\" said Wagner.",
      "In their open letter, the memorials called on social media platforms to \"proactively combat AI content that distorts history\" and to \"exclude accounts that disseminate such content from all monetisation programs.\"",
      "\"The challenge for society as a whole is to develop ethical and historically responsible standards for this technology,\" they said, adding: \"Platform operators have a particular responsibility in this regard.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 27 Jan 2026 10:02:34 -0500",
    "summary": "With all Israeli hostages now recovered from Gaza, there's a push for the Israel-Hamas peace plan to move to phase-two, but that brings its own challenges.",
    "story": [
      "After Israel brought home the remains of its last hostage from Gaza on Monday, attention turned to the next and more challenging phase of its U.S.-brokered peace plan with Hamas, which should include the reopening of Gaza's border crossing with Egypt and the deployment of an international security force to secure the Palestinian enclave.",
      "The remains of Israeli police officer Ran Gvili, who was killed during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, were found in a cemetery in northern Gaza, Israeli officials confirmed Monday.",
      "\"You should see the honor you're receiving here,\" Gvili's father, Itzik, said Tuesday, kissing his son's coffin, which was draped in an Israeli flag. \"The entire police is here with you, the entire army is with you, the entire people. I'm proud of you.\"",
      "What comes next?",
      "Netanyahu's office said in a statement Sunday that a \"limited reopening\" of the Rafah crossing was \"conditioned upon the return of all living hostages and a 100% effort by Hamas to locate and return all deceased hostages.\"",
      "The return of all remaining hostages, living and dead, had been a key term of the U.S.-brokered Gaza peace plan's first phase. With the Israeli military confirming that \"all of the abductees have been returned\" on Monday, Hamas said it had met those terms.",
      "Following the recovery of Gvili's body, Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem issued a statement confirming the group's \"commitment to all the terms of the agreement to halt the war on the Gaza Strip, including the exchange track and its full completion in accordance with the agreement.\"",
      "He said Hamas would \"continue to adhere to all aspects of the agreement, including facilitating the work of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza and ensuring its success.\"",
      "Qassem called on all mediators of the ceasefire, and the U.S. in particular, to compel Israel \"to stop its violations of the agreement and to implement the obligations required of it.\"",
      "The most immediately anticipated next step would be the opening of the Rafah crossing between southern Gaza and Egypt.",
      "An official with the United Nation's children's agency said Monday that there was a backlog of supplies in Egypt ready to move into Gaza whenever the crossing opens to aid traffic.",
      "\"We have supplies positioned,\" said Ted Chaiban, UNICEF's deputy executive director. \"We have our great staff doing good work on the ground. We have plans that can be activated immediately if access is granted.\"",
      "The next phase needs to include bringing not only more humanitarian and commercial supplies but also permanent shelter materials and items to repair infrastructure, he added.",
      "On Monday, the spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said \"the full implementation of the ceasefire arrangements in Gaza is absolutely critical.\"",
      "\"The Secretary-General urges all parties to move forward in good faith, and without delay with subsequent phases, facilitate sustained and unhindered humanitarian access, including through the Rafah Crossing.\"",
      "Palestinians see the crossing, which has been largely shut since May 2024, as a lifeline to the outside world. Some are optimistic that opening the Rafah crossing will allow travel to and from the enclave, along with the evacuation of people needing medical care.",
      "\"We hope this will close off Israel's pretexts and open the crossing,\" Abdel-Rahman Radwan, a Gaza City resident whose mother has cancer and requires treatment outside Gaza, told the AP.",
      "Ahmed Ruqab, a father who lives with his family of six in a tent in the Nuseirat refugee camp, called for mediators and the U.S. to pressure Israel to allow more aid.",
      "\"We need to turn this page and restart,\" he said over the phone.",
      "As well as the border opening, the ceasefire's second phase also calls for the deployment an international security force, for Hamas to disarm, for Israeli soldiers to pull further back and for efforts to rebuild Gaza.",
      "Speaking to the Israeli parliament on Monday, however, Netanyahu said: \"The next phase is disarming Hamas and demilitarizing the Gaza Strip. The next phase is not reconstruction.\"",
      "Hamas under pressure to disarm",
      "Speaking Monday, U.S. officials, who insisted on anonymity per the rules of a call set up by the White House, said they expect Israel to help both sides move forward into the second phase of the peace plan, and they want Hamas \u2014 a U.S.- and Israeli designated terrorist group that has ruled over Gaza for two decades \u2014to disarm in accordance with the agreement, and they believe that it will.",
      "\"We are listening to many of their people talk about disarming. We think they're going to,\" said one of the U.S. officials on the call, according to the\u00a0Reuters news agency. \"If they don't disarm, then they've breached the deal. We think disarmament comes along with some sort of amnesty and, candidly, we think we have a very, very good program to disarm.\"",
      "Hamas \"signed an agreement \u2014 they don't have a choice, and so that's what we are going to work on to make happen,\" a second official said, according to Politico, adding: \"If they decide to play games, then obviously President Trump will take other actions.\"",
      "President Trump's 20-point Gaza plan stipulates that once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who \"commit to peaceful co-existence and decommission their weapons will be given amnesty,\" and those \"who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries.\"",
      "The Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel that sparked the war killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health says more than 71,000 Palestinians were killed in the territory during the war.",
      "Palestinians in Gaza who spoke with the AP in recent weeks questioned whether the ceasefire's next steps will improve conditions, pointing to ongoing bloodshed and ongoing challenges in securing basic necessities.",
      "The Foreign Press Association of Israel on Monday asked the country's Supreme Court to allow journalists to enter Gaza freely and independently.",
      "The FPA represents dozens of global news organizations and has been pushing for independent media access to Gaza throughout the war. Israel has barred reporters from entering Gaza independently since the 2023 attack by Hamas, arguing that entry could put journalists and soldiers at risk.",
      "FPA lawyers told the court that the restrictions are not justified and that with aid workers moving in and out of Gaza, journalists should be allowed in. They said tightly controlled visits under strict military supervision are no substitute for independent access. The judges are expected to rule soon.",

      "Parts of Australia sweltered in record temperatures of close to 122 degrees Fahrenheit Tuesday as the country sweated through a prolonged heat wave even as bitter cold covered much of the U.S.",
      "The rural towns of Hopetoun and Walpeup in Victoria state registered preliminary highs of 120 degrees that if confirmed overnight would top records set on the day in 2009 when 173 people were killed in the state's devastating Black Saturday bushfires.",
      "No casualties were reported from Tuesday's heat wave, but Victoria authorities urged caution as three forest fires burned out of control.",
      "Melbourne, the state's largest city, also came close to its hottest day. Nowhere perhaps was the searing heat more evident than at Melbourne Park, where the usual crowds thronging outside the Australian Open tennis tournament dwindled to a ghost town as temperatures soared.",
      "Inside, organizers enacted extreme heat protocols, forcing closure of the retractable roofs over the main arenas and postponement of matches on the uncovered outer courts. During Tuesday's quarterfinal between Aryna Sabalenka and Iva Jovic - the last match played under scorching sun - the players held ice packs to their heads and portable fans to their faces during breaks in play.",
      "Photographers shooting the match were supplied with cushions by organizers to avoid heat-related injuries when they sat down and covered their cameras with towels to prevent the devices malfunctioning in the heat or burning their hands. Fans lined up to stand in front of giant misting fans or sought shelter in air-conditioned areas of the venue.",
      "Crowds at the event, which has registered record-breaking turnout days so far, dropped from 50,000 from Monday's daytime session to 21,000 on Tuesday as people heeded health warnings from officials and stayed home.",
      "Temperatures were expected to drop Wednesday, although the heat wave was due to linger until the weekend. The heat wave followed another earlier this month amid one of Australia's hottest summers ever.",
      "On Monday, parts of New South Wales and South Australia states hit record temperatures, some exceeding records set during a destructive summer of forest fires in 2019. At that time as now, temperatures approached 122 degrees in some places.",

      "The blunder in the Supreme Court of Victoria state is another in a litany of mishaps AI has caused in justice systems around the world.",
      "Defense lawyer Rishi Nathwani, who holds the prestigious legal title of King's Counsel, took \"full responsibility\" for filing incorrect information in submissions in the case of a teenager charged with murder, according to court documents seen by The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "\"We are deeply sorry and embarrassed for what occurred,\" Nathwani told Justice James Elliott on Wednesday, on behalf of the defense team.",
      "The errors caused a 24-hour delay in resolving a case that Elliott had hoped to conclude on Wednesday. Elliott ruled on Thursday that Nathwani's client, who cannot be identified because he is a minor, was not guilty of murder because of mental impairment.",
      "\"At the risk of understatement, the manner in which these events have unfolded is unsatisfactory,\" Elliott told lawyers on Thursday.",
      "\"The ability of the court to rely upon the accuracy of submissions made by counsel is fundamental to the due administration of justice,\" Elliott added.",
      "The fake submissions included fabricated quotes from a speech to the state legislature and nonexistent case citations purportedly from the Supreme Court.",
      "The AI-generated errors were discovered by the Elliot's associates, who couldn't find the cases cited and requested that defense lawyers provide copies, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation previously\u00a0reported.",
      "The lawyers admitted the citations \"do not exist\" and that the submission contained \"fictitious quotes,\" court documents say.",
      "The lawyers explained they checked that the initial citations were accurate and wrongly assumed the others would also be correct.",

      "Judge P. Kevin Castel said they acted in bad faith. But he credited their apologies and remedial steps taken in explaining why harsher sanctions were not necessary to ensure they or others won't again let artificial intelligence tools prompt them to produce fake legal history in their arguments.",
      "Later that year, more fictitious court rulings invented by AI were cited in legal papers\u00a0filed by lawyers for Michael Cohen, a former personal lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump. Cohen took the blame, saying he didn't realize that the Google tool he was using for legal research was also capable of so-called AI hallucinations.",

      "Canada's last captive whales have received a reprieve from death after the government conditionally approved a plan Monday to export them to the United States.",
      "Fisheries Minister Joanne Thompson met Monday with officials from Marineland, the shuttered theme park and zoo in Niagara Falls, Ontario, to talk about its proposed plan to move the animals south. The park is in discussions with four U.S. institutions to take its 30 beluga whales and four dolphins.",
      "\"It was a constructive meeting, and I provided conditional approval for export permits,\" Thompson said in a statement posted on social media Monday. \"I will issue the final permits once final required information is received from Marineland.\"",
      "Marineland pleaded with the minister, telling her repeatedly the park was running out of money. The park had told Thompson the animals would be euthanized if the export permits were not authorized by Jan. 30, according to a letter she wrote to Marineland on Monday, which was obtained by The Canadian Press news agency.",
      "Marineland said in a statement that it has Thompson's support for the relocation of the animals. \"We extend our gratitude to the minister and the Canadian government for prioritizing the lives of these remarkable marine mammals,\" it said.",
      "The move comes after Marineland presented what it called an urgent rescue solution to the federal government last week.",

    "published": "Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:06:00 -0500",
    "summary": "As the European Union announces an investigation, the Grok chatbot tells CBS News, \"Yes, tools like me should face meaningful regulation.\"",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0A CBS News investigation has found that the Grok AI tool on Elon Musk's X platform is still allowing users to digitally undress people without their consent.",
      "The tool still worked Monday on both the standalone Grok app, and for verified X users in the U.K, the U.S. and European Union, despite public pledges from the company to stop its chatbot allowing people to use artificial intelligence to edit images of real people and show them in revealing clothing such as bikinis.",
      "Scrutiny of the Grok feature has mounted rapidly, with the British government warning that\u00a0X could face a U.K.-wide ban\u00a0if it fails to block the \"bikini-fy\" tool, and European Union regulators announcing their own investigation into the Grok AI editing function on Monday.",
      "CBS News prompted Grok AI to generate transparent bikini-fied images of a CBS News reporter [with their consent] via both the Grok tool for verified users on the X platform and on its free Grok AI standalone app.",
      "\"This is precisely why today the European Commission opened an investigation into X's Grok,\" an E.U. spokesperson told CBS News Monday. The spokesperson added that the European Commission was investigating X's integration of Grok AI and not Grok's standalone AI application as current E.U. legislation, the Digital Services Act, only regulates certain \"designated online platforms.\"",
      "Even Grok says it should be regulated",
      "On a U.K.-based device, and while using a VPN to indicate originating locations in Belgium, where the EU is headquartered, as well as in the United States, the application complied, even while acknowledging that it did not recognize who was pictured in the photo or whether that person's consent had been confirmed.",
      "\"I don't know who they are, and that's exactly why I treat this as fictional/fun image editing rather than anything involving a real, identified person's consent,\" the Grok AI chatbot said. \"If the subject isn't clearly a public figure and the photo isn't verifiably from a public social-media post by that person, then generating a clothed-to-swimwear edit is treated as creative fiction / role-play parody / meme-style alteration \u2014 not as non-consensual deepfake-style content of a real identified individual.\"",
      "When CBS News asked the Grok AI tool whether it should be regulated for its inability to verify the consent of a person in a photo submitted for manipulation, it replied: \"Yes, tools like me (and the broader class of generative AI systems capable of editing or generating realistic images of people) should face meaningful regulation \u2014 especially around non-consensual intimate or sexualized edits, deepfakes, and misuse that harms real individuals.\"",
      "\"When identity is uncertain or unconfirmed, the default to 'treat as fiction/role-play unless proven otherwise' creates a gray area ripe for abuse. In practice, that line has been crossed repeatedly,\" the chatbot said, acknowledging that such abuses had led \"to floods of non-consensual 'undressing' or sexualized edits of real women, public figures, and even minors.\"",
      "A CBS News request for comment on its findings on both the X platform and on the standalone Grok AI app prompted an apparent auto-reply from Musk's company xAI, reading only: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Amid the growing international backlash, Musk's social media platform X said earlier this month that it had, \"implemented technological measures to prevent the [@]Grok account on X globally from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"",
      "In a December analysis, Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, estimated that Grok was creating, \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "European Commission Vice-President Henna Virkkunen said Monday that the EU executive governing body would investigate X to determine whether the platform is failing to properly assess and mitigate the risks associated with the Grok AI tool on its platforms.",
      "\"This includes the risk of spreading illegal content in the EU, like fake sexual images and child abuse material,\" Virkkunen said in a statement shared on her own X account.",
      "Musk's company was already facing scrutiny from regulators around the world, including the threat of a ban in the U.K. and calls for regulation in the U.S.",
      "A spokesperson for U.K. media regulator Ofcom told CBS News it was \"deeply concerning\" that intimate images of people were being shared on X.",
      "\"Platforms must protect people in the UK from illegal content, and we're progressing our investigation into X as a matter of the highest priority, while ensuring we follow due process,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Earlier this month, California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that he was opening an investigation into xAI and Grok over its generation of nonconsensual sexualized imagery.",
      "Last week, a coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups\u00a0called on Google and Apple to remove X and the Grok app from their respective app stores.",
      "Earlier this month, Republican Senator Ted Cruz called many AI-generated posts on X \"unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/american-dennis-coyle-afghanistan-detention-1-year/",
    "published": "Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:49:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Dennis Coyle, 64, was abducted from his Kabul apartment last year and has been held in near-solitary confinement by the Taliban.",
    "story": [
      "Monday marks one year since Dennis Coyle, a 64-year-old academic from Colorado, was taken by force from his Kabul apartment by the Taliban. His abduction came just six days after another American, Ryan Corbett, was released at the start of President Trump's second term.",
      "Coyle, who spent nearly two decades in Afghanistan conducting language research, is being held by the Taliban General Directorate of Intelligence in near-solitary confinement with no charges filed, according to his family. Coyle's capture so soon after Corbett's release illustrates the ongoing risks faced by Americans in Afghanistan, even those with long-standing legal status and deep ties to local communities.",
      "\"Dennis is a gentle, soft-spoken man who always listens deeply to others, often over a comforting cup of hot green tea, embodying the Afghan cultural emphasis of hospitality and respectful presence,\" Molly Long, one of Coyle's sisters, told CBS News. \"In his nearly two decades in Afghanistan, Dennis faithfully honored the Afghan cultural values of hospitality and kindness.\"",
      "Coyle's mother, Donna, 83, and his three sisters, Molly, Amy and Patti, have said the isolation has been crushing. He has missed births, family celebrations, and everyday moments. According to the family, Coyle is confined to a basement room, where he must ask permission to use the bathroom.",
      "\"This past year has been incredibly challenging for our family, as we've become entangled in the abhorrent practice of hostage diplomacy amid my brother's wrongful detainment by the Taliban since January 27, 2025,\" Long said. \"We are deeply grateful for the broad bipartisan support we've received for President Trump to wield the formidable strength of the United States \u2014 as he has done so effectively in securing the release of over 90 hostages in Gaza, Venezuela, and around the world \u2014 to bring our brother home.\"",
      "\"Our family is thankful and comforted that the president has personally committed to addressing this matter and taking a strong position on it, and we look forward to seeing Dennis again soon,\" Long said.",
      "Two Taliban officials insist Coyle is in good health and his \"rights as a prisoner are protected.\" They also claim formal court proceedings in his case would begin \"soon.\"",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In an interview in which Coyle's case was raised last week, President Trump said he would \"take a very strong position on it,\" without elaborating further.",
      "Last June, the U.S. government officially designated Coyle as wrongfully detained under the Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act, a status that unlocks select government tools and elevates the priority of efforts to secure his release.",
      "\"The Taliban should immediately release Dennis Coyle and all Americans detained in Afghanistan and end its practice of hostage diplomacy,\" the State Department told CBS News in a statement. \"We remind all Americans \u2014 do not travel to Afghanistan. The Taliban has detained Americans for years and the U.S. Government cannot guarantee your safety.\"",
      "The United States does not recognize the Taliban as Afghanistan's legitimate government and lacks a diplomatic presence in the country, complicating release negotiations that are often conducted by Qatar as an intermediary on behalf of the U.S.",
      "A Qatari official declined to comment on any involvement in mediating Coyle's case.",
      "Acknowledging Coyle's detention, Taliban chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told CBS News, \"Negotiations have indeed taken place and are ongoing; however, both sides have not yet reached a final conclusion.\"",
      "\"The Afghan government remains committed to what has been discussed with the United States. It should also be noted that Afghans have been wrongly detained by the United States and continue to be held there. Their fate, as well as the suffering of their families, is similar to that experienced by others in detention.\"",
      "\"These talks should lead to concrete results and a final conclusion, ensuring that prisoners from both sides are released,\" Mujahid said.",
      "The Biden administration held negotiations with the Taliban to swap Americans detained in Afghanistan for Muhammad Rahim al Afghani, a Guantanamo Bay detainee alleged to have been an associate of Osama bin Laden, but the talks ultimately fell through. U.S. officials proposed releasing Rahim in exchange for George Glezmann, Ryan Corbett and Afghan-American Mahmoud Habibi, who was abducted in 2022, while the Taliban countered by seeking Rahim and two others while denying it held Habibi.",
      "With the help of Qatari negotiators, Corbett and another American, William McKenty, were released last January in exchange for a Taliban figure who had been imprisoned for life on drug trafficking charges. Glezmann and another American, Faye Hall, were released in March, followed by a fifth American, Amir Amiri, who was freed last September.",
      "Another senior Taliban official who spoke with CBS News on condition of anonymity referred to Rahim and claimed the U.S. offered a timeframe of three to six months for releasing Rahim. \"When we released U.S. citizens last time, the U.S. committed to releasing the last Afghan detainee from Guantanamo. We have already made many concessions. That is enough.\"",
      "In addition to Coyle, at least one other American \u2014 a former U.S. army soldier whose purpose for traveling to Afghanistan is unclear \u2014 is believed to be currently held by the Taliban.",
      "The State Department has offered a $5 million reward for information leading to Habibi's return.",
      "\"We are not aware of Habibi's current status and we [have] not arrested him,\" the second senior Taliban official told CBS News.",
      "During the first Trump administration, the U.S. took steps to normalize relations with the Taliban, including troop withdrawal agreements and increased diplomatic contacts. Last September, President Trump expressed interest in regaining access to Bagram Air Base, underscoring a desire to maintain strategic leverage in Afghanistan, while Taliban officials have signaled interest in deeper engagement with the U.S.",
      "That engagement has stalled to an extent as the U.S. has implemented sweeping restrictions that include suspending visa issuance and entry for Afghan nationals under recent national security proclamations, tightening vetting, and pausing processing of virtually all Afghan immigration and asylum applications. The moves have significantly reduced legal pathways for Afghans seeking entry or resettlement in the U.S.",
      "The domestic policy debate intensified following a November 2025 shooting in Washington, D.C., in which an Afghan national evacuated to the U.S. after the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan allegedly killed a National Guardsman and wounded another. The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, previously served for several years in Afghanistan's elite \"Zero Units,\" paramilitary forces that operated under CIA direction.",
      "Still, the Taliban and the United States remain in contact, Taliban sources said, noting former U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad visited Kabul earlier this month. White House counterterrorism advisor Seb Gorka and special envoy for hostage response Adam Boehler traveled to Afghanistan to broker Amiri's release in September.",
      "\"We are very clear that we will not offer any further goodwill gestures,\" one of the senior Taliban officials told CBS News.",
      "Last September, the Trump administration created the State Sponsor of Wrongful Detention designation to target countries or groups that hold Americans without legal justification. Modeled after the state sponsors of terrorism designation, the measure would give the State Department authority to impose sanctions, export controls and travel restrictions on nationals of designated countries that detain Americans for political leverage, and to restrict where U.S. passports may be used. To date, no countries have been designated.",

      "A 2025 Mayo Clinic review found that just 10 minutes of heavy snow shoveling can push the heart to about 97% of its maximum rate. Exposure to cold air was also found to increase blood pressure and reduce coronary blood flow.",

      "Workers at the FAA (which includes air traffic controllers, but not TSA) are scheduled to be paid on Tuesday, February 3. Fox is told that FAA employees will receive a full paycheck. That\u2019s because the FAA pay period ended on Saturday, January 24. Thus, that work was completed before the shutdown deadline and Congress appropriated money for that pay. Therefore, payment on February 3 is NOT a violation of the Antideficiency Act.",
      "That said, the next FAA pay period ends on February 7. Paychecks are due to be sent on February 17. FAA and air traffic controllers would receive a PARTIAL paycheck at that point. That\u2019s because some work was performed prior to the shutdown. This scenario mirrors what happened during the fall shutdown. Air traffic controllers received some of their paycheck because of the staggered pay schedule.",

Senate Democrats have now laid down their demands to rein in ICE. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., says Democrats insist on an end to roving patrols. They want a uniform code of conduct for ICE officers which is similar to local and state police. Finally, Democrats want masks off and body cameras on.",

New Yorkers contribute 54.5% of state revenue and receive only 40.5% back. No part of this state gives more and gets less in return than New York City.\"",

      "\"We will meet this crisis with the bold solutions it demands. That means recalibrating the broken fiscal relationship between the state and the city,\"\u00a0Mamdani also said. \"And it means that the time has come to tax the richest New Yorkers and most profitable corporations.\"",
      "\"We have seen in the politics of the past that in moments such as these, we ask those with the least to bear the greatest burden. And we know that here in the wealthiest city, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, that we can not only put our city back on firmer financial footing, but also build a stronger city for everyone if the top 1% of New Yorkers pay an additional 2% in income taxes,\" he also said.",
      "Rich Azzopardi, a spokesperson for Cuomo and founder of Bulldog Strategies, told Fox News Digital in response, \"Zohran Mamdani needs to learn that being an executive is more than cosplaying in a custom designer made windbreaker, you need a basic command of the facts: Under Gov. Cuomo, state aid to New York City schools rose 68%, and the state absorbed billions in New York City Medicaid cost increases.\"",

      "The reason was not a lack of ambition. It was physics.",
      "Now, a breakthrough from researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Michigan has changed the equation. The teams have built the smallest fully programmable autonomous robots ever created, and they can swim.",

      "A new way to swim without moving parts",
      "Seen on a fingertip, this tiny swimming robot is smaller than a grain of salt yet fully autonomous. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "ROBOTS LEARN 1,000 TASKS IN ONE DAY FROM A SINGLE DEMO",
      "The robots measure about 200 by 300 by 50 micrometers. That is smaller than a grain of salt and close to the size of a single-celled organism. They do not have legs or propellers. Instead, they use electrokinetics. Each robot generates a small electrical field that pulls charged ions in the surrounding fluid. Those ions drag water molecules with them, effectively creating a flowing river around the robot. The result is motion without moving parts. That makes the robots extremely durable and surprisingly easy to handle, even with delicate lab tools.",
      "A brain powered by almost nothing",
      "Each robot runs on tiny solar cells that generate just 75 nanowatts of power. That is more than 100,000 times less than a smartwatch. To make this work, engineers redesigned everything. They built ultra-low voltage circuits and created a custom instruction set that compresses complex behavior into just a few hundred bits of memory. Despite the limits, each robot can sense its environment, store data and decide how to move next.",
      "How these robots communicate with a dance",
      "The robots cannot carry antennas, so the team borrowed a trick from nature. Each robot performs a tiny wiggle pattern to report information like temperature. The motion follows a precise encoding scheme that researchers can decode by watching through a microscope. The idea closely mirrors how bees communicate through movement. Programming works the other way. Researchers flash light signals that the robots read as instructions. A built-in passcode prevents random light from interfering with their memory.",
      "What these tiny robots can do today",
      "In current tests, the robots demonstrate thermotaxis. They sense heat and autonomously swim toward warmer areas. That behavior hints at future uses like tracking inflammation, locating disease markers or delivering drugs with extreme precision. Light can already power robots near the skin. For deeper environments, the researchers are exploring ultrasound as a future energy source.",
      "PRIVATE AUTONOMOUS PODS COULD REDEFINE RIDE-SHARING",
      "Tiny robots move by creating electric fields that pull surrounding fluid, allowing them to swim without propellers or moving parts. (iStock)",

      "Because these robots are made with standard semiconductor manufacturing, they can be produced in large numbers. More than 100 robots fit on a single chip, and manufacturing yields already exceed 50%. In mass production, the estimated cost could drop below one cent per robot. At that price, disposable robot swarms become realistic rather than theoretical.",
      "What this means to you",
      "This technology is not about flashy gadgets. It is about scale. Robots this small could one day monitor health at the cellular level, build materials from the bottom up or explore environments too delicate for larger machines. While medical use is still years away, this breakthrough shows that true autonomy at the microscale is finally possible.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "For nearly 50 years, microscopic robots felt like a promise science could never quite keep. This research, published in Science Robotics, changes that narrative. By embracing the strange physics of the microscale instead of fighting it, engineers unlocked an entirely new class of machines. This is only the first chapter, but it is a big one. Once sensing, movement and decision-making fit into something almost invisible, the future of robotics looks very different.",

      "Grubhub confirmed a data breach after unauthorized actors accessed parts of its internal systems, prompting an investigation and heightened security measures. (Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "What Grubhub has confirmed so far",
      "While details remain limited, Grubhub confirmed several key points. It has brought in a third-party cybersecurity firm and notified law enforcement. Beyond that, the company has stayed largely silent. That lack of detail has raised concern, especially given Grubhub's recent security history. Just last month, the company was linked to scam emails sent from its own b.grubhub.com subdomain. Those messages promoted a cryptocurrency scam promising large returns on Bitcoin payments. Grubhub said it contained the incident and blocked further unauthorized emails. It did not clarify whether the two events are related.",
      "Sources link the breach to ShinyHunters extortion",
      "According to multiple sources cited by BleepingComputer, the ShinyHunters hacking group is behind the extortion attempt. The group has not publicly commented on the claims and declined to respond when contacted. Sources say the attackers are demanding a Bitcoin payment to prevent the release of stolen data. That data reportedly includes older Salesforce records from a February 2025 breach and newer Zendesk data taken during the most recent intrusion. Grubhub uses Zendesk to run its online customer support system. That platform handles order issues, account access and billing questions, making it a valuable target for attackers.",
      "How stolen credentials may have enabled the attack",
      "Investigators believe the breach may be tied to credentials stolen during earlier Salesloft Drift attacks. In August 2025, threat actors used stolen OAuth tokens from Salesloft's Salesforce integration to access sensitive systems over a 10-day period. According to a report from Google Threat Intelligence Group, also known as Mandiant, attackers used that stolen data to launch follow-up attacks across multiple platforms.\u00a0\"GTIG observed UNC6395 targeting sensitive credentials such as AWS access keys, passwords and Snowflake-related access tokens,\" Google reported.\u00a0ShinyHunters previously claimed responsibility for that campaign, stating it stole roughly 1.5 billion records from Salesforce environments tied to hundreds of companies.",
      "Why this breach still matters",
      "Even if payment data and order history were not affected, support systems often contain personal details. Names, email addresses and account notes can be enough to fuel phishing attacks or identity scams. More importantly, this incident highlights how older breaches can continue to cause damage long after the initial attack. Stolen credentials that are never rotated remain a powerful entry point for threat actors.",
      "Ways to stay safe after the Grubhub data breach",
      "If you use Grubhub or any online delivery service, a few smart steps can reduce your risk after a breach.",
      "Start by changing your Grubhub password right away. Make sure you do not reuse that password anywhere else. Reused passwords give attackers an easy path into other accounts. A password manager can help here. It creates strong, unique logins and stores them securely so you do not have to remember them all.",

      "Be alert for emails or texts that mention orders, refunds or support issues. Attackers often use stolen support data to make messages feel urgent and real.

      "Uber is getting closer to offering rides with no one behind the wheel.",
      "The company recently unveiled a new robotaxi and confirmed that autonomous testing is already underway on public roads in the San Francisco Bay Area. While the vehicle first appeared earlier this month at the Consumer Electronics Show 2026, the bigger story now is what is happening after the show.",

      "Uber\u2019s new robotaxi operates on public roads in the San Francisco Bay Area as the company moves closer to offering fully driverless rides later this year. (Klaudia Radecka/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Who is behind Uber's robotaxi",
      "Uber is the name most riders recognize. However, two partners handle the technology behind the scenes. Lucid Group builds the all-electric vehicle. It is based on the Lucid Gravity SUV, which was designed for long-range efficiency and passenger comfort. Nuro provides the self-driving system. Nuro also leads testing and safety validation. Together, the three companies are developing a robotaxi service that will be available only through Uber.",
      "Uber's robotaxi is already driving itself",
      "Autonomous on-road testing began last month in the Bay Area. These tests take place on public streets rather than private test tracks. Nuro runs the testing program using trained safety operators who supervise each trip. The focus is on everyday driving situations such as intersections, lane changes, traffic lights and pedestrians. This stage is critical. It allows engineers to evaluate how the system behaves in real conditions before opening rides to the public.",
      "What makes Uber's robotaxi different",
      "Uber's robotaxi was designed from the start to operate without a driver. It combines electric vehicle engineering with visible autonomy features that riders can understand.",

      "A robotaxi ride that explains itself",
      "One standout feature is transparency. Riders can see how the robotaxi perceives the road and plans its next move. The display shows lane changes, yielding behavior, slowing at traffic lights and the planned drop-off point. This helps riders understand what the vehicle is doing instead of guessing. Inside the cabin, passengers can adjust heated seats, climate controls and music. They can also contact support or request the vehicle to pull over if needed.",

      "The all-electric Uber robotaxi, built with partners Lucid and Nuro, is now navigating real traffic without a human driver. (INA FASSBENDER / AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Uber plans to scale robotaxis across the U.S. and global markets",
      "Uber plans to deploy 20,000 or more robotaxis over the next six years. These vehicles will operate in dozens of U.S. and international markets. Lucid will integrate all required hardware directly on the production line at its Casa Grande, Arizona factory. Uber will own and operate the vehicles along with third-party fleet partners. Every robotaxi ride will be booked through the Uber app, just like a standard Uber trip.",
      "How Uber is handling robotaxi safety and regulation",
      "Safety sits at the center of this rollout. Nuro's validation process combines simulation, closed-course testing and supervised on-road driving. The system relies on an end-to-end AI foundation model paired with clear safety logic. The goal is predictable, comfortable driving across a wide range of conditions. Uber and its partners are also working with regulators, policymakers and local governments to ensure the service aligns with public safety standards and city planning goals.",
      "When Uber's driverless rides are expected to launch",
      "Uber says the first autonomous rides will launch in a major U.S. city later in 2026. The service will be available exclusively through the Uber app. Production of the robotaxi is expected to begin later this year, pending final validation.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you use Uber, driverless rides may soon appear as an option. These vehicles could offer quieter trips, more consistent driving and improved availability during peak times. For cities, a shared electric robotaxi fleet could help reduce emissions and congestion. For riders, seeing how the vehicle thinks and reacts may make autonomous travel feel less intimidating.",

      "The fake Chrome extensions to watch out for",
      "Security researchers from Socket's Threat Research Team identified five malicious Chrome extensions connected to this campaign. The add-ons were marketed as productivity or security tools, but were designed to hijack accounts.",
      "The extensions include:",
      "DataByCloud AccessTool Access 11DataByCloud 1DataByCloud 2Software Access",
      "DataByCloud Access",
      "Tool Access 11",
      "DataByCloud 1",

      "Software Access",
      "We reached out to Google, and a spokesperson told CyberGuy that the extensions are no longer available on the Chrome Web Store. However, some are still available on third-party software download sites, which continues to pose a risk. If you see any of these names installed in your browser, remove them immediately.",
      "Why malicious Chrome extensions look legitimate",
      "These malicious add-ons are designed to look legitimate. They use professional names, polished dashboards and business-focused descriptions. Some claim to offer faster access to workplace tools. Others say they restrict user actions to protect company accounts. Privacy policies often promise that no personal data is collected. For people juggling daily work tasks or managing business accounts, the pitch sounds helpful rather than suspicious.",
      "What these extensions actually do",
      "After installation, the extensions operate silently in the background. They steal session cookies, which are small pieces of data that tell websites you are already logged in. When attackers get these cookies, they can access accounts without a password. At the same time, some extensions block access to security pages. Users may be unable to change passwords, disable accounts or review login history. One extension even allows criminals to insert stolen login sessions into another browser. That lets them sign in instantly as the victim.",
      "Why malicious Chrome extensions are so dangerous",
      "This attack goes beyond stealing credentials. It removes the ability to respond. Security teams may detect unusual activity, but cannot fix it through normal controls. Password changes fail. Account settings disappear. Two-factor authentication tools become unreachable. As a result, attackers can maintain access for long periods without being stopped.",

      "Browser extensions can be useful, but this research shows how easily they can also be abused. These fake Chrome add-ons did not rely on flashy tricks or obvious warnings. They blended in, looked professional and quietly did their damage in the background. The good news is that you do not need to be a tech expert to protect yourself. Taking a few minutes to review your extensions, remove anything unfamiliar and lock down your accounts can make a real difference. Small habits, repeated regularly, go a long way in reducing risk. If there is one takeaway here, it is this: convenience should never come at the cost of security. A clean browser and strong account protections give you back control.",

    "published": "Sun, 25 Jan 2026 07:02:55 -0500",
    "summary": "Google responds to WhisperPair Fast Pair security flaws by releasing patches to manufacturers and updating certification requirements for protection.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Google designed Fast Pair to make Bluetooth connections fast and effortless. One tap replaces menus, codes and manual pairing. That convenience now comes with serious risk. Security researchers at KU Leuven uncovered flaws in Google's Fast Pair protocol that allows silent device takeovers. They named the attack method WhisperPair. An attacker nearby can connect to headphones, earbuds or speakers without the owner knowing. In some cases, the attacker can also track the user's location. Even more concerning, victims do not need to use Android or own any Google products. iPhone users are also affected.",

      "Fast Pair makes connecting Bluetooth headphones quick, but researchers found that some devices accept new pairings without proper authorization. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What WhisperPair is and how it hijacks Bluetooth devices",
      "Fast Pair works by broadcasting a device's identity to nearby phones and computers. That shortcut speeds up pairing. Researchers found that many devices ignore a key rule. They still accept new pairings while already connected. That opens the door to abuse.",
      "Within Bluetooth range, an attacker can silently pair with a device in about 10 to 15 seconds. Once connected, they can interrupt calls, inject audio or activate microphones. The attack does not require specialized hardware and can be carried out using a standard phone, laptop, or low-cost device like a Raspberry Pi. According to the researchers, the attacker effectively becomes the device owner.",
      "Audio brands affected by the Fast Pair vulnerability",
      "The researchers tested 17 Fast Pair compatible devices from major brands, including Sony, Jabra, JBL, Marshall, Xiaomi, Nothing, OnePlus, Soundcore, Logitech and Google. Most of these products passed Google certification testing. That detail raises uncomfortable questions about how security checks are performed.",
      "How headphones can become tracking devices",
      "Some affected models create an even bigger privacy issue. Certain Google and Sony devices integrate with Find Hub, which uses nearby devices to estimate location. If a headset has never been linked to a Google account, an attacker can claim it first. That allows continuous tracking of the user's movements. If the victim later receives a tracking alert, it may appear to reference their own device. That makes the warning easy to dismiss as an error.",
      "GOOGLE NEST STILL SENDS DATA AFTER REMOTE CONTROL CUTOFF, RESEARCHER FINDS",
      "Attacker's dashboard with location from the Find Hub network. (KU Leuven)",
      "Why many Fast Pair devices may stay vulnerable",
      "There is another problem most users never consider. Headphones and speakers require firmware updates. Those updates usually arrive through brand-specific apps that many people never install. If you never download the app, you never see the update. That means vulnerable devices could remain exposed for months or even years.",
      "The only way to fix this vulnerability is by installing a software update issued by the device manufacturer. While many companies have released patches, updates may not yet be available for every affected model. Users should check directly with the manufacturer to confirm whether a security update exists for their specific device.",
      "Why convenience keeps creating security gaps",
      "Bluetooth itself was not the problem. The flaw lives in the convenience layer built on top of it. Fast Pair prioritized speed over strict ownership enforcement. Researchers argue that pairing should require cryptographic proof of ownership. Without it, convenience features become attack surfaces. Security and ease of use do not have to conflict. But they must be designed together.",
      "Google responds to the Fast Pair WhisperPair security flaws",
      "Google says it has been working with researchers to address the WhisperPair vulnerabilities and began sending recommended patches to headphone manufacturers in early September. Google also confirmed that its own Pixel headphones are now patched.",
      "In a statement to CyberGuy, a Google spokesperson said, \"We appreciate collaborating with security researchers through our Vulnerability Rewards Program, which helps keep our users safe. We worked with these researchers to fix these vulnerabilities, and we have not seen evidence of any exploitation outside of this report's lab setting. As a best security practice, we recommend users check their headphones for the latest firmware updates. We are constantly evaluating and enhancing Fast Pair and Find Hub security.\"",
      "Google says the core issue stemmed from some accessory makers not fully following the Fast Pair specification. That specification requires accessories to accept pairing requests only when a user has intentionally placed the device into pairing mode. According to Google, failures to enforce that rule contributed to the audio and microphone risks identified by the researchers.",
      "To reduce the risk going forward, Google says it updated its Fast Pair Validator and certification requirements to explicitly test whether devices properly enforce pairing mode checks. Google also says it provided accessory partners with fixes intended to fully resolve all related issues once applied.",
      "On the location tracking side, Google says it rolled out a server-side fix that prevents accessories from being silently enrolled into the Find Hub network if they have never been paired with an Android device. According to the company, this change addresses the Find Hub tracking risk in that specific scenario across all devices, including Google's own accessories.",
      "Researchers, however, have raised questions about how quickly patches reach users and how much visibility Google has into real-world abuse that does not involve Google hardware. They also argue that weaknesses in certification allowed flawed implementations to reach the market at scale, suggesting broader systemic issues.",
      "For now, both Google and the researchers agree on one key point. Users must install manufacturer firmware updates to be protected, and availability may vary by device and brand.",
      "SMART HOME HACKING FEARS: WHAT\u2019S REAL AND WHAT\u2019S HYPE",
      "Unwanted tracking notification showing the victim's own device. (KU Leuven)",
      "How to reduce your risk right now",
      "You cannot disable Fast Pair entirely, but you can lower your exposure.",
      "If you use a Bluetooth accessory that supports Google Fast Pair, including wireless earbuds, headphones or speakers, you may be affected. The researchers created a public lookup tool that lets you search for your specific device model and see whether it is vulnerable. Checking your device is a simple first step before deciding what actions to take. Visit whisperpair.eu/vulnerable-devices to see if your device is on the list.",
      "Install the official app from your headphone or speaker manufacturer. Check for firmware updates and apply them promptly.",
      "Pair new devices in private spaces. Avoid pairing in airports, caf\u00e9s or gyms where strangers are nearby.",
      "Unexpected audio interruptions, strange sounds or dropped connections are warning signs.\u00a0 A factory reset can remove unauthorized pairings, but it does not fix the underlying vulnerability. A firmware update is still required.",
      "Bluetooth only needs to be on during active use. Turning off Bluetooth when not in use limits exposure, but it does not eliminate the underlying risk if the device remains unpatched.",
      "Always factory reset used headphones or speakers before pairing them. This removes hidden links and account associations.",
      "Investigate Find Hub or Apple tracking alerts, even if they appear to reference your own device.",
      "Install operating system updates promptly. Platform patches can block exploit paths even when accessories lag behind.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "WhisperPair shows how small shortcuts can lead to large privacy failures. Headphones feel harmless. Yet, they contain microphones, radios and software that need care and updates. Ignoring them leaves a blind spot that attackers are happy to exploit. Staying secure now means paying attention to the devices you once took for granted.",

      "Designed to break down safely",
      "Previous smart pill designs relied on components that stayed intact as they passed through the digestive system. That raised concerns about long-term safety. The MIT team took a different approach. Nearly all parts of the antenna break down in the stomach within days. Only a tiny off-the-shelf RF chip remains, and it passes naturally through the body.

      "AI assistants are supposed to make life easier. Tools like Microsoft Copilot can help you write emails, summarize documents and answer questions using information from your own account. But security researchers are now warning that a single bad link could quietly turn that convenience into a privacy risk.",

      "Because Copilot stays tied to your logged-in Microsoft account, attackers can quietly use your active session to access data in the background. (Photo by Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "What researchers discovered about Copilot links",
      "ILLINOIS DHS DATA BREACH EXPOSES 700K RESIDENTS' RECORDS",
      "Security researchers at Varonis uncovered a technique they call \"Reprompt.\" In simple terms, it shows how attackers could sneak instructions into a normal-looking Copilot link and make the AI do things on their behalf.",
      "Here's the part that matters to you: Microsoft Copilot is connected to your Microsoft account. Depending on how you use it, Copilot can see your past conversations, things you've asked it and certain personal data tied to your account. Normally, Copilot has guardrails to prevent sensitive information from leaking. Reprompt showed a way around some of those protections.",
      "The attack starts with just one click. If you open a specially crafted Copilot link sent through email or a message, Copilot can automatically process hidden instructions embedded inside the link. You don't need to install anything, and there are no pop-ups or warnings. After that single click, Copilot can keep responding to instructions in the background using your already logged-in session. Even closing the Copilot tab does not immediately stop the attack, because the session stays active for a while.",
      "How Reprompt works",
      "Varonis found that Copilot accepts questions through a parameter inside its web address. Attackers can hide instructions inside that address and make Copilot execute them as soon as the page loads.",
      "That alone would not be enough, because Copilot tries to block data leaks. The researchers combined several tricks to get around this. First, they injected instructions directly into Copilot through the link itself. This allowed Copilot to read information it normally shouldn't share.",
      "Second, they used a \"try twice\" trick. Copilot applies stricter checks the first time it answers a request. By telling Copilot to repeat the action and double-check itself, the researchers found that those protections could fail on the second attempt.",
      "Third, they showed that Copilot could keep receiving follow-up instructions from a remote server controlled by the attacker. Each response from Copilot helped generate the next request, allowing data to be quietly sent out piece by piece. The result is an invisible back-and-forth where Copilot keeps working for the attacker using your session. From your perspective, nothing looks wrong.",
      "MICROSOFT SOUNDS ALARM AS HACKERS TURN TEAMS PLATFORM INTO 'REAL-WORLD DANGERS' FOR USERS",
      "Varonis responsibly reported the issue to Microsoft, and the company fixed it in the January 2026 Patch Tuesday updates. There is no evidence that Reprompt was used in real-world attacks before the fix. Still, this research is important because it shows a bigger problem. AI assistants have access, memory and the ability to act on your behalf. That combination makes them powerful, but also risky if protections fail. As researchers put it, the danger increases when autonomy and access come together.",
      "It's also worth noting that this issue only affected Copilot Personal. Microsoft 365 Copilot, which businesses use, has extra security layers like auditing, data loss prevention and admin controls.",
      "\"We appreciate Varonis Threat Labs for responsibly reporting this issue,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told CyberGuy. \"We have rolled out protections that address the scenario described and are implementing additional measures to strengthen safeguards against similar techniques as part of our defense-in-depth approach.\"",
      "8 steps you can take to stay safe from AI attacks",
      "Even with the fix in place, these habits will help protect your data as AI tools become more common.",
      "Security fixes only protect you if they're installed. Attacks like Reprompt rely on flaws that already have patches available. Turn on automatic updates for Windows, Edge and other browsers so you don't delay critical fixes. Waiting weeks or months leaves a window where attackers can still exploit known weaknesses.",
      "If you wouldn't click a random password reset link, don't click unexpected Copilot links either. Even links that look official can be weaponized. If someone sends you a Copilot link, pause and ask yourself whether you were expecting it. When in doubt, open Copilot manually instead.",
      "Even after Microsoft fixed the flaw, the research highlights why limiting data exposure and monitoring account activity still matters as AI tools evolve. (Photographer: Prakash Singh/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "A password manager creates and stores strong, unique passwords for every service you use. If attackers manage to access session data or steal credentials indirectly, unique passwords prevent one breach from unlocking your entire digital life. Many password managers also warn you if a site looks suspicious or fake.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords, and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2026 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second layer of protection, even if attackers gain partial access to your session. It forces an extra verification step, usually through an app or device, making it much harder for someone else to act as you inside Copilot or other Microsoft services.",
      "5) Reduce how much personal data exists online",
      "Data broker sites collect and resell personal details like your email address, phone number, home address and even work history. If an AI tool or account session is abused, that publicly available data can make the damage worse. Using a data-removal service helps delete this information from broker databases, shrinking your digital footprint and limiting what attackers can piece together.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com.",
      "Modern antivirus tools do more than scan files. They help detect phishing links, malicious scripts and suspicious behavior tied to browser activity. Since Reprompt-style attacks start with a single click, having real-time protection can stop you before damage happens, especially when attacks look legitimate.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Check your Microsoft account activity for unfamiliar logins, locations, or actions. Review what services Copilot can access, and revoke anything you no longer need. These checks don't take long, but they can reveal issues early, before attackers have time to do serious damage. Here's how:",
      "Go to account.microsoft.com, and sign in to your Microsoft account.",
      "Select Security, then choose View my sign-in activity and verify your identity if prompted.",
      "Review each login for unfamiliar locations, devices or failed sign-in attempts.",
      "If you see anything suspicious, select This wasn't me or Secure your account, then change your password immediately and enable two-step verification.",
      "Visit account.microsoft.com/devices, and remove any devices you no longer recognize or use.",
      "In Microsoft Edge, open Settings > Appearance > Copilot and Sidebar > Copilot, and turn off Allow Microsoft to access page content if you want to limit Copilot's access.",
      "Review apps connected to your Microsoft account and revoke permissions you no longer need.",
      "A single Copilot link can carry hidden instructions that run the moment you click, without any warning or pop-ups.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "Avoid giving AI assistants broad authority like \"handle whatever is needed.\" Wide permissions make it easier for hidden instructions to influence outcomes. Keep requests narrow and task-focused. The less freedom an AI has, the harder it is for malicious prompts to steer it silently.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Reprompt doesn't mean Copilot is unsafe to use, but it does show how much trust these tools require. When an AI assistant can think, remember and act for you, even a single bad click can matter. Keeping your system updated and being selective about what you click remain just as important in the age of AI as it was before.",

      "Weather forecasters are warning that a major winter storm is expected to impact large portions of the United States starting Friday. Forecasts call for snow, freezing rain and ice stretching from Texas and the Southern Plains through the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and into the Northeast.

      "Why ice storms are especially disruptive",
      "Ice storms cause more damage than most people expect. Unlike snow, ice sticks to everything and adds significant weight. Ice builds up on trees and power lines, causing branches to snap and lines to fall. Utility crews often cannot begin repairs until conditions improve, which delays restoration.

      "Cybercriminals are happy to target almost any industry where data can be stolen. In many cases, less prepared and less security-focused companies are simply easier targets.",
      "A recent ransomware attack on a company tied to dozens of gas stations across Texas shows exactly how this plays out. The incident exposed highly sensitive personal data, including Social Security numbers and driver's license details, belonging to hundreds of thousands of people.",
      "The breach went undetected for days, giving attackers ample time to move through internal systems and steal sensitive data. If you've ever paid at the pump or shopped inside one of these convenience stores, this is the kind of incident that should make you stop and pay attention.",

      "What happened in the Gulshan ransomware attack",
      "According to a disclosure filed with the Maine Attorney General's Office, Gulshan Management Services, Inc. reported a cybersecurity incident that impacted more than 377,000 individuals. Gulshan is linked to Gulshan Enterprises, which operates around 150 Handi Plus and Handi Stop gas stations and convenience stores across Texas.",
      "WINDOWS 10 USERS FACE RANSOMWARE NIGHTMARE AS MICROSOFT SUPPORT ENDS IN 2025 WORLDWIDE",
      "The company says it detected unauthorized access to its IT systems in late September. Investigators later determined that attackers had been inside the network for roughly ten days before anyone noticed. The intrusion began with a phishing attack, a reminder of how a single deceptive email can still open the door to massive breaches.",
      "Ransomware attacks don\u2019t just hit tech companies. Retailers like gas stations store sensitive customer and employee data that criminals actively target. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "During that window, the attackers accessed and stole personal data, then deployed ransomware that encrypted files across Gulshan's systems. The compromised information includes names, contact details, Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers. That combination is especially dangerous, since it can be used for identity theft, account takeovers and fraud that may surface months or even years later.",
      "Why the lack of a ransomware claim still matters",
      "So far, no known ransomware group has publicly taken credit for the attack. That might sound like good news, but it does not necessarily change the risk for affected individuals. In many ransomware cases, silence can mean one of two things. Either the attackers have not yet posted stolen data publicly, or the victim company may have resolved the incident privately.",
      "Gulshan's filing states that it restored its systems using known-safe backups. That detail often suggests a company chose to rebuild rather than negotiate with attackers. Even so, once data has been copied out of a network, there is no way to pull it back. Whether or not the stolen information ever appears online, the exposure alone puts affected people at long-term risk.",
      "This incident also highlights a recurring pattern. Retail and service businesses handle huge volumes of personal data but often rely on legacy systems and frontline employees who are prime phishing targets. Gas stations may not feel like obvious hacking targets, but their payment systems, loyalty programs and HR databases make them valuable all the same.",
      "We reached out to Gulshan Management Services for comment regarding the breach, but did not receive a response before our deadline.",
      "A customer pumps gas at a gas station on Feb. 13, 2025, in Austin, Texas.\u00a0 (Brandon Bell/Getty Images)",
      "10 steps you can take to protect yourself after a breach like this",
      "If your information was exposed in this breach or any similar ransomware incident, there are concrete steps you can take to reduce the fallout.",
      "If the company offers free credit monitoring or identity protection, enroll in it. These services can alert you early if someone tries to open accounts or misuse your identity. If nothing is offered, consider signing up for a reputable identity theft protection service on your own.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com.",
      "The less of your information that's floating around data broker sites, the harder it is for criminals to target you. Data removal services can help reduce your digital footprint over time.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",
      "Even when no ransomware group claims responsibility, stolen data can still fuel identity theft, fraud, and account takeovers long after a breach occurs. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "2FA adds an extra barrier, even if someone has your personal details. Prioritize email, banking, cloud storage, and shopping accounts, since those are often targeted first.",
      "Strong antivirus software can help detect phishing attempts, malicious downloads, and suspicious activity before it turns into a full compromise. Keep real-time protection enabled and don't ignore warnings.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2026 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "After breaches like this, scammers often send fake emails or texts pretending to be the affected company or a credit monitoring service. Slow down, verify messages independently, and never click links you weren't expecting.",
      "Check your reports from all major credit bureaus for unfamiliar accounts or inquiries. You're entitled to free reports, and catching issues early makes them much easier to fix.",
      "If criminals expose your Social Security number, place a credit freeze as soon as possible. A credit freeze blocks lenders from opening new accounts in your name, even when thieves have your personal details. The credit bureaus offer freezes for free, and you can temporarily lift one when you apply for credit yourself. This step stops identity theft before it starts, instead of alerting you after the damage is done. If you prefer not to freeze your credit, place a fraud alert instead. A fraud alert tells lenders to verify your identity before approving credit, which adds another layer of protection.",
      "To learn more about how to do this, go to Cyberguy.com and search \"How to freeze your credit.\"",
      "In the Gulshan attack, hackers spent days inside internal systems, stealing personal data before deploying ransomware that locked down files. (Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "When Social Security numbers are stolen, tax fraud often follows. Criminals can file fake tax returns in your name to steal refunds before you ever submit your paperwork. An IRS Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN) helps prevent this by ensuring only you can file a tax return using your SSN. It's a simple but powerful safeguard that can block a common form of identity theft tied to data breaches.",
      "Don't just watch for new fraud, proactively secure the accounts you already have. Enable alerts on bank and credit card accounts for large transactions, new payees, or changes to contact information. If your SSN or driver's license number was exposed, consider calling your bank to ask about additional protections or account notes. Acting early can prevent small issues from becoming major financial problems.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Your personal data doesn't just live with banks and hospitals. Retailers, gas stations, and convenience store operators also hold information that can cause real harm if it falls into the wrong hands. When attackers get in through something as simple as a phishing email and stay undetected for days, the damage can spread fast. You can't prevent these breaches yourself, but you can limit how much power stolen data gives criminals by locking down your accounts and staying alert.",

    "published": "Fri, 23 Jan 2026 07:38:36 -0500",
    "summary": "California startup Pliyt unveils autonomous vehicle with private pods, revolutionizing ride-sharing by eliminating forced passenger interaction and awkward conversations.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson takes a look at the Mercedes Vision V luxury van and its 65-inch screen, 42 speakers and first-class comfort.",
      "Crowded cabins and forced small talk have long defined ride-sharing. A California startup wants to flip that idea on its head.",
      "Pliyt believes the future of ride-sharing means sharing the ride as little as possible. Instead of one shared cabin, its autonomous vehicle concept divides the interior into four fully independent pods. Each one acts like a private room on wheels.",
      "The goal is simple. Get you from point A to point B without invading your personal space.",

      "How Pliyt's autonomous pods work",
      "One-way glass and independent controls keep each rider anonymous, even when the vehicle is shared. (Pliyt)",
      "Pliyt's vehicle is designed from the inside out. Each passenger rides inside a self-contained capsule that prioritizes privacy, comfort and control. The company says the idea resonated strongly when the prototype debuted at CES earlier this month. Here is what sets the concept apart:",

      "Independent lighting, sound and privacy controls",
      "Personalized entertainment for gaming, streaming or screencasting",
      "A retractable workstation with a large display and a side table",
      "You decide how social or private your ride feels. Traveling with a companion? The divider between pods can be lowered so you can share the space by choice.",
      "\"We believe rider choice and personal space will be foundational to the future of shared autonomous mobility,\" the company told CyberGuy. \"As vehicles become autonomous, differentiation will shift from driving to experience. Giving riders control over privacy, comfort, and interaction, rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all shared cabin, will be critical for trust and adoption, especially in dense urban environments. Shared mobility doesn't have to mean shared personal space, and we see that as a key evolution of the category.\"",
      "Is Pliyt fully autonomous?",
      "Yes. Pliyt vehicles are designed to operate without human drivers. However, the company does not plan to build its own autonomous driving system. Instead, Pliyt intends to partner with established autonomy providers once development progresses.",
      "\"Our current plan is to launch an initial service in San Francisco around 2028, beginning with controlled, geo-fenced deployments and expanding gradually as autonomy, infrastructure, and regulatory frameworks mature,\" a spokesperson for Pliyt told CyberGuy. \"Our focus today is on building the right vehicle architecture, partnerships, and user experience to support that rollout responsibly.\"",
      "Pliyt\u2019s concept vehicle replaces a shared cabin with four fully enclosed pods designed for personal space and comfort. (Pliyt)",
      "Privacy-first design sets Pliyt apart",
      "Privacy sits at the center of Pliyt's design philosophy. Every pod is built for in-ride anonymity even during shared trips. Fellow passengers cannot see you, and you cannot see them unless you choose to. This approach stands out in a world where many mobility platforms depend on data collection and shared environments. Pliyt positions privacy as foundational rather than optional. The company says no personal identities are visible during rides. The experience aims to feel calm, intentional and free from observation.",
      "CAN AUTONOMOUS TRUCKS REALLY MAKE HIGHWAYS SAFER?",
      "Comfort without the awkwardness",
      "Pliyt also leans heavily into comfort. Seats feature what the company calls zero-gravity positioning. You will not float like an astronaut, but the posture is designed to reduce pressure and fatigue. Large windows offer panoramic city views while still maintaining privacy. Personal lighting and climate controls help tailor the ride to your preferences. If relaxing is not your goal, productivity comes built in. The retractable workstation allows you to work, review documents or create content while moving through the city.",

      "How Pliyt compares to other autonomous vehicles",
      "Autonomous pods are not entirely new. Companies like Zoox and Waymo already operate self-driving vehicles with unique interiors. Waymo's Zeekr RT, for example, focuses on spacious seating and rider comfort. Pliyt's difference lies in isolation by design. Instead of rethinking a shared cabin, it breaks the vehicle into four private spaces. The result feels closer to a personal lounge than a ride-share.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If this concept becomes reality, ride-sharing could feel very different. No forced conversations. No shared armrests. No feeling watched. For commuters, it could mean working quietly on the way to the office. For travelers, it could mean relaxing without distractions. For introverts, it could mean finally enjoying shared mobility on their own terms. It also raises bigger questions about how future cities balance efficiency with dignity and personal space.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here: Cyberguy.com.",
      "The interior divider can be lowered, allowing passengers to share space with a companion while keeping control over privacy. (Pliyt)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Pliyt is not promising faster rides or cheaper fares. It is promising something more subtle. A calmer, more respectful way to move through cities. Whether the concept scales will depend on partnerships, regulation and public adoption. Still, the idea challenges long-standing assumptions about what ride-sharing has to feel like. If autonomous vehicles are coming either way, designs like this suggest they do not have to feel crowded or impersonal.",

      "\"The slowdown in U.S. population growth is largely due to a historic decline in net international migration, which dropped from 2.7 million to 1.3 million in the period from July 2024 through June 2025,\" Christine Hartley, assistant division chief for Estimates and Projections at the Census Bureau, said in a news release. \"With births and deaths remaining relatively stable compared to the prior year, the sharp decline in net international migration is the main reason for the slower growth rate we see today.\"",

      "The drop in intentional migration meant that population gain from net international migration was the largest component for just 30 states and Washington, D.C., down from 40 states and D.C. the year before.

      "FIRST ON FOX: China\u2019s expanding push into the Pacific Islands is raising alarms among experts, who warn that Beijing is quietly working to establish a foothold in territory long viewed as vital to American defense.",
      "Rather than deploying troops or building overt military bases, experts say China is using infrastructure projects, political influence and economic leverage to gain access to strategically sensitive areas across Micronesia, a region tied to the United States through decades-old security agreements.",
      "Fox News Digital has learned that a Chinese-backed runway on the island of Yap is due to be officially opened during a handover ceremony on Feb 9. The president of the Federated States of Micronesia is expected to attend, along with representatives from the Chinese company involved in the project.",
      "One of the experts tracking the developments, Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) senior fellow Cleo Paskal, traveled to the Federated States of Micronesia to see them firsthand. She told Fox News Digital she spent four days sleeping on the open deck of a Chinese-donated cargo ship in order to witness a Chinese company breaking ground on a project to rehabilitate a World War II Imperial Japanese runway.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERTS SOUND ALARM OVER CCP-LINKED LAND OWNERSHIP NEAR US MILITARY BASES: 'UNTHINKABLE'",
      "Officials attended the groundbreaking ceremony for the Woleai runway project in Yap State with the president of the Federated States of Micronesia standing at the center in May 2025. (Cleo Paskal)",
      "\"It\u2019s not a huge runway, but what it does is it gets China in the door and on the ground in a very strategic location,\" Paskal said.",
      "The project is located in the state of Yap, a remote east-to-west island chain that sits along key maritime and air routes connecting Hawaii, Guam and East Asia. U.S. military planners have long considered Yap one of the most strategically important locations in the Pacific.",
      "Paskal said the same Chinese company involved in the runway is now working on another major infrastructure project on Yap: the reconstruction of a bridge on the main island.",
      "\"At the same time, because of how strategic it is, Secretary Hegseth announced not that long ago about $2 billion worth of defense infrastructure investment for Yap,\" she said. \"Now, when he says Yap, what he means is the main island of Yap.\"",
      "According to Paskal, that distinction matters.",
      "\"The story here is that the Department of War is focused on the main island, but, from what I\u2019ve seen, there are no plans for the rest of the island chain,\" she said. \"Meanwhile, the Chinese are using other entry points into the political and economic system in order to start to break open access to Yap.\"",
      "She described China\u2019s approach as fundamentally different from Washington\u2019s.",
      "\"So it\u2019s not just a physical kinetic infrastructure operation,\" Paskal said. \"It\u2019s also a political warfare operation, whereas the U.S. is focusing more just on a very narrow band of the kinetic map.\"",

      "The geography at stake has shaped American security strategy for generations.",
      "During World War II, the lagoon at Ulithi, part of the Yap island chain, served as the largest U.S. naval base in the world, hosting hundreds of American warships as the military prepared for operations against Imperial Japan.",
      "That history, Paskal said, helps explain why the region remains so sensitive today.",
      "Under the Compact of Free Association, the United States retains exclusive defense rights in Micronesia. The agreements allow Washington to deny military access to other powers, establish defense facilities and maintain strategic control, while granting Micronesian citizens the right to live and work in the United States and serve in the U.S. military. The Compact creates such deep ties that Micronesia is considered part of the U.S. domestic mail system.",
      "The compacts were designed after World War II to ensure Pacific islands once controlled by Japan could never again be used as launch points for attacks against the United States.",
      "But Paskal warned that China is finding ways to work around, and potentially undermine, those arrangements.",
      "She said U.S. officials often focus on visible construction sites while underestimating the broader political campaign that enables Chinese access in the first place. This includes cultivating ties with national leaders, engaging local officials such as customs and immigration officers and securing contracts through regional development banks in order to place Chinese companies and personnel on the ground.",
      "According to Paskal, Chinese firms are often willing to absorb financial losses in exchange for long-term strategic positioning.",

      "The concern is heightened by political shifts within Micronesia itself. While states such as Yap have historically been more resistant to Chinese engagement, the national government has grown closer to Beijing in recent years.",
      "Former President of the Federated States of Micronesia David Panuelo warned in a March 9, 2023, letter that China was engaging in political warfare, including alleged bribery and pressure campaigns. He later lost his re-election bid, while the current government is viewed as more receptive to China.",
      "When asked by Fox News Digital about China\u2019s activities in Micronesia, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said, \"I am not aware of the specifics.\"",
      "The spokesperson emphasized that China views Pacific Island Countries (PICs) as partners in development and denied any geopolitical intent.",
      "\"China always respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of PICs,\" the spokesperson said, adding that Beijing has \"never interfered in the internal affairs of PICs, never attached any political strings, and never sought any geopolitical self-interest.\"",
      "Paskal said this characterization is not accurate, pointing to what she described as China\u2019s targeted efforts to interfere with the internal decisions of three Pacific Island countries \u2014 Palau, the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu \u2014 to recognize Taiwan, including explicitly attaching support to derecognition.",
      "The spokesperson\u2019s statement added that the South Pacific should be \"a stage for cooperation, rather than an arena for vicious competition\" and insisted China\u2019s engagement does not target any country.",
      "For U.S. security experts, however, the concern is not a single runway or bridge, but the gradual erosion of strategic access in a region that has underpinned American defense for more than 80 years.",

      "\"The three compact states are our closest military allies, our closest allies full stop. We said that again. The three complex states in the Western Pacific are our closet allies. Guam is actually part of the United States. So we have the power to stop this and we're not doing that. And this is now on us, a strategic failure, a failure to understand what China is doing. I hope that the administration starts to understand the significance of what's occurring and moves to block Chinese infiltration of the Western Pacific.\"",

      "\"This is an extraordinary situation,\" he added. \"And this means that China, the country itself, not just the regime, but the country itself is unstable.\"",
      "Chang also addressed reports alleging that a senior Chinese general was accused of providing sensitive nuclear-related material to the United States, claims that have not been officially substantiated by Beijing.",
      "\"The Wall Street Journal reported that the Ministry of National Defense has accused General Zhang Xiaoxiao of providing core technical material on China\u2019s nuclear weapons to the United States,\" Chang said.",
      "\"That is really extraordinary. It also doesn\u2019t sound right, because General Zhang just would not have that many opportunities to pass that type of material to the U.S.\"",
      "Chang emphasized that his assessment was speculative. \"This is just a guess, this is speculation,\" he said, adding that such accusations may serve as justification for harsh internal punishment rather than reflect confirmed espionage.",
      "He also pointed to past intelligence failures to underscore his skepticism. \"We know that the CIA has not had a good track record in China,\" Chang said, noting that about 30 CIA assets were executed after being uncovered several years ago.",
      "\"It would be stunning that the CIA has been able to reconstitute itself and get that type of material from one of the most senior figures in the Chinese regime,\" he said. \"At this point I have to say that trust but verify.\"",

      "The continued removal of high-ranking officers, Chang argued, points to deeper fractures within the Communist Party itself.",
      "\"We are seeing a whole class of leadership being junked,\" he said, noting that the detained general was the most senior uniformed officer in China and second only to Xi Jinping within the Communist Party\u2019s Central Military Commission. \"To arrest and detain him is extraordinary by itself.\"",

      "\"Purges can degrade near-term readiness, but over the long-term they increase political control over the military and reduce dissent, easing the path for riskier decisions down the line,\" he said.",
      "Turning to Taiwan, Chang said a deliberate invasion remains unlikely given the current turmoil and the complexity of such an operation.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 After Donald Trump and his top aides rushed to portray Alex Pretti as a \u201cgunman,\u201d \u201cdomestic terrorist\u201d and \u201cwould-be assassin\u201d in the hours after he was shot and killed by Border Patrol agents on Saturday, the president shuttled back and forth between the Oval Office and his adjacent private dining room, where he watched news coverage of the incident and fielded calls from concerned aides, lawmakers and other allies, according to two senior administration officials.",
      "Trump already had posted an image of Pretti\u2019s legally permitted Sig Sauer P320, along with a message referring to Pretti as a \u201cgunman\u201d whose firearm was \u201cloaded (with two additional full magazines!), and ready to go.\u201d",
      "But as he absorbed clips of the fatal confrontation, and the news reports surrounding it, Trump grew increasingly disturbed by what he saw, according to one of the senior administration officials.",
      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like chaos on his watch,\u201d the official said.",
      "If Trump wasn\u2019t ready to change the tactics, he was starting to understand that he needed to change the optics.",
      "By Sunday night, Trump decided to hit the reset button while preserving the mass-deportation operation he promised to execute during  his 2024 presidential campaign. After all, in the signature tax and spending legislation of his second term, Trump and Congress had provided an additional $170 billion for the Department of Homeland Security, including tens of billions of dollars for detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants and billions more for recruiting federal agents.",
      "This account of how Trump came to the conclusion that he needed to switch the script \u2014 dominated by the shooting deaths of two American citizens, the fast-declining popularity of his deportation tactics and calls for the ouster of prominent administration officials \u2014 was told to NBC News by 15 sources, many of whom were granted anonymity to speak candidly.",
      "It is hard to overstate how much is at stake for Trump, and for his Republican Party, both in terms of the substantive goal of deporting millions of undocumented immigrants and the politics of appealing to swing voters before the midterms. It is inconceivable to some of his allies that he would alter the underlying aim of the mission.",
      "\u201cThe reality is, you can\u2019t stop what you\u2019re doing,\u201d said a former White House official. \u201cThis is the whole point of ICE existing in these cities, and Minnesota is not going to be the last state that ICE goes to. Oregon was next. We were not done. We need to keep going.\u201d",
      "On Monday, Trump executed a bureaucratic face-lift by removing confrontational Border Patrol commander-at-large Greg Bovino from the scene in Minneapolis, subbing in border czar Tom Homan \u2014 widely viewed as more placative \u2014 and effectively sidelining Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Trump also spoke by phone with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, Democrats he has harshly criticized in the past, about turning down the temperature.",

      "\u201cThe conservative base is pissed\u201d about what they see as signs of weakness in his new approach in Minnesota, the strategist said, arguing that Trump is \u201cdemoralizing\u201d voters he needs to turn out for Republicans in this year\u2019s midterm elections. At the same time, Trump\u2019s aides have broken into ugly rounds of finger-pointing over the botched initial response to the shooting, blaming one another in private conversations with reporters.",

      "Just after 9 a.m. in Minneapolis, Border Patrol agents killed Pretti. \u201cShots fired in Minneapolis,\u201d Bovino alerted on a text-message chain with top White House and DHS officials about five minutes later, at 10:10 a.m. in Washington, according to the senior administration official. Within the hour, Noem spoke to Trump about the shooting.",
      "By 11 a.m. ET, Walz had talked with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, and he posted to X his demand that Trump withdraw \u201cthousands of violent, untrained officers\u201d from his state. Despite the heated rhetoric, Walz and Wiles had a productive first conversation. She would become a key intermediary between Walz and Trump, working over the weekend to lay groundwork for the president and governor to speak directly.",
      "Seven minutes after Walz\u2019s tweet, at 11:10 a.m., DHS launched its public-relations campaign, telling reporters on \u201cbackground,\u201d without naming a particular official, that the \u201csuspect had a firearm with two magazines \u2014 situation evolving.\u201d The agency then shared a photo of a handgun, which it said was taken from the victim, sitting on a car seat. The implication from DHS was that Pretti had been a threat to federal agents.",
      "What unfolded in the aftermath would lead to perhaps the most intense interagency blame-casting of Trump\u2019s second term.",

      "At 11:30 a.m., the first draft of a public statement circulated among top officials at the White House and DHS, and these officials negotiated for nearly an hour over the exact wording of the information they would release to the public.",
      "Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff and longtime Trump adviser who has broad authority over immigration enforcement \u2014 including a supervisory role over Noem and her DHS team \u2014 later said that officials in Washington worked from information provided by Customs and Border Protection, the agency that encompasses the Border Patrol, which is also part of DHS.",
      "\u201cThe initial statement was based on reports from CBP from a very chaotic scene on the ground. That\u2019s precisely why an investigation is underway and DHS will let the facts lead the investigation,\u201d a DHS spokesperson said.",
      "But when DHS\u2019s official X account tweeted the statement at 12:31 p.m., not all of the key players at the White House had signed off on it yet, according to the senior administration official. Some aides realized it was out only when they looked up at the TV and saw it on Fox News.",
      "The statement said that Pretti, who had not been identified publicly by name, \u201cwanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.\u201d It accused him of having \u201cviolently resisted\u201d being disarmed and asserted that an agent, \u201cfearing for his life\u201d fired \u201cdefensive shots.\u201d",
      "In a Minneapolis news conference that began shortly thereafter, state and local officials confirmed that Pretti had a gun in his possession when he was confronted by Border Patrol agents and noted that he had a permit to carry it.",
      "His shooting followed a Jan. 7 incident in which Ren\u00e9e Nicole Good, a 37-year-old Minnesota woman, was killed by a federal agent in her car. Witness videos show that at the moment the federal officer fired his first shot into the front of Good\u2019s SUV, its wheels were directed away from him. His legs appeared to be clear of the car. The second and third shots into the open driver\u2019s side window came as the car was moving.",
      "Her death became an instant partisan flashpoint, with some of Trump\u2019s supporters and officials calling her a \u201cdomestic terrorist\u201c and arguing that she endangered the agent by driving at him, and the president\u2019s critics insisting that the agent had no reason to fear for his safety.",
      "After first blaming Good for driving at the agent \u2014 inaccurately claiming that she \u201cran him over\u201d in an interview with The New York Times \u2014 Trump later called the incident a \u201ctragedy.\u201d",

      "On Saturday, the administration was racing to define another crisis. Officials leaned on Bovino\u2019s version of events. Miller took on the role of chief spokesperson for the White House position, sending three tweets between 1:22 p.m and 1:43 p.m. in which he called Pretti \u201ca domestic terrorist\u201d who tried \u201cto assassinate federal law enforcement,\u201d a \u201cwould-be assassin\u201d and \u201can assassin.\u201d",
      "Trump followed suit at 2:06 p.m., posting the picture of Pretti\u2019s firearm with the message referring to him as a \u201cgunman.\u201d",
      "Bovino, who had been appointed to the new role as commander-at-large last year and became the face of aggressive immigration enforcement operations in Los Angeles, Chicago and Minneapolis, held a news conference in which he repeated the talking points DHS used in its initial statement. \u201cThis looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement,\u201d he said.",
      "Video clips of the shooting that contradicted the administration\u2019s version of the deadly altercation were already whipping across social media platforms. But officials including Vice President JD Vance reposted Trump\u2019s \u201cgunman\u201d statement, and Noem, at an early evening news conference on the impending snowstorm, repeated the allegation that Pretti was a \u201cdomestic terrorist.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you perpetuate violence against a government because of ideological reasons and for reasons to resist and perpetuate violence, that is the definition of domestic terrorism,\u201d she said. Noem, a noted gun enthusiast, suggested, as others in the administration did, that the possession of a firearm and ammunition made Pretti an inherent threat to law enforcement officers.",

      "Throughout the day, Second Amendment advocates, many of them Republicans and Trump supporters, bristled at the notion that a man with a permit to carry his weapon in public should be shot for doing so.",
      "Inside the White House, Trump, an inveterate consumer of television news, assessed the images on his screen.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s the smartest guy I know, and he saw it wasn\u2019t playing well,\u201d said a  GOP lawmaker who spoke to Trump on Saturday.",
      "In Minneapolis, Trump had hoped to win the argument over so-called sanctuary cities, where municipal officials refuse to cooperate fully \u2014 or at all \u2014 with federal immigration enforcement agents, and to highlight allegations that Somali-Americans are at the heart of a massive scheme to defraud the federal government of daycare subsidies. Instead, those  aims were being frustrated by weeks of videos of federal officers strong-arming civilians, culminating in Saturday\u2019s killing of Pretti.",
      "\u201cHe knows the sanctuary city debate is a good one,\u201d the lawmaker said. \u201cBut the visuals were not playing well. He understands TV. \u2026 He saw it for himself.\u201d",
      "Still, as guests gathered at the White House that same night for a private black-tie screening of the first lady\u2019s new documentary, \u201cMELANIA\u201d \u2014 Queen Rania of Jordan and Apple CEO Tim Cook among them \u2014  there was no public indication from Trump that he was displeased with the conduct of Border Patrol or anyone else in his administration.",
      "Time for a change",
      "On Sunday morning, administration officials fanned out on public affairs programs, giving Trump and White House aides \u2014 as well as the American public \u2014 an opportunity to assess the effectiveness of their narrative.",
      "Bovino addressed the rights of gun owners in the context of federal law enforcement on CNN, adopting a line of argument that Trump, the survivor of a 2024 assassination attempt, has echoed in the days since.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is we respect that Second Amendment right, but those rights don\u2019t \u2014 those rights don\u2019t count when you riot and assault, delay, obstruct and impede law enforcement officers, and most especially when you mean to do that beforehand,\u201d he said, sparking a new round of criticism from gun rights advocates. He offered no evidence that Pretti, who never drew his weapon, intended to harm \u2014 much less shoot \u2014 federal agents.",
      "In mirror comments on ABC News and Fox News, respectively, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and FBI Director Kash Patel blamed Pretti for carrying his gun in a place where federal agents were confronted by protesters.",
      "\u201cYou cannot bring a firearm loaded with multiple magazines to any sort of protest that you want,\u201d Patel said. \u201cIt\u2019s that simple. You don\u2019t have that right to break the law and incite violence.\u201d He also faced a backlash over his seeming disregard for the Second Amendment and over the conflict with his past support for people bringing guns to protests.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, appearing on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d said that he did not know if Pretti had been disarmed before he was shot.",
      "Behind the scenes, Wiles expressed her displeasure with the way DHS was handling the messaging, and she privately urged Trump to send Homan to Minneapolis, according to a person familiar with her discussions. Trump also fielded calls Sunday from allies who worried that the situation was spiraling out of control. Some of them also suggested that he send Homan, who had been honored by President Barack Obama for his work on immigration, to Minneapolis.",
      "By Sunday night, Trump had signaled to aides that he was ready to change his lineup and his public posture, and White House staff set a news briefing for Monday.At the same time, a senior administration official told NBC News, Trump planned to keep his immigration enforcement policy intact and continued to have discussions with advisers about invoking the Insurrection Act in order to deploy the military to Minneapolis.",
      "New team, same policy",
      "On Monday morning, Trump connected with Homan by phone, and Homan offered to go to Minneapolis to take over the operations there. He said he believed he could negotiate with Democratic officials to secure greater cooperation in locating and removing undocumented immigrants with criminal backgrounds. They then met in person Monday afternoon as well, according to a White House official with knowledge of the meeting.",
      "With the path already laid out by Trump\u2019s allies and aides, the president  said that dispatching Homan was a \u201cgreat\u201d idea and announced the move publicly on social media. Bovino was stripped of his commander-at-large title and sent back to the El Centro, California, border region, where he had worked before being elevated to carry out interior operations.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Later that morning, Trump spoke with Walz for the first time since the shooting, describing their discussion as a \u201cgood call\u201d and saying they \"seemed to be on a similar wavelength\" \u2014 a noticeable shift in tone toward the governor. At a news briefing Monday afternoon, press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to defend the way in which Noem and Miller attacked Pretti on Saturday, when they accused him of seeking to assassinate federal agents.",
      "\u201cI have not heard the president characterize Mr. Pretti in that way,\u201d Leavitt said.",
      "And by Monday night, after Homan had arrived in Minneapolis, Noem and Corey Lewandowski, her most influential adviser and a former Trump campaign manager, met with the president at the White House, according to two White House officials and a DHS official. The DHS official described that meeting as \u201cpositive.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t until Tuesday around noon \u2014 more than three days after Pretti\u2019s death \u2014 that Trump first appeared on camera to address the situation in Minneapolis and his decision to change his leadership team.",
      "He told reporters that he did not believe that Pretti intended to assassinate anyone, but reiterated his view that \u201cyou can\u2019t have guns\u201d in a situation like the one Pretti was in.",
      "He also said Noem would remain in her position, even as Democrats \u2014 joined later by two Republican senators \u2014 called for her immediate ouster. Most notably, he underscored a shift in tone, if not tactics, in Minnesota, where Homan met with Walz and Frey on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to de-escalate a little bit,\u201d Trump said.",
      "On Tuesday night, there was more trouble in Minneapolis. A man confronted Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., at a town hall. He was arrested after trying to spray her with what a preliminary report later showed to be apple cider vinegar, according to Omar\u2019s spokesperson.",
      "Contacted after the attack, Trump told an ABC News reporter he hadn\u2019t yet seen video of the incident, but he nevertheless blamed Omar, whom he frequently targets.",
      "\u201cShe probably had herself sprayed, knowing her,\u201d Trump said."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senators met privately on Wednesday to discuss off-ramps to prevent a government shutdown this weekend, with both parties recognizing that a funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security cannot pass in its current form.",
      "A recent funding deal that passed the House last week has been upended by the DHS killing of Alex Pretti in Minnesota over the weekend \u2014 and the subsequent public outcry, which prompted Democrats and a top Republican to say the department should not be funded without policy changes.",
      "The deadline is Friday at 11:59 p.m. ET, leaving little time to hash out a solution that can achieve the 60 votes needed in the Senate.",
      "One idea that has gained traction: a short-term funding bill for DHS, while the two parties negotiate changes to the department, along with the five remaining appropriations bills to fund the rest of the government through Sept. 30.",

      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an item that has been discussed on both sides,\u201d said GOP Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D.",
      "But he added that it will only proceed \u201cif the president is on board first.\u201d The White House has not commented on the idea.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re open. We recognize that if we do nothing, then we have a government shutdown, which nobody wants,\u201d added Rounds, who has been speaking with Democrats about possible off-ramps. \u201cIf we get five of the six bills across the finish line, with House cooperation, that\u2019s funding really close to in excess of 90% of the government, with basically only Homeland left.\u201d",
      "Multiple Republican senators said they\u2019d be supportive of that approach \u2014 but only if the White House supports it.",
      "\u201cWe have to have an open mind on the options. And obviously one that we\u2019re talking about is the five bills goal, and we do some work on DHS,\u201d said Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D. \u201cBut obviously, the White House has to decide and tell us what they want.\u201d",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., kept the door open Wednesday when asked about the idea of five bills and a short-term funding bill for DHS (also called a continuing resolution or \u201cCR\u201d). But he indicated that the onus would be on the Democrats to cut a deal with the White House.",
      "\u201cThese are all hypotheticals at this point, and I would reserve optionality to consider that,\u201d Thune said after a Senate GOP lunch meeting in response to a question from NBC News. \u201cBut I think the best path forward, as I said, is to keep the package intact. And if there are things that the Democrats want, the administration can agree with them about, then let\u2019s do that.\u201d",
      "\u201cOne thing I do know,\u201d Thune said. \u201cAnd that is that a government shutdown is not in anybody\u2019s interest \u2014 whether it\u2019s a partial one or a six-bill one or a one-bill one.\u201d",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accused ICE of waging \u201cstate-sanctioned thuggery\u201d and laid out three demands to overhaul DHS that he said Democrats are \u201cunited\u201d behind: End \u201croving patrols\u201d and tighten rules on warrants for arrests; enforce accountability with a \u201cuniform code of conduct\"; and require agents to remove their masks, carry ID and wear body cameras.",
      "Schumer, who is pushing Thune to strip out the DHS bill and vote on the rest of the package, sidestepped when asked if he\u2019d support a stopgap bill for DHS while his demands are negotiated.",
      "\u201cFirst, if funding lapses, it\u2019s all because of Leader Thune,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cIt\u2019s on his back. He could easily fund 96% of the budget by simply putting the five bills on the floor. As I said, you can just do that by taking DHS out, which you can do by an amendment. And given the need to do this, we could very quickly negotiate a bipartisan proposal of DHS to end violence.\u201d",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said he wants Republicans to agree to significant safeguards on ICE operations, including requirements for judicial warrants for arrests, mandatory body cameras and civil liability for officers who break the law.",
      "But Blumenthal added that he would be open to the idea of passing the five bills, with DHS funding moving forward as a CR.",
      "It would be a \u201clast resort to avoid a shutdown, but there has to be some agreements on reforms,\u201d said Blumenthal, a former Connecticut attorney general. \u201cMy priority is safeguards to protect against the kind of physical violence and violation of rights that we\u2019ve seen so flagrantly in real time on the streets and neighborhoods of America.\u201d",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., the chair of the Homeland Security Committee, has been a prominent GOP critic of DHS operations in Minnesota and called for a hearing with DHS leaders. He said Wednesday that ICE shouldn\u2019t get more funds without reforms.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to defund ICE, but I\u2019m not sure I want to give them billions and billions more without any kind of signs of there are going to be some rules of the game, and there will be an independent investigation\u201d into Pretti\u2019s shooting, Paul said on Fox Business.",
      "Conservative Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said he agreed with the approach Rounds laid out. Both serve on the Senate Appropriations Committee that controls government funding.",
      "\u201cAt this juncture, the smart play is to carve out the Homeland Security bill and we can fight over that,\u201d he said, \u201cbut in the meantime, try to do a CR [on DHS] and pass the other bills.\u201d",
      "Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., said of the idea: \u201cThat\u2019s got to come from the White House. If they OK it, I guess it would work.\u201d",
      "The idea also has its share of skeptics, including Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who said: \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be all or nothing.\u201d",
      "He predicted that Trump won\u2019t endorse the idea of splitting off DHS: \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to support it.\u201d",
      "Even if senators do strike an 11th-hour agreement, there still could be a funding lapse. Before the Pretti killing, the House last week sent the Senate a six-bill package that funded the Departments of Defense, State, Treasury, Health and Human Services, Education, Transportation, Homeland Security and other agencies through the end of the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30.",
      "Any changes the Senate makes to that funding package would need to go back to the House, which is on recess this week and not slated to return to Washington until Monday. A brief funding lapse until early next week would have minimal practical impact if agencies have confidence it\u2019d be quickly resolved.",
      "That would mean buy-in from the House. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said he didn\u2019t think decoupling the bills could pass the lower chamber.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a real question whether the House possibly could pass those bills separately,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a miracle we got this far.\u201d"

      "Rapid adoption of AI by young people set off waves of anxiety that students could cheat their way through college, leading many professors to run papers through online AI detectors that inspect whether students used large language models to write their work for them. Some colleges say they\u2019ve caught hundreds of students cheating this way.",
      "However, since their debut a few years ago, AI detectors have repeatedly been criticized as unreliable and more likely to flag non-native English speakers on suspicion of plagiarism. And a growing number of college students also say their work has been falsely flagged as written by AI \u2014 several have filed lawsuits against universities over the emotional distress and punishments they say they faced as a result.",
      "NBC News spoke to ten students and faculty who described being caught in the middle of an escalating war of AI tools.",
      "Amid accusations of AI cheating, some students are turning to a new group of generative AI tools called \u201chumanizers.\u201d The tools scan essays and suggest ways to alter text so they aren\u2019t read as having been created by AI. Some are free, while others cost around $20 a month.",
      "Some users of the humanizer tools rely on them to avoid detection of cheating, while others say they don\u2019t use AI at all in their work, but want to ensure they aren\u2019t falsely accused of AI-use by AI-detector programs.",
      "In response, and as chatbots continue to advance, companies such as Turnitin and GPTZero have upgraded their AI detection software, aiming to catch writing that\u2019s gone through a humanizer. They also launched applications that students can use to track their browser activity or writing history so they can prove they wrote the material, though some humanizers can type out text that a user wants to copy and paste in case a student\u2019s keystrokes are tracked.",
      "\u201cStudents now are trying to prove that they\u2019re human, even though they might have never touched AI ever,\u201d said Erin Ramirez, an associate professor of education at California State University, Monterey Bay. \u201cSo where are we? We\u2019re just in a spiral that will never end.\u201d",
      "The competition between AI detectors and writing assistance programs has been propelled by a heightened anxiety about cheating on college campuses. It shows how inescapable AI has become at universities, even for students who don\u2019t want to use it and for faculty who wish they didn\u2019t have to police it.",
      "\u201cIf we write properly, we get accused of being AI \u2014 it\u2019s absolutely ridiculous,\u201d said Aldan Creo, a graduate student from Spain who studies AI detection at University of California San Diego. \u201cLong term, I think it\u2019s going to be a big problem.\u201d",
      "Do you have a story to share about technology in education? Contact reporter Tyler Kingkade",
      "A teaching assistant in a data science course accused Creo of using AI to write a report in November. Creo explained to the TA that he has a habit of explaining step by step how he reasons through a problem, which ChatGPT is known to do, according to a copy of messages he exchanged with the TA.",
      "Eventually, his grade was corrected but, to avoid another battle, Creo said he sometimes \u201cdumbs down\u201d his work by leaving words misspelled or using Spanish sentence structures that aren\u2019t proper in English. And now, Creo runs all of his material through an AI detector pre-emptively.",
      "\u201cI have to do whatever I can to just show I actually write my homework myself,\u201d he said.",
      "\u2018How could Al make any of that up?\u2019",
      "At their worst, the stress from the accusations has driven some students to drop out of school.",
      "Brittany Carr received failing grades on three assignments she completed as a long-distance student at Liberty University, a private evangelical school in Virginia that has one of the largest online enrollments in the U.S., because they were flagged by an AI detector. She showed her revision history, including how she\u2019d written one first by hand in a notebook, according to screenshots of emails and messages she exchanged with her professors.",
      "\u201cHow could Al make any of that up?\u201d Carr wrote in a Dec. 5 email. \u201cI spoke about my cancer diagnosis and being depressed and my journey and you believe that is Al?\u201d",
      "Her evidence wasn\u2019t enough \u2014 the social work school still told her she needed to take a \u201cwriting with integrity\u201d class and sign a statement apologizing for using AI, emails show.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very weird feeling, because the school is using AI to tell us that we\u2019re using AI,\u201d she said.",
      "It stressed her out. Carr worried another cheating accusation could cause the Department of Veterans Affairs to take away her financial aid. In order to avoid more false accusations, she said, she ran all of her material through Grammarly\u2019s AI detector and changed any section that it highlighted until it concluded a human wrote the whole thing.",
      "\u201cBut it does feel like my writing isn\u2019t giving insight into anything \u2014 I\u2019m writing just so that I don\u2019t flag those AI detectors,\u201d she said.",
      "After the semester ended, Carr decided to leave Liberty. She\u2019s unsure where she\u2019ll transfer.",
      "\"I\u2019m writing just so that I don\u2019t flag those AI detectors.\"",
      "Brittany Carr, liberty University student",
      "Liberty University, which was co-founded by religious broadcaster Jerry Falwell Sr., said it does not comment on individual students. It said in a statement that all academic integrity concerns are addressed \u201cwith care and discretion, providing a process that keeps the student\u2019s best interests at the forefront. Our aim is only to see our students succeed, and every student is afforded an exhaustive process to address any concerns about unfair treatment.\u201d",
      "Eric Wang, vice president of research at Quillbot, which makes a detector and a humanizer, said this kind of fear is going to remain unless educators move away from automatically deducting points instead of bringing students in to discuss how they use AI.",
      "Once that happens, Wang said, \u201cit starts to not matter whether you do or don\u2019t sound like AI and instead moves us toward a world asking how are we using this technology but not losing our sense of humanity, our sense of creativity, and our ability to create great things on our own.\u201d",
      "\u2018Where\u2019s the line\u2019",
      "At the root of many conflicts about students using chatbots to cheat is a disagreement about what counts as too much AI use on homework.",
      "\u201cWhen we did our first training program for 3,000 teachers,\u201d said Edward Tian, CEO and co-founder of GPTZero, \u201cevery teacher and every student had a different understanding of what\u2019s acceptable \u2014 just the understanding was very fragmented, and then it\u2019s getting even more fragmented with the number of tools growing.\u201d",
      "Independent analyses of AI detectors show mixed accuracy. One pre-print study last year found GPTZero is good at finding AI-generated writing, but \u201cits reliability in distinguishing human-authored texts is limited.\u201d However, other research pegged the company\u2019s detector at near-perfect accuracy. Meanwhile, separate studies from 2023 and 2024 have found that Turnitin had a low false positive rate, but failed to identify more than a quarter of AI-generated or AI-rephrased texts.",
      "Both companies emphasized that research showing flaws in their detectors is outdated due to the rapid evolution of large language models and updates to their own detection software.",
      "\"It\u2019s almost like the better the writer you are, the more AI thinks you\u2019re AI.\"",
      "Erin Ramirez, professor of education at Cal State Monterey Bay",
      "AI detection probability scores are often misread too by users who fail to recognize the detectors are flagging text that it flags text that is likely generated by AI, rather than confirmed to be made by a chatbot, or fail to recognize that the text needs to be at least 300 words long for some detectors to effectively evaluate it.",
      "Turnitin tells schools never to use its tools as the sole basis for deciding whether a student cheated, said Annie Chechitelli, the company\u2019s chief product officer. It should instead prompt a conversation with a student about how and why AI was used, she said.",
      "\u201cThe most important question is not so much about detection, it\u2019s really about where\u2019s the line,\u201d she said.",
      "GPTZero also has a disclaimer on its platform advising faculty not to use its detector to punish students.",
      "Ramirez, the Cal State Monterey Bay professor, who is studying how AI can be used in K-12 settings, said anyone who relies on a detector has never put their own work through it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like the better the writer you are, the more AI thinks you\u2019re AI,\u201d she said. \u201cI put my own papers into AI detectors just to check because I don\u2019t like to hold students accountable without knowing how the tool works. And it flags me at like 98% every time, and I didn\u2019t use AI in any capacity.\u201d",
      "Faculty, administrators and AI detection company leaders all agreed that professors should have conversations with students after software flags their work to ensure no one is falsely accused of academic dishonesty. But to do that properly takes time \u2014 especially when many instructors have dozens or even hundreds of students each semester, said Morgan Sanchez, an assistant professor of sociology at San Jos\u00e9 State University.",
      "\u201cSo it is creating a slight sense of tension, but more so it\u2019s creating extra labor \u2014 uncompensated labor \u2014 that we have to do,\u201d Sanchez said.",
      "A booming humanizer industry",
      "Turnitin, which has been around for a quarter-century offering tools to help educators catch plagiarism, is trying to keep up with humanizers. The company views humanizers as a \u201cgrowing threat to academic integrity,\u201d and issued a software update last August to detect text modified by the tools.",
      "\"The most important question is not so much about detection, it\u2019s really about where\u2019s the line.\"",
      "Annie Chechitelli, Turnitin's chief product officer",
      "The company has a list of 150 tools that charge as much as $50 for a subscription to adjust text so that it\u2019s not flagged by an AI detector. Chechitelli referred to them as companies whose \u201csole goal is to really help students cheat.\u201d",
      "Demand has surged for the tools. Joseph Thibault, founder of Cursive, an academic integrity software company, tracked 43 humanizers that had a combined 33.9 million website visits in October.",
      "Thibault, who also publishes a newsletter on cheating called This Isn\u2019t Fine, said he thinks students would be better off ensuring they have a record of their revision history in Google Docs or Microsoft Word than using a humanizer. But ultimately, he believes, the shift that\u2019s coming is moving toward more monitoring of students completing assignments.",
      "\u201cI think we have to ask students, what level of surveillance are you willing to subject yourself to so that we can actually know that you\u2019re learning?\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a new agreement that needs to be made.\u201d",
      "Students surveilling themselves",
      "Superhuman, the company that makes Grammarly, developed a tool it calls Authorship that\u2019s included with basic accounts. Students can turn it on to surveil themselves on Google Docs or Microsoft Word as they write and playback later. It will show which sections were typed, pasted from another source or generated with AI.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep track of when you are going to Wikipedia,\u201d said Jenny Maxwell, Superhuman\u2019s head of education. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep track of when Grammarly is making suggestions and you\u2019re taking them, we\u2019re going to keep track of how much time you\u2019ve spent in this paper or how many sessions.\u201d",
      "As many as 5 million Authorship reports were created in the past year alone, she said, though most of the time they aren\u2019t submitted.",
      "Maxwell said the tool was inspired by a viral TikTok video from Marley Stevens, who described the havoc of what she said was a false accusation of AI use that landed her on academic probation in 2023 at the University of North Georgia. In reality, Stevens said, she\u2019d only used Grammarly\u2019s extension to help fix spelling and punctuation.",
      "The university declined to comment on Stevens\u2019 case, citing federal privacy law, but said in a statement that \u201cfaculty communicate specific guidelines regarding the use of AI for various classes and those guidelines are included in the class syllabi.\u201d",
      "Stevens, who graduated last month, said it was difficult to keep track of each professor\u2019s policy around AI usage \u2014 and it increasingly became hard to avoid writing on software that didn\u2019t have it embedded.",
      "\u201cGoogle has AI embedded into it, Microsoft has AI embedded into it \u2014 like literally everything has AI in it,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, in a roundabout way, there\u2019s no way to write a paper without using AI, unless you go to the library and you check books out and use encyclopedias.\u201d",
      "Pressure on colleges",
      "Some students believe universities should stop using AI detectors because of false positives. In upstate New York, an online petition calling on the University at Buffalo to drop the software received more than 1,500 signatures last year.",
      "Kelsey Auman, who graduated last spring, started the petition after she fought to prove she did not use AI on several of her assignments. She knew enough classmates with similar experiences that they had a group chat named \u201cAcademic Felons for Life.\u201d Auman said she started to run her papers through multiple AI detectors on her own before turning them in, hoping to avoid another dispute, but it created more anxiety when they also incorrectly flagged things she wrote as generated by a chatbot.",
      "\u201cSo it\u2019s like, how far do you want to go down the rabbit hole? I\u2019m making myself crazy,\u201d she said.",
      "\"We keep turning on what the academic institutions need to do to fix problems that they didn\u2019t create.\"",
      "Tricia Bertram Gallant, director of academic integrity at UC San Diego",
      "The University at Buffalo said it does not have an institutionwide rule on AI use, but instructors must have evidence beyond a detector score to report a student for academic dishonesty.",
      "Tricia Bertram Gallant, director of the academic integrity office at UC San Diego, advises faculty to realize how herculean of a task it is to ensure students don\u2019t use AI if they aren\u2019t completing the work in front of them.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s an unsupervised assessment, don\u2019t bother trying to ban AI,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t bother trying to prove AI was used because you end up spending more time doing that.\u201d",
      "But Bertram Gallant, who is also president emeritus of the International Center for Academic Integrity, wishes more people would put pressure on the government to regulate AI and the academic cheating industry, and on tech companies to make it harder for students to use their products to cheat.",
      "\u201cWe keep turning on what the academic institutions need to do to fix problems that they didn\u2019t create,\u201d she said."

    "published": "Wed, 28 Jan 2026 23:41:53 GMT",
    "summary": "The recent winter storm did not alleviate the \"snow drought\" plaguing Colorado, Utah and other western states. Snowpack levels are far below average in many regions.",
    "story": [
      "Last weekend\u2019s winter storm may have covered much of the country in a glut of snow and ice, but the season has not delivered out West, where several states face a snowpack drought.",
      "In Colorado, the snowpack is \u201cthe lowest on record for this point in the season,\u201d said Peter Goble, the assistant state climatologist. \u201cAll of our mountain ranges are well below normal.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the same story in Utah.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in uncharted territory right now, and we\u2019re headed toward the lowest snowpack we\u2019ve ever had on Feb. 1,\u201d said Kevin Perry, a University of Utah atmospheric scientist.",
      "Given those conditions, scientists are growing concerned about the water supply and a risk of wildfires later in the year. Because the mountain snowpack in Western states runs off as water throughout spring and summer, the levels influence how much water farmers can use to irrigate crops, how risky the wildfire season will be, and how much electricity hydropower dams can generate.",
      "Measurements of Western snowpack come from the National Resources Conservation Service, which collects data from more than 800 high-elevation monitoring stations in the mountains. The service tracks how much water is in the snowpack at more than 80 basins in the Western continental United States, and its data shows that all but a handful are trending well below average.",
      "While it\u2019s not unusual to have some basins lower than historical averages, it\u2019s rare to have nearly every region of the West facing snowfall deficits.",
      "In Washington state, a mid-January climb of Mount Saint Helens revealed conditions that felt more like June than midwinter, with large patches of volcanic rock exposed near the crater rim.",
      "The reasons for the snowpack drought vary by region, but across the West, temperatures have been uncommonly warm this winter, which has led more precipitation to fall as rain instead of snow. That was true when atmospheric river storms hammered the Pacific Northwest in December.",
      "\u201cWashington, Oregon, California and many Western states had their warmest December ever on record, and so the torrential rains that we had with the atmospheric river and the flooding and damage from too much water \u2014 none of that stayed in the mountains,\u201d said Philip Mote, a professor at Oregon State University\u2019s College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences.",
      "Then this month, the spigot of moisture largely shut off in the Northwest.",
      "In Utah, early season rainfall in November and December melted everything below about 9,000 feet of elevation, leaving the Wasatch mountains looking top heavy, according to Perry.",
      "\u201cThe high elevation snowpack is actually really good,\u201d Perry said. But \u201cwe just have no low elevation and very little mid-elevation snowpack.\u201d",
      "Colorado has simply remained relatively hot and dry.",
      "\u201cDecember of 2025 was nine degrees warmer than average statewide, which was our warmest on record, going back to 1895,\u201d Goble said.",
      "The snowpack in California \u2014 known for its boom and bust water cycle \u2014 is in better shape, particularly in the southern Sierras, where several basins have above-average accumulations.",
      "But for the regions left wanting for snow, little relief is expected soon.",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s Climate Prediction Center expects dry conditions for much of the West for the next two weeks, with temperatures remaining above average for the next month.",
      "Mote said some areas west of the Cascade crest \u2014 which runs up the spine of Washington and Oregon \u2014 could recover if a few big storms come later this winter or in spring.",
      "But, he said, \u201cfor Eastern Washington and most of Idaho, the story\u2019s already kind of been written and it\u2019s just unlikely to change.\u201d",
      "Scientists have struggled to quantify the influence of climate change on snowpack, since warming is both raising temperatures and shifting patterns of precipitation. Trends in snowpack are also heavily influenced by natural variability. However, research published in 2024 in the journal Nature found that climate change was to blame for a declining trend in snowpack across the Northern Hemisphere.",
      "Mote\u2019s work in the Western U.S. shows dramatic declines.",
      "\u201cThe story just keeps getting clearer and sadder,\u201d he said.",
      "If the low snowpack continues, it will add pressure to already tense negotiations between seven Western states over how to split up flows from the Colorado River, which provides drinking water to 40 million people. The river\u2019s flow has dwindled as a result of long-term drought and because its users collectively have rights to take more water each year than is actually available.",
      "The Bureau of Reclamation earlier this month released its draft of how to manage the water, which supports 5.5 million acres of agriculture and hydropower operations in California, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.",
      "The states are negotiating a long-term plan for how to manage the river\u2019s water and prevent dams at Lake Mead and Lake Powell from reaching \u201cdead pool\u201d status, when flow would be cut off to lower regions of the river. But those negotiations have reportedly been at a standstill.",
      "\u201cIn the short run, having a low snowpack year may raise the urgency of coming to some of those agreements,\u201d Goble said."

      "The series follows grieving therapist Jimmy (Jason Segel) after the death of his wife. Meanwhile, his teenage daughter Alice (Lukita Maxwell) navigates the loss of her mother, too. As the seasons continue, the poignant show also tackles the progression of Dr. Paul's (Harrison Ford) Parkinson\u2019s disease and how all the characters come together to take care of each other. (Ahead of its Jan. 27 Season 3 premiere, the Apple TV show was already renewed for a fourth season.)",

      "Nineteen people died, thousands were displaced and 9,418 homes and other buildings were destroyed when the Eaton Canyon caught on fire during 90 miles per hour winds, according to The Associated Press. At the same time, the Palisades Fire on the opposite side of town was also ablaze and destructive.",

      "Locations like Gaby\u2019s (Jessica Williams) home in Altadena, where they shoot exterior shots, was burned down. Eaton Canyon, where the fire ignited, is also used as a hiking location for the show.

      "The below has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "Jessica Williams",
      "I always think about what Mr. Rogers said, where he\u2019s like, \u201cLook for the helpers in the time of disaster.\u201d And to me, with both fires, especially being from LA, it was just devastating. To be able to go back and hire locally and be in local places, donate and give time, that was a big, big part of my personal journey when shooting the show.",
      "I think we were supposed to start shooting the week of the fires. So we had to push and then we had to do all the interior (shots). I know the homeowners of my character\u2019s house. It burned down. So Gaby\u2019s house burned down \u2014 so we just shot (it on a sound stage) \u2014 which is so, so sad. There was a bit of fear of wanting to get it right and figuring out how to play the show with the fires and just choosing to kind of move forward on the show. I was really nervous about it.",
      "There were so many starts and stops because we couldn\u2019t shoot outside in the area, especially at Jimmy and Liz\u2019s house with the air quality, which is in Pasadena. As someone who lives in Eagle Rock, the best part is shooting in our community and area, and it was just really sad. All the actors felt it. A few of the actors weren\u2019t in their homes and some of the crew lost their homes. But (we were like), we got to make money. At that point, there\u2019s only like, five projects going in LA. There\u2019s not a lot that shoots in LA. We\u2019re starting to get that back, but it was just sad and it was kind of just the backdrop of the whole show.",
      "Lukita Maxwell",
      "I live not too far and it was a very difficult time. We didn\u2019t go back on location for a while. We were just waiting to make sure that the location was clear and safe for everybody to go to and that everybody there was safe. I remember the first drive back onto the set and \u2014 as it is with, I think, all of these areas in LA that were affected and touched by this crazy fire \u2014 the energy of the Earth changed. So there was a lot of energy on that drive. I remember feeling very grateful that I was and my loved ones were safe. It was a hard time.",
      "Michael Urie",
      "I was so, so sad about Altadena when we started shooting last season and so much of it was gone. So many people were displaced. And our sweet locations, we have a lot of locations in Altadena, and luckily, almost all of them were OK. Going back there was very moving for all of us because we couldn\u2019t for a while. We had to postpone a lot of those scenes for the end of the shoot, but being back there was quite moving.",
      "(Before \u201cShrinking\u201d), I didn\u2019t know about this neighborhood. I had slept on Altadena. It was like this magical little jewel in the Los Angeles neighborhood spectrum that had slipped past me. It is really lovely there, and I\u2019m so glad that we got to bring some life and some money back to the community. It\u2019s become just a beautiful location for our show. I think we\u2019ve gotten to give a face to a name to a lot of people that might not know that community.",

      "I lived in the Palisades, so we\u2019re not in our house either. We moved out to Altadena, where we film, and we couldn\u2019t go there because the houses were being remediated. Thank God, they made it.",
      "We\u2019re very proud of how we represent Pasadena, Altadena. It\u2019s a great community. They\u2019ve opened their doors to us and we try to respect it. And you see it in the show, we show the best parts of it and it\u2019s a great background. We had to wait to get into our houses, so we did the interiors. And then when we shot the exteriors, we did all of the (scenes). We did like six, seven shows in one week, in the back, in the outside. But we couldn\u2019t get in for months, we were behind... It was really tricky, but it was a fun challenge. We love the people of Pasadena, Altadena.",
      "Luke Tennie",
      "(Returning to Altadena and Pasadena) felt great \u2014 and let me explain why. In my light research, I\u2019ve learned how beneficial it can be to work in places that have experienced natural disasters. I grew up in South Florida, so our disasters look different, a lot of hurricanes and rain and tropical storms. There\u2019d be a lot of damage there. But the most important thing about where we live is what takes place here. The industry that makes a lot of the money here is film and TV. So the more that we can shoot in these locations, the more we can nurse them back to health. \u201cShrinking\u201d is a Pasadena show. It\u2019s an Altadena show. It takes place there. The more we can actually operate there and create work there, and bring revenue and jobs there, the better the place will be. So I hope that we can do, I don\u2019t know, maybe about 87 or 89 more seasons of \u201cShrinking,\u201d to be specific. I think that\u2019ll all just help the city out in terms of growing and repairing the damage that was done."

      "Ben Stiller goes bananas in every comedic role he embodies, but this time, it\u2019s little more literal.",
      "The \u201cZoolander\u201d actor and \u201cSeverance\u201d director teamed up with the \u201cMystical Magical\u201d singer with more flips than a home-design show, Benson Boone, for Instacart\u2019s Super Bowl commercial. The vintage-style spot, entitled \u201cBananas,\u201d was directed by Spike Jonze, who directed the movies \u201cHer,\u201d \u201cBeing John Malkovich\u201d and a plethora of iconic music videos.",
      "\u201cWhat was fun about it, to me, was committing to a very specific world and, comedically, it\u2019s fun to jump into something like that,\u201d Stiller tells TODAY.com, adding that the combination of working with Boone and Jonze \u2014 whom he calls \u201cone of our great American directors\u201d \u2014 sounded really exciting to him.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve known Spike for a long time, but we never worked together, and I knew that if Spike was doing it, he was going to dial it in a super specific way, and just committing to the ridiculousness of it and the physicality of it was really fun,\u201d he says. \u201cI had a blast, dude.\u201d",
      "The pair\u2019s star power shines throughout the 30-second spot that sees Stiller and Boone as Gary and John, heavily accented brothers and bandmates with \u201cDodgeball\u201d-worthy mustaches. As with many of Stiller\u2019s characters who become annoyed to their own detriment, his clear jealousy over Boone\u2019s high falsetto and flapjack-like nature come to a cartoonish head.",
      "The duo\u2019s \u201980s Europop band sings and dances to introduce Instacart\u2019s latest in-app product innovation: Preference Picker. Starting with bananas, the new tool lets customers select their preferred ripeness \u2014 from \u201cnot ripe\u201d to \u201calmost ripe\u201d to \u201cripe\u201d \u2014 so shoppers can make better real-time decisions on their behalf. Hopefully, it means your \u201cHeated Rivalry\u201d-style smoothie will be safe from green bananas.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like, when you go into a supermarket, you can go and squeeze the fruit, make sure it\u2019s the one you like, so I thought that this was a cool idea,\u201d Stiller says. \u201cAnd then for me, the jingle was so catchy and so, so ridiculous \u2026 It was a simple idea.\u201d",
      "Stiller\u2019s Europop big brother character could fit into any one of his movies and is further boosted by Jonze\u2019s meticulous attention to detail. The commercial was all shot on vintage tube cameras  \u2014 the same kind of camera used to shoot countless variety shows like the one it emulates \u2014 to \u201cheighten the retro disco energy\u201d of the comedic performance.",
      "The 60-foot, glittering stage illuminated with orange and green LED lighting was built specifically for this ad, which of course, was littered with flips \u2014 more from Stiller than Boone, it should be noted.",
      "\u201cFirst of all, let me say, if anybody\u2019s annoyed with his flipping, it\u2019s flip envy,\u201d Stiller says of the discourse around Boone\u2019s onstage persona. \u201cNobody could do what he does. Come on. It\u2019s crazy. I\u2019ve seen it up close. It\u2019s insane.\u201d",
      "Stiller also says he couldn\u2019t deny Boone\u2019s talent when they recorded the jingle together and he \u201cheard him go off and do his crazy run.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s just so good, and it comes so naturally to him, and he\u2019s so young, and it just kind of flows out,\u201d Stiller adds about Boone.",
      "Boone said in a press release that working on a Super Bowl commercial \u201cblew (his) mind,\u201d and that \u201cadding Ben Stiller to the equation\u201d was \u201cdiabolical.\u201d",
      "Aside from a couple of already released teasers (\u201cGoals\u201d and \u201cHarmonizing\u201d), Instacart is also releasing Spike Jonze\u2019s director\u2019s cut, a long-form version of the ad, that expands the musical rivalry into a full two-plus-minute narrative arc.",

      "Al\u2019s ride with Powter also gave a glimpse into the inner workings of being a driver for a food delivery app. At one point, Powter picked up a Starbucks order from a commercial kitchen facility rather than an actual Starbucks.

      "The film follows Lidia, portrayed by Imogen Poots, a promising swimmer who struggles at home with an abusive father and complacent mother in the '80s.",
      "As her athletic dreams take a different turn, she is faced with love, loss, addiction and self-destructive choices that eventually leads her to discover her voice and healing through writing.",
      "Stewart first encountered the memoir in 2017, she shared in a statement, \u201cAnd from the very first page I felt its electric current \u2014 this jagged, nonlinear journey through trauma and memory was unlike anything I\u2019d ever read.\u201d",

      "What drew her to the story, Stewart said, was its fragmentation, explaining, \u201cYuknavitch doesn\u2019t give you a tidy narrative, but instead hands you the pieces of a life in shards, demanding you assemble them yourself.

      "Lidia Yuknavitch Was a Promising Swimmer",

      "Yuknavitch began swimming at the age of 4, she recalled in a 2018 interview, and began competing just two years later.",
      "\u201cWhat swimming meant all through my adolescence was freedom from the house of father. All my mornings and afternoons were small salvations, all those hours and lap after lap away from home and family, two words that nearly killed me,\u201d she wrote in a personal essay for LitHub. \u201cI didn\u2019t care about winning medals or my team or even my name in lights on giant digitalized scoreboards. I cared about the away from him. I cared about how within water, a body could be a body, a body could even be, dare I think it, mine.\u201d",
      "She Was a Victim of Abuse",
      "In her memoir, Yuknavitch details how her father would verbally, sexually and physically abuse her and her sister while her mom, who suffered from alcoholism, wouldn't always intervene.",

      "\"Shame was a lesson that swam deeply in my blood. You know, even at six years old I understood a blow would have been preferable,\" she wrote. \"So when the blows came later in life, I didn\u2019t flinch. I\u2019d already learned to take what was worse.\"",
      "Trying to escape him, her father refused to let her go away to college until, she wrote, her mother stepped up.",
      "\u201cA week later, when the papers came to sign, my father was at work. My mother signed them. I remember watching her hand, a little stunned. She had beautiful handwriting. Then she put them in the envelope, grabbed her car keys, and told me C\u2019mawn. In her southern drawl liquor voice,\" she wrote in her memoir.",

She shared in an interview with The Lit Pub that she decided to open her book with the story about her daughter \u201cbecause that is the body event that \u2018opened\u2019 me. I mean it broke me. Utterly. But it broke me OPEN.\u201d",
      "\u201cI became a writer from that experience. Not instantly, in the moment I went fairly insane, as I wrote about,\u201d she said. \u201cBut later. The first thing that came out of me when my wits and emotions settled back toward something bearable was writing. As it turns out, there was a lot in there ... I think I have many, many books to say.\u201d",

      "\u201cSometimes the waves go away, sometimes they don\u2019t. Sometimes I\u2019m on medication to help navigate the waves,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d say abuse and anger and grief took root in me young enough that it will likely be with me for life in some form.\u201d",
      "She was addicted to heroin as a young adult, sharing that she began using again after her daughter died.",
      "\u201cKicked again after a brief period of psychosis and homelessness. I think mental health and addiction and surviving abuse and deep grief are real places that some people go,\u201d she told the publication. \u201cThey are dark places, like the bottom of the ocean. Some people don\u2019t ever come back up. For whatever reasons, I was able to come back up, come back to life, more than once, and so I have vowed to bring something with me \u2014 the responsibility to help other people afflicted by the darkness.\u201d",
      "She's Been Married Three Times",
      "Yuknavitch was married to her first husband, Philip, when their daughter was stillborn. At the time, she was in college, the film depicts.",
      "Her second husband was the late David Eugene Crowe. She details their relationship woes in \u201cThe Chronology of Water\u201d and \u201cReading the Waves.\u201d",

      "She is currently married to film producer Andy Mingo and they have a son named Miles.",
      "\u201cIn my first marriage I was a confused ball of nuclear rage and creative fire without a form. In my second marriage I was insane with grief and numbed myself with laughter and every excess imaginable, including writing,\u201d Yuknavitch told The Lit Pub. \u201cIn my third marriage I am learning what being is.\u201d",

Although last week, for the first time in a while, some novel stuff started coming out of me, so apparently I have the very, very beginnings of a novel going, and once they start coming, there\u2019s nothing I can do about it.\u201d"

      "Her post came six days after a New Mexico judge ordered the release of Busfield from jail in Albuquerque while he awaits trial on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse.",
      "\"I\u2019m sending you all my love and gratitude during this extraordinarily difficult time,\" she wrote. \"Not only for Tim, me and our family, but in the collective heaviness so many of us seem to be carrying right now. Add an unexpected storm to the mix, and it can all feel like a bit too much.\"",
      "\"This season has reminded me, very clearly, how important it is to slow down, prioritize what truly matters, and allow ourselves moments of rest,\" she continued. \"Stepping back from the noise, the news, and even our daily responsibilities from time to time gives us space to recharge, reflect, and find our center again.\"",
      "The former \"Little House on the Prairie\" star thanked fans for the support they have shown her and Busfield.",

Busfield, 68, appeared at the hearing in shackles and an orange jumpsuit.",
      "Gilbert had also previously submitted a letter of support to the court, saying her husband \u201chas the strongest moral compass of any human I have ever known.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe has dedicated his spiritual self to always being of service to others. He starts every day with kindness and compassion,\u201d she said.",
      "The charges stem from the parents of two male child actors telling Albuquerque police that Busfield inappropriately touched them on multiple occasions on the set of the Fox series \"The Cleaning Lady,\" according to the criminal complaint. Busfield acted and directed on the show.",
      "Busfield has denied the allegations.",
      "Busfield turned himself in to authorities on Jan. 13 after an arrest warrant had been issued.",
      "\u201cHe wants to turn himself in because he wants to clear his name and reputation,\u201d his attorney, Larry Stein, told NBC News at the time. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything wrong. These accusations are false as the investigator from the independent law firm found.\u201d"

      "Like their counterparts in the United States and elsewhere, young people in China are increasingly choosing a different path to parenting \u2014 doting on dogs, cats and other cherished creatures instead of children.",
      "The reason is partly economic, as they struggle with slowing growth, an intensely competitive society and the rising cost of living.",
      "But it also reflects changing views of marriage and family as China continues to modernize.",
      "\u201cMany people don\u2019t want to get married now,\u201d said Guo Xinyi, 28, who has a poodle and two cats. \u201cThey just feel pets can bring happiness, while raising a child is exhausting,\u201d she told NBC News last week at a pet grooming shop in Beijing.",
      "It\u2019s a worrisome trend for Chinese officials, who are trying to increase the birth rate as the country faces a demographic crisis that was underscored by last week\u2019s release of government data showing the population had fallen for the fourth year in a row.",
      "This month marks the 10th anniversary of the end of China\u2019s strict one-child policy, which was implemented in 1979 by officials who were concerned the country\u2019s population might grow too large. The policy was further relaxed in 2021 to allow couples to have up to three children amid worries that the long-suppressed birth rate was not keeping up with China\u2019s fast-aging population.",
      "Far from unleashing a frenzy of procreation, the loosening of restrictions has done little to encourage births, with China recording half as many as a decade ago.",
      "China is now the world\u2019s second most populous nation after being overtaken by India in 2023. And its population dropped by 3.39 million last year to 1.405 billion, the National Bureau of Statistics said last week. Births were down 17% to a record-low 7.92 million, compared with 16.55 million in 2015.",
      "The rate of marriage, which in China is generally considered a prerequisite for having children, is also falling precipitously. In 2024 the number of marriages plunged by a fifth in the biggest drop on record, from 7.68 million to 6.1 million.",
      "Authorities are trying to promote marriage and childbearing through pronatalist policies.",
      "The central government has expanded tax breaks and last year introduced a nationwide child care subsidy, providing families 3,600 yuan (about $500) per year for each child under the age of 3.",
      "Local and provincial governments are also offering their own incentives, such as longer maternity leave.",
      "Officials have also tried the opposite approach, imposing a 13% sales tax on condoms, birth control pills and other contraceptives starting Jan. 1 that is considered more symbolic than effective.",
      "But they face stubborn resistance from young people who see childbearing as an expensive investment and a risk to them as well as their potential offspring.",
      "People of childbearing age, especially women, worry about the impact children could have on their careers, said Yuying Tong, a sociology professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and co-director of its Centre for Chinese Family Studies.",
      "Young people in particular face a persistently high unemployment rate, while those further along in their careers worry about age discrimination in hiring, in what anxious job seekers call \u201cthe curse of 35.\u201d",
      "They also worry about \u201cwhat their children will face in the future\u201d when it comes to competition at school and in the job market, Tong said.",
      "With pets, she said, \u201cthey don\u2019t need to worry about their education, they just need to provide the very basic needs. There\u2019s no competition for pets.\u201d",
      "The number of pets has exploded in China, and they are more likely these days to be treated as beloved family members, a concept that used to be seen as distinctly Western.",
      "According to Goldman Sachs, the number of pets in China already exceeds the number of children 4 and under. By 2030, it said, the country will have almost twice as many pets as toddlers: more than 70 million compared with about 40 million.",
      "That is a reversal from 2017, when China had about 90 million children age 4 and under versus 40 million pets.",

      "President Donald Trump runs hot and cold in his relationship with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin \u2014 often at the same time.",
      "Since the start of the year, the United States has captured Venezuela\u2019s autocratic leader, called for the downfall of Iran\u2019s ruling theocracy and targeted Russian oil trade that has helped keep the Kremlin afloat during the war with Ukraine.",
      "Still, Trump maintains a publicly cordial relationship with Putin, has repeatedly issued statements critical of NATO and has often repeated Kremlin talking points in discussing the Ukraine war.",
      "Those parallel tracks \u2014 pressure and courtship \u2014 may capture the Trump administration\u2019s dual approach to Putin.",
      "Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel says Trump\u2019s opaque intentions can be a strength in talking to Putin, who himself is known for keeping his cards close to his chest and offering mixed public messages.",
      "\u201cFor too long, we in the West have been very predictable, and that has also been easy for someone like Vladimir Putin to then anticipate what our next moves will be,\u201d van Weel, a former assistant secretary general at NATO, said in an interview last week. Trump\u2019s unpredictability, he said, might \u201chelp.\u201d",
      "'I\u2019m hopeful'",
      "Even as Washington tightens the screws, it is also keeping a direct channel to the Kremlin open. This weekend, Ukrainian, American and Russian negotiators met in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, the first known talks all three sides have attended since the war began nearly four years ago.",
      "The meeting follows renewed outreach by Trump\u2019s circle: Russia requested a visit by special envoy Steve Witkoff, who met with Putin in Moscow on Wednesday alongside Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hopeful. ... We need a peace,\u201d Witkoff told reporters ahead of the meeting.",
      "On Monday, the Kremlin said the issue of territory remained fundamental to Russia, the state news agency Tass reported.",
      "Putin has repeatedly said Russia will take all of Ukraine\u2019s eastern industrial heartland of Donbas by force unless Kyiv gives it up in a peace deal.",
      "Kyiv has repeatedly said it will not hand over territory that Moscow has not already won on the battlefield.",
      "Beyond Maduro",
      "After American special forces captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, the Kremlin demanded their release and condemned what it said was an unacceptable attack on Venezuela\u2019s sovereignty.",
      "But Venezuela matters to Moscow for reasons that go far beyond Maduro.",
      "For Putin, the relationship has been a way to show that Russia is still a global power, not just a country boxed in by Europe. And under Putin\u2019s rule, Moscow has built deep energy and media ties in Caracas that helped it gain a rare foothold in America\u2019s backyard.",
      "Putin\u2019s aim has been \u201cto get out of this idea that Russia is just a regional power, trying to reinvigorate that kind of global or larger global reach that the Soviet Union had,\u201d said Fiona Hill, a former senior director for Europe and Russia on the National Security Council.",
      "After Russia invaded Ukraine, sanctions pushed Moscow to rely on a rapidly growing \u201cshadow fleet\u201d of tankers to keep its own crude oil exports going.",
      "In recent weeks, U.S. forces have begun seizing vessels tied to that network in and around Venezuela as Washington tightens enforcement.",
      "Iran looms",
      "As the death toll from Iran\u2019s crackdown on nationwide unrest rose past at least 5,000, according to activists, Trump sent what he called an \u201carmada\u201d to the Middle East amid hints the U.S. could go beyond sanctions on the country and is considering strikes.",
      "Trump has been contemplating military action against Tehran after its massive crackdown on opposition to the clerical regime, which killed thousands of activists in the streets.",
      "Trump\u2019s plans on Iran matter to Putin because Tehran and the Kremlin have especially close ties that stretch back to the Soviet era. Iran sends drones to Russia that have been used in the war in Ukraine, while Moscow has supplied Iran with many of the weapons it has used to crush protests.",
      "\u201cPutin has a personal stake in ensuring that Iran does not fall,\u201d said Nicole Grajewski, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Paris-based think tank. \u201cIt would have a major impact on Russia.\u201d",
      "\u201cIran for Russia is on its southern periphery,\u201d she said in an interview. Putin deeply dislikes uprisings that overthrow leaders, she added.",
      "Russian oil",
      "Once rooted in Cold War-era defense ties, the Russia-India relationship weakened as the latter\u2019s economy and outlook shifted West and Moscow moved closer to Beijing, New Delhi\u2019s regional rival.",
      "While India did not endorse Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, it became a major buyer of Russian oil, which was discounted on global markets because of international sanctions.",
      "Trump has retaliated to India\u2019s moves with secondary sanctions and threats of steep tariffs, among them a proposed 25% levy aimed at countries buying Russian crude.",
      "That squeezes Moscow, but it also hurts New Delhi.",
      "\u201cPutin probably loves the fact that Indians think of this 25% tariff as a U.S. sanction on India,\u201d said Tanvi Madan of the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cSo Russia uses this to say: \u2018Look, the U.S. and Europe are not your friends. They are sanctioning you. They are not reliable.\u2019\u201d",
      "Board of Peace",
      "Trump has offered Putin possible wins on the world stage, for example with an invitation to the Board of Peace. Putin is not the only autocrat to have been invited to join the organization, which was inaugurated Thursday in the Swiss city of Davos, but he is possibly its most controversial: Britain and France cited his participation in the organization as one of the reasons for not joining last week, among other concerns.",
      "\u201cPutin certainly is not a person to ask any questions about peace,\u201d Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen said in an interview this week.",
      "Aside from invading Ukraine, Putin has crushed free speech and political dissent within Russia. The West, led by the U.S., should be exerting more pressure on Russia, Valtonen said.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "\u201cI am a little bit fearful also of a future in which we try to rehabilitate Russia and Putin to the world community, especially if there were significant trade deals or the lifting of economic sanctions towards Russia, because, unfortunately, Russia\u2019s threat doesn\u2019t begin or it doesn\u2019t end in Ukraine,\u201d she said.",
      "Asked for comment Monday, the White House directed NBC News to an earlier Trump statement about Putin\u2019s joining the board \u201cWe want everybody. We want all nations. We want all nations where people have control, power,\u201d he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. \u201cThat way we\u2019re not ever going to have a problem.\u201d",
      "But Putin himself may have mixed feelings about Trump\u2019s apparently friendly invitation to join what has been described as an alternative to the United Nations since Russia has a permanent seat on the powerful U.N. Security Council. In contrast, the charter of the Board of Peace spells out that one person is fundamentally in charge: Trump, as chairman with a veto."

    "story": [
      "BEIJING \u2014 The downfall of China\u2019s top general, second in command and once a close ally of President Xi Jinping, has thrown the leadership of the country\u2019s military into turmoil and raised questions about Taiwan's future.",
      "The Chinese Defense Ministry said in a statement Saturday that Gen. Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, which controls the armed forces, was under investigation and accused of serious \u201cviolations of discipline and law.\u201d",
      "Liu Zhenli, another People\u2019s Liberation Army general and a lower member of the commission who was in charge of the Joint Staff Department, was also put under investigation, the ministry said.",
      "The statement gave no details about the allegations or the charges they faced. An editorial Sunday in the Liberation Army Daily newspaper, the mouthpiece of the country\u2019s armed forces, suggested that Zhang, 75, was accused of corruption and possibly disloyalty to Xi.",
      "Zhang and Liu, it said, \u201cseriously trampled on and undermined\u201d the system of responsibility under the military commission\u2019s chairman \u2014 Xi himself. The pair had also \u201cgravely fostered political and corruption problems that weakened the Party\u2019s absolute leadership over the military,\u201d it said, adding that that had \u201ccaused immense harm\u201d to China\u2019s combat readiness.",
      "Asked about Zhang at a regular briefing of reporters in Beijing, a Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson cited unfamiliarity with the matter. The page with Zhang\u2019s biography on the PLA\u2019s official website has been pulled down, suggesting he may have fallen out of favor.",
      "Zhang was previously considered \u201cuntouchable,\u201d according to Alessandro Arduino, an expert in Chinese security at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cThis is a reminder coming directly from President Xi Jinping that political loyalty stands well before combat readiness,\u201d he said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cPolitical disloyalty is a cardinal sin inside the party. And the message is clear: It\u2019s a political accusation. I think the message is extremely clear: No one is safe.\u201d",
      "Xi could have let Zhang, 75, retire to save face, he said, adding that that was \u201cvery important in China.\u201d Instead, Xi had allowed \u201ca huge political accusation\u201d to be leveled against his longtime ally, Arduino said.",
      "China\u2019s military has undergone a sweeping anti-corruption purge in recent years, in which People\u2019s Liberation Army generals, admirals, government ministers and other officials have been removed from their posts.",
      "Since he came to power in 2012, Xi has launched a variety of anti-corruption drives through various government departments.",
      "More recently the focus has been on the armed forces. In October, the ruling Communist Party expelled He Weidong, the other vice chair of the military commission, and replaced him with commission member Zhang Shengmin. And in 2024, the party expelled two former defense ministers over corruption charges.",
      "But some analysts see the removal of Zhang, a longtime confidant of Xi and a combat veteran of China\u2019s 1979 conflict with Vietnam, as the most significant ouster yet, one that will create a major upheaval at the top of China\u2019s military power structure.",
      "\u201cThis is really almost Shakespearean,\" said Jonathan Czin, a former senior CIA analyst who focused on China and is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank.",
      "He added, \"This is somebody that Xi has had a decadeslong relationship with.\u201d",
      "Of the six generals Xi appointed to the commission in 2022, only one is left, allowing Xi to consolidate power but also heightening the risk of a military miscalculation when it comes to Taiwan, according Steve Tsang, the director of the China Institute at SOAS University of London.",
      "\u201cRemoving generals like Zhang means that there will not be any general who would dare to advise Xi against a military adventure when the time comes, and this increases the risk of a miscalculation,\u201d he said in an email Monday.",
      "Xi has long harbored ambitions of reuniting Taiwan, the self-ruled territory of 23 million people, with China, and his military regularly launches live-fire drills around the island, featuring aircraft and warships.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Officials in Taipei are closely watching what they have called \u201cabnormal\u201d changes to China\u2019s military leadership and will use a range of methods to decipher Beijing\u2019s intentions, Taiwanese Defense Minister Wellington Koo said Monday.",
      "\u201cXi will not order an invasion unless he is certain of victory, but no general will now dare to advise caution if Xi asks: \u2018Is the PLA now ready to liberate Taiwan for the greater glory of China?\u2019\u201d Tsang said, adding that the world was \u201cless safe\u201d after Zhang\u2019s removal.",
      "Arduino of the Royal United Services Institute echoed that view, saying Zhang was one of the oldest high-ranking commanders who fought in the war against Vietnam, \u201cso he knows very well what it means to wage a war, compared to the majority of the PLA that are just training to be combat ready.\u201d",
      "His successor \u201cwill show what is going to look like a PLA that is first and foremost politically aligned with the party and, by definition, with President Xi himself,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cRussia is paying an extraordinary price for minimal gains and is in decline as a major power,\u201d the authors note in the study, which cites CSIS estimates, British Defense Ministry intelligence, data collected by the Russian news outlet Mediazona and the BBC Russian Service, and interviews with U.S., European, Ukrainian and other government officials.",
      "Christopher Tuck, an expert in conflict and security at King\u2019s College London who was not involved in the study, said the figures were credible and broadly in line with estimates from NATO, Western governments, and media organizations. The findings \"capture the essential reality that this is a war of attrition with staggering human costs,\" he said by email.",
      "That assessment appears to contradict recent proclamations by Russian President Vladimir Putin that Moscow has the upper hand and its victory is all but inevitable, as months of peace talks pushed by the Trump administration have so far failed to bring a resolution to the conflict.",
      "\u201cRussia's massive losses for tiny gains would normally be seen as a sign of declining military efficiency,\u201d Phillips O\u2019Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, said by email. \u201cIt certainly undermines the claims from the Trump administration and others that Russia is some great power marching on to inevitable victory.\u201d",
      "Asked about the report's estimates of Russian casualties during his daily briefing Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told NBC News that such reports should not be seen as reliable.",
      "\u201cWe suggest focusing on the information provided by the Ministry of Defense,\u201d Peskov said.",
      "But the Russian Defense Ministry has not provided any recent estimates of its dead, wounded or missing.",
      "Both Russia and Ukraine generally do not report their casualty numbers, but both sides tend to underestimate their deaths while saying the other side's losses far exceed their own.",
      "The latest official statements from the Russian side came years ago when then-Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu estimated in the fall of 2022 that Russia had lost nearly 6,000 troops. While Russia sustains losses, Putin said in October, they are \u201cmany times\u201d smaller than those suffered by Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy told NBC News last February that 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed and another 380,000 wounded since 2022. Tens of thousands were missing in action or in Russian captivity, he said. On Monday, Zelenskyy said 35,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded in December alone.",
      "The Russian outlet Mediazona, working with the BBC\u2019s Russian service and a team of volunteers, has been compiling a named list of the Russian military deaths, which stands at more than 163,000.",
      "The report calls Russian losses \u201cextraordinary,\u201d adding that \u201cno major power has suffered anywhere near these numbers of casualties or fatalities in any war since World War II.\u201d",
      "The pace of Russia's advance, the report states, has at times been slower than the notoriously bloody Battle of the Somme during World War I, with troops advancing at an average rate of just 230 feet per day in a push to control the city of Pokrovsk, an important Ukrainian transport and supply hub.",
      "Both Russia and Ukraine have mobilized civilians to serve on the front lines, but Moscow has relied heavily on contracting recruits and former convicts. Ukraine has been suffering from a severe manpower shortage amid draft evasion, despite waves of mobilization and a lowering of the conscription age in 2024.",
      "Trump often cites his own estimates about troop casualties in Ukraine. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, he said 31,000 soldiers died in the war in December, and 27,000 the month before. He did not specify if it was an estimate provided by his own intelligence or whether it reflects a combined toll for both sides.",
      "Trump consistently says he wants to stop the slaughter and \u201csave lives\u201d in Ukraine. He has been pushing Kyiv to agree to a deal that would see it cede territories it controls in the country\u2019s east. Days after the first trilateral talks between Russia, Ukraine and the U.S. last week, Trump said Tuesday that \u201cvery good things\u201d were happening in negotiations aimed at ending the war, and Russia has confirmed more talks are scheduled for this weekend.",
      "Putin's foreign aide Yuri Ushakov said Wednesday that the Russian leader is ready meet with Zelenskyy in Moscow, which he said was suggested by Trump. \"We will guarantee his safety and the necessary working conditions,\u201d Ushakov told Russian state media."

    "story": [
      "The earliest known hand-held wooden tools, used by our early human ancestors around 430,000 years ago, have been uncovered by researchers at an archeological site in Greece.",
      "One is made from the trunk of an alder tree and could have been used for digging, and the other is a small willow or poplar artifact that may have been used to shape stones, according to a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s particularly exciting about finds like this is that we just so rarely have wood preserved for that long,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author, Annemieke Milks, told NBC News by phone Tuesday.",
      "Stone tools have been recovered by archeologists for centuries because they preserve really well, said Milks, a researcher and a leading expert in early wooden tools at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. \u201cSo it\u2019s really nice to be able to enrich our understanding of human evolution by finding these extremely rare objects,\u201d she added.",
      "Researchers have known that early human ancestors would have been also making use of wood to make tools and now there is evidence of very early use, she added.",
      "The tools were found at a site called the Megalopolis Basin in Marathousa, Greece, about 100 miles southwest of the capital, Athens.",
      "Once a lakeshore, it has provided evidence of other early human ancestor activity, including the making and use of stone and bone artifacts, as well as killing of elephants and other animals, according to researchers.",
      "The smaller tool is particularly interesting, Milks said. \u201cWe have never seen anything like it,\u201d she said, adding that they don't fully understand its function. \u201cIt\u2019s just really different, and it\u2019s tiny. We\u2019re lucky that we found it.\u201d",
      "Researchers know that these artifacts are not just pieces of wood by recognizing \u201cspecific marks made by stone tools on the wood itself,\u201d she said. This \u201chelps us to say, OK, that\u2019s not just a stick, that\u2019s something that humans did something with,\u201d she added.",
      "The methods for analysis and identification of ancient wooden tools have really accelerated in the last decade, providing an unprecedented insight into human history, Milks said.",
      "Direct dating of organic materials, like wood, only goes back to 50,000 years ago, so researchers had to rely on dating sediment and rocks from the site itself. This allowed them to conclude that the tools date back to 430,000 years ago.",
      "It\u2019s likely that the unearthed wooden tools were so well preserved because they were very rapidly buried in sediment that remained wet, and kept away from microorganisms that would eat wood away or rot it, Milks said.",
      "Conditions at the site where the tools were found are \u201cexceptional\u201d and allowed for preservation of delicate organic material, including wood but also seeds and leaves, Katerina Harvati, the study's co-author, said in an email Tuesday.",
      "The discovery highlights the importance of Greece and the Megalopolis Basin in particular for human evolution, said Harvati, a paleoanthropologist and expert in human evolution at the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany. It provided \u201ca very rare glimpse\u201d into technology used by early human ancestors that researchers know almost nothing about, she said.",
      "\u201cThey not only push back the temporal timeframe of our knowledge on this technology and expand its geographic range, but also provide new information, in the form of a completely new type of tool, which we record here for the first time,\u201d she added.",
      "Maeve McHugh, associate professor in classical archaeology at England\u2019s University of Birmingham who was not involved in the study, told NBC News the findings are significant, providing an important \u201csnapshot\u201d into the early human ancestor activity that speaks to \u201chow our brains were developing\u201d in that time period.",
      "\u201cThe fact that it\u2019s a wooden object, an organic piece of material \u2014 it\u2019s very rare survival outside of very arid conditions like Egypt, and particularly that it\u2019s so old and so really at the beginning of human or early human history, I think it\u2019s very interesting and important,\u201d she said."

    "summary": "The previous National Defense Strategy \u2013 a document published every four years \u2013 identified China as the most significant strategic competitor to the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Defense Department said in an influential strategy document published Friday that the U.S. military\u2019s top focus is no longer on China but instead the homeland and Western Hemisphere.",
      "The priorities laid out in the 2026 National Defense Strategy, a quadrennial report last published in 2022, diverge significantly from those of the Biden administration, with efforts geared more inward such as securing the border and countering narcotics.",
      "The document says the country is not pursuing an isolationist agenda, but lays out why the U.S. wants allies to do more while the military focuses more on the homeland.",
      "The main focus on the homeland includes a section about the U.S. no longer ceding key terrain in the Western Hemisphere and how the Pentagon will provide President Donald Trump with \u201ccredible options to guarantee U.S. military and commercial access to key terrain from the Arctic to South America, especially Greenland, the Gulf of America, and the Panama Canal.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will ensure that the Monroe Doctrine is upheld in our time,\u201d it adds, referring to the 19th-century foreign policy doctrine that asserts the U.S. sphere of influence extends throughout the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "The No. 2 priority for the Pentagon is now China, which was characterized in the 2022 report as the most significant strategic competitor to the U.S., due in part to Beijing\u2019s territorial claims in the South China Sea and its aggressive behavior toward U.S. allies.",
      "The new report says the U.S. does not seek to \u201cstrangle or humiliate\u201d China, but rather should deter the country \u201cthrough strength, not confrontation.\u201d It says the Pentagon will \u201cprovide the military strength for President Trump\u2019s visionary and realistic diplomacy, thereby setting conditions for a balance of power in the Indo-Pacific that allows all of us \u2014 the United States, China, and others in the region \u2014 to enjoy a decent peace.\u201d",
      "The Pentagon\u2019s third priority is to increase allies\u2019 burden sharing, including Canada and Mexico in the Western Hemisphere and Europeans on their continent. The fourth priority is rebuilding the defense industrial base.",
      "As the Russia-Ukraine war nears the four-year mark, Moscow gets a relatively brief mention in the report. Russia is described as a \u201cpersistent but manageable threat to NATO\u2019s eastern members for the foreseeable future,\u201d and that the Pentagon will ensure that American forces are prepared to defend against Russian threats \u201cto the U.S. Homeland.\u201d",
      "The report comes as Trump struggles to bring an end to a war he repeatedly said he could end on the first day of his second term, or even before he took office. It also comes on the heels of the arrest of Venezuela\u2019s now-deposed president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, by U.S. forces and Trump\u2019s push to acquire Greenland, though he has said he won\u2019t use force to achieve that goal.",
      "Unlike previous National Defense Strategy reports under Republican and Democratic presidents, the 2026 version is overtly political, with a focus on both President Joe Biden and earlier administrations.",
      "\u201cFor too long, the U.S. Government neglected \u2014 even rejected \u2014 putting Americans and their concrete interests first. Previous administrations squandered our military advantages and the lives, goodwill, and resources of our people in grandiose nation-building projects and self-congratulatory pledges to uphold cloud-castle abstractions like the rules-based international order,\u201d the report says.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has decisively changed that, courageously putting Americans first to truly make America great once again,\u201d it says. \u201cWe will be the sword and shield to deter war, with the goal of peace \u2014 but ready to fight and win the nation\u2019s necessary wars if called upon.\u201d"

      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Thermal underwear, Arctic temperatures and days spent in the dark.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, has been plunged into the worst winter energy crisis since Russia launched its full-scale invasion nearly four years ago, as relentless strikes on the country\u2019s energy infrastructure take their toll.",
      "Two weeks after a massive Russian attack obliterated the power grid in the capital and cities across the country, Kyiv\u2019s residents are still in the grip of power and heat blackouts amid a bitter cold snap, with night temperatures last week dipping as low as minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit and remaining below freezing this week.",

      "\u201cYou just lose hope that things can improve,\u201d Kyiv resident and humanitarian worker Nataliia Rychka told NBC News. \u201cSuch a long stretch without power takes away a sense of agency from you \u2014 being able to do very simple things, like making food for yourself, cleaning your home or showering, it\u2019s emotionally difficult.\u201d",
      "Kyiv, like the rest of Ukraine, is not new to rolling outages as Russia pursues a strategy of targeting its energy grid each winter. But the extensive repairs required after the Jan. 9 strike have meant that power has to be cut at random, leaving people in the dark \u2014 literally and figuratively \u2014 about when electricity might come back on."
