      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d remains at the top of the box office in its second weekend in theaters as it pulled in another record haul",
      "The Walt Disney Co.'s animated film \u201cMoana 2\u201d remained at the top of the box office in its second weekend in theaters as it brought in another record haul.",
      "The film added $52 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. That brings its domestic total to $300 million, surpassing the original, and its global tally to a staggering $600 million.",
      "The amount set a record gross for a movie on the weekend following Thanksgiving weekend, unseating \u201cFrozen II,\u201d which earned $35.2 million in the same time frame in 2019. The numbers are not adjusted for inflation. Originally conceived as a Disney+ series, \u201cMoana 2\u201d has already broken into the top five highest grossing releases of the year. Its performance means Disney has three films in this year's top five, including \u201cInside Out 2\u201d and \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine.\u201d The studio also has another big movie on the way before the year ends: Barry Jenkins' \u201cMufasa,\" out Dec. 20.",
      "The weekend also showcased several new releases, including A24\u2019s horror comedy \u201cY2K\u201d and the Jude Law crime thriller \u201cThe Order.\u201d But nothing was ever going to present significant competition to the enticing Thanksgiving leftovers, \u201cMoana 2,\u201d \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II.\u201d",
      "Second place at the box office was occupied by \u201cWicked,\u201d which added $34.9 million, bringing its domestic total to $320.5 million in three weeks. Globally, the musical adaptation released by Universal is at $455.6 million. \u201cGladiator II\u201d followed in third place with $12.5 million, while \u201cRed One\u201d came in fourth with $7 million.",
      "\u201cThese holdovers are going to create the momentum that\u2019s going to put an $8.5 billion-plus box office year on the horizon,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.",
      "Pre-pandemic, $11 billion had become the annual norm for the movie business. Since then, the closest the industry has gotten to that number was last year, which cracked $9 billion. This year started off slow and up to a few months ago, Dergarabedian said, even hitting $8 billion for the year was in doubt. But in the two weeks since Thanksgiving, the deficit from last year has narrowed by over 5%.",
      "The newcomers struggled to make a significant impact. Even the 10th anniversary rerelease of Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cInterstellar,\u201d which played in only 165 theaters, did better than \u201cY2K\u201d ($2.1 million) and \u201cThe Order\u201d ($878,000) combined. Paramount reported that the science fiction epic starring Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway brought in an estimated $4.4 million. IMAX also noted that all the 70mm IMAX presentations of \u201cInterstellar\u201d were sold out through the weekend.",
      "\u201cI was thrilled so many moviegoers took advantage of the original IMAX experience of \u2018Interstellar\u2019 this weekend,\" Nolan said in a statement.",
      "The biggest of the many newcomers was the Indian action pic \u201cPushpa: The Rule \u2013 Part 2,\u201d which earned $4.9 million. Sony and Crunchyroll's anime release, \u201cSolo Leveling \u2013 ReAwakening,\u201d made $2.4 million. Fathom also released pop duo for KING + COUNTRY\u2019s \u201cA Drummer Boy Christmas\u201d concert in theaters where it made $2.1 million.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really diverse marketplace,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cThere's event cinema, international cinema, a re-release of a 10-year-old film. It's easily one of the most eclectic and interesting lineups I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d",
      "Next weekend theaters are in for another influx of bigger movies, with both Sony's comic book film \u201cKraven the Hunter\u201d and the animated \u201cThe Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim\u201d opening in wide release. Awards contenders \u201cNickel Boys\u201d and \u201cSeptember 5\u201d will also open in a limited number of theaters.",
      "Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.",
      "1. \u201cMoana 2,\u201d $52 million.",

      "Celebrities, cultural icons and a few surprise guests are gathering for the annual Kennedy Center Honors celebration in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- Celebrities, cultural icons and a few surprise guests are gathering for the annual Kennedy Center Honors celebration Sunday evening in Washington.",
      "This year's recipients of the lifetime achievement award for artistic accomplishment are director Francis Ford Coppola,the Grateful Dead, jazz trumpeter Arturo Sandoval, and singer-songwriter Bonnie Raitt. In addition, the venerable Harlem theater The Apollo, which has launched generations of Black artists, is being recognized.",
      "There will be personalized tributes with performances and testimonials from fellow artists during the gala at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Medallions were presented during the traditional Saturday night ceremony at the State Department.",
      "The tribute performances are often kept secret from the recipients themselves, most notably in 2018 when Cyndi Lauper flat out lied to her longtime friend Cher about being unable to attend. Lauper appeared on stage to perform Cher's hit, \u201cIf I Could Turn Back Time.\u201d",
      "Several of the latest honorees have themselves participated in past tributes to friends and colleagues at the Kennedy Center.",
      "Coppola spoke during fellow director Martin Scorsese\u2019s induction in 2007. Sandoval performed in the tribute to his mentor, jazz trumpet legend Dizzy Gillespie. Raitt has taken part in tributes to Buddy Guy and Mavis Staples. Raitt even attended the Kennedy Center Honors in the 1970s when her father, Broadway performer John Raitt, was taking part in a tribute to composer Richard Rogers.",
      "The tribute to the Grateful Dead is expected to double as a memorial to the band's founding bass player Phil Lesh, who died in October at age 84.",
      "This could also be the last Kennedy Center Honors ceremony without political intrigue for a while.",
      "During Republican Donald Trump's first four years in office, Kennedy Center officials were forced to walk a public tightrope between the tradition of the president attending the ceremony and the open antipathy toward Trump from multiple honorees. In 2017, recipient Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Trump attended. Trump, who takes office in January, skipped the ceremony for the entirety of his first term.",
      "At a ceremony at the White House before attending the awards event itself, President Joe Biden praised each honoree. He also had an audience member, actor Robert De Niro, stand before declaring, \u201cIf I get in trouble, I\u2019m coming to you pal.\u201d",
      "De Niro grinned and nodded and others in attendance, including the honorees, laughed at what appeared to be a reference to De Niro sometimes playing hardnosed enforcers in movies like \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d But Biden actually meant he might seek the actor\u2019s help for post-presidency career advice.",
      "\u201cThings are not looking good for February,\u201d Biden joked. Then he conceded that he couldn\u2019t sing or dance but suggested he might still find a way to help De Niro\u2019s production company.",
      "The awards show will air on CBS on Dec. 22."

    "story": [
      "Each year, celebrities descend on Morocco to attend the Marrakech International Film Festival, enjoy warm weather, luxurious resorts and laud the power of cinema",
      "MARRAKECH, Morocco -- After the movie \u201cCabo Negro\u201d screened at the Marrakech International Film Festival this week, organizers anticipating backlash whisked its crew away and canceled screenwriter-director Abdellah Taia\u2019s scheduled post-film Q&A.",
      "The film \u2014 selected as one of the festival\u2019s 70 features and approved by authorities to be shot in Morocco \u2014 is a queer tale of two young men spending a summer on a beach in the north of the country.",
      "\u201cI am Moroccan. I am gay. And I always have wanted to put the reality of Moroccan gays in cinema,\u201d Taia said, introducing the film at a screening last week. \u201cThe love that I never got growing up, I invented it; I created it; and I put it in \u2018Cabo Negro\u2019 to give it to today\u2019s Moroccan youth.\u201d",
      "Sixteen years after Taia came out in Moroccan media and 11 years after he released his first film with gay protagonists, the subject of \u201cCabo Negro\u201d isn\u2019t new. Nor was his statement out of step with the actors and directors who similarly laud what movies are capable of at the festival.",
      "Yet the chain of events that followed laid bare some of the tensions animating Morocco\u2019s film industry.",
      "When the Marrakech festival rolls out its red carpet each year, movie stars in attendance find sunny winter weather, luxurious resorts and a venue to laud cinema and its power to change minds. This year\u2019s event wrapped up on Saturday and featured stars such as actor Sean Penn and director Luca Guadagnino. But the image that the festival projects about freedoms in Morocco\u2019s film industry often clashes with censorship and economic realities facing filmmakers.",
      "Such tensions have become paramount for the global film industry as new festivals crop up in countries like Saudi Arabia and China, the world\u2019s second largest entertainment industry.",
      "In Morocco, foreign films with sex scenes can screen at the Marrakech Film Festival without issue, yet normally segments that contain kissing in films such as \u201cTitanic\u201d or \u201cSpiderman\u201d are censored on Moroccan television. Audiences can applaud a film about Iran\u2019s repression of nationwide protests in 2022. But Moroccan journalists and activists critical of the government continue to be sentenced to prison time, including as recently as last month. And Moroccan films like \u201cCabo Negro\u201d may be shown, but homosexuality remains outlawed under Morocco\u2019s penal code.",
      "When a video of Taia\u2019s remarks spread in Moroccan media and on social networks, supporters defended his right to freedom of expression while detractors, including a former prime minister, questioned why films about homosexuality were allowed to be screened at all.",
      "The festival\u2019s French-led management team declined to comment about the \u201cCabo Negro\u201d screening or scrapped Q&A but have previously described the festival as a a platform for the region's filmmakers.",
      "\u201cWhat makes the identity of Marrakech unique is it creates a ... space to have prestigious big names of the industry coming very generously to meet the audience and at the same time giving a strong spotlight on new discoveries,\u201d Remi Bonhomme, the festival\u2019s artistic director, said last week. \u201cWe work with this emerging generation of filmmakers from Morocco, the Arab region and the African continent.\u201d",
      "But some have begun to ask about who and what the festival serves.",
      "\u201cThere are people who think the festival is some \u2018bling bling\u2019 thing only for foreigners, only for the country\u2019s marketing,\u201d said Mariam El Ajraoui, a Moroccan film scholar and Abu Dhabi University professor. \u201cThere are others who think that to support local cinema, you have to look abroad.\u201d",
      "Morocco\u2019s film industry has risen to new heights over the past decade, with movies winning awards at the Cannes Film Festival and productions like \u201cGladiator II\u201d shooting in the country.",
      "Despite growth, it remains relatively small domestically. Morocco projects $11 million worth of tickets will be sold in 2024 \u2014 a sum almost double the box office total from a decade ago. Less than half the tickets sold are for Moroccan films.",
      "Morocco\u2019s film authority has offered $5.9 million in support to 32 films this year, roughly $184,000 per movie. Because it often costs more for movies to make it to the screen, the majority of films seek state or private funds outside Morocco, either in Europe or the Middle East. Such a funding landscape boosts films with narratives that can win approval from Moroccan authorities and also appeal to what western producers think about Morocco.",
      "\u201cYou have to get the money either in Morocco or outside Morocco,\u201d said a producer who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions because his films often apply for state funding.",
      "Films that get necessary funding and authorization often thread a fine line. They take on themes like religion, sexuality and the battle between tradition and modernity, but often subtly and without explicit words in the scripts they submit for film permits.",
      "\u201cIf the CCM is against you, you find funding outside. But you still must shoot the movie in Morocco, so you need the \u2018OK\u2019 from the CCM,\u201d the producer added, using the French acronym for Morocco\u2019s film authority.",
      "Taia\u2019s film \u201cCabo Negro\u201d was a low budget endeavor with no state support, but received authorization from CCM.",
      "\u201cWhy not? If there's a population interested in these films, why deprive them?\u201d said CCM director Abdelaziz El Bouzdaini. \u201cThat's what it's like in Morocco. We're a welcoming country.\u201d",
      "Addressing these social issues wins festival placement, international praise and access to foreign funding. But for others like Taia, addressing those very taboos too directly can risk domestic pushback.",
      "The dynamic can also add difficulty for directors aiming to make comedies, thrillers or crime capers.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sort of paradox that I haven\u2019t been able to explain to myself about how the market works. \u2026 Social films that might be less audience-friendly get a lot more spectators,\u201d director Yasmine Benkiran said on a festival panel on Friday.",
      "Filmmakers whose work centers on social issues, regardless of the level of taboo, say their inspirations are straightforward and argue that the themes they cover are part of Moroccan life.",
      "Director Nabil Ayouch\u2019s film \u201cEverybody Loves Touda,\u201d about the struggles of a Moroccan folk singer who moves from an impoverished village to the country\u2019s largest city, premiered at Cannes, was shown at the festival last week and opens in Moroccan theaters on Dec. 11.",
      "His movies have dealt with radicalization, poverty and sexuality, including \u201cMuch Loved,\u201d a film about prostitutes in Marrakech that Morocco banned in 2015. The country has previously submitted six of his movies to be considered for the Oscars\u2019 Best International Feature award.",
      "In the past, some in Morocco have criticized Ayouch\u2019s choice of topics. But he said in an interview that he was inspired by stories and rarely thought about whether subjects may appeal to audiences in Morocco or the West.",
      "\u201cI am trying to be as frank and sincere as I can be when I\u2019m doing my movies,\u201d Ayouch said. \u201cCommon points in my work are a strong interest in people that we don\u2019t especially want to hear or see because it\u2019s much easier to judge them.\u201d"

      "MILAN -- Milan\u2019s Pinacoteca di Brera museum, conceived under Napoleon as a \u201clittle Louvre,\u201d is finally getting a modern art addition first envisioned more than 50 years ago with the opening Sunday of Palazzo Citterio, home to one of the world\u2019s most important collections of 20th century Italian art.",
      "Completing the project long beset by shifting priorities, periods of neglect and most recently an ill-fated architectural vision was a priority for Brera director Angelo Crespi when he took over in January.",
      "Italy's then-culture minister set Dec. 7 \u2014 the feast day for Milan\u2019s patron St. Ambrose \u2014 as the target opening date, giving Crespi just months to resolve structural issues and oversee the installation of hundreds of modern works of art donated to the Brera decades ago.",
      "On deadline, the current culture minister, Alessandro Giuli, who inherited the project in September, inaugurated Palazzo Citterio on Saturday\u2019s feast day, ahead of the public opening on Sunday.",
      "The accelerated timeline after decades of delays \u201cwasn\u2019t to prove something,\" Crespi told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThere was awareness that it needed to be opened,\" he said. \"The question was not just economic, but also ethical. After 52 years, we couldn\u2019t keep such a beautiful building closed simply because of inertia.\u201d",
      "The Palazzo Citterio opening completes a decades-old vision for a \u201cGrande Brera,\u201d which encompasses also the Pinacoteca and the Braidense National Library, just as it takes on greater heft in the Italian cultural landscape.",
      "From Dec. 2, the Grande Brera also incorporated into its fold Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cLast Supper,\u201d arguably Italy\u2019s most famous masterpiece. The fragile wall mural is located in a church complex a kilometer (half a mile) away from the Pinacoteca and Palazzo Citterio.",
      "The merger creates a system of state-run museums in Milan that boosts Brera\u2019s cachet and gives Crespi significant autonomy in their management, including control over 80% of revenue.",
      "Combined, the \u201cLast Supper,\u201d and the Pinacoteca di Brera, receive 1 million visitors a year, and take in more than 10 million euros ($10.5 million) in revenue, Crespi said. As a single entity, they are among the top 10 most-visited sites in Italy.",
      "Crespi hopes to use this greater visibility to promote other institutes in the Brera complex, including the Academy of Fine Arts, botanical gardens and an observatory, while also pitching Milan \u2014 better known for fashion and finance \u2014 as a city of the arts.",
      "Beside the Grande Brera\u2019s vast collections and the \u201cLast Supper,\u201d masterpieces by Michelangelo, Canova, Caravaggio, Raffaello, Bellini, Piero della Francesca and others are displayed in museums and landmarks within walking distance of Milan's central Duomo cathedral. Yet they are often overlooked by visitors.",
      "\u201cAll of the biggest masterpieces and names who made Italian art great over the centuries are concentrated within a few hundred meters,\u201d Crespi said, adding that as an art city, Milan can rival Florence, Rome and Venice.",
      "The Grande Brera should become \u201cthe motor of this narration of Milan as a city of art,\" he said.",
      "By spring, the Pinacoteca di Brera will be linked to Palazzo Citterio, a few minutes' walk away, by a passageway through the botanical gardens behind the museums.",
      "Inside Palazzo Citterio, visitors are greeted by the monumental late 19th century painting \u201cHuman Flood,\u201d by Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo, intended as a bridge from the Pinacoteca's collection that is rich in Italian Renaissance and Baroque art taken from areas conquered by Napoleon's army.",
      "In the new museum, hundreds of artworks donated to the Brera decades ago by the art collectors Emilio Jesi and Lamberto Vitali form \u201ca manual of Italian contemporary art,\u201d with a particular focus on Giorgio Morandi, said curator Marina Gargiulo.",
      "Jesi, who lived in an apartment in the palazzo, focused his collection on painters who were his contemporaries in the 1930-1960s, most of them Italian artists, with notable exceptions including Picasso.",
      "Vitali's tastes were more eclectic, ranging from archaeological artifacts to Byzantine mosaics and art from the medieval era through the 20th century, with paintings by his friend Morandi and by Modigliani, Gargiulo said.",
      "The new museum also includes a series of 152 miniature self-portraits commissioned by Italian neorealistic screenwriter Cesare Zavattini.",
      "Workers were still installing the permanent collection and an exhibition two days before the public opening, and Crespi said his own staff suggested postponing the opening as the date neared. But he held fast.",
      "\u201cOtherwise, we could have entered in a new loop, with more years of other ideas, other projects. It is the right moment and we need to do it,\u201d Crespi said.",
      "For now, the Palazzo Citterio will be open Thursday-Sunday from 2 p.m.-7 p.m., while the Pinacoteca di Brera is open Tuesday-Sunday from 8:30 a.m. until 7:15 p.m. Reservations are recommended for Leonardo\u2019s Last Supper Museum, open from 8:15 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday-Sunday, with a maximum 40 people admitted every 15 minutes."

      "While the game is the focal point, the alternate broadcast, in some ways, will resemble a three-hour episode of \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d It starts with Homer eating too many hot dogs and having a dream while watching football.",
      "Homer joins the Cowboys in the dream while Bart teams up with the Bengals. Lisa and Marge will be sideline reporters.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the beginning of the story, and the story continues through the entire game until Homer wakes up from his dream at the end of the game. It is like a complete story, and the NFL game will happen in between. It\u2019s just going to be an amazing presentation with tons of surprises,\u201d said Michael \u201cSpike\u201d Szykowny, ESPN\u2019s VP of edit and animation.",
      "This is the second year ESPN has done an alternate broadcast for an NFL game. It used the characters from \u201cToy Story\u201d for last year\u2019s Sunday morning game from London between the Atlanta Falcons and Jacksonville Jaguars.",
      "\u201cThe Simpsons\u201d has featured many sports-themed episodes during its 35 seasons. Even though \u201cHomer at the Bat\u201d remains the consensus favorite sports episode for many Simpsons fans, there have been football ones such as \u201cBart Star\u201d and \u201cLisa The Greek.\u201d There also was a Super Bowl-themed one after Fox\u2019s broadcast of Super Bowl 33 between Denver and Atlanta in 1999.",
      "Even though \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d remains a staple on Fox\u2019s prime-time schedule, it is part of the Disney family after their acquisition of 20th Century Fox in 2019. All 35 seasons are on Disney+.",
      "The show\u2019s creators have worked with ESPN and the NFL to make sure the look and sound is definitely Simpsonsesque.",
      "The theme song is a mash-up of \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d opening and \u201cMonday Night Football\u2019s\u201d iconic \u201cHeavy Action.\u201d",
      "There have also been pre-recorded skits and bits to use during the broadcast featuring Simpson\u2019s legendary voices Hank Azaria, Nancy Cartwright, Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, and Yeardley Smith.",
      "The telecast will be entirely animated, with the players\u2019 movements in sync with what is happening in real-time on the field. That is done through player-tracking data enabled by the NFL\u2019s Next Gen Stats system and Sony\u2019s Beyond Sports Technology.",
      "While Next Gen Stats tracks where players are on the field with a tracking chip in the shoulder pads, there is skeletal data tracking and limb tracking data \u2014 which uses 29 points per player \u2014 to get closer to the player\u2019s movements.",
      "The other data tracking will allow Beyond Sports and Disney to add special characters to the game. For example, there might be a play where Lisa catches the ball and goes 30 yards instead of Cincinnati\u2019s Tee Higgins.",
      "\u201cLisa is much smaller than the rest of the players. So, in real life, the ball would go over her head, but now, with data processing, we can take the ball and make it go exactly into her hands. So for the viewer, it still looks believable, and it all makes sense,\u201d said Beyond Sports co-founder Nicolaas Westerhof.",
      "The other major challenge is making \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d two-dimensional cartoon characters into 3-D simulations. Szykowny and his team worked to make that a reality over the past couple of months.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a big leap of faith for them to say, hey, we trust you to make our characters 3-D and work with it. Our ESPN creative studio team has done a wonderful job,\u201d Szykowny said.",
      "Lisa, Krusty, Nelson, Milhouse and Ralph will be with Bart and the Bengals; while Carl, Barney, Lenny and Moe join up with with Homer and the Cowboys.",
      "The broadcast will also feature ESPN personalities Stephen A. Smith, Peyton Manning and Eli Manning.",
      "ESPN\u2019s Drew Carter, Mina Kimes and Dan Orlovsky will call the game from Bristol, Connecticut, and also be animated. They will wear Meta Quest Pro headsets to experience the game from Springfield using VR technology.",
      "For Kimes, being part of the broadcast and being an animated Simpsons character is a dream come true. She is a massive fan of the show and has a framed photo of Lisa Simpson \u2014 who she said is a personal hero and icon \u2014 as part of her backdrop when she makes appearances on ESPN NFL shows from her home in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have any input, and I didn\u2019t see anything beforehand, so I wasn\u2019t sure if it would look like me, but it kind of does, which is very funny,\u201d said Kimes, who drew Simpsons characters when she was a kid. \u201cTo see the actual staff turn me into one was a dream.\u201d",
      "Even though the Bengals (4-8) and Cowboys (5-7) have struggled this season, Selman thinks both teams have personalities that appeal to \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d universe.",
      "\u201cWe were just so lucky also that the Cowboys are sort of like a Homer Simpson-type team, American team, and Mike McCarthy might be a Homer-type guy, one might imagine,\u201d he said. \u201dAnd then you have Joe Burrow on the other side who is a cool young, spiky-haired, blonde bad boy -- he\u2019s like Bart. And that fits our character archetypes so perfectly.",
      "\u201cIf Homer is mad at Bart and has a hot dog dream while watching \u2019Monday Night Football\u2019, and then it\u2019s basically McCarthy versus Burrow, Homer versus Bart, and that\u2019s the simple father versus son strangling \u2014 Homer strangling Bart dynamic that has been part of the show for 35 years. I don\u2019t know if that would have worked as well if it was like Titans versus Jacksonville. We would have found something. We would have made it work.\u201d",

      "\u201cI had a lot of nerves and I actually think those nerves served me because that is what the adolescent version of that lion is,\u201d Pierre said in an interview Friday at the San Diego Safari Park about his leading role in \u201cMufasa: The Lion King.\u201d He took the reins as the new voice of Mufasa after Jones played the iconic King Mufasa in both the 1994 and 2019 versions of Disney's \u201cThe Lion King.\u201d",

So I felt a lot of space to create because I felt like \u2018Lion King\u2019 is practically a genre of music and there was room to play and find new stuff within it.\u201d",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- A pair of iconic ruby slippers that were worn by Judy Garland in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d and stolen from a museum nearly two decades ago sold for a winning bid of $28 million at auction Saturday.",
      "Heritage Auctions had estimated that they would fetch $3 million or more, but the fast-paced bidding far outpaced that amount within seconds and tripled it within minutes. A few bidders making offers by phone volleyed back and forth for 15 minutes as the price climbed to the final, eye-popping sum.",
      "Including the Dallas-based auction house's fee, the unknown buyer will ultimately pay $32.5 million.",
      "Online bidding, which opened last month, had stood at $1.55 million before live bidding began late Saturday afternoon.",
      "The sparkly red heels were on display at the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids, Minnesota, in 2005 when Terry Jon Martin used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum\u2019s door and display case.",
      "Their whereabouts remained a mystery until the FBI recovered them in 2018. Martin, now 77, who lives near Grand Rapids in northern Minnesota, wasn't publicly exposed as the thief until he was indicted in May 2023. He pleaded guilty in October 2023. He was in a wheelchair and on supplementary oxygen when he was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health.",
      "His attorney, Dane DeKrey, explained ahead of sentencing that Martin, who had a long history of burglary and receiving stolen property, was attempting to pull off \u201cone last score\u201d after an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. But a fence \u2014 a person who buys stolen goods \u2014 later told him the rubies were just glass, DeKrey said. So Martin got rid of the slippers. The attorney didn't specify how.",
      "The alleged fence, Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of the Minneapolis suburb of Crystal, was indicted in March. He was also in a wheelchair and on oxygen when he made his first court appearance.

      "NEW YORK -- A prolonged and closely watched copyright case involving an online library's unauthorized offering of free e-books has ended after the defendant, Internet Archive, decided not to challenge an appeal's court's ruling against it.",
      "In September, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld a Manhattan federal court's decision that found the Archive in violation of copyright law and granted a permanent injunction. The Archive had until this week to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, but declined to do so.",
      "In 2020, four major publishers \u2014 Hachette Book Group, HarperCollins Publishers, John Wiley & Sons and Penguin Random House \u2014 sued the Archive, alleging that it had illegally provided free copies of more than 100 books, including fiction by Toni Morrison and J.D.

Pallante, president and CEO of the Association of American Publishers, said in a statement.",
      "The Archive\u2019s director of library services, Chris Freeland, posted a brief statement on the Archive's web site saying that \u201cWhile we are deeply disappointed with the Second Circuit\u2019s opinion,\u201d they would \u201ccontinue to honor\u201d an agreement to \u201cremove books from lending at their member publishers\u2019 requests.\u201d"

      "A jury on Tuesday found the two remaining defendants in the trial not guilty of racketeering, murder and gang-related charges, though one of them was convicted on a gun charge.",
      "Nine of the defendants, including the rapper Gunna, had accepted plea deals before the trial began, and prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case.",
      "That left a dozen defendants still facing charges after the trial. One pleaded guilty Wednesday after reaching a deal with prosecutors and prosecutors said the same day that they were dropping the charges against six others."

      "\u201cFlow\u201d is quite easily the best animated movie of the year and one of the most poetic ecological parables in recent memory, writes AP Film Writer Jake Coyle in his review",
      "Of all the post-apocalyptic landscapes we've been treated to over the years, none is as beautiful nor peaceful as that of \u201cFlow.\u201d",
      "In Gints Zilbalodis' wondrously shimmering animated fable, a solitary black cat, after escaping a cataclysmic flood, navigates a water world. What brought things to this point is never explained. We're left to look upon this strange, verdant and overgrown landscape through the amber eyes of our unnamed feline protagonist. Humans are completely absent, and it's part of this beguilingly meditative film to wonder not just about what role we played in the flood, but to ponder the grace of the animal life left to inherit the Earth.",
      "As much as I didn't have a wordless Latvian animated movie on my 2024 bingo card, \u201cFlow\u201d \u2014 an expected Oscar contender currently in theaters \u2014 is quite easily the best animated movie of the year and one of the most poetic ecological parables in recent memory. It's an all-audiences movies, and by that, I'm tempted to include not just young and old, but cats and dogs, too.",
      "When the waters rise, the cat encounters a friendly Labrador, a long-legged secretary bird, a dozing capybara and a bauble-hoarding ring-tailed lemur. Cute as they are, they aren't quite your typical animated animals. Part of the allure of \u201cFlow\u201d is seeing animal characters that would normally be anthropomorphized and voiced by celebrity actors \u2014 the lemur, in particularly, has until now been ruled by Sacha Baron Cohen's King Julian of \u201cMadagascar\" \u2014 move and sound authentically.",
      "Well, mostly. Circumstances bring these five together aboard a small sailboat, an ark sans Noah. And while \u201cFlow\u201d doesn't exactly go for realism \u2014 the secretary bird, for instance, proves an especially adept captain in steering the rudder \u2014 it is most decidedly drawn in closer harmony to the natural world than your average animation. Together they sail through mountain tops-turned-islands and an abandoned city with rivers for streets.",
      "That \u201cFlow\u201d is made with computer generated animation adds to its dreamy, curiously real surrealism. Zilbalodis created \u201cFlow\u201d with Blender, the free, open-source graphics software tool. His camera moves less with the prescribed, storyboarded form of traditional animation than as a nimble, roving perspective within a virtual world. That such a natural and sensory movie is made possible by cutting-edge technology is one reason why the dystopic world of \u201cFlow\u201d always feels more hopeful than it ought to.",
      "Another reason is the animals. Though they come from different species and have little means of communication, they together form an odd partnership. The cat is initially wary of each, but they slowly form an evident bond. Their survival hinges on their cooperation, which is occasionally threatened by the self-interest of others (there's a pack of less community-minded dogs) or the cat's own timid reluctance. Staying to face a problem or trust another animal, rather than scampering away, goes against its nature.",
      "In that way, these two- and four-legged creatures, digitally rendered in a human-less future, are both worthy heirs to the planet and furry figures of inspiration for today. Reflections run through \u201cFlow\u201d \u2014 in a mirror clutched by the lemur, in the water the cat peers into \u2014 but none more so than the image of ourselves gazing back at it.",
      "\u201cFlow,\u201d a Sideshow and Janus Films release is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for peril and thematic elements. Running time: 84 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four."

      "Goldberg will help lead the show at The Theater at Madison Square Garden from Dec. 11-Jan. 5. The tour has a deep connection to the first version of the hit show: It is being directed by Jenn Thompson, who at the age of 10 stepped into the role of Pepper in the original Broadway production.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a really beautiful journey. I have a lot of ghosts I got to exorcise and revisit and reclaim,\u201d says Thompson, who for the new show has chipped away at the layers of productions and charted a course back to the original production.",

      "The musical first premiered on Broadway in 1977 and was revived in 1997 and 2012. The 1977 original show won the Tony Award as best musical and ran for 2,300 performances, inspiring tours and revivals that never went out of style. It last played New York on Broadway in 2012-14.",

      "A new documentary chronicles Sudan's 2019 revolution and the period of time immediately after the ouster of military dictator Omar Al-Bashir",
      "MARRAKECH, Morocco -- In the early days of Sudan's 2019 revolution, Shajane Suliman brought sandwiches, coffee and mint tea to demonstrations in closed-off sections of Khartoum. But as hope made way for despair, she decided more than food was needed to nourish the movement.",
      "Public outcry had sprung up against Sudan's longtime military dictator and his mismanagement of the country's economy. Throughout months of demonstrations, hundreds were killed or injured by security forces suppressing protests.",
      "So Suliman donned a gas mask and headed to the streets carrying posters adorned with lines like, \u201cSouls cannot be killed, let alone ideas.\u201d",
      "A continent away, filmmaker Hind Meddeb was finishing \u201cParis Stalingrad,\u201d a documentary about the plight of refugees living in encampments near the edge of the French capital. Sudanese refugees encouraged her to go to Khartoum and film their nascent revolution.",
      "Such is the origin story of \u201cSudan, Remember Us,\" Meddeb's 75-minute documentary being shown in competition at the Marrakech Film Festival this week after screening at festivals in Venice and Toronto.",
      "Sudan, a predominantly Arab country on the edge of sub-Saharan Africa, descended into civil war in 2023, as fighting erupted between the military and a paramilitary group known as the Rapid Support Forces that grew out of Darfur\u2019s notorious Janjaweed militia.",
      "Though estimates are difficult to come by, at least 24,000 people have been killed and millions displaced in a conflict that has largely been eclipsed in the world\u2019s attention by wars in the Middle East and Ukraine.",
      "To Suliman, who ended up as one of its protagonists, the documentary\u2019s purpose is similar to what she wrote on a poster five years ago: an effort to motivate a despairing public years after revolution failed to cement civilian rule.",
      "The revolution, she said, felt like \u201ca piece of heaven\u201d despite the violence, full of music, poetry and optimism about Sudan's future.",
      "\u201cEveryone forgot or lost hope,\u201d Suliman said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s different for us now than when the revolution started. We were together so it was easy. Now we need to change how we want to continue.\"",
      "\u201cSudan, Remember Us\u201d begins with a series of voice messages to Meddeb from April 2023, the month that civil war broke out. Activists describe their feelings of shock and disbelief about how what U.N. officials have called a \u201cforgotten war\" has ruined life and made their country unrecognizable.",
      "Mostly, it brings viewers to 2019, the year that Sudan's military ousted President Omar al-Bashir, paving the way for power-sharing and a short-lived transitional government led by generals and civilians.",
      "Largely shot on a handheld camera in a country that has at times blocked the internet, banned foreign news channels and arrested its own journalists, the movie is both a story of collective hope and a feat of reportage.",
      "Meddeb\u2019s observational approach and lingering on poems differs from gripping streaming-friendly protest documentaries such as Jehane Noujaim\u2019s \u201cThe Square\u201d (2013), Evgeny Afineevsky\u2019s \u201cWinter on Fire\u201d (2015) or Kiwi Chow\u2019s \u201cRevolution of Our Times\u201d (2021). She captures a revolution documentary\u2019s requisite images \u2014 the chaos and terror as well as solidarity and joy of demonstrators facing off against security forces.",
      "But the movie aims for a different kind of storytelling.",
      "A former France 24 journalist, Meddeb gravitated toward documentary for the breathing room it offered to let stories unfold in an unpredictable way, she said in an interview.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very spontaneous film. I was diving into what was happening and and filming what was inspiring me,\" she said at the Marrakech Film Festival.",
      "What she found and was inspired by was a country described as a \u201cland of literature\u201d and a revolution in which women played a central role.",
      "The protests rendered in the documentary pulsate with drums beating at marches and through the rhythm of poems recited at sit-ins. Meddeb takes the audience from phone camera-filmed street fighting to underground cafes to the Nile River as young people discuss their hopes for Sudan.",
      "\u201cThe revolution was a time of beautiful feelings and projects,\u201d one woman says after security forces killed more than 100 people in a June 2019 massacre. \u201cIt made you want to take part. A painting, a poem, anything to bring people together.\u201d"

      "The parents of a 14-year-old Missouri boy who fell to his death from a Florida amusement park ride has won a $310 million verdict against the attraction's Austrian builder",
      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- The parents of a 14-year-old Missouri boy who fell to his death from an Orlando amusement park ride in 2022 have won a $310 million verdict against the attraction's Austrian builder.",
      "Late Thursday, the Orange County jury ordered that the manufacturer Funtime pay $155 million each to Tyre Sampson's parents, Nekia Dodd and Yarnell Sampson. He died on March 24, 2022, after falling 70 feet (21 meters) from the Orlando Free Fall ride at Icon Park. The trial lasted only a day as Funtime never appeared in court to defend itself.",
      "Icon Park, which rented the ride's space to Orlando Slingshot, the ride's owner and operator, had already settled with Sampson's family for an undisclosed amount.",
      "\u201cThe jury\u2019s decision confirms what we have long argued: Tyre\u2019s death was the result of blatant negligence and a failure to prioritize safety over profits,\u201d the family's lawyers, Ben Crump and Natalie Jackson, said in a statement. \u201cThe ride\u2019s manufacturers neglected their duty to protect passengers, and (Thursday's) outcome ensures they face the consequences.\"",
      "The family will now have to seek an order from an Austrian court to collect the damages.",

The company's website shows that it manufactures thrill rides that throw, drop and spin passengers at high speeds and from tall elevations, including attractions named Vomatron, Sling Shot and Chaos Pendle.",
      "Sampson, a football standout who stood 6 foot, 2 inches tall (1.9 meters) and weighed 380 pounds (172 kilograms), was visiting Orlando on spring break from the St. Louis area when he went with friends to the downtown amusement park.",
      "They rode the Orlando Free Fall, which placed 30 riders in seats attached to a tower, secured them with a shoulder harness and then dropped them 430 feet (131 meters). It didn't have seat belts, something most drop rides have as an additional safety measure.",
      "Because of Sampson's size, the harness didn't lock properly and he was ejected from his seat when the ride braked 70 feet from the ground.",
      "His parents argued that Orlando Slingshot and Funtime should have warned their son about the risks of someone his size going on the ride and didn\u2019t provide an appropriate restraint system. Adding seat belts would have cost $660.",
      "The state ordered the ride closed after the accident and it never reopened. It is now being demolished.",

      "\u201cI was shaking,\u201d the viola leader recalled of that day in Prague\u2019s Rudolfinum. \u201cHe smiled at me and from this moment, I knew that I can do it. He told me very nice words after \u2014 he told me that this is exactly what my viola section needs.\u201d",
      "Celebrating the end of the 100th anniversary Year of Czech Music, an event held every decade in the year ending in 4, Bychkov is conducting through pain in leading the Czech Philharmonic on a North American tour to New York and Toronto.",
      "He had lumbar decompression surgery in September after finishing the new production of Wagner\u2019s \u201cTristan und Isolde\u201d at the Bayreuth Festival and the 72-year-old was limping slightly at Carnegie Hall this week, holding a podium railing and music stands for support as he walked on and off stage.",

Bed\u0159ich Smetana was born in 1824 and died in 1884, Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek was born in 1854 and Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k died in 1904. Bychkov's tour programs features that trio plus Gustav Mahler, born in what is now the Czech Republic.",

      "\u201cThey were still playing from the original parts. I mean, you can hardly see the notes,\u201d he said.",
      "Bychkov caused panic in the orchestra when he introduced a new critical edition.",

      "Bychkov was born in Leningrad to Jewish parents and his family left Russia for Vienna in 1974, then settled in the U.S. one year later.

So she yelled and the police was just outside,\u201d Bychkov said, adding he quickly was released. \u201cWhat would they do with me in the end? It wasn\u2019t political. I was not an agent of foreign influence.\u201d",
      "A few weeks after his Berlin debut, Bychov returned to the Philharmonie when Eugen Jochum canceled, and Bychkov met van Karajan for the first time.",
      "\u201cAt some point he said, `So you\u2019re in Grand Rapids now?\u2018\u201d Bychkov remembered. \u201cI said, yes, I\u2019m in Grand Rapids. I said, this is my Ulm, because that was the place that he started, and he laughed like crazy. He said, `You\u2019re so right. A few years of that and you\u2019re ready for anything.\u2018\u201d",
      "Bychkov succeeded Rudel as music director of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra from 1985-89. He then took similar roles at the Orchestre de Paris from 1989-98 and the WDR Symphony Orchestra in Cologne, Germany, from 1997-2010.",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- Some of the elderly residents of seven Louisiana nursing homes who were sent in 2021 to ride out Hurricane Ida in a crowded, ill-equipped warehouse are being offered shares of a nearly $9 million settlement after they sued.",
      "Retired state judge William \u201cRusty\u201d Knight told The Times-Picayune of New Orleans that all the 427 former residents who filed legal claims are being sent letters outlining the proposed settlement. Knight said amounts differ based on patients' individual circumstances.",

      "Authorities said conditions at the warehouse deteriorated rapidly after the powerful storm hit on Aug. 29, 2021. They found ill and elderly bedridden people on mattresses on the wet floor, some crying for help, some lying in their own waste. Civil suits against Dean\u2019s corporation said the ceiling leaked and toilets overflowed at the sweltering warehouse, and there was too little food and water.",
      "Within days after the storm hit, the state reported the deaths of seven of the evacuees, five of them classified as storm-related.",
      "By the time Dean was arrested on state charges in June 2022, he had lost state licenses and federal funding for his nursing homes. Dean pleaded no contest to 15 criminal counts in July and was sentenced to three years of probation, paying $258,000 in restitution and more than $1 million as a penalty.",
      "Last month, Dean agreed to pay $8.2 million to the federal government to settle allegations that he misused assets and income from four nursing homes whose loans were insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Prosecutors say he funneled nursing home money to his personal bank accounts, using the money to buy antiques, guns and cars.",
      "But Dean also faced civil lawsuits or legal claims from 427 of the 843 patients who were taken to Independence, or their surviving relatives. Many of the plaintiffs and their lawyers have suggested Dean was hiding other assets.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no true justice after what my clients endured,\u201d attorney Matthew Hemmer, who represents hundreds of nursing home victims, told WVUE-TV.",
      "Knight said he knows of 165 of Dean's former residents who have died since the evacuation, and he said he expects to learn more people have died as responses to the settlement offer are returned."

      "Nearly four days after the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, police still did not know the gunman\u2019s name or whereabouts or have a motive for the killing. Investigators were looking at whether the shooter may have been a disgruntled employee or client of the insurer, Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told reporters.",
      "The FBI announced Friday night it was offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction.",
      "Video of the gunman fleeing Wednesday\u2019s shooting showed him riding a bicycle into Central Park and later taking a taxi to a bus terminal that offers commuter service to New Jersey and Greyhound routes to Philadelphia, Boston and Washington, D.C, according to Kenny.",
      "Police have video of the man entering the bus station but no video of him exiting, leading them to believe he left the city, Kenny said.",
      "Investigators on Friday found a backpack in the park that had been worn by the gunman during the shooting, police said, following a massive sweep to find it in a vast area with lakes and ponds, meadows, playgrounds and woods.",
      "Police didn\u2019t immediately reveal what, if anything, it contained but said it would be analyzed for clues.",
      "The gunman made sure to conceal his identity with a mask during almost all of his time in the city, including during the attack and while he ate, yet left a trail of evidence in view of the nation\u2019s biggest city and its network of security cameras.",
      "The gunman arrived in New York City on Nov. 24 and shot Thompson 10 days later outside his company\u2019s annual investor conference at a hotel just blocks from Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center.",
      "The gunman got off a bus that originated in Atlanta and made several stops along the way, Kenny said. Police have not determined where he got on the bus. Investigators have a list of passengers, but none of them would have had to provide an ID when they climbed aboard, Kenny said.",
      "Investigators believe the suspect used a fake identification card and paid cash, Kenny said, when he checked in at the hostel, which has a caf\u00e9 along with shared and private rooms and is blocks from Columbia University.",
      "Investigators have tested a discarded water bottle and protein bar wrapper in a hunt for his DNA. They also were trying to obtain additional information from a cellphone found along the gunman\u2019s escape route.",
      "Photos of the suspected shooter that were taken in the lobby of a hostel on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side appear to from the only time he removed his mask, Kenny said. The images, showing a man smiling in the lobby of the HI New York City hostel. They are among a collection of photos and video circulated since the shooting \u2014 including footage of the attack, as well as images of the suspected gunman at a Starbucks beforehand.",
      "\u201cFrom every indication we have from witnesses, from the Starbucks, from the hostel, he kept his mask on at all times except for the one instance where we have him photographed with the mask off,\u201d Kenny said.",
      "His roommates at the hostel also said he didn\u2019t speak to them. Nothing of investigative value was found in a search of the suspected shooter\u2019s hotel room.",
      "Asked how close he felt police were to making an arrest, Kenny said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t \u2018Blue Bloods.\u2019 We\u2019re not going to solve this in 60 minutes. We\u2019re painstakingly going through every bit of evidence that we can come across. Eventually, when an apprehension is made, we will have to present all of these facts to a judge and jury, so we\u2019re taking our time, doing it right and making sure we\u2019re going to get justice for this victim and closure for his family.\u201d",
      "Security video of the shooting shows the killer approaching Thompson from behind, firing several shots with a gun equipped with a silencer, barely pausing to clear a jam while the executive fell to the sidewalk.",
      "Police were looking into the possibility that the weapon was a veterinary pistol, which is a weapon commonly used on farms and ranches if an animal has to be euthanized quietly, Kenny said \u2014 though he stressed that hadn\u2019t been confirmed.",

A law enforcement official previously told The Associated Press the words were \u201cdeny,\u201d \u201cdefend\u201d and \u201cdepose.\u201d The messages mirror the phrase \u201cdelay, deny, defend,\u201d which is commonly used by lawyers and critics about insurers that delay payments, deny claims and defend their actions.",

      "\u201cAnd then you know the CEO of this company you pay a lot of money to gets $10 million dollars a year, you won\u2019t have a lot of sympathy for the guy,\" Maristela said, citing Thompson's compensation package that included base pay and stock options. \u201cHealth care is a business, I understand, but the obsession with share price, with profit, has to be reevaluated.\u201d",
      "University of Pennsylvania researcher Michael Anne Kyle said she's not surprised by the growth of conversation around insurers.",
      "\u201cPeople are often struggling with this by themselves, and when you see someone else talk about it, that may prompt you to join the conversation,\u201d she said.",
      "Kyle studies how patients access care and said she's seen frustration with the system build for years. Costs are rising, and insurers are using more controls such as prior authorizations and doctor networks to manage them. Patients are often stuck in the middle of disputes between doctors and insurers.",
      "\u201cPatients are already spending a lot of money on health care, and then they\u2019re still facing problems with the service,\u201d she said.",
      "Insurers often note that most of the money they bring in goes back out the door to pay claims, and that they try to corral soaring costs and the overuse of some care.",
      "In Ohio, Anderson said his initial reaction to the CEO shooting was to question whether it was connected to a coverage denial, like the ones he'd experienced with his wife.",
      "\u201cI definitely do not condone killing people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I read it and said, 'I wonder if somebody had a spouse whose coverage was denied.\u2019\u201d",
      "It's something Will Flanary, a Portland-based ophthalmologist and comedian with a large social media following, saw online a lot in the shooting's immediate aftermath and found very telling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s zero sympathy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the lesson to take away from that is not, \u2018Let\u2019s shame people for celebrating a murder.\u2019 No, it\u2019s: \u2018Look at the amount of anger that people have toward this system that\u2019s taken advantage of people and do something to try to fix that.\u2019\u201d",
      "Flanary's content, published under the name Dr. Glaucomflecken, started out as niche eye doctor jokes and a way to cope with his own experiences with two cancer diagnoses and a sudden cardiac arrest. But it has evolved, featuring character skits that call attention to and satirize the decisions of large health insurers, including UnitedHealthcare.",
      "He said he's never seen conversations around health insurance policy take off the way they did this week \u2014 and he hopes these new voices can help bring about change.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always talking about how powerful social media can be with advocacy,\" he said, \"because it really is the only way to put a significant amount of pressure on these corporations who are doing bad things for patients.\u201d",

      "The Hospital de Jesus in Mexico City\u2019s bustling historic center covers most of a city block",
      "MEXICO CITY -- In Mexico City\u2019s bustling historic center, the Hospital de Jesus covers most of a city block. Its faded unassuming yellow facade, characteristic of the middle of the last century, obscures the medical center within founded 500 years ago by Spanish conqueror Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s.",
      "Entering between street-level shoe stores, visitors find the oldest continuously operating hospital in the Americas. Stone arches lead to expansive patios filled with lush vegetation.",
      "The hospital was founded to treat the conquering Spanish, then later opened to the local Indigenous inhabitants to ensure a healthy workforce. Today it provides 24/7 emergency care, as well as affordable access to medical specialists for current residents of what was at the time of its founding the center of the Aztec empire.",
      "\u201cYou can feel the Mexican heritage here,\u201d said Dr. Pedro \u00c1lvarez S\u00e1nchez. \u201cFor 500 years, the hospital has never closed its doors.\u201d",
      "On Nov. 8, 1519, Cort\u00e9s and his soldiers entered Tenochtitlan, the Aztec name for the capital, and met Aztec emperor Moctezuma in a place known as Huitzilan, just in front of the present-day hospital.",
      "Cort\u00e9s had conquered the city by 1521, and to honor that original encounter, he founded the hospital in 1524.",
      "The meeting of Cort\u00e9s and Moctezuma is depicted in a floor-to-ceiling tile mural beside one of the central patios. The main temple of Tenochtitlan \u2014 only a few blocks from the hospital \u2014 sits in the background. The union of two suns represents the meeting of two cultures.",
      "Cort\u00e9s is buried in a small church adjacent to the hospital. Descendants of him and Moctezuma met here in 2019 to mark the anniversary of that initial encounter.",
      "Around the world, only a handful of hospitals can boast such longevity. For example, St. Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital in London founded in 1123 and Bellevue Hospital in New York City founded in 1736 also continue to provide full medical services.",
      "Much of the hospital has remained intact thanks to a board of trustees founded in the 16th century. Over the years, countless doctors have quietly worked to conserve the hospital\u2019s mission of affordable care and to preserve the building\u2019s unique architectural features.",
      "\u201cWe want to ensure that this hospital continues to provide quality medical attention to patients,\u201d said Dr. Octaviano Rosalez Seraf\u00edn, 71, president of the hospital\u2019s board of trustees. \u201cWe want to continue the tradition of care the hospital has had for years.\u201d",
      "Celia Ch\u00e1vez Escamilla, 56, arrived at the hospital at dawn recently for an appointment with her dermatologist. \u201cHere they take good care of us,\u201d said Ch\u00e1vez. \u201cThe prices here are accessible. If you go somewhere else it\u2019s too expensive.\u201d Her consultation was just 400 pesos or under $20.",
      "Escamilla was accompanied by her daughter Myriam Rafael Sanchez, 26, who was fascinated by the medical center. \u201cI\u2019ve seen (the hospital) a lot in movies and TV shows,\u201d she said excitedly. \u201cWe have all of Mexico\u2019s history around us.\u201d",
      "The hospital didn\u2019t always serve the entire public, according to Sandra Elena Guevara Flores, an anthropologist focusing on medicine at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.",
      "Guevara said the hospital was not open to the Indigenous population initially, but only to the Spanish who had recently arrived in the Americas.",
      "However, as epidemics began to spread, the hospital opened its doors to more patients. \u201cIt was a strategy by the Spanish governors in the new Spain to treat the whole population,\u201d said Guevara. \u201cIt (was) so the servants and the whole labor system wouldn\u2019t die.\u201d",
      "Early Spanish doctors at the hospital often used native Mexican herbs to cure their patients. \u201cIt\u2019s said that traditional Galenic Hippocratic medicine was used in the hospital, but really it was Indigenous medicine,\u201d said Guevara. \u201cThey (Indigenous peoples) would share their knowledge.\u201d",
      "The Spanish imprint can be seen in the hospital\u2019s architecture, said Hugo Antonio Arciniega \u00c1vila, a historian and archaeological expert from the National Autonomous University of Mexico.",
      "The hospital, like some other colonial structures in Mexico City, is \u2018encapsulated\u2019 inside a newer building from the 1950s.",
      "Because the Spanish built low stone structures on huge lots with massive stone walls, people who wanted to build newer facilities a century or two later would often just build over, around or among the colonial-era structures. Sometimes they would incorporate the old masonry walls into the new building, either for preservation reasons or because it was cheaper to use them than to tear them down. So from the street, there is often no sign that behind a Victorian or functionalist facade, there is a partially preserved Spanish structure within.",
      "The hospital was built in the form of a T, with two large patios and a grand staircase devised by Spanish architect Claudio de Arciniega in the 16th century. The design provided constant ventilation and sunshine to patients. The architect also included a chapel on each of the two original floors.",
      "\u201cThe architecture of this hospital is fascinating,\u201d said Arciniega about the intentional layout of religious spaces and access to open air. \u201cIf you cure the soul, you can cure the body \u2013 it\u2019s the same way the doctors thought.\u201d",
      "For the 67-year-old \u00c1lvarez, who has worked at the hospital for nearly 50 years and also serves as the board of trustees\u2019 treasurer, the center has been a constant in his life. He began working at the hospital as a lab assistant at age 18.",
      "\u201cA lot of people ask me, why do you keep working at the Hospital de Jesus?\u201d he said. \u201cI tell them because I love it.\u201d",

    "summary": "Planned Parenthood wanted to resume offering abortions in several Missouri clinics on Friday, immediately after the state's new constitutional amendment rolling back a near total ban took effect",
    "story": [
      "Planned Parenthood wanted to resume offering abortions in several Missouri clinics on Friday, immediately after the state's new constitutional amendment rolling back a near total ban took effect",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Planned Parenthood wanted to resume offering abortions in several Missouri clinics on Friday, immediately after a newly passed constitutional amendment rolling back the state\u2019s near-total ban took effect, but they remain on hold as a complicated court battle drags on.",
      "The issue is that the amendment does not specifically override any state laws. And even before the end of Roe v. Wade enabled Missouri's Republican-led legislature to approve a near-total ban, the state's numerous restrictions left it with just one abortion clinic, in St. Louis.",
      "Missouri\u2019s Republican attorney general says many of those old laws \u2014 like a 72-hour waiting period \u2014 should still be enforced despite the amendment; Planned Parenthood says they shouldn't.",
      "Prosecutors are caught in the middle. They want a preliminary injunction halting enforcement of the old laws while attorneys argue about what to do.",
      "But so far, Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang hasn't acted on that request.",
      "\u201cAs of today, Missourians have an unrealized constitutional right,\u201d said Emily Wales, president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood Great Plains in a written statement. \"They are entitled to access abortion under the state\u2019s constitution, and every day they cannot get that care here at home, their rights are being violated.\u201d",
      "Here is what to know about the complicated legal battle and the state of abortion access:",
      "Missouri is one of five states where voters approved ballot measures in November adding the right to an abortion to their state constitutions. Ultimately approved by almost 52% of voters, it guarantees people\u2019s right to make decisions about their reproductive health, such as whether to get an abortion, take birth control or get in vitro fertilization.",
      "While the amendment is widely understood to prevent the state from restricting abortions up to the point of viability, abortion-rights advocates must persuade judges to prevent old regulations from being enforced.",
      "\u201cThere were certainly people who thought the issue was decided after the vote \u2014 that we would have access,\" Wales said Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ve had patients calling for weeks now saying, \u2018Can I get in? Can I stay close to home?\u2019 Of course, that\u2019s not true.\u201d",
      "Reproductive rights activists are also suing to dismantle Arizona's 15-week abortion ban that conflicts with the fundamental right to abortion voters approved.",
      "Maryland's new abortion rights amendment won't make an immediate difference, since the state already allows access to abortion. It's a similar situation in Montana, where abortion is already legal until viability. Colorado's measure enshrined already-existing access and undoes an earlier amendment that prohibited state and local government funding for abortion, opening the possibility of state Medicaid and government employee insurance plans covering care.",
      "The day after voters approved Missouri's amendment, the two Planned Parenthood branches asked a judge to find the state\u2019s near-total ban and most of its other abortion regulations unenforceable.",
      "Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey has already conceded that most abortions are now legal. He issued an opinion last month, stating that he will not enforce Missouri\u2019s ban on abortions before viability.",
      "But his office is still fighting to keep a 72-hour waiting period before an abortion can be performed; bans on abortions based on race, sex or a possible Down syndrome diagnosis; and a requirement that medical facilities that provide abortions be licensed as ambulatory surgical centers, among other regulations.",
      "This patchwork of old laws is a big problem for abortion providers. They say those restrictions had effectively blocked abortions across most of the state even before Missouri enacted a law banning all abortions except in cases of medical emergency, minutes after Roe was toppled.",
      "\u201cWe have already been living in a post-Roe world,\u201d Dr. Iman Alsaden, the medical director of the Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said at the time.",
      "But Missouri Solicitor General Josh Divine has defended these laws, arguing that most women regret their abortions and that the requirements are designed to give them the time to think through their decisions.",
      "\"What we are trying to do is create a situation where women can in fact make the choice they want to do \u2014 and we know that most of the time that is childbirth,\u201d Divine said after a court hearing Wednesday.",
      "Wales, of Planned Parenthood, said Missourians showed at the ballot box that they value reproductive rights. And she expressed frustration with what she described as \"an Attorney General\u2019s office that has made clear it will fight tooth and nail to prevent Missourians from accessing their new constitutional right to reproductive freedom.\u201d",

      "The U.S. government has ordered testing of the nation\u2019s milk supply for bird flu to better monitor the spread of the virus in dairy cows",
      "The U.S. government on Friday ordered testing of the nation's milk supply for bird flu to better monitor the spread of the virus in dairy cows.",
      "Raw or unpasteurized milk from dairy farms and processors nationwide must be tested on request starting Dec. 16, the Agriculture Department said. Testing will begin in six states \u2014 California, Colorado, Michigan, Mississippi, Oregon and Pennsylvania.",
      "Officials said the move is aimed at \u201ccontaining and ultimately eliminating the virus,\" known as Type A H5N1, which was detected for the first time in March in U.S. dairy cows. Since then, more than 700 herds have been confirmed to be infected in 15 states.",
      "\u201cThis will give farms and farmworkers better confidence in the safety of their animals and ability to protect themselves, and it will put us on a path to quickly controlling and stopping the virus\u2019 spread nationwide,\u201d Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement.",
      "The risk to people from bird flu remains low, health officials said. Pasteurization, or heat treatment, kills the virus in milk, leaving it safe to drink.",
      "Veterinarians, farmers, scientists and academics have been calling for nationwide milk testing for months, said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, who led the efforts.",
      "\u201cIt's another step in the right direction,\u201d Poulsen said. \u201cThey're coming around that we need a better handle on it.\u201d",
      "Dairy farmers and processors across the U.S. have been reluctant to test animals or milk for the virus, fearing economic or other repercussions. Jamie Jonker, chief science officer of the National Milk Producers Federation, said the industry supports USDA efforts to eliminate the virus.",
      "Under the federal order, dairy farmers and those who handle raw milk intended for pasteurization must provide samples of the milk on request for testing for bird flu. It requires reporting of positive tests to the USDA and it requires herd owners to provide basic information to allow tracing of the disease in cattle.",
      "The move follows an April 24 federal order that mandated testing of certain dairy cattle before they could move between states and required reporting of any positive tests. Despite that order, the virus has continued to spread, Poulsen noted.",
      "Raw milk from infected cows contains high loads of live virus, testing has shown.",
      "At least 58 people in the U.S. have been infected with bird flu, mostly farm workers who became mildly ill after close contact with infected cows, including their milk, or infected poultry.",
      "Bird flu has also been spreading among wild birds and a number of other animals.",
      "Federal officials continue to warn against drinking raw milk, which can contain a host of germs that make people sick. In California, officials quarantined a farm and halted distribution of milk after bird flu virus was detected in raw milk sold in stores. Raw Farm of Fresno issued a voluntary recall of raw milk and cream produced after Nov. 9.",

      "Weighted blankets are a popular choice to warm up in cold weather, but research on their effectiveness is limited",
      "NEW YORK -- Rhonda James was skeptical when her husband ordered a weighted blanket for her online. But five minutes after she wrapped it around her body, she zonked out.",
      "\u201cIt felt like a really big hug,\u201d said James, a banker in Charleston, South Carolina.",
      "As outside temperatures grow chilly, weighted blankets can be a popular choice to warm up. Some people say the added pressure helps them soothe the worries of the day and get to sleep faster.",
      "But research on the effectiveness of weighted blankets is limited. Here's what to know.",
      "Weighted blankets come with extra heft in the form of glass beads, pellets, cotton or another filling. Scientists haven\u2019t studied exactly how the blankets work, but they have a few ideas.",
      "The blankets\u2019 firm touch may calm the brain's fight-or-flight response, said Dr. Neal Walia, a sleep medicine expert at UCLA Health.",
      "\u201cThe evenly distributed weight on you tells your body, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re in a calm environment,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "The extra pressure also may signal the brain to release what\u2019s called the love hormone, also known as oxytocin. It\u2019s produced during bonding and cuddling, and can also lower anxiety, Walia said.",
      "For most healthy adults, experts say to choose a blanket that is about 10% of their body weight. So a 150-pound person may opt for a 15-pound blanket.",
      "Weighted blankets are not recommended for babies or toddlers since they can hinder movement and breathing.",
      "People with sleep apnea, sleep-related disorders or respiratory problems should check with a doctor before using a weighted blanket.",
      "The blankets aren't for everyone and each person gets the best out of their blanket differently. For example, some may find them too hot to use during warmer months.",
      "And the extra swaddling comes at a cost: quality weighted blankets can range from $50 to over $300 depending on the size, weight and material.",
      "James takes hers out of the closet to unwind when she\u2019s watching TV or sipping a glass of wine.",
      "Lucy Taylor, a freelance writer from Wales, uses her blanket to fall asleep when her anxiety spikes during the winter.",
      "\u201cIf my body\u2019s relaxed, my mind follows suit,\u201d she said.",
      "There isn't a ton of research on whether weighted blankets actually work, and the studies that do exist are on small groups. Most studies don't focus on the average sleeper. Instead, they investigate whether weighted blankets can help people with chronic sleep problems, mental health conditions or developmental disorders.",
      "There are some hints that weighted blankets can help with anxiety, chronic pain and sleep. But the research isn't conclusive.",
      "A study on 120 people with insomnia found that the weighted blankets helped them sleep better compared to a light blanket. Another study on 67 children with autism found the weighted blanket didn\u2019t affect their sleep at all \u2013 but the children and their parents preferred it to a regular blanket.",
      "And a third study on 94 adults with chronic pain found that a heavier weighted blanket didn\u2019t affect sleep, but was better at reducing pain compared to a lighter one.",
      "Even though there\u2019s not yet strong evidence to back up the benefits of weighted blankets, sleep experts say there\u2019s no harm in giving them a try if you're willing to splurge.",
      "Dr. Daniel Barone, a sleep medicine expert at Weill Cornell Medicine, suggests it to his patients after other traditional therapies and medicines.",

      "A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat",
      "A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat. Researchers found at higher temperatures and humidity, the heat kills far more young people under 35 than those older than 50.",
      "For decades, health and weather experts have warned that the elderly and the youngest children were most vulnerable in heat waves. But this study looking at all deaths in Mexico from 1998 to 2019 shows that when the combination of humidity and temperature reach uncomfortable levels, such as the mid to upper 80s Fahrenheit (around 30 degrees Celsius) and 50% relative humidity, there were nearly 32 temperature-related deaths of people 35 years old for every temperature-related death of someone 50 and older.",
      "The study in Friday's journal Science Advances shows an especially surprising spike of heat-related deaths in an age group thought to be young and robust: People between 18 and 35. That age group alone had nine times as many temperature-related deaths as those older than 50.",
      "Study authors and outside experts are scrambling to figure out why. Demographics alone don't explain why more young adult Mexicans are dying in high heat than their elders. Two theories: Outdoor workers who can't escape the heat, and young people who don't know their limits.",
      "The trend is likely to widen as the world warms from human-caused climate change, according to computer simulations run by the study team.",
      "\u201cWe found that younger people are especially vulnerable to humid heat,\u201d study co-author Jeffrey Shrader, a climate economist at Columbia University, said. \u201cAs the climate warms, we're really going to be shifting the burden of temperature-related mortality towards younger individuals and away from older individuals who tend to be more vulnerable to cold temperatures.\u201d",
      "Data from cold weather shows more than 300 deaths of Mexican residents 50 and older for every young person dying from cold temperatures, according to the study.",
      "\u201cPeople of all ages are increasingly at risk from the rising temperatures, and this study shows that those that we might have considered relatively safe from heat-related adverse health outcomes might not be so much so,\u201d said Marina Romanello, executive director of the Lancet Countdown that monitors health effects of climate change. She was not part of the study team.",
      "\u201cHeat is a much more dangerous silent killer than most people acknowledge it to be, and that heat is increasingly putting our health and survival at risk,\" Romanello said in an email.",
      "Study authors decided to examine weather-related deaths in Mexico because that country not only has detailed mortality data, but it has a variety of different climates making it an ideal place to study in depth, Shrader said.",
      "Researchers also want to figure out whether this is just a situation in Mexico or other warmer sections of the globe have similar spikes in young adult deaths in high heat and humidity.",
      "Initially the team just wanted to look at deaths and what scientists call wet-bulb globe temperatures, but when they looked at age differences, they were surprised and looked in more detail, Shrader said. Wet-bulb temperature, which is intended to mirror how the body cools itself, is derived using a complicated measurement system that factors in humidity and solar radiation. A wet-bulb globe temperature of 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) is thought to be the limit for human survivability. Most places don\u2019t reach that level.",
      "Researchers determined temperature-related mortality by complex statistical analysis that compares numerous factors in the number of deaths and removes everything they can except temperature fluctuations, said study co-author Andrew Wilson, a Columbia climate economics researcher.",
      "Researchers also calculated the ideal temperature for when there are the fewest excess deaths at each age group. Younger adults' sweet temperature spot is about nine degrees Fahrenheit (five degrees Celsius) cooler than it is for older people, Shrader and Wilson said.",
      "Some outside health and climate experts were initially puzzled at the higher youth mortality seen in the study. Co-author Patrick Kinney, a professor of urban health and sustainability at Boston University, said it was likely the study included a higher proportion of outdoor workers exposed to heat than prior studies did.",
      "Study co-author Tereza Cavazos, a climate scientist at the Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education in Mexico, said she remembers her father's generations taking siestas in the high heat of the day and that was healthy. That doesn't happen so much now, she said.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of population that is vulnerable in the future. Not even in the future, right now,\u201d Cavazos said.

      "\u201cHigh humidity makes it a lot harder for the body to cool itself through sweating \u2013 which is how our body primarily stays cool,\" said Dr. Renee Salas, an emergency medicine physician and climate change expert at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

      "\"All efforts are underway to identify the cause of the illness, understand its modes of transmission and ensure an appropriate response as swiftly as possible,\u201d the WHO Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, said in a statement.",
      "The symptoms include fever, headache, cough and anemia. Epidemiological experts from the National Rapid Response Team are in the region to take samples and investigate the disease.",
      "Authorities in Congo have so far confirmed 71 deaths, including 27 people who died in hospitals and 44 in the community in the southern province of Kwango, Health Minister Roger Kamba said Thursday.",
      "The deaths were recorded between Nov. 10 and Nov. 25 in the Panzi health zone of Kwango province. There were around 380 cases, almost half of which were children under the age of 5, according to the minister.",
      "The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded slightly different numbers, with 376 cases and 79 deaths. The discrepancy was caused by problems with surveillance and case definition, the head of the Africa CDC, Jean Kaseya, said.",
      "\u201cFirst diagnostics are leading us to think it is a respiratory disease,\u201d Kaseya said. \u201cBut we need to wait for the laboratory results.\u201d",
      "The Panzi health zone, located around 435 miles (700 kilometers) from the capital Kinshasa, is in a remote part of Kwango province, making it hard to access.",
      "It took the epidemiological experts two days to get there, Congo's health minister said. Because of the lack of testing capacity, samples had to be taken to Kikwit, more than 500 kilometers away, said Dieudonn\u00e9 Mwamba, the head of the National Institute for Public Health.",
      "Mwamba said that Panzi was already a \u201cfragile\u201d zone, with 40% of its residents experiencing malnutrition. It was also hit by an epidemic of typhoid fever two years ago, and there is currently a resurgence of seasonal flu across the country.",
      "Oscar Kazwa, a resident of Panzi, said his 28-year-old daughter died two weeks ago from the mystery disease.",
      "\u201cShe had a high fever, coughing, vomiting and was very weak.\u201d Kazwa said. \u201cAs there was no adequate care, she died.\"",
      "WHO experts are joining the National Rapid Response Team in Panzi to support the response to the outbreak. The team, which includes epidemiologists and clinicians, will deliver medicines and sample kits to help identify the cause of the disease. It will also collaborate with community leaders to enhance surveillance and promote infection prevention.",
      "Since late November, a local WHO team has been helping Kwango\u2019s health authorities with disease surveillance, the organization's statement said.",
      "While Kamba said he was not aware of any reports of the disease in health zones other than Panzi, the WHO said in its statement Friday that the disease has been reported in seven of the 30 health zones in Kwango province."

      "LONDON -- An alternative healer who advocated \u201cslapping therapy\u201d to treat a range of maladies was sentenced Friday to 10 years in prison for the death of a 71-year-old diabetic woman who stopped taking insulin during one of his workshops.",
      "Hongchi Xiao, 61, was convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence for failing to get medical help for Danielle Carr-Gomm as she howled in pain and frothed at the mouth during the fourth day of a workshop in October 2016.",
      "Xiao, of Cloudbreak, California, promoted paida lajin therapy, getting patients to slap themselves repeatedly to release \u201cpoisonous waste\u201d from the body. The technique has its roots in Chinese medicine, but critics say it has no scientific basis and patients often end up with bruises, bleeding \u2014 or worse.",
      "Carr-Gomm was one of two of Xiao\u2019s patients who died.",
      "He was extradited from Australia, where he had been convicted of manslaughter after a 6-year-old boy died when his parents withdrew his insulin medication after attending one of his workshops in Sydney.",

      "Bright said Xiao only made a \u201ctoken effort\u201d to get Carr-Gomm to take her insulin once it was too late and had shown no sign of remorse as he continued to promote paida lajin in prison.",
      "Carr-Gomm was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 1999 and was desperate to find a cure that didn't involve injecting herself with needles, her son, Matthew, said.",
      "She sought out alternative treatments and had attended a previous workshop by Xiao in Bulgaria a few months before her death in which she also became seriously ill after ceasing her medication.",
      "However, she recorded a video testimonial, calling Xiao a \u201cmessenger sent by God\u201d who was \u201cstarting a revolution to put the power back in the hands of the people to cure themselves and to change the whole system of healthcare.\"",
      "Xiao had congratulated Carr-Gomm when she told other participants at the English retreat that she had stopped taking her insulin.",
      "By day three, Carr-Gomm was \"vomiting, tired and weak, and by the evening she was howling in pain and unable to respond to questions,\u201d prosecutor Duncan Atkinson said.",
      "A chef who wanted to call an ambulance said she deferred to those with holistic healing experience.",
      "\u201cThose who had received and accepted the defendant\u2019s teachings misinterpreted Mrs. Carr-Gomm\u2019s condition as a healing crisis,\u201d Atkinson said."

      "Democrats in Michigan are pressing to pass reproductive health care legislation before the party loses its majority with the new legislative session next year",
      "LANSING, Mich. -- Michigan Democrats are pushing this month to pass legislation they say will improve reproductive health care, in particular the safety of digital health data, ahead of Republicans taking over the state House in 2025.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is backing a bill designed to protect reproductive health data including data logged on menstrual cycle tracking apps. Similar legislation that has passed in other states is aimed at keeping the data from being used to target people seeking abortions.",
      "\u201cThis feels like a very urgent need for us to get this done while we have a window in Michigan with the Democratic majority for the next few weeks,\u201d said state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, sponsor of the digital privacy bill.",
      "The rush is a reaction to expectations that it will be harder to pass the reproductive health care policies Democrats favor after Republicans take control of the state House in January. Democrats kept control of the state Senate in the November election.",
      "Republicans have opposed the digital privacy bill over a section they say will stifle anti-abortion advertising.",
      "Other reproductive health bills to be considered during the December session that began Tuesday include a package on Black maternal health and an expansion of access to birth control.",
      "After the overturn of Roe v. Wade, some women in states with strict abortion bans began to worry that their health information could be used to track their reproductive status. Apps that track menstrual cycles became a major focus point.",
      "Abortion is constitutionally protected in Michigan. But McMorrow does not trust President-elect Donald Trump's campaign promise to veto any possible national abortion ban nor his campaign's efforts to distance itself from Project 2025, which proposed a rollback on abortion and contraception access.",
      "Period tracking apps allow women to take detailed day-by-day notes about their health, from how heavy their period flow is to additional symptoms such as cramping. They can log pregnancies and miscarriages.",
      "\u201cThese tools are really valuable,\u201d McMorrow said. \u201cI just want to make sure that the guardrails are there when indications from the incoming federal administration is they would potentially weaponize the data in a way that is very dangerous.\u201d",
      "Federal law bars medical providers from sharing health data without a patient\u2019s consent but doesn\u2019t prevent digital tech companies from tracking menstrual cycles or an individual\u2019s location and selling it to data brokers. Legislation for federal bans have never gained momentum, largely because of opposition from the tech industry.",
      "How the legislation works varies from state to state. Washington state has digital privacy law that broadly covers all health-related data while Virginia has a law that explicitly prohibits the issuance of search warrants, subpoenas or court orders for electronic or digital menstrual health data.",
      "Michigan\u2019s proposal would require businesses or organizations to use reproductive health data only for the services it provides, and consumers must be informed of how the data is being used. In order to sell that data, an entity would need explicit, signed consent from the consumer. Consumers would also have the option to opt out from their data being sold at any time.",
      "It would also regulate retailers, who often compile data to target consumers with advertisements, and the use of geofencing, which allows marketers to target consumers with ads based on their location.",
      "The bill would prohibit identifying who is receiving reproductive health care by using location information and targeting them with advertisements. This would apply to people visiting fertility or abortion clinics.",
      "The geofencing provision of the bill has drawn objection from anti-abortion advocates. Genevieve Marnon, legislative director for Right to Life of Michigan, said in committee testimony Tuesday that the bill would prevent women visiting an abortion clinic from being reached by anti-abortion ads.",

Phone calls to numbers listed for the company and emails seeking comment went unanswered.",
      "The outbreak appeared to be Klebsiella oxytoca, a multidrug-resistant bacteria. It was first detected in November at three government hospitals and one private one in the State of Mexico, on the outskirts of Mexico City.",
      "The department said the children appeared to have died from a blood infection.",
      "So far, of 20 possible cases, the bacteria was ruled out in one case, suspected in four and confirmed in 15 cases. Of the 19 patients, 13 died and the six others are being treated at hospitals.",
      "Asked about the cluster of cases, President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday that health officials \"told me about a case yesterday, but let's say, it's under control.\u201d",
      "It was the latest public blow to Mexico\u2019s tottering, underfunded health care system. Last week, the director of the country\u2019s flagship national cardiology institute said the hospital didn\u2019t have money to buy essential supplies, calling the situation \u201ccritical.\u201d",
      "Dr. Jorge Gaspar, the hospital's director, wrote an internal letter saying that budget cuts \u201chave affected the acquisition of supplies necessary for the institution's functioning.\u201d In a subsequent public letter the next day, he clarified that the initial message was intended for an \u201cinternal\u201d audience and assured the public that \u201cwe are working to solve the situation.\u201d",

      "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield would have used \"physician work time values,\" which is published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, as the metric for anesthesia limits; maternity patients and patients under the age of 22 were exempt. But Dr. Jonathan Gal, economics committee chair of the American Society for Anesthesiologists, said it's unclear how CMS derives those values.",

It's not clear how many states in total would have been affected, as notices also were posted in Virginia and Colorado.",
      "People across the country registered their concerns and complaints on social media, and encouraged people in affected states to call their legislators. Some people noted that the policy could prevent patients from getting overcharged.",
      "Gal said the policy change would have been unprecedented, ignored the \u201cnuanced, unpredictable human element\u201d of surgery and was a clear \u201cmoney grab.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incomprehensible how a health insurance company could so blatantly continue to prioritize their profits over safe patient care,\u201d he said. \"If Anthem is, in fact, rescinding the policy, we\u2019re delighted that they came to their senses.\u201d",
      "Prior to Anthem's announcement Thursday, Connecticut comptroller Sean Scanlon said the \u201cconcerning\u201d policy wouldn't affect the state after conversations with the insurance company. And New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in an emailed statement Thursday that her office had also successfully intervened.",

      "Efforts to reduce the nation\u2019s persistently high maternal mortality rates involve state panels of experts that investigate and learn from each mother\u2019s death",
      "Efforts to reduce the nation's persistently high maternal mortality rates involve state panels of experts that investigate and learn from each mother's death.",
      "The panels \u2014 called maternal mortality review committees \u2014 usually do their work quietly and out of the public eye. But that's not been the case recently in three states with strict abortion laws.",
      "Georgia dismissed all members of its committee in November after information about deaths being reviewed leaked to the news organization ProPublica. Days later, The Washington Post reported that Texas' committee won\u2019t review cases from 2022 and 2023, the first two years after the state banned nearly all abortions. In Idaho, the state let its panel disband in 2023 only to reinstate it earlier this year.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve become more of a lightning rod than they were before,\u201d said epidemiologist Michael Kramer, director of the Center for Rural Health and Health Disparities at Mercer University in Georgia.",
      "Here\u2019s what maternal mortality review committees across the nation do and what might happen next:",
      "\u201cMaternal mortality review committees are important because they are the most comprehensive source of information about maternal mortality that we have,\u201d said David Goodman, who leads the maternal mortality prevention team at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The panels review deaths that occur during pregnancy or within a year after it ends, whether directly related to the pregnancy or not. Causes of death can range from hemorrhage during childbirth to drug overdoses to traffic accidents.",
      "The goal, Kramer said, is to examine maternal deaths and help \"decide what we can do about them.\u201d",
      "All states, a few cities and Puerto Rico have these committees. Their membership varies and may include OB-GYNs, maternal-fetal medicine doctors, nurses, midwives, mental and public health experts and members of patient advocacy groups. Most have representatives from several areas of expertise, which the CDC recommends.",
      "How members are selected also varies; people may apply, submit letters of interest or be invited to serve.",
      "The selection shouldn\u2019t be politically motivated, Kramer said, because \u201cif there\u2019s a systematic exclusion of certain data or certain perspectives\u201d it\u2019s difficult to truly understand what\u2019s happening.",
      "First, the panels work with state vital statistics offices and epidemiologists to identify deaths associated with pregnancy by examining death certificates and looking for a pregnancy checkbox or a related cause of death. They may also search for links to birth and fetal death records, or delve into hospital discharge data, media reports and obituaries.",
      "Once they identify cases, they collect as much information as possible, such as prenatal care records, hospital and social service records, autopsy reports and interviews with family members. Professional \u201cabstractors\u201d distill all this into case narratives, which committee members pore over. Most use a standardized review process developed by the CDC \u2014 and all panels can get help and guidance from the agency.",
      "They consider questions such as: Was the death pregnancy-related? What was the underlying cause? Was it preventable? What factors contributed?",
      "States generally have privacy rules that protect committee members and people who provide information on the deaths.",
      "The groups then issue public reports that don\u2019t name moms or hospitals but include overall findings, trends and recommendations. Some come out a couple of years or more after the deaths.",
      "Across the nation in 2023, Goodman said, 151 recommendations from those reports were implemented by communities, hospitals, medical professionals and policymakers.",
      "Georgia will rebuild its committee through a new application process, the state public health commissioner said.",
      "Texas' committee has been reviewing 2021 deaths and will start on 2024 cases at its next meeting, Texas Department of State Health Services spokesperson Lara Anton said in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cReviewing cases is a lengthy process and legislators have asked for more recent data. Starting the next review cycle with 2024 cases will allow us to provide that in the next report,\u201d Anton said, adding that maternal and child health epidemiologists will continue to analyze and publish data for 2022 and 2023.",
      "In Idaho, the reconstituted review committee now falls under the state board of medicine, which licenses doctors, instead of the state's health and welfare department. It will operate like it always has, said Bob McLaughlin, spokesperson for the medical board. Members met for the first time in November and plan to issue a report by Jan. 31. Because the legislature wanted the most up-to-date information, McLaughlin said the first report will cover only 2023 cases, and the group will review 2022 deaths next.",
      "Goodman said he\u2019s encouraged that every state has a review committee now \u2014 only 20 had them in 2015.",

      "The deaths were recorded between Nov. 10 and Nov. 25 in the Panzi health zone of Kwango province. There were around 380 cases, almost half of which were children under the age of five, according to the minister.",
      "The Africa CDC recorded slightly different numbers, with 376 cases and 79 deaths. The discrepancy was caused by problems with surveillance and case definition, Kaseya said.",

      "New clues are emerging in the hunt for the masked gunman who stalked and killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, including possible leads about his travel before the shooting and a message scrawled on ammunition found at the crime scene",
      "NEW YORK -- New clues emerged Thursday in the hunt for the masked gunman who stalked and killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, including possible leads about his travel before the shooting and a message scrawled on ammunition found at the crime scene.",
      "The words \u201cdeny,\u201d \u201cdefend\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were found emblazoned on the ammunition, echoing a phrase used by insurance industry critics, two law enforcement officials said Thursday.",
      "The words were written in permanent marker, according to one of the two officials, who were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Investigators also now believe the suspect may have traveled to New York last month on a bus that originated in Atlanta, one of the law enforcement officials said.",
      "Police and federal agents have been collecting information from Greyhound in an attempt to identify the suspect and are working to determine whether he purchased the ticket to New York in late November, the official said.",
      "Police also released new photos Thursday of a person wanted for questioning in connection with Thompson's killing.",
      "The images, showing an unmasked man smiling in the lobby of a Manhattan hostel, add to a collection of photos and video that have circulated since the shooting \u2014 including footage of the attack itself, as well as still frames of the suspected gunman stopping at a Starbucks beforehand.",
      "Thompson, the head of one of the largest U.S. health insurers, died in a dawn ambush Wednesday as he walked from his midtown hotel to the company\u2019s annual investor conference at a Hilton across the street. The reason for the killing remained unknown, but New York City police say evidence firmly points to it being a targeted attack.",
      "The messages on the 9 mm ammunition found at the scene of the shooting mimic the phrase \u201cdelay, deny, defend,\u201d which is commonly used by lawyers and insurance industry critics to describe tactics used to avoid paying claims.",
      "It refers to insurers delaying payment, denying a claim and then defending their actions. Health insurers like UnitedHealthcare have become frequent targets of criticism from doctors and patients for denying claims or complicating access to care.",
      "Investigators also recovered a cellphone from a pedestrian plaza through which the shooter fled. Inside a nearby trash can, they found a water bottle and protein bar wrapper that they say the gunman purchased from Starbucks minutes before the shooting. The city's crime lab is examining those items for DNA and fingerprints.",
      "Investigators were still trying to obtain additional information from the phone Thursday, the law enforcement official said.",
      "A tip that the shooter may have stayed at a hostel brought police Thursday morning to at least two such establishments on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side, according to one of the law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation. The photos made public Thursday were taken in the lobby of the HI New York City hostel.",
      "\u201cWe are fully cooperating with the NYPD and, as this is an active investigation, can not comment at this time,\u201d hostel spokesperson Danielle Brumfitt said in an emailed statement.",
      "Investigators believe the suspect used a fake New Jersey identification card when he checked in at the hostel, said one of the officials who spoke with the AP.",
      "Employees who work at the hostel told investigators they remembered a man who almost always wore a mask when interacting with them or passing by the front desk. That person wore a jacket that looked like the one worn by the man pictured in surveillance images released after the shooting, the official said.",
      "After the shooting, police said the gunman fled on a bicycle and was last seen riding into Central Park.",
      "Members of the public have flooded police with tips \u2014 many unfounded. Police searched a Long Island Rail Road train Wednesday night after a commuter claimed to have spotted the shooter, but they found no sign of the gunman.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re following up on every single tip that comes in,\u201d said Assistant Commissioner Carlos Nieves, a police spokesperson. \u201dThat little piece of information could be the missing piece of the puzzle that ties everything together.\u201d",
      "Based on surveillance video and evidence from the scene, investigators believe the shooter had at least some firearms training and experience with guns and that the weapon was equipped with a silencer, one of the law enforcement officials told the AP.",
      "Investigators were also looking into whether the suspect had pre-positioned a bike as part of an escape plan, the official said.",
      "Security video shows the killer approaching Thompson from behind, leveling his pistol and firing several shots, barely pausing to clear a gun jam while the executive tumbled to the sidewalk. Cameras showed him fleeing the block across a pedestrian plaza before getting on the bicycle.",
      "Police released several images of the man wearing a hooded jacket and a mask that concealed most of his face \u2014 a look that would not have attracted attention on a chilly morning.",
      "Thompson, a father of two sons who lived in a Minneapolis suburb, had been with Minnetonka, Minnesota-based UnitedHealthcare since 2004 and served as CEO for more than three years.",
      "His wife, Paulette, told NBC News on Wednesday that he told her \u201cthere were some people that had been threatening him.\u201d She didn\u2019t have details but suggested the threats may have involved issues with insurance coverage.",
      "The insurer\u2019s parent company, UnitedHealth Group Inc., was holding its annual meeting in New York to update investors on its direction and expectations for the coming year. The company ended the conference after Thompson\u2019s death.",
      "UnitedHealthcare provides coverage for more than 49 million Americans and brought in more than $281 billion in revenue last year. It is the largest provider of Medicare Advantage plans in the U.S. and manages health insurance coverage for employers and state and federally funded Medicaid programs.",

      "Many citizens in Syria's neighboring countries reacted with joy to news Assad was gone. In Jordan\u2019s capital, Amman, resident Muhab al-Majali said his fall marked the end of \u201cunjust and tyrannical rule.\u201d",
      "\u201cI believe that the future is beautiful and prosperous for the Syrians,\u201d he said.",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli forces had \u2014 temporarily, he said \u2014 seized a buffer zone in the Golan Heights established by a 1974 ceasefire agreement, after Syrian troops abandoned their positions.

      "Its decadeslong strategy of building an \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d supporting militant groups and proxies around the region is falling apart. First came the crushing Israeli campaign in Gaza triggered by the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Iranian-backed Hamas.",
      "That war spawned another in Lebanon, where Israel has mauled Iran\u2019s most powerful ally, Hezbollah, even as Israel has launched successful airstrikes openly inside of Iran for the first time.",
      "And now Iran\u2019s longtime stalwart ally and client in Syria, President Bashar Assad, is gone. As dawn broke Sunday, rebel forces completed a lightning offensive by seizing the ancient capital of Damascus and tearing down symbols of more than 50 years of Assad's rule over the Mideast crossroads.",
      "Ali Akbar Velayati, a key adviser to Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, once called Assad and Syria \u201cthe golden ring of the resistance chain in the region.\u201d",
      "\u201cWithout the Syrian government, this chain will break and the resistance against Israel and its supporters will be weakened.\u201d",
      "That break in the chain is literal. Syria was an important geographical link that allowed Iran to move weapons and other supplies to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Its loss now further weakens Hezbollah, whose powerful arsenal in southern Lebanon had put Iranian influence directly on the border of its nemesis Israel.",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s deterrence thinking is really shattered by events in Gaza, by events in Lebanon and definitely by developments in Syria,\u201d a United Arab Emirates senior diplomat Anwar Gargash said at the International Institute for Strategic Studies\u2019 Manama Dialogue in Bahrain.",
      "Iran still holds the card of its nuclear program. Though it denies that intention, it can use the potential for building a weapons capability to cast a shadow of influence in the region.",
      "\u201cIran remains a critical regional player,\u201d Gargash said. \u201cWe should use this moment to connect and speak about what\u2019s next in my opinion.\u201d",
      "Only a few years ago, the Islamic Republic loomed ascendant across the wider Middle East. Its \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d was at a zenith.",
      "Hezbollah in Lebanon stood up against Israel. Assad appeared to have weathered an Arab Spring uprising-turned-civil war. Iraqi insurgents killed U.S. troops with Iranian-designed roadside bombs. Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels fought a Saudi-led coalition to a stalemate.",
      "Syria, at the crossroads, played a vital role.",
      "Early in Syria\u2019s civil war, when it appeared Assad might be overthrown, Iran and its ally, Hezbollah, rushed fighters to support him \u2014 in the name of defending Shiite shrines in Syria. Russia later joined with a scorched earth campaign of airstrikes.",
      "The campaign won back territory, even as Syria remained divided into zones of government and insurgent control.",
      "But the speed of Assad\u2019s collapse the past week showed just how reliant he was on support from Iran and Russia \u2013 which at the crucial moment didn\u2019t come.",
      "Russia remains mired years after launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. For Iran, international sanctions over its advancing nuclear program have ground down its economy.",
      "For Israel, breaking Iran\u2019s regional network has been a major goal, though it is wary over jihadi fighters among the insurgents who toppled Assad. Israel on Sunday moved troops into a demilitarized buffer zone with Syria by the Israel-held Golan Heights in what it called a temporary security measure.",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Assad's fall a \u201chistoric day,\" saying it was \u201cthe direct result of our forceful action against Hezbollah and Iran, Assad\u2019s main supporters.\u201d",
      "Iran\u2019s theocratic rulers long touted their regional network to Iranians as a show of their country\u2019s strength, and its crumbling could raise repercussions at home \u2014 though there is no immediate sign of their hold weakening. Anger over the tens of billions of dollars Iran is believed to have spent propping up Assad was a rallying cry in rounds of nationwide anti-government protests that have broken out over recent years, most recently in 2022.",
      "The loss of Syria does not mean the end of Iran\u2019s ability to project power in the Mideast. The Houthi rebels continue to launch attacks on Israel and on ships moving through the Red Sea \u2014 though the tempo of their attacks have again fallen without a clear explanation from their leadership.",
      "Iran also maintains its nuclear program. While insisting it enriches uranium for peaceful purposes, Western intelligence agencies and the International Atomic Energy Agency say Iran had an organized nuclear weapons program until 2003.",
      "The head of the IAEA also warned Friday that Iran is poised to \u201cquite dramatically\u201d increase its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium as it has started cascades of advanced centrifuges.",
      "\u201cIf Iran would develop nuclear weapons, that would be a great blow to the international nonproliferation regime,\u201d said Thanos Dokos. Greece\u2019s national security adviser, in Bahrain.",
      "There remains a risk of wider attacks in the region, particularly on oil infrastructure. An attack in 2019 initially claimed by the Houthis but later assessed by experts to have been carried out by Iran temporarily halved Saudi Arabia\u2019s production of oil.",
      "\u201cIf, as a result of escalation, there are attacks against the energy infrastructure of Iran or Saudi Arabia, that would be bad news for the global oil supply,\u201d Dokos warned.",

      "The reopening ceremonies for Notre Dame were as much a celebration of people as they were a rejoicing of the cathedral\u2019s resurrection from fire",
      "PARIS -- The reopening ceremonies for Notre Dame were as much a celebration of people as they were a rejoicing at the cathedral's resurrection from fire.",
      "Outside, the Catholic faithful shivered and prayed in the cold and the rain \u2014 and yet were ecstatic and said they wouldn't rather have been anywhere else.",
      "Inside, fire officers proudly soaked up a standing ovation from the congregation and French President Emmanuel Macron's thanks from a grateful nation.",
      "Largely unheralded, workers and artisans who resurrected skills from medieval times made it all possible, laboring day and night to meet what had seemed an impossible five-year deadline set by Macron to get Notre Dame back on its feet.",
      "From 340,000 donors, big and small, 846 million euros (US$895 million) poured in from more 150 countries after the 2019 inferno to fund the rebuild.",
      "Together, all those who helped and all those who prayed proved that it's the people who cherish and venerate buildings like Notre Dame that keep them alive, making them more than inanimate examples of human history, architecture, and culture.",
      "Hear what some of those people had to say this weekend about Notre Dame's journey from darkness to light and their role in it.",
      "For Corinne Lo Sardo, who works for Air France and lives in the Paris region, Notre Dame \"is a woman. Untouchable.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe represents the verb \u2018to love,'\u201d the 57-year-old said, standing outside in the cold. \"I venerate the stones, I venerate the history, I venerate what she represents.'",
      "She spoke about the April 15, 2019, fire and the pain it caused her as though it was yesterday.",
      "\u201cI was on the floor, as if I was being whipped by the flames. I was crying,\u201d she said. \"We weren't sure she would survive.\"",
      "Unable to take part in the invite-only inaugural Mass on Sunday, Lo Sardo followed the service on a giant screen outside, seemingly oblivious to the rain pattering on her umbrella and the finger-numbing December chill.",
      "\u201cI absolutely wanted to be here for her resurrection, braving winds, rain, cold \u2014 no matter,\u201d she said. \u201cShe lives again, she is reborn.\u201d",
      "\"Impossible.\" That was American carpenter Hank Silver's first thought when he joined the reconstruction effort \u2014 in a workshop in Normandy, northern France, that was working on the rebuild of cathedral's huge roof that burned.",
      "\u201cI saw the pile of oak logs at our workshop, I started laughing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had 600 logs just for our part in the nave.\"",
      "Yet, working with hand tools and woodworking techniques that medieval-era carpenters pioneered in building Notre Dame more than 800 years ago, the job got done.",
      "\u201cThe way I see it, a cathedral is a perpetual job site,\" 42-year-old Silver said. \"Maybe we\u2019re part of the same crew, in a way, as those guys 800 years ago. It\u2019s just been kind of an unbroken, ongoing process.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that, broadly speaking, we have saved the building.\u201d",
      "When Ouaziz Abrous was hired after the blaze to work as a fire-safety officer on the reconstruction site, Notre Dame was \u201cin a catastrophic state,\u201d he recalled.",
      "The fire-savaged shell had gaping holes in its vaulted ceilings and there were \u201cashes everywhere,\" he said.",
      "Among the 2,500 people who filled the newly resplendent cathedral for Saturday's first reopening ceremony, Abrous stood out, not only because of his bright workman's jacket and crackling walkie-talkie but because of the grin on his face.",
      "\u201cEverything is grandiose, everything is exceptional, everyone is happy, you see the joy on people's faces,\" he said. \"The Christian faithful have waited five years for this day and now the cathedral is theirs.",
      "\u201cEight thousand people played their part, each of them leaving their own little touch,\u201d he added. \u201cFor us, it's an extraordinary satisfaction.\u201d",
      "In the rebuild, cutting-edge fire safety systems have been installed, with thermal cameras, smoke detectors, and water-misting equipment to prevent a similar catastrophe in the future.",
      "\u201cIf in 2019 they'd had the measures we have today, it wouldn't have burned,\u201d Abrous said. \u201cFor five years, we protected it like a crystal glass \u2014 24 hours a day.\"",
      "While working as a carpenter on the rebuild, 39-year-old Martin Lorentz decided that when the work was finished, he'd like to get married in Notre Dame.",
      "Now, he can.",
      "\u201cThe idea came to me when I was working at cutting the biggest pieces of wood for the choir,\" he said. \"I thought why not? Our love is great and the cathedral is great.\u201d",
      "He wrote to Archbishop Laurent Ulrich, who approved the idea. The date's not yet set but he and his fianc\u00e9e attended the first Mass on Sunday.",
      "Based in the south-western French region of Dordogne, Lorentz mostly worked on the wooden framework of the choir and in the rafters of Notre Dame itself, amid the scaffolding, machines and bustle.",
      "\u201cIt was a great adventure,\u201d he said. \"Now it\u2019s so beautiful, so clear and brand-new.\u201d",

      "A short-lived martial law decree by South Korea's leader last week raised worries about budding authoritarianism around the world",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- In an era of rising authoritarianism, at the heels of a six-hour martial law decree that unfolded while many South Koreans slept, something noteworthy happened: Democracy held.",
      "The past week in Seoul, officials and academics warn, is what a threat to democracy looks like in 2024. It's a democratically-elected president declaring martial law over the nation he leads, asserting sweeping powers to prevent opposition demonstrations, ban political parties and control the media. It's members of the military attempting to block lawmakers from exercising their power to vote on cancelling the power grab.",
      "And here's what it took to defeat President Yoon Suk Yeol 's lurch toward government by force:",
      "Unified popular support for democracy. Legislators storming the National Assembly past midnight, live-streaming themselves climbing over fences. A politician grabbing at a soldier's rifle and yelling \u201cAren't you ashamed?\u201d until he retreated. And finally, decisively, Parliament assembling a quorum and voting unanimously to cancel martial law.",
      "It was a victory for a hard-won democracy \u2014 and for the idea that checks and balances among branches of government must work to counteract each other's ambitions, as the American founders wrote in the Federalist Papers in 1788.",
      "But as the drama played out in Seoul, the scaffolding of democracy rattled around the world.",
      "In other countries, the grab for power might have worked. Other would-be authoritarians might have been better prepared than Yoon.",
      "In deeply polarized societies \u2014 the United States, for example, where Republicans are staunchly loyal to president-elect Donald Trump \u2014 there might not have been decisive support from the public or the opposition. The military might have used force. And the members of the legislature might not have voted as one to snuff out the attempted takeover.",
      "\u201cPresident Yoon's attempt to declare martial law reveals the fragility of the rule of law in divided societies, especially those with governments in which the chief executive cannot be easily dismissed by the legislature,\" said Tom Pepinsky, a government professor at Cornell University who studies backsliding among democracies in Southeast Asia.",
      "Notably, he said in an email, \u201cNo members of President Yoon\u2019s own party were willing to defend his actions in public.\"",
      "Nevertheless, Yoon\u2019s surprise attempt to impose martial law revealed both the fragility and resilience of the country\u2019s democratic system.",
      "Within three hours of his stunning announcement to impose military rule \u2014 claiming the opposition was \u201cparalyzing\u201d state affairs \u2014 190 lawmakers voted to cancel his actions. In so doing, they demonstrated the strength of the country\u2019s democratic checks and balances.",
      "Yoon\u2019s authoritarian push, carried out by hundreds of heavily armed troops with Blackhawk helicopters and armored vehicles sent to the National Assembly, harked back to an era of dictatorial presidents. The country\u2019s democratic transition in the late 1980s came after years of massive protests by millions that eventually overcame violent suppressions by military rulers.",
      "Civilian presence was again crucial in shaping the events following Yoon\u2019s late night television announcement on Tuesday. Thousands of people flocked to the National Assembly, shouting slogans for martial law to be lifted and Yoon to step down from power. There were no reports of violent clashes as troops and police officers.",
      "\u201cWe restored democracy without having a single casualty this time,\u201d said Seol Dong-hoon, a sociology professor at South Korea\u2019s Jeonbuk National University.",
      "It\u2019s virtually impossible for any leader of a democracy to pull off a transition toward martial law without a public willing to support it, or at least tolerate it.",
      "Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, attracted millions of views as he began live-streaming his journey to the National Assembly, pleading for people to converge to the parliament to help lawmakers get inside. The shaky footage later shows him exiting his car climbing over a fence to get onto the grounds.",
      "The vote at the National Assembly was also broadcast live on the YouTube channel of Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik, who also had to scale a fence to get in.",
      "Yoon\u2019s sense of crisis clearly wasn\u2019t shared by the public, whose opinions, Seol said, were shaped predominantly by the shocking videos broadcast to their devices.",
      "\u201cUltimately, democracy is all about moving public opinion,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat was most crucial in this case was that everything was broadcast live on smartphones, YouTube and countless other media.\u201d",
      "Opposition lawmakers are now pushing to remove Yoon from office, saying he failed to meet the constitutional requirement that martial law should only be considered in wartime or a comparable severe crisis \u2014 and that he unlawfully deployed troops to the National Assembly.",
      "On Saturday, an opposition-led impeachment motion failed after most lawmakers from Yoon\u2019s party boycotted the vote. Yet the president\u2019s troubles persist: The vote\u2019s defeat is expected to intensify nationwide protests and deepen South Korea\u2019s political turmoil, with opposition parties preparing to introduce another impeachment motion when parliament reconvenes next Wednesday.",
      "Han Sang-hie, a law professor at Seoul\u2019s Konkuk University, said the martial law debacle highlights what he sees as the most crucial flaw of South Korea\u2019s democracy: that it places too much power in the hands of the president, which is easily abused and often goes unchecked.",
      "Political scientists call what happened in South Korea an \u201cautogolpe\u201d \u2014 a \u201cself-coup\u201d \u2014 defined as one led by incumbent leaders themselves, in which an executive takes or sponsors illegal actions against others in the government. Yoon qualifies because he used troops to try to shut down South Korea's legislature.",
      "Self-coups are increasing, with a third of the 46 since 1945 occurring in the past decade, according to a study by researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and Penn State University. About 80% of self-coups succeed, they reported.",
      "In 2021, a power grab by Tunisian President Kais Saied raised similar concerns around the world after the country designed a democracy from scratch and won a Nobel Peace Prize after a largely bloodless revolution.",
      "In the United States, some have expresed worry about similar situations arising during the second administration of Donald Trump. He has vowed, after all, to shake some of democracy's pillars. He's mused that he would be justified if he decided to pursue \u201cthe termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution.\u201d That\u2019s in contrast to the oath of office he took in 2017, and will again next year, to \u201cpreserve, protect and defend the Constitution\u201d as best he can.",

      "BERLIN -- Adam Pemble, an Associated Press video journalist who covered some of the biggest global news of the past two decades, from earthquakes and conflicts to political summits and elections, has died. He was 52.",
      "Pemble died Thursday in Minneapolis surrounded by friends and family, according to his friend Mike Moe, who helped care for him in the final weeks of his fight against cancer.",
      "Known for bringing stories alive with his camera, Pemble epitomized the best of television news traditions, casting a curious and compassionate lens onto the lives of the people and communities whose stories he told.",
      "He joined the AP in 2007 in New York before moving to Prague in 2011 to help launch AP\u2019s first cross-format operation combining photography, text stories and video. He enhanced Eastern European news coverage, creating distinctive stories highlighting the region's culture and society.",
      "\u201cAdam was an incredibly talented and passionate journalist and an empathetic storyteller. He had this amazing ability to get anyone to talk to him on camera, which I attribute to the Midwestern charm he embodied throughout his life.\" said Sara Gillesby, AP\u2019s Director of Global Video and Pemble\u2019s former manager in New York when he joined the AP. \"He was the best of us.\u201d",
      "Pemble was born in Saint Louis Park, Minnesota, in 1972 and grew up in Minneapolis. After graduating with a degree in mass communications from Minnesota State University Moorhead, he started his journalism career in 1997 at KVLY, a television station in Fargo, North Dakota, and later worked at WCCO in Minneapolis.",
      "\u201cHe had the skills of the old-school camera people to meet a deadline and turn a beautiful story,\u201d said Arthur Phillips, a cameraman who worked with Pemble at WCCO. \u201cBut he had a calling for greater things.\u201d",
      "Moving to New York, Pemble covered some of the biggest stories in the city, including the trial of Bernie Madoff, interviews with former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and with then-real estate developer, now U.S. president-elect, Donald Trump.",
      "He went to Haiti to cover the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake, where he captured shocking images of devastation. A few weeks later he was in Vancouver, covering the Winter Olympics.",
      "With his transfer to Prague, Pemble quickly became the go-to video journalist deployed to the biggest news events in Europe, interviewing government leaders, covering violent protests, the aftermath of terror attacks and numerous national elections across the continent.",
      "\u201cAn inquiring mind, a keen eye and a healthy skepticism for those in power who tried to spin away from truth all combined to make Adam\u2019s stories as rich in color as he was in character,\" said Sandy MacIntyre, former AP head of global video. \"Time and again he was asked to do the impossible and without fail he delivered the exceptional.\u201d",
      "\u201dBut more than all of that, he was the colleague and friend you wanted by your side because if Adam was there we knew we were going to be the winning team.\u201d",
      "As civil unrest rocked Ukraine in 2014, Pemble reported from Kyiv and later Donetsk, where he covered the first Russian-backed demonstrations before spending weeks in Crimea during Russia's annexation of the strategic peninsula.",
      "His video reports included the last remaining Ukrainian sailors loyal to Kyiv finally abandoning their ship and coming ashore. With the Russian national anthem playing from a car in the background, his final shot showed two distraught sailors heckled as they walked away.",
      "Pemble returned to Ukraine following Russia's invasion of the country in 2022. Among his many assignments was filming the exclusive March 2023 AP interview by Executive Editor Julie Pace with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a train shuttled them across Ukraine to cities near some of the fiercest fighting.",
      "\u201cAdam showed up to every assignment with enthusiasm, creativity and commitment to his work and his colleagues. He loved what he did, and so many of us at AP are better for having worked alongside him,\u201d Pace said.",
      "When not deployed overseas, Pemble set his camera's gaze on his new home in the Czech Republic, offering insight into the traditions and unique stories of Eastern Europe. From Christmas carp fishing at sunrise to graffiti artists in Prague, to the intimate story of a Slovak priest challenging the celibacy rules of the Catholic Church, he brought his unmistakable style.",
      "He worked with a traditional large broadcast camera in an era where many video shooters shifted to smaller, lighter cameras. He always put himself in the right place to let reality unfold like \u201can old school analog painter in an often fast and furious digital age,\u201d former AP cameraman Ben Jary recalled.",
      "Pemble's interest in visual storytelling led to experimenting with new technologies, including aerial videography. In 2015, he was the first major news agency camera operator to film live drone footage when reporting on the migration crisis in the Balkans.",
      "An avid gardener who planted trees and chilis on his rooftop in Prague, he was adventurous in the kitchen and especially proud of his vegan \u201cmeatloaf,\u201d friends said. He loved a seedy dive bar as much as a Michelin restaurant, and foods as varied as charcoal choux pastry with truffle creme and his favorite road trip junk food, Slim Jim\u2019s jerky and Salted Nut Rolls.",
      "Pemble\u2019s wit, wisdom, energy and positivity enriched the lives and experiences of those around him, friends and colleagues recalled.",
      "\u201cIf someone asked me to see a picture of quiet strength and courage, dignity and grace, and most of all kindness, I would show them a picture of a man for all seasons,\" said Dan Huff, a Washington-based AP video journalist, \"I would show them a picture of Adam Pemble.\""

      "Half a century of rule by the Assad family in Syria has crumbled with astonishing speed",
      "LONDON -- Half a century of rule by the Assad family in Syria crumbled with astonishing speed after insurgents burst out of a rebel-held enclave and converged on the capital, Damascus, taking city after city in a matter of days.",
      "Opposition forces swept across the country and entered Damascus with little or no resistance as the Syrian army melted away. President Bashar Assad, Syria\u2019s ruler for 24 years \u2014 succeeding his father, Hafez Assad \u2014 fled the country. Russian state media reported that he was in Moscow.",
      "It\u2019s a stunning development in Syria\u2019s devastating 13-year conflict. Anti-government protests in 2011 met with a brutal crackdown, escalating into a civil war that has killed more than half a million people and displaced half of Syria\u2019s prewar population of 23 million. Assad, backed by Iran and Russia, gradually regained control of more than two-thirds of Syria, leaving the rebels with one stronghold in the northwest of the country.",
      "And there the conflict remained, largely frozen, for years until late November. Here\u2019s a look at a seismic two weeks for the Middle East.",
      "Armed opposition groups launch a large-scale attack on areas controlled by government forces in northwestern Syria and claim to have wrested control of over 15 villages from government forces in northwestern Aleppo province. The government and its allies respond with airstrikes and shelling in an attempt to halt the insurgent advances.",
      "The offensive is led by the jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. Formerly the Syrian branch of al-Qaida and known as the Nusra Front, HTS later distanced itself from al-Qaida, seeking to market itself as a more moderate group. It is classed as a terrorist group by the United Nations and the U.S.",
      "The attack on Aleppo follows weeks of simmering low-level violence, including government attacks on opposition-held areas. Turkey, a main backer of Syrian opposition groups, says the rebels began a limited offensive to stop the attacks, but it expanded as government forces began to retreat.",
      "The offensive expands to reach the countryside of Idlib province amid reports government troops are retreating.",
      "The insurgents enter Aleppo, Syria\u2019s largest city, for the first time since they were pushed out in 2016 after a grueling military campaign by Syrian government forces backed by Russia and Iran. They meet with little resistance.",
      "The rebels say they control Aleppo, raising a flag over the city\u2019s citadel and occupying the international airport. The Syrian armed forces claim to have redeployed troops and equipment in preparation for a counterattack.",
      "By evening, the insurgents have seized at least four towns in the central Hama province and claim to have entered the provincial capital.",
      "The Syrian military launches a counterattack with troops and airstrikes on Idlib and Aleppo. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi visits Damascus, telling Assad that Tehran will support the counteroffensive.",
      "But Assad receives little, if any, help from his allies. Russia is busy with its war in Ukraine, and Iran has seen its proxies across the region degraded by regular airstrikes. Lebanon\u2019s Iran-backed Hezbollah, which at one point sent thousands of fighters to shore up Assad\u2019s forces, has been weakened by a yearlong conflict with Israel.",
      "The insurgents push south, advancing to within 10 kilometers (6 miles) of Hama, the country\u2019s fourth-largest city and a key crossroads in central Syria, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of Damascus. State media reports fierce fighting in the province, and both state media and a U.K.-based observer group say government forces, backed by Russian airstrikes, have recaptured some territory.",
      "Turkey urges Assad to hold talks with the opposition.",
      "After several days of fighting the rebels sweep into Hama. Dozens of jubilant fighters are seen firing into the air in celebration in Assi Square, the site of massive anti-government protests in the early days of the uprising in 2011. The Syrian army says it has redeployed to positions outside the city to protect civilians.",
      "Rapidly advancing now, the rebels seize two towns on the outskirts of Homs, Syria\u2019s third-largest city. About 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Hama, Homs is the gateway to Damascus and the location of one of Syria\u2019s two state-owned oil refineries. Capturing it would cut the link between Damascus, Assad\u2019s seat of power, and the coastal region where he enjoys wide support.",
      "The government denies reports that its military has withdrawn from the city.",
      "Top diplomats from countries including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, Iran and Russia, hold talks on Syria in the Qatari capital, Doha.",
      "Opposition forces take Homs after government forces abandon it. The insurgents say they have encircled Damascus and are carrying out the \u201cfinal stage\u201d of their offensive.",
      "The U.N. special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, seeks urgent talks in Geneva to ensure an \u201corderly political transition,\u201d as Syrian state media denies Assad has fled the country.",
      "Syrian state television airs a video statement by a group of men saying that President Bashar Assad has been overthrown and all prisoners have been set free.

      "The protests came a day before India\u2019s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, is due to visit Dhaka amid growing tension between the two neighbors in recent months.",
      "It will be the first high-profile diplomatic visit by an Indian official since the fall of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is in exile in India, in August.",
      "Bangladesh, which is predominantly Muslim, has accused the majority Hindus in India of attacking the Assistant High Commissioner\u2019s office at Agartala in the Indian state of Tripura and desecrating Bangladeshi flags in Kolkata in West Bengal state.",
      "India said it regretted the attacks and pledged to take action against those responsible. Bangladesh\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also summoned the Indian High Commissioner and protested formally.",
      "On Sunday, thousands of supporters of the BNP, which is headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, marched toward the Indian High Commission, but police stopped them by setting up barbed wire fences. They later allowed a team of six leaders of the three associate bodies of the party to hand in a letter to the High Commission.",
      "The BNP last ruled Bangladesh in 2001-2006 in partnership with the Jamaat-e-Islami party. In the absence of Hasina, Zia's party is the main force and it is expected to win the next election if it happens sometime soon.",
      "Hasina, whose party is seen as more secular than the BNP, is highly regarded by India as a trusted friend. Most Hindus in Bangladesh are considered to be supporters of Hasina's Awami League party.",
      "The BNP supporters chanted slogans such as \u201cDelhi or Dhaka? Dhaka, Dhaka!\u201d and \u201cAgents of India, be careful, be careful!\u201d They also carried banners reading \u201cWe have friends overseas, but not masters.\u201d",
      "The protesters said India has been trying to instigate communal riots in Bangladesh to achieve political mileage since the ouster of Hasina, who fled to India following a mass uprising that ended her 15-year rule. Hasina\u2019s party is struggling to get back on the streets while Hasina herself is facing arrest warrants on charges of crimes against humanity involving the deaths of hundreds of protesters during the uprising in July and August.",
      "Over the past few weeks, some smaller Islamist groups and the BNP have protested against India over the attacks in Tripura and urged the interim government, led by Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, to officially raise concerns.",
      "The situation started becoming tense after authorities in Bangladesh last month arrested a prominent Bangladeshi Hindu leader and jailed him, pending further legal procedures.",
      "India had earlier officially raised concern over allegations of attacks on Hindus in Bangladesh after the fall of Hasina. Yunus and his close aides said the reports were exaggerated.",
      "Bangladesh has been navigating crucial challenges since August amid mob violence, rising commodity prices, street protests and an unstable economy. The presence of Islamist groups has been visible more than ever in recent months.",
      "The police are demoralized because many of their colleagues were killed in the protests and law and order remains a major concern, with rights groups also calling for ensuring press freedom. About 700 inmates including many criminals and radical Islamists still remain at large after jailbreaks during the political chaos in August.",
      "Yunus has been urging people to stay calm, promising improvement."

      "Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the militant leader who led the stunning insurgency that toppled Syria\u2019s President Bashar Assad, has spent years working to remake his public image and that of his fighters",
      "BEIRUT -- Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the militant leader whose stunning insurgency toppled Syria\u2019s President Bashar Assad, has spent years working to remake his public image, renouncing longtime ties to al-Qaida and depicting himself as a champion of pluralism and tolerance. As he entered Damascus behind his victorious fighters Sunday, he even dropped his nom de guerre and referred to himself with his real name, Ahmad al-Sharaa.",
      "The extent of that transformation from jihadi extremist to would-be state builder is now put to the test.",
      "Insurgents control Damascus, Assad has fled into hiding, and for the first time after 50 years of his family\u2019s iron hand, it is an open question how Syria will be governed.",
      "Syria is home to multiple ethnic and religious communities, often pitted against each other by Assad\u2019s state and years of war. Many of them fear the possibility that Sunni Islamist extremists will take over. The country is also fragmented among disparate armed factions, and foreign powers from Russia and Iran to the United States, Turkey and Israel all have their hands in the mix.",
      "Hours after Damascus' capture, the 42-year-old al-Sharaa made his first appearance in the city's landmark Umayyad Mosque, declaring Assad's fall \u201ca victory for the Islamic nation.\u201d A senior rebel commander, Anas Salkhadi, appeared on state TV to declare, \u201cOur message to all the sects of Syria, is that we tell them that Syria is for everyone,\u201d",
      "Al-Sharaa, who has been labeled a terrorist by the United States, and his insurgent force, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS \u2013 many of whose fighters are jihadis -- now stand to be a major player.",
      "For years, al-Sharaa worked to consolidate power, while bottled up in the province of Idlib in Syria\u2019s northwest corner as Assad\u2019s Iranian- and Russian-backed rule over much of the country appeared solid.",
      "He maneuvered among extremist organizations while eliminating competitors and former allies. He sought to polish the image of his de-facto \u201csalvation government\u201d that has been running Idlib to win over international governments and reassure Syria\u2019s religious and ethnic minorities. And he built ties with various tribes and other groups.",
      "Along the way, he shed his garb as a hard-line Islamist guerrilla and put on suits for press interviews, talking of building state institutions and decentralizing power to reflect Syria\u2019s diversity.",
      "\u201cSyria deserves a governing system that is institutional, no one where a single ruler makes arbitrary decisions,\u201d he said in an interview with CNN last week, offering the possibility HTS would eventually be dissolved after Assad falls.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t judge by words, but by actions,\u201d he said.",
      "Throughout his rise through extremist ranks, al-Sharaa was only known by the jihadi nickname he adopted, Abu Mohammed al-Golani. His ties to al-Qaida stretch back to 2003, when he joined insurgents battling U.S. troops in Iraq. The Syrian native was detained by the U.S. military but remained in Iraq. During that time, al-Qaida usurped like-minded groups and formed the extremist Islamic State of Iraq, led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.",
      "In 2011, a popular uprising in Syria against Assad triggered a brutal government crackdown and led to all-out war. Al-Golani\u2019s prominence grew when al-Baghdadi sent him to Syria to establish a branch of al-Qaida called the Nusra Front. The United States labeled the new group as a terrorist organization. That designation still remains in place and the U.S. government has put a $10 million bounty on him.",
      "As Syria\u2019s civil war intensified in 2013, so did al-Golani\u2019s ambitions. He defied al-Baghdadi\u2019s calls to dissolve the Nusra Front and merge it with al-Qaida\u2019s operation in Iraq, to form the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS.",
      "Al-Golani nonetheless pledged his allegiance to al-Qaida, which later disassociated itself from ISIS. The Nusra Front battled ISIS and eliminated much of its competition among the Syrian armed opposition to Assad.",
      "In his first interview in 2014, al-Golani kept his face covered, telling a reporter for Qatari network Al-Jazeera that he rejected political talks in Geneva to end the conflict. He said his goal was to see Syria ruled under Islamic law and made clear that there was no room for the country\u2019s Alawite, Shiite, Druze and Christian minorities.",
      "In 2016, al-Golani revealed his face to the public for the first time in a video message that announced his group was renaming itself Jabhat Fateh al-Sham -\u2013 the Syria Conquest Front -- and cutting its ties to al-Qaida.",
      "\u201cThis new organization has no affiliation to any external entity,\u201d he said in the video, filmed wearing military garb and a turban.",
      "The move paved the way for al-Golani to assert full control over fracturing militant groups. A year later, his alliance rebranded again as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham -\u2013 meaning Organization for Liberating Syria -- as the groups merged, consolidating al-Golani\u2019s power in northwest Syria\u2019s Idlib province.",
      "HTS later clashed with independent Islamist militants who opposed the merger, further emboldening al-Golani and his group as the leading power in northwestern Syria, able to rule with an iron fist.",
      "With his power consolidated, al-Golani set in motion a transformation that few could have imagined. Replacing his military garb with shirt and trousers, he began calling for religious tolerance and pluralism.",
      "He appealed to the Druze community in Idlib, which the Nusra Front had previously targeted, and visited the families of Kurds who were killed by Turkish-backed militias.",
      "In 2021, he had his first interview with an American journalist on PBS. Wearing a blazer, with his short hair gelled back, the now more soft-spoken HTS leader said that his group posed no threat to the West and that sanctions imposed against it were unjust.",
      "\u201cYes, we have criticized Western policies,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to wage a war against the United States or Europe from Syria, that\u2019s not true. We didn\u2019t say we wanted to fight.\u201d"

      "BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romania\u2019s defiant far-right presidential candidate, Calin Georgescu, on Sunday stood outside a closed polling station to denounce a top court\u2019s unprecedented decision to annul the first round of the vote in which he emerged as the frontrunner.",
      "The Constitutional Court on Friday canceled the election after a trove of declassified intelligence alleged Russia organized a sprawling campaign across social media to promote Georgescu.",
      "\u201cToday is Constitution Day and there is nothing constitutional in Romania anymore. I am here in the name of democracy,\u201d Georgescu, 62, told media in Mogosoaia, outside Bucharest. \u201cBy canceling democracy, our very freedom is canceled.\u201d",
      "The court cited the illegal use of digital technologies including artificial intelligence, as well as undeclared sources of funding. Without naming Georgescu, the court said one candidate received \u201cpreferential treatment\" on social media platforms, distorting voters\u2019 expressed will.",
      "Despite being a huge outsider who declared zero campaign spending, Georgescu topped the polls in the first round on Nov. 24, and was due on Sunday to face reformist Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party in a runoff.",
      "Thirteen candidates ran in the first round of the presidential race in the European Union and NATO member country, the aftermath of which was gripped by myriad controversies including a recount of the vote ordered by the same court.",
      "New dates will be set to rerun the presidential vote from scratch.",
      "Romanian President Klaus Iohannis said in a statement marking Constitution Day on Sunday that \u201cwe find ourselves in a moment of profound responsibility toward the values \u200b\u200bthat characterize us as a nation.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Romanian Constitution defines the framework within which the state and political life operate, serving as a shield against threats to democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cIn turbulent times, state institutions are called upon to act with calm, wisdom and respect for the law, the Constitution and democracy.\u201d",
      "George Simion, the 38-year-old leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, told reporters outside a closed polling station in Bucharest on Sunday that the annulment amounted to an attack against democracy, saying Iohannis should \u201ctake a step back and respect the Constitution, not mock it.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is Constitution Day. It is a day of significance for Romanians. It is a day when Romanians should have gone to vote freely,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cblood was shed for this 35 years ago,\u201d referring to Romania\u2019s revolution in December 1989 that overthrew communism.",
      "After Georgescu unexpectedly topped the polls in the first round, his success left many political observers wondering how most local surveys had placed him behind at least five other candidates before the vote.",
      "Many observers attributed his success to his TikTok account, which now has 6.2 million likes and 565,000 followers. But some experts suspected Georgescu\u2019s online following was artificially inflated, while Romania\u2019s top security body alleged he was given preferential treatment by TikTok over other candidates.",
      "On Saturday, Romanian prosecutors conducted raids at three properties in the central city of Brasov linked to Bogdan Peschir, who is suspected of illegally financing a campaign to promote Georgescu. The raids were based on suspicions of voter corruption, money laundering and cyber fraud, prosecutors said.",
      "The secret services alleged that Peschir paid $381,000 (361,000 euros) to TikTok users to promote Georgescu content on the Chinese-owned platform. Intelligence authorities said information they obtained \u201crevealed an aggressive promotion campaign\u201d to increase and accelerate Georgescu\u2019s popularity.",
      "There is no clear link between Peschir and alleged Russian interference. Russia denies meddling in Romania.",
      "On Friday, Georgescu's would-be opponent Lasconi also strongly condemned the court\u2019s decision to annul the elections, saying it was \u201cillegal, immoral, and crushes the very essence of democracy\u201d and that the second round should have gone forward."

      "Milan\u2019s Pinacoteca di Brera museum, conceived under Napoleon as a \u201clittle Louvre,\u201d is finally getting a modern art addition first envisioned more than 50 years ago with the opening Sunday of Palazzo Citterio",
      "MILAN -- Milan\u2019s Pinacoteca di Brera museum, conceived under Napoleon as a \u201clittle Louvre,\u201d is finally getting a modern art addition first envisioned more than 50 years ago with the opening Sunday of Palazzo Citterio, home to one of the world\u2019s most important collections of 20th century Italian art.",
      "Completing the project long beset by shifting priorities, periods of neglect and most recently an ill-fated architectural vision was a priority for Brera director Angelo Crespi when he took over in January.",
      "Italy's then-culture minister set Dec. 7 \u2014 the feast day for Milan\u2019s patron St. Ambrose \u2014 as the target opening date, giving Crespi just months to resolve structural issues and oversee the installation of hundreds of modern works of art donated to the Brera decades ago.",
      "On deadline, the current culture minister, Alessandro Giuli, who inherited the project in September, inaugurated Palazzo Citterio on Saturday\u2019s feast day, ahead of the public opening on Sunday.",
      "The accelerated timeline after decades of delays \u201cwasn\u2019t to prove something,\" Crespi told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThere was awareness that it needed to be opened,\" he said. \"The question was not just economic, but also ethical. After 52 years, we couldn\u2019t keep such a beautiful building closed simply because of inertia.\u201d",
      "The Palazzo Citterio opening completes a decades-old vision for a \u201cGrande Brera,\u201d which encompasses also the Pinacoteca and the Braidense National Library, just as it takes on greater heft in the Italian cultural landscape.",
      "From Dec. 2, the Grande Brera also incorporated into its fold Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u201cLast Supper,\u201d arguably Italy\u2019s most famous masterpiece. The fragile wall mural is located in a church complex a kilometer (half a mile) away from the Pinacoteca and Palazzo Citterio.",
      "The merger creates a system of state-run museums in Milan that boosts Brera\u2019s cachet and gives Crespi significant autonomy in their management, including control over 80% of revenue.",
      "Combined, the \u201cLast Supper,\u201d and the Pinacoteca di Brera, receive 1 million visitors a year, and take in more than 10 million euros ($10.5 million) in revenue, Crespi said. As a single entity, they are among the top 10 most-visited sites in Italy.",
      "Crespi hopes to use this greater visibility to promote other institutes in the Brera complex, including the Academy of Fine Arts, botanical gardens and an observatory, while also pitching Milan \u2014 better known for fashion and finance \u2014 as a city of the arts.",
      "Beside the Grande Brera\u2019s vast collections and the \u201cLast Supper,\u201d masterpieces by Michelangelo, Canova, Caravaggio, Raffaello, Bellini, Piero della Francesca and others are displayed in museums and landmarks within walking distance of Milan's central Duomo cathedral. Yet they are often overlooked by visitors.",
      "\u201cAll of the biggest masterpieces and names who made Italian art great over the centuries are concentrated within a few hundred meters,\u201d Crespi said, adding that as an art city, Milan can rival Florence, Rome and Venice.",
      "The Grande Brera should become \u201cthe motor of this narration of Milan as a city of art,\" he said.",
      "By spring, the Pinacoteca di Brera will be linked to Palazzo Citterio, a few minutes' walk away, by a passageway through the botanical gardens behind the museums.",
      "Inside Palazzo Citterio, visitors are greeted by the monumental late 19th century painting \u201cHuman Flood,\u201d by Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo, intended as a bridge from the Pinacoteca's collection that is rich in Italian Renaissance and Baroque art taken from areas conquered by Napoleon's army.",
      "In the new museum, hundreds of artworks donated to the Brera decades ago by the art collectors Emilio Jesi and Lamberto Vitali form \u201ca manual of Italian contemporary art,\u201d with a particular focus on Giorgio Morandi, said curator Marina Gargiulo.",
      "Jesi, who lived in an apartment in the palazzo, focused his collection on painters who were his contemporaries in the 1930-1960s, most of them Italian artists, with notable exceptions including Picasso.",
      "Vitali's tastes were more eclectic, ranging from archaeological artifacts to Byzantine mosaics and art from the medieval era through the 20th century, with paintings by his friend Morandi and by Modigliani, Gargiulo said.",
      "The new museum also includes a series of 152 miniature self-portraits commissioned by Italian neorealistic screenwriter Cesare Zavattini.",
      "Workers were still installing the permanent collection and an exhibition two days before the public opening, and Crespi said his own staff suggested postponing the opening as the date neared. But he held fast.",
      "\u201cOtherwise, we could have entered in a new loop, with more years of other ideas, other projects. It is the right moment and we need to do it,\u201d Crespi said.",
      "For now, the Palazzo Citterio will be open Thursday-Sunday from 2 p.m.-7 p.m., while the Pinacoteca di Brera is open Tuesday-Sunday from 8:30 a.m. until 7:15 p.m. Reservations are recommended for Leonardo\u2019s Last Supper Museum, open from 8:15 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday-Sunday, with a maximum 40 people admitted every 15 minutes."

    "story": [
      "When local residents and admirers learned the iconic Sycamore Gap tree in northern England had been cut down last year, they wanted to know why and who could have committed such a senseless act",
      "LONDON -- It was neither Britain\u2019s biggest tree nor its oldest. But the majestic sycamore that stood for 150 years along a stretch of Hadrian\u2019s Wall in northern England was one of the most beloved.",
      "Perched symmetrically in a dip between two hills, the Sycamore Gap tree had been the site of first kisses, wedding proposals and even a place where the ashes of loved ones were scattered.",
      "When local residents and admirers woke to the news last fall that it had been cut down in the dark of night, they wanted to know why and who could have committed such a senseless act.",
      "On Monday, prosecutors are expected to start providing those answers.",
      "Two men are scheduled to go on trial in Newcastle Crown Court on charges related to toppling the tree and damaging the ancient wall built by Emperor Hadrian in A.D. 122 to protect the northwest frontier of the Roman Empire.",
      "Little has been said about the case, including a possible motive, to protect the integrity of the trial and rights of the accused.",
      "Daniel Graham, 39, and Adam Carruthers, 32, have pleaded not guilty to two counts each of criminal damage. Prosecutors said the value of the tree exceeded 620,000 pounds ($790,000) and damage to the wall was assessed at 1,100 pounds ($1,400).",
      "\u201cThis is a case that will be instantly recognizable to you, indeed anyone hearing the charges read out,\u201d prosecutor Rebecca Brown said in May, as the two defendants made their first court appearance.",
      "\u201cThe prosecution say the tree was deliberately felled on Sept. 28 last year and the resultant fall damaged Hadrian\u2019s Wall, a UNESCO World Heritage Site,\" Brown said. \"The prosecution say these defendants are responsible as part of a joint enterprise.\u201d",
      "Word of the tree's demise spread swiftly and the impact reverberated through the wild and scenic Northumberland region.",
      "\u201cI still can\u2019t come to terms with the fact that the tree\u2019s not there,\u201d said Catherine Cape, who lives nearby. \u201cI am still really angry about it. I can\u2019t understand why you would want to destroy something so beautiful.\u201d",
      "The tree became famous after being featured in Kevin Costner\u2019s 1991 film \u201cRobin Hood: Prince Of Thieves,\" and was a big draw for tourism.",
      "Before the tree was cut down, about 80% of the inquiries at Northumberland National Park 's main visitors center were from people planning to walk to the tree, the park's chief executive, Tony Gates, said after the tree was cut down.",
      "The sycamore\u2019s broad canopy framed between two hills had long been a popular draw for landscape photographers and a scenic stop for walkers on the path along the wall.",
      "Cape walked to the tree on her first and second dates with her future husband. They later watched their daughter take her first steps there. And after her mother and sister both died in 2020, she met her brother-in-law and nephews there when they couldn\u2019t gather indoors during the COVID-19 lockdown.",
      "The tree was a huge draw for the guests that stayed at a small cabin Cape owns. Bookings dropped off after the tree was downed but they have largely rebounded.",
      "She used to drive past the tree two or three days a week but now takes the highway instead because she doesn't like to see the empty space on the hillside where it stood.",
      "The sycamore was removed with a crane and taken to a National Trust property for storage. A section of the trunk went on display at the park visitor center this fall and seeds from the tree that were used to grow saplings are being donated for planting around the U.K.",
      "In time, the tree itself may grow back. More than two dozens shoots were discovered sprouting from the stump.",
      "\u201cThe tree does still live on, but just not in the form that it was,\u201d Cape said. \"We\u2019ll never see it in our lifetime grow into a tree, or what it was before.\""

      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- Ousted Syrian leader Bashar Assad fled to Moscow and received asylum from his longtime ally, Russian media said Sunday, hours after a stunning rebel advance seized control of Damascus and ended his family\u2019s 50 years of iron rule.",
      "Thousands of Syrians poured into streets echoing with celebratory gunfire and waved the revolutionary flag in scenes that recalled the early days of the Arab Spring uprising, before a brutal crackdown and the rise of an insurgency plunged the country into a nearly 14-year civil war.",
      "The swiftly moving events raised questions about the future of the country and the wider region.",
      "\u201cOur approach has shifted the balance of power in the Middle East,\" President Joe Biden said, crediting action by the U.S. and its allies for weakening Syria\u2019s backers \u2014 Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. He called the fall of Assad a \u201cfundamental act of justice\u201d but also a \u201cmoment of risk and uncertainty,\u201d and said rebel groups are \u201csaying the right things now\u201d but the U.S. would assess their actions.",
      "Russia requested an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council to discuss Syria, according to Dmitry Polyansky, its deputy ambassador to the U.N., in a post on Telegram.",
      "The arrival of Assad and his family in Moscow was reported by Russian agencies Tass and RIA, citing an unidentified source at the Kremlin. A spokesman there didn't immediately respond to questions. RIA also said Syrian insurgents had guaranteed the security of Russian military bases and diplomatic posts in Syria.",
      "Earlier, Russia said Assad left Syria after negotiations with rebel groups and that he had given instructions to transfer power peacefully.",
      "The leader of Syria's biggest rebel faction, Abu Mohammed al-Golani, is poised to chart the country\u2019s future. The former al-Qaida commander cut ties with the group years ago and says he embraces pluralism and religious tolerance. His Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the U.N.",
      "In his first public appearance since fighters entered the Damascus suburbs Saturday, al-Golani visited the Umayyad Mosque and described Assad's fall as \u201ca victory to the Islamic nation.\u201d Calling himself by his given name, Ahmad al-Sharaa, and not his nom de guerre, he said Assad had made Syria \u201ca farm for Iran\u2019s greed.\u201d",
      "The rebels face the daunting task of healing bitter divisions in a country ravaged by war and split among armed factions. Turkey-backed opposition fighters are battling U.S.-allied Kurdish forces in the north, and the Islamic State group is still active in remote areas.",
      "Syrian state television broadcast a rebel statement saying Assad had been overthrown and all prisoners had been released. They urged people to preserve the institutions of \u201cthe free Syrian state,\u201d and announced a curfew in Damascus from 4 p.m. to 5 a.m.",
      "An online video purported to show rebels freeing dozens of women at the notorious Saydnaya prison, where rights groups say thousands were tortured and killed. At least one small child was seen among them.",
      "\u201cThis happiness will not be completed until I can see my son out of prison and know where is he,\u201d said one relative, Bassam Masr. \"I have been searching for him for two hours. He has been detained for 13 years.\u201d",
      "Rebel commander Anas Salkhadi appeared on state TV and sought to reassure religious and ethnic minorities, saying: \u201cSyria is for everyone, no exceptions. Syria is for Druze, Sunnis, Alawites, and all sects.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not deal with people the way the Assad family did,\" he added.",
      "Damascus residents prayed in mosques and celebrated in squares, calling, \u201cGod is great.\u201d People chanted anti-Assad slogans and honked car horns. Teenage boys picked up weapons apparently discarded by security forces and fired into the air.",
      "Soldiers and police fled their posts and looters broke into the Defense Ministry. Families wandered the presidential palace, walking by damaged portraits of Assad. Other parts of the capital were empty and shops were closed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a dream. I need someone to wake me up,\" said opposition fighter Abu Laith, adding the rebels were welcomed in Damascus with \u201clove.\u201d",
      "Rebels stood guard at the Justice Ministry, where Judge Khitam Haddad said he and colleagues were protecting documents. Outside, residents sought information about relatives who disappeared under Assad.",
      "The rebels \u201chave felt the pain of the people,\u201d said one woman, giving only her first name, Heba. She worried about possible revenge killings by the rebels, many of whom appeared to be underage.",
      "Syria\u2019s historically pro-government newspaper al-Watan called it \u201ca new page for Syria. We thank God for not shedding more blood.\u201d It added that media workers should not be blamed for publishing past government statements ordered from above.",
      "A statement from the Alawite sect that formed the core of Assad's base called on young Syrians to be \u201ccalm, rational and prudent and not to be dragged into what tears apart the unity of our country.\u201d",
      "The rebels mainly come from the Sunni Muslim majority in Syria, which also has sizable Druze, Christian and Kurdish communities. In Qamishli in the northeast, a Kurdish man slapped a statue of the late leader Hafez Assad with his shoe.",
      "The rebel advances since Nov. 27 were the largest in recent years, and saw the cities of Aleppo, Hama and Homs fall within days as the Syrian army melted away. The road to Damascus from the Lebanese border was littered with military uniforms and charred armored vehicles.",
      "Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, which provided crucial support to Assad, abandoned him as they reeled from other conflicts.",
      "The end of Assad\u2019s rule was a major blow to Iran and its proxies, already weakened by conflict with Israel. Iran said Syrians should decide their future \u201cwithout destructive, coercive, foreign intervention.\u201d The Iranian Embassy in Damascus was ransacked after apparently having been abandoned.",
      "Hossein Akbari, Iran\u2019s ambassador to Syria, said it was \u201ceffectively impossible\u201d to help the Syrian government after it admitted the insurgents' military superiority. Speaking on Iranian state media from an undisclosed location, he said Syria's government decided Saturday night to hand over power peacefully.",
      "\u201cWhen the army and the people could not resist, it was a good decision to let go to prevent bloodshed and destruction,\u201d Akbari said, adding that some of his colleagues left Syria before sunrise.",
      "Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, speaking on state TV, said there were concerns about the \u201cpossibility of civil war, disintegration of Syria, total collapse and turning Syria into a shelter for terrorists.\u201d",
      "Syrian Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali has said the government was ready to \u201cextend its hand\u201d to the opposition and turn its functions over to a transitional government. A video on Syrian opposition media showed armed men escorting him from his office to a hotel.",

      "The search for UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson\u2019s killer has stretched into a fifth day \u2014 and beyond New York City",
      "NEW YORK -- The search for UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson \u2019s killer since Thompson was ambushed Wednesday outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel has stretched beyond New York City. While still looking to identify the suspect, the FBI has offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest and conviction. That\u2019s on top of a $10,000 reward offered by the NYPD.",
      "The gunman used a fake ID and paid cash during the 10 days he was in the city, NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told reporters Friday. He also kept his face covered except while checking in at a hostel. He was captured on some of the thousands of surveillance cameras blanketing Manhattan, allowing police to build a timeline of his movements.",
      "Here's what we know so far about what the NYPD describes as a planned attack.",
      "10:11 p.m. \u2014 The suspected shooter arrives in New York City on a Greyhound bus at the Port Authority terminal. The bus originated in Atlanta and made six or seven stops on the way to New York. Police could not immediately determine where he got on the bus.",
      "The man then takes a taxi to the area of the New York Hilton Midtown and is there for about a half hour.",
      "About 11 p.m. \u2014 The man takes a taxi to the HI New York City Hostel at 891 Amsterdam Ave., where he stays until the morning of the shooting. He presents an ID that police believe to be fake. Two roommates in a shared room that had bunkbeds never saw his face, police said, because he kept his mask on.",
      "When speaking with an employee in the hostel lobby, he briefly pulled down his facemask and smiled \u2014 a moment captured on surveillance images that have been widely circulated by police.",
      "The man was checked out of the hostel, where guests are automatically checked out if they don\u2019t show at the desk by a certain time. Police don\u2019t believe he stayed someplace else and checked back into the same hostel the next day.",
      "About 5:30 a.m. \u2014 The suspected shooter leaves the hostel well before dawn.",
      "5:41 a.m. \u2014 He appears on video at 54th Street and Sixth Avenue walking back and forth in the area of the Hilton hotel where United Healthcare\u2019s parent company, UnitedHealth Group, is holding its annual investor conference.",
      "Police deduce that he rode a bicycle to the Hilton because it took him such a short time to get there. \u201cCould he have stolen the bike? These are things we\u2019re still looking into,\u201d Kenny said.",
      "At some point, he went to a nearby Starbucks and purchased a bottle of water and at least one energy bar before returning to the hotel.",
      "6:44 a.m. \u2014 He shoots Thompson as the executive arrives alone, on foot, having walked from a hotel across the street. The man flees.",
      "6:48 a.m. \u2014 The man enters Central Park by bicycle at the 60th Street and Center Drive entrance. It's in the park and away from security cameras that police believe he discards a gray backpack.",
      "6:56 a.m. \u2014 He leaves the park at West 77th Street and Central Park West, still on the bicycle.",
      "6:58 a.m. \u2014 He passes another camera on 85th Street and Columbus Avenue, still on the bicycle.",
      "7 a.m. \u2014 He's at 86th Street, no longer with the bicycle.",
      "7:04 a.m. \u2014 He enters a taxi northbound at 86th Street and Amsterdam Avenue.",
      "7:30 a.m. \u2014 He's near the George Washington Bridge and the bus terminal there. It offers commuter service to New Jersey and Greyhound routes to Philadelphia, Boston and Washington.",
      "After the attack, investigators find the words \u201cdeny,\" \u201cdefend\u201d and \"depose,\u201d  written in permanent marker on ammunition at the scene. The words mimic a phrase used by insurance industry critics.",
      "Kenny and Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch reveal that investigators believe the gunman left New York City on a bus. Investigators say he entered the George Washington Bridge Bus Station but have not found video of him leaving or getting on a bus.",
      "\u201cIt could possibly be a disgruntled employee, or a disgruntled client,\" Kenny says of a possible motive in a briefing.",
      "Police find what they say is the man's backpack. Its contents are not disclosed.",
      "Police continue to search Central Park; scuba divers are seen scouring a pond. The NYPD releases additional photos showing the suspected shooter next to and in the back seat of a taxi. In both images he is seen wearing a blue, medical-style face mask.",
      "Despite recovering a fingerprint from the Starbucks purchase and sending items for DNA testing, police have yet to publicly identify the suspect.",

      "Second place at the box office was occupied by \u201cWicked,\u201d which added $34.9 million, bringing its domestic total to $320.5 million in three weeks. Globally, the musical adaptation released by Universal is at $455.6 million. \u201cGladiator II\u201d followed in third place with $12.5 million, while \u201cRed One\u201d came in fourth with $7 million.",
      "\u201cThese holdovers are going to create the momentum that\u2019s going to put an $8.5 billion-plus box office year on the horizon,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore.",
      "Pre-pandemic, $11 billion had become the annual norm for the movie business. Since then, the closest the industry has gotten to that number was last year, which cracked $9 billion. This year started off slow and up to a few months ago, Dergarabedian said, even hitting $8 billion for the year was in doubt. But in the two weeks since Thanksgiving, the deficit from last year has narrowed by over 5%.",
      "The newcomers struggled to make a significant impact. Even the 10th anniversary rerelease of Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cInterstellar,\u201d which played in only 165 theaters, did better than \u201cY2K\u201d ($2.1 million) and \u201cThe Order\u201d ($878,000) combined. Paramount reported that the science fiction epic starring Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway brought in an estimated $4.4 million. IMAX also noted that all the 70mm IMAX presentations of \u201cInterstellar\u201d were sold out through the weekend.",
      "\u201cI was thrilled so many moviegoers took advantage of the original IMAX experience of \u2018Interstellar\u2019 this weekend,\" Nolan said in a statement.",
      "The biggest of the many newcomers was the Indian action pic \u201cPushpa: The Rule \u2013 Part 2,\u201d which earned $4.9 million. Sony and Crunchyroll's anime release, \u201cSolo Leveling \u2013 ReAwakening,\u201d made $2.4 million. Fathom also released pop duo for KING + COUNTRY\u2019s \u201cA Drummer Boy Christmas\u201d concert in theaters where it made $2.1 million.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a really diverse marketplace,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cThere's event cinema, international cinema, a re-release of a 10-year-old film. It's easily one of the most eclectic and interesting lineups I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d",
      "Next weekend theaters are in for another influx of bigger movies, with both Sony's comic book film \u201cKraven the Hunter\u201d and the animated \u201cThe Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim\u201d opening in wide release. Awards contenders \u201cNickel Boys\u201d and \u201cSeptember 5\u201d will also open in a limited number of theaters.",
      "Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump says he can&rsquo;t guarantee his promised tariffs on key U.S. foreign trade partners won&rsquo;t raise prices for American consumers",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump says he can\u2019t guarantee his promised tariffs on key U.S. foreign trade partners won\u2019t raise prices for American consumers",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump said he can't guarantee that his promised tariffs on key U.S. foreign trade partners won't raise prices for American consumers and he suggested once more that some political rivals and federal officials who pursued legal cases against him should be imprisoned.",
      "The president-elect, in a wide-ranging interview with NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that aired Sunday, also touched on monetary policy, immigration, abortion and health care, and U.S. involvement in Ukraine, Israel and elsewhere.",
      "Trump often mixed declarative statements with caveats, at one point cautioning \u201cthings do change.\u201d",
      "A look at some of the issues covered:",
      "Trump has threatened broad trade penalties, but said he didn\u2019t believe economists' predictions that added costs on those imported goods for American companies would lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers. He stopped short of a pledge that U.S. households won't be paying more as they shop.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t guarantee anything. I can\u2019t guarantee tomorrow,\u201d Trump said, seeming to open the door to accepting the reality of how import levies typically work as goods reach the retail market.",
      "That's a different approach from Trump's typical speeches throughout the 2024 campaign, when he framed his election as a sure way to curb inflation.",
      "In the interview, Trump defended tariffs generally, saying they are \"going to make us rich.\u201d",
      "He has pledged that, on his first day in office in January, he would impose 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico and Canada unless those countries satisfactorily stop illegal immigration and the flow of illegal drugs such as fentanyl into the United States. He also has threatened additional tariffs on China to help force that country to crack down on fentanyl production.",
      "\u201dAll I want to do is I want to have a level, fast, but fair playing field,\u201d Trump said.",
      "He offered conflicting statements on how he would approach the justice system after winning election despite being convicted of 34 felonies in a New York state court and being indicted in other cases for his handling of national security secrets and efforts to overturn his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cHonestly, they should go to jail,\u201d Trump said of members of Congress who investigated the Capitol riot by his supporters who wanted him to remain in power.",
      "The president-elect underscored his contention that he can use the justice system against others, including special prosecutor Jack Smith, who led the case on Trump\u2019s role in the siege on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump confirmed his plan to pardon supporters who were convicted for their roles in the riot, saying he would take that action on his first day in office.",
      "As for the idea of revenge driving potential prosecutions, Trump said: \u201cI have the absolute right. I\u2019m the chief law enforcement officer, you do know that. I\u2019m the president. But I\u2019m not interested in that.\"",
      "At the same time, Trump singled out lawmakers on a special House committee who had investigated the insurrection, citing Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.",
      "\u201cCheney was behind it ... so was Bennie Thompson and everybody on that committee,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Asked specifically whether he would direct his administration to pursue cases, he said, \u201cNo,\u201d and suggested he did not expect the FBI to quickly undertake investigations into his political enemies.",
      "But at another point, Trump said he would leave the matter up to Pam Bondi, his pick as attorney general. \u201cI want her to do what she wants to do,\u201d he said.",
      "Such threats, regardless of Trump's inconsistencies, have been taken seriously enough by many top Democrats that Biden is considering issuing blanket, preemptive pardons to protect key members of his outgoing administration.",
      "Trump did seemingly back off his campaign rhetoric calling for Biden to be investigated, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not looking to go back into the past.\u201d",
      "Trump repeatedly mentioned his promises to seal the U.S.-Mexico border and deport millions of people who are in the U.S. illegally through a mass deportation program.",
      "\u201cI think you have to do it,\u201d he said.",
      "He suggested he would try to use executive action to end \u201cbirthright\u201d citizenship under which people born in the U.S. are considered citizens \u2014 although such protections are spelled out in the Constitution.",
      "Asked specifically about the future for people who were brought into the country illegally as children and have been shielded from deportation in recent years, Trump said, \u201cI want to work something out,\u201d indicating he might seek a solution with Congress.",
      "But Trump also said he does not \u201cwant to be breaking up families\u201d of mixed legal status, \u201cso the only way you don\u2019t break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back.\u201d",
      "Long a critic of NATO members for not spending more on their own defense, Trump said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d would remain in the alliance \u201cif they pay their bills.\u201d",
      "Pressed on whether he would withdraw if he were dissatisfied with allies\u2019 commitments, Trump said he wants the U.S. treated \u201cfairly\u201d on trade and defense.",
      "He waffled on a NATO priority of containing Russia and President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Trump suggested Ukraine should prepare for less U.S. aid in its defense against Putin\u2019s invasion. \u201cPossibly. Yeah, probably. Sure,\u201d Trump said of reducing Ukraine assistance from Washington. Separately, Trump has called for an immediate ceasefire.",
      "Asked about Putin, Trump said initially that he has not talked to the Russian leader since Election Day last month, but then hedged: \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to him recently.\u201d Trump said when pressed, adding that he did not want to \u201cimpede the negotiation.\u201d",
      "The president-elect said he has no intention, at least for now, of asking Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to step down before Powell's term ends in 2028. Trump said during the campaign that presidents should have more say in Fed policy, including interest rates.",
      "Trump did not offer any job assurances for FBI Director Christopher Wray, whose term is to end in 2027.",
      "Asked about Wray, Trump said: \u201cWell, I mean, it would sort of seem pretty obvious\u201d that if the Senate confirms Kash Patel as his pick for FBI chief, then \u201che\u2019s going to be taking somebody\u2019s place, right? Somebody is the man that you\u2019re talking about.\u201d",
      "Trump promised that the government efficiency effort led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will not threaten Social Security. \u201cWe're not touching Social Security, other than we make it more efficient,\u201d he said. He added that \u201cwe're not raising ages or any of that stuff.\u201d",
      "He was not so specific about abortion or his long-promised overhaul of the Affordable Care Act.",
      "On abortion, Trump continued his inconsistencies and said he would \u201cprobably\u201d not move to restrict access to the abortion pills that now account for a majority of pregnancy terminations, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. But pressed on whether he would commit to that position, Trump replied, \u201cWell, I commit. I mean, are -- things do -- things change. I think they change.\u201d",
      "Reprising a line from his Sept. 10 debate against Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump again said he had \u201cconcepts\u201d of a plan to substitute for the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which he called \u201clousy health care.\u201d",
      "He added a promise that any Trump version would maintain insurance protections for Americans with preexisting health conditions. He did not explain how such a design would be different from the status quo or how he could deliver on his desire for \u201cbetter health care for less money.\u201d",

      "Europe's economy has enough difficulties, from tepid growth to trade tensions with the U.S. Dealing with those woes is only getting harder due to the political chaos in the two biggest European countries, France and Germany",
      "BRUSSELS -- Even before the French and German governments collapsed, Europe\u2019s economy had enough difficulties. Tepid growth and lagging competitiveness versus the U.S. and China. An auto industry that's struggling. Where to find billions for defense against Russia? And now Donald Trump threatening tariffs.",
      "Solutions will be harder to find while the two countries that make up almost half of the eurozone economy remain stuck in political paralysis well into 2025.",
      "Where once there was the so-called French-German axis to push Europe ahead, now there\u2019s a vacuum. French Prime Minister Michel Barnier resigned Thursday after losing a vote of confidence, and while President Emmanuel Macron will appoint a successor, the new head of government will lack a majority. Elections are not constitutionally permitted until at least June.",
      "Germany's coalition led by Social Democratic Chancellor Olaf Scholz with the Greens and pro-business Free Democrats fractured in November, triggering an early election on Feb. 23. Talks to form a new government could last into April.",
      "At least Germany's likely new chancellor, conservative opposition leader Friedrich Merz, appears open to loosening constitutional restrictions on borrowing to enable pro-growth spending and investment, said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director Europe at Eurasia Group.",
      "France, however, could be facing \u201ccomplete paralysis on the economic question,\" Rahman said. \u201cIt's highly unlikely they're going to get a political equilibrium that has a mandate to implement a credible fiscal course correction.\"",
      "\"And that's obviously a problem for Europe because it means the great potential of the European economy is not what it otherwise should be, because you don't have France and Germany firing on all cylinders,\" he said.",
      "Then there's Europe's lagging business environment, dissected by former European Central Bank head Mario Draghi in a report that contains recommendations such as common borrowing to support public investment; EU-wide industrial policy; and integrating financial markets to help startups raise capital. Yet \u201cnothing can move in Europe without Franco-German alignment,\u201d Rahman said.",
      "Meanwhile, Europe's auto industry has sought a review of tough EU emissions standards in 2025 instead of 2026, saying slackening demand for electric cars means they won't be able to avoid heavy fines and that the money would be better used to develop new electric vehicles.",
      "Anne-Laure Delatte, a French economist and head of research at the National Center for Scientific Research, said financial markets remain cautious but are not overly alarmed by France\u2019s political instability. But economic weakness in France and Germany could have broader implications for the European Union.",
      "\u201cThis could either weaken Europe\u2019s position globally or shift power and influence to other European countries like the Netherlands or Spain, which are performing well at the moment,\u201d she said.",
      "France is expected to see growth of 1.1% this year and 0.8% next year, while Germany\u2019s economy is expected to shrink 0.1% this year, the second consecutive year of contraction, and rebound modestly with 0.7% next year. Germany faces headwinds from a shortage of skilled labor, excessive bureaucracy and higher energy prices, and efforts to address those issues have been stalled by squabbling in Scholz\u2019s coalition.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, head of the EU\u2019s executive arm, is equipped with serious powers, especially on trade, a key EU authority delegated to Brussels by member countries. But there\u2019s only so much von der Leyen can do without political backing from the two biggest member countries, whose national budgets are bigger than the EU's.",
      "The most urgent matter may be how to respond to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office Jan. 20. European officials are trying to defuse a potential trade conflict involving new U.S. tariffs or import taxes on European goods that would seriously ding the continent\u2019s export-focused economy.",
      "Europe could decide not to retaliate to any U.S. tariffs, thus avoiding a mutually destructive tit-for-tat cycle. The bloc could also commit to buying U.S. liquefied natural gas to mollify Trump, or spend billions more on defense for Ukraine to answer his complaint that European countries don't meet NATO commitments on defense spending.",
      "Europe is seeing only modest growth as consumers pummeled by inflation remain cautious about spending. The economy is expected to expand 0.8% this year and 1.3% next year for the 20 EU member countries that use the euro currency, according to the European Commission.",
      "While the direct impact on growth is small, the political logjam means Europe is missing an important opportunity to engage Trump, said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank.",
      "\"It would be ideal if Europe \u2014 at the moment when Trump is not yet in office \u2014 would prepare a big offer for Trump, such as: We spend significantly more on defense, if on trade and on Ukraine you don\u2019t disappoint us. This is unfortunately not happening.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe risk is that Trump on trade might be tougher on us than otherwise because Germany and France are missing in action,\" he said.",
      "Von der Leyen can offer to get countries to purchase more U.S. natural gas and remind Trump that the EU could retaliate, but \u201cthe offer that Europe can make to Trump is small, rather than a big offer where there would be German and French money behind it.\u201d",
      "The EU commission estimates that as much as 500 billion euros ($528 billion) will be needed over the next decade to help meet the bloc\u2019s security needs. Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius has indicated common defense bonds could raise that enormous sum. But moving ahead without Germany, the bloc's biggest member, is hard to imagine.",
      "The big issues such as defense and competitiveness \u201crequire the fiscal and parliamentary resources of the biggest member states and the question is whether Germany and France are in a position to enable that at the European level,\" said Rahman.",
      "\u201cI think the answer is probably yes, but I feel a bit less certain than I would have had Germany and France not had this very difficult political time.\u201d",

      "GEORGETOWN, Guyana -- Guyana is revisiting a dark history nearly half a century after U.S. Rev. Jim Jones and more than 900 of his followers died in the rural interior of the South American country.",
      "It was the largest suicide-murder in recent history, and a government-backed tour operator wants to open the former commune now shrouded by lush vegetation to visitors, a proposal that is reopening old wounds, with critics saying it would disrespect victims and dig up a sordid past.",
      "Jordan Vilchez, who grew up in California and was moved into the Peoples Temple commune at age 14, told The Associated Press in a phone interview from the U.S. that she has mixed feelings about the tour.",
      "She was in Guyana\u2019s capital the day Jones ordered hundreds of his followers to drink a poisoned grape-flavored drink that was given to children first. Her two sisters and two nephews were among the victims.",
      "\u201cI just missed dying by one day,\u201d she recalled.",
      "Vilchez, 67, said Guyana has every right to profit from any plans related to Jonestown.",
      "\u201cThen on the other hand, I just feel like any situation where people were manipulated into their deaths should be treated with respect,\u201d she said.",
      "Vilchez added that she hopes the tour operator would provide context and explain why so many people went to Guyana trusting they would find a better life.",
      "The tour would ferry visitors to the far-flung village of Port Kaituma nestled in the lush jungles of northern Guyana. It\u2019s a trip available only by boat, helicopter or plane; rivers instead of roads connect Guyana\u2019s interior. Once there, it\u2019s another six miles via a rough and overgrown dirt trail to the abandoned commune and former agricultural settlement.",
      "Neville Bissember, a law professor at the University of Guyana, questioned the proposed tour, calling it a \u201cghoulish and bizarre\u201d idea in a recently published letter.",
      "\u201cWhat part of Guyana\u2019s nature and culture is represented in a place where death by mass suicide and other atrocities and human rights violations were perpetuated against a submissive group of American citizens, which had nothing to do with Guyana nor Guyanese?\u201d he wrote.",
      "Despite ongoing criticism, the tour has strong support from the government's Tourism Authority and Guyana\u2019s Tourism and Hospitality Association.",
      "Tourism Minister Oneidge Walrond told the AP the government is backing the effort at Jonestown but is aware \u201cof some level of push back\u201d from certain sectors of society.",
      "She said the government already has helped clear the area \u201cto ensure a better product can be marketed,\u201d adding that the tour might need Cabinet approval.",
      "\u201cIt certainly has my support,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is possible. After all, we have seen what Rwanda has done with that awful tragedy as an example.\u201d",
      "Rose Sewcharran, director of Wonderlust Adventures, the private tour operator who plans to take visitors to Jonestown, said she was buoyed by the support.",
      "\u201cWe think it is about time,\u201d she said. \u201cThis happens all over the world. We have multiple examples of dark, morbid tourism around the world, including Auschwitz and the Holocaust museum.\u201d",
      "The November 1978 mass suicide-murder was synonymous with Guyana for decades until huge amounts of oil and gas were discovered off the country\u2019s coast nearly a decade ago, making it one of the world\u2019s largest offshore oil producers.",
      "New roads, schools and hotels are being built across the capital, Georgetown, and beyond, and a country that rarely saw tourists is now hoping to attract more of them.",
      "An obvious attraction is Jonestown, argued Astill Paul, the co-pilot of a twin-engine plane that flew U.S. Rep. Leo J. Ryan of California and a U.S. news crew to a village near the commune a day before hundreds died on Nov. 18, 1978. He witnessed gunmen fatally shoot Ryan and four others as they tried to board the plane on Nov. 18 and fly back to the capital.",
      "Paul told the AP he believes the former commune should be developed as a heritage site.",
      "\u201cI sat on the tourism board years ago and did suggest we do this, but the minister at the time lashed the idea down because the government wanted nothing to do with morbid tourism,\u201d he recalled.",
      "Until recently, successive governments shunned Jonestown, arguing that the country\u2019s image was badly damaged by the mass murder-suicide, even though only a handful of Indigenous people died. The overwhelming majority of victims were Americans like Vilchez who flew to Guyana to follow Jones. Many endured beatings, forced labor, imprisonment and rehearsals for a mass suicide.",
      "Those in favor of a tour include Gerry Gouveia, a pilot who also flew when Jonestown was active.",
      "\u201cThe area should be reconstructed purely for tourists to get a first-hand understanding of its layout and what had happened,\" he said. \u201cWe should reconstruct the home of Jim Jones, the main pavilion and other buildings that were there.\u201d",
      "Today, all that is left is bits of a cassava mill, pieces of the main pavilion and a rusted tractor that once hauled a flatbed trailer to take temple members to the Port Kaituma airfield.",
      "Until now, most visitors to Jonestown have been reporters and family members of those who died.",
      "Organizing an expedition on one\u2019s own is daunting: the area is far from the capital and hard to access, and some consider the closest populated settlement dangerous.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still a very, very, very rough area,\u201d said Fielding McGehee, co-director of The Jonestown Institute, a nonprofit group. \u201cI don\u2019t see how this is going to be an economically feasible kind of project because of the vast amounts of money it would take to turn it into a viable place to visit.\u201d",
      "McGehee warned about relying on supposed witnesses who will be part of the tour. He said the memories and stories that have trickled down through generations might not be accurate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a game of telephone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does not help anyone understand what happened in Jonestown.\u201d",
      "He recalled how one survivor had proposed a personal project to develop the abandoned site, but those from the temple community said, \u2018Why do you want to do that?\u2019",
      "McGehee noted that dark tourism is popular, and that going to Jonestown means tourists could say they visited a place where more than 900 people died on the same day.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the prurient interest in tragedy,\u201d he said.",
      "If the tour eventually starts operating, not everything will be visible to tourists.",
      "When Vilchez returned to Guyana in 2018 for the first time since the mass suicide-murder, she made an offering to the land when she arrived in Jonestown.",
      "Among the things she buried in the abandoned commune where her sisters and nephews died were snippets of hair from her mother and father, who did not go to Jonestown.",
      "\u201cIt just felt like a gesture that honored the people that died,\u201d she said.",

      "As the search for UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson\u2019s killer stretches into a fourth day and beyond the New York City limits, investigators are reckoning with a tantalizing dichotomy",
      "NEW YORK -- They have seen him smiling on a hostel security camera, but don\u2019t know his name. They found the backpack he discarded while fleeing, but don\u2019t know where he's gone.",
      "As the search for UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson\u2019s killer goes on, investigators are reckoning with a tantalizing dichotomy: They have troves of evidence, but the shooter remains an enigma.",
      "Police don\u2019t know who he is, where he is, or why he did it, though they are confident it was a targeted attack instead of a random act.",
      "\u201cThe net is tightening,\u201d New York City Mayor Eric Adams said Saturday.",
      "Hours after he spoke, police divers were seen searching a pond in Central Park, where the killer fled after the shooting. Officers have been scouring the park for days for any possible clues and found his bag there Friday.",
      "Late Saturday, police released two additional photos of the suspected shooter that appeared to be from a camera mounted inside a taxi. The first shows him outside the vehicle and the second shows him looking through the partition between the back seat and the front of the cab. In both, his face is partially obscured by a blue, medical-style mask.",
      "Retracing the gunman\u2019s steps using surveillance video, police say, it appears he left the city by bus soon after the shooting Wednesday morning outside the New York Hilton Midtown. He was seen on video at an uptown bus station about 45 minutes later, NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said.",
      "With the high-profile search expanding across state lines, the FBI announced late Friday that it was offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction, adding to a reward of up to $10,000 that the NYPD has offered. Police say they believe the suspect acted alone.",
      "Police provided no updates on the hunt Saturday, but investigators are urging patience \u2014 even with a killer on the loose.",
      "Hundreds of detectives are combing through video recordings and social media, vetting tips from the public and interviewing people who might have information, including Thompson\u2019s family and coworkers and the shooter\u2019s randomly assigned roommates at the Manhattan hostel where he stayed.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t \u2018Blue Bloods.\u2019 We\u2019re not going to solve this in 60 minutes,\" Kenny told reporters Friday. \u201cWe\u2019re painstakingly going through every bit of evidence that we can come across.\u201d",
      "The shooter paid cash at the hostel, presented what police believe was a fake ID and is believed to have paid cash for taxi rides and other transactions. He didn't speak to others at the hostel and almost always kept his face covered with a mask, only lowering it while eating.",
      "But investigators caught a break when they came across security camera images of an unguarded moment in which he briefly showed his face soon after arriving in New York on Nov. 24.",
      "Police distributed the images to news outlets and on social media but so far haven't been able to ID him using facial recognition \u2014 possibly because of the angle of the images or limitations on how the NYPD is allowed to use that technology, Kenny said.",
      "On Friday evening, investigators found a backpack in Central Park that had been worn by the gunman, police said. They didn\u2019t immediately reveal what, if anything, it contained but said it would be tested and analyzed.",
      "Another potential clue, a fingerprint on an item he purchased at a Starbucks minutes before the shooting, has so far proven useless for identifying him, Kenny said.",
      "Aided by surveillance cameras on nearly every building and block, police have been able to retrace the shooter\u2019s movements.",
      "They know he ambushed Thompson at 6:44 a.m. as the executive arrived at the Hilton for his company\u2019s annual investor conference, using a 9 mm pistol that resembled the guns farmers use to put down animals without causing a loud noise. They know ammunition found near Thompson\u2019s body bore the words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose,\u201d mimicking a phrase used by insurance industry critics.",
      "Kenny said the fact that the shooter knew UnitedHealthcare group was holding a conference at the hotel and what route Thompson might take to get there suggested that he could possibly be a disgruntled employee or client.",
      "Investigators know from surveillance video that the shooter fled into Central Park on a bicycle and ditched it around 7 a.m. near 85th Street.",
      "He then walked a couple blocks and got into a taxi, arriving at 7:30 a.m. at the George Washington Bridge Bus Station, which is near the northern tip of Manhattan and offers commuter service to New Jersey and Greyhound routes to Philadelphia, Boston and Washington.",
      "Investigators don't know what happened next. They are searching through more surveillance video but have yet to locate video of the shooter getting on a bus or exiting the station.",
      "\u201cWe have reason to believe that the person in question has left New York City,\u201d Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch told CNN on Friday.",
      "Police have determined from video that the gunman was in the city for 10 days before the shooting. He arrived at Manhattan\u2019s main bus terminal on a Greyhound bus that originated in Atlanta, though it's not clear whether he embarked there or at one of about a half-dozen stops along the route.",
      "Immediately after that, he took a cab to the vicinity of the Hilton and was there for about a half hour, Kenny said.",
      "At around 11 p.m. on the night he arrived, he went by taxi to the HI New York City Hostel. It was there, while speaking with an employee in the lobby, that he briefly pulled down the mask and smiled, giving investigators the brief glimpse they are now relying on to identify and capture a killer.",

      "Carlotta Walls LaNier, one the nine Black students who desegregated Little Rock Central High School in 1957, launched a bottle of sparkling wine into the hull of the Virginia-class submarine at Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia.",
      "In 2018, then-Navy Secretary Ray Mabus named the six women of the Little Rock Nine as sponsors of the ship. Besides LaNier, Elizabeth Eckford and Gloria Ray Karlmark also attended the ceremony. All the sponsors had their initials welded into steel plates when the submarine's keel was laid in 2022.",
      "\u201cHistory is full of groups of collective people who come together to make something happen,\u201d the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported that LaNier said in a speech before the crowd at the shipyard. \u201cMany people are behind the submarine that we christened today. It\u2019s similar to the quote on our currency, E pluribus unum \u2014 \u2018Out of many, one.\u2019 We have SSN 800, but many participated in the reality of it being here today.\u201d",
      "Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro called the ship \u201cthe very best of our submarine force capabilities.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe will always be propelled by the proud legacy of her namesake, represented here today by three of her courageous sponsors, who overcame tremendous adversity as members of the Little Rock Nine,\u201d Del Toro said.",
      "A number of speakers also noted the 83rd anniversary of Japan's attack in Pearl Harbor, the event that launched the United States into World War II.",
      "The submarine is the fifth naval ship named for Arkansas, including a battleship. The most recent was a guided missile cruiser that was decommissioned in 1988.",
      "The Arkansas is the 27th in a series of Virginia-class submarines and the 13th built at Newport News, a massive shipyard owned by Huntington Ingalls Industries. The other submarines are built at General Dynamics Corp.'s Electric Boat shipyard in Connecticut.",
      "The Arkansas is expected to launch in 2025."

      "The studio confirmed on Saturday that Steve Mensch, its 62-year-old president and general manager, had died.",
      "\u201cWe are incredibly saddened by the passing of our dear friend Steve Mensch,\" the studio said in a statement. \"Steve was a cherished member of our team for more than eight years and well-beloved in the community of Atlanta. It\u2019s hard to imagine not seeing him smiling throughout the halls. We will miss him dearly. Our heart goes out to his family as we all send them our prayers.\u201d",
      "The crash happened in Homosassa, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) north of Tampa. Photos from the scene show the plane having come to rest upside down on a road. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating.",
      "The single-engine Vans RV-12IS was registered to Mensch at his home address in the Atlanta suburb of Fayetteville, according to FAA records.",

      "NEW YORK -- The gunman who killed the CEO of the largest U.S. health insurer likely left New York City on a bus soon after the brazen ambush that has shaken corporate America, police officials said. But he left something behind: a backpack that was discovered in Central Park.",
      "Nearly four days after the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, police still did not know the gunman\u2019s name or whereabouts or have a motive for the killing. Investigators were looking at whether the shooter may have been a disgruntled employee or client of the insurer, Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny told reporters.",
      "The FBI announced Friday night it was offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction.",
      "Video of the gunman fleeing Wednesday\u2019s shooting showed him riding a bicycle into Central Park and later taking a taxi to a bus terminal that offers commuter service to New Jersey and Greyhound routes to Philadelphia, Boston and Washington, D.C, according to Kenny.",
      "Police have video of the man entering the bus station but no video of him exiting, leading them to believe he left the city, Kenny said.",
      "Investigators on Friday found a backpack in the park that had been worn by the gunman during the shooting, police said, following a massive sweep to find it in a vast area with lakes and ponds, meadows, playgrounds and woods.",
      "Police didn\u2019t immediately reveal what, if anything, it contained but said it would be analyzed for clues.",
      "The gunman made sure to conceal his identity with a mask during almost all of his time in the city, including during the attack and while he ate, yet left a trail of evidence in view of the nation\u2019s biggest city and its network of security cameras.",
      "The gunman arrived in New York City on Nov. 24 and shot Thompson 10 days later outside his company\u2019s annual investor conference at a hotel just blocks from Radio City Music Hall and Rockefeller Center.",
      "The gunman got off a bus that originated in Atlanta and made several stops along the way, Kenny said. Police have not determined where he got on the bus. Investigators have a list of passengers, but none of them would have had to provide an ID when they climbed aboard, Kenny said.",
      "Investigators believe the suspect used a fake identification card and paid cash, Kenny said, when he checked in at the hostel, which has a caf\u00e9 along with shared and private rooms and is blocks from Columbia University.",
      "Investigators have tested a discarded water bottle and protein bar wrapper in a hunt for his DNA. They also were trying to obtain additional information from a cellphone found along the gunman\u2019s escape route.",
      "Photos of the suspected shooter that were taken in the lobby of a hostel on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side appear to from the only time he removed his mask, Kenny said. The images, showing a man smiling in the lobby of the HI New York City hostel. They are among a collection of photos and video circulated since the shooting \u2014 including footage of the attack, as well as images of the suspected gunman at a Starbucks beforehand.",
      "\u201cFrom every indication we have from witnesses, from the Starbucks, from the hostel, he kept his mask on at all times except for the one instance where we have him photographed with the mask off,\u201d Kenny said.",
      "His roommates at the hostel also said he didn\u2019t speak to them. Nothing of investigative value was found in a search of the suspected shooter\u2019s hotel room.",
      "Asked how close he felt police were to making an arrest, Kenny said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t \u2018Blue Bloods.\u2019 We\u2019re not going to solve this in 60 minutes. We\u2019re painstakingly going through every bit of evidence that we can come across. Eventually, when an apprehension is made, we will have to present all of these facts to a judge and jury, so we\u2019re taking our time, doing it right and making sure we\u2019re going to get justice for this victim and closure for his family.\u201d",
      "Security video of the shooting shows the killer approaching Thompson from behind, firing several shots with a gun equipped with a silencer, barely pausing to clear a jam while the executive fell to the sidewalk.",
      "Police were looking into the possibility that the weapon was a veterinary pistol, which is a weapon commonly used on farms and ranches if an animal has to be euthanized quietly, Kenny said \u2014 though he stressed that hadn\u2019t been confirmed.",
      "The words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were scrawled on the ammunition, one word on each of three bullets, Kenny said. A law enforcement official previously told The Associated Press the words were \u201cdeny,\u201d \u201cdefend\u201d and \u201cdepose.\u201d The messages mirror the phrase \u201cdelay, deny, defend,\u201d which is commonly used by lawyers and critics about insurers that delay payments, deny claims and defend their actions.",

      "The fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare's CEO has opened the door for many people to vent their frustrations and anger over the insurance industry",
      "For years, patients in the U.S. health care system have grown frustrated with a bureaucracy they don\u2019t understand.",
      "Doctors are included in an insurer\u2019s network one year but not the next. Getting someone on the phone to help can be next to impossible. Coverage of care and prescriptions is often unceremoniously denied.",
      "This week\u2019s fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has unleashed a wave of public feeling \u2014 exasperation, anger, resentment, helplessness \u2014 from Americans sharing personal stories of interactions with insurance companies, often seen as faceless corporate giants.",
      "In particular, the words written on ammunition found at the shooting scene \u2014 \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose,\u201d echoing a phrase used to describe how insurers dodge claim payouts \u2014 amplified voices that have long been critical of the industry.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden, I am fired up again,\u201d said Tim Anderson, describing how his wife, Mary, had to deal with UnitedHealthcare coverage denials before she died from Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in 2022.",
      "Anderson said they couldn\u2019t get coverage for machines to help his wife breathe or talk \u2014 toward the end, she communicated by blinking when he showed her pictures. The family had to rely on donations from a local ALS group, he said.",
      "\u201cThe business model for insurance is don\u2019t pay,\u201d said Anderson, 67, of Centerville, Ohio.",
      "\u201cWhen Mary could still talk, she said to me to keep fighting this,\u201d he added. \u201cIt needs to be exposed.\u201d",
      "For Anderson and others, Thompson's death and the message left at the scene have created an opportunity to vent their frustrations. Conversations at dinner tables, office water coolers, social gatherings and on social media have pivoted to the topic, as police efforts to find the gunman keep the case in the news.",
      "Hans Maristela said he understands why the chatter is bubbling up. The 54-year-old caregiver in California was moved to comment on Facebook about UnitedHealthcare's reputation of denying coverage. As a Catholic, he said, he grieves Thompson's death and feels for his family, especially with the holidays around the corner.",
      "But he sees frustration with insurers even among his clients, most of them wealthy older people who've not been shielded from high out-of-pocket costs.",
      "\u201cAnd then you know the CEO of this company you pay a lot of money to gets $10 million dollars a year, you won\u2019t have a lot of sympathy for the guy,\" Maristela said, citing Thompson's compensation package that included base pay and stock options. \u201cHealth care is a business, I understand, but the obsession with share price, with profit, has to be reevaluated.\u201d",
      "University of Pennsylvania researcher Michael Anne Kyle said she's not surprised by the growth of conversation around insurers.",
      "\u201cPeople are often struggling with this by themselves, and when you see someone else talk about it, that may prompt you to join the conversation,\u201d she said.",
      "Kyle studies how patients access care and said she's seen frustration with the system build for years. Costs are rising, and insurers are using more controls such as prior authorizations and doctor networks to manage them. Patients are often stuck in the middle of disputes between doctors and insurers.",
      "\u201cPatients are already spending a lot of money on health care, and then they\u2019re still facing problems with the service,\u201d she said.",
      "Insurers often note that most of the money they bring in goes back out the door to pay claims, and that they try to corral soaring costs and the overuse of some care.",
      "In Ohio, Anderson said his initial reaction to the CEO shooting was to question whether it was connected to a coverage denial, like the ones he'd experienced with his wife.",
      "\u201cI definitely do not condone killing people,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I read it and said, 'I wonder if somebody had a spouse whose coverage was denied.\u2019\u201d",
      "It's something Will Flanary, a Portland-based ophthalmologist and comedian with a large social media following, saw online a lot in the shooting's immediate aftermath and found very telling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s zero sympathy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the lesson to take away from that is not, \u2018Let\u2019s shame people for celebrating a murder.\u2019 No, it\u2019s: \u2018Look at the amount of anger that people have toward this system that\u2019s taken advantage of people and do something to try to fix that.\u2019\u201d",

      "TWIN FALLS, Idaho -- The federal government on Friday approved a scaled-down wind farm in Idaho over local opposition, including from groups concerned about its proximity to a historic site where Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II.",
      "The Bureau of Land Management signed off on a final plan for the Lava Ridge Wind Project northeast of Twin Falls that decreases the number of wind turbines to 241 from 400 and imposes a maximum height of 660 feet (201 meters). The agency said the area \u201cdisturbed\u201d by the project has been reduced by half from the initial proposal, with 992 acres (401 hectares) disturbed within a 38,535-acre (15,594-hectare) area.",
      "The agency said the project could power up to 500,000 homes and that its approval \u201creflects a careful balance of clean energy development with the protection of natural, cultural, and socioeconomic resources on this historically significant landscape.\u201d",
      "Some groups have expressed concern over the high desert site's potential impacts on the Minidoka National Historic Site, where thousands of Japanese Americans were imprisoned during World War II.",
      "Friends of Minidoka, a group that works to preserve the site and educate about its history, said it was reviewing the decision but that it remained disappointed by a project it views as harming the area's \u201csacredness.\u201d",
      "\u201cMinidoka National Historic Site holds deep significance to both the nation as a whole and to the Japanese American community about the lessons of a gross violation of constitutional rights on a group of American citizens,\u201d Robyn Achilles, the group's executive director, said in an email.",
      "Under the final version of the project, the closest turbine to the historic site would be 9 miles (14 kilometers) away.",
      "Two months after the Japan\u2019s Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066. Roughly 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry were taken from their homes and incarcerated in camps as a potential threat against the U.S. Many were elderly, disabled, children or infants.",
      "Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador has also opposed the wind project.

      "SAO PAULO -- Brazil soccer extended its kit deal with Nike by 12 years to 2038 on Friday.",
      "A person familiar with the agreement told The Associated Press it was worth $100 million per year, plus royalties on the sale of national team shirts which were not included in previous contracts.",
      "The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to disclose the terms of the deal.",

      "\u201cThis contract shows the strength of Brazilian soccer,\u201d CBF president Ednaldo Rodrigues said. \u201cThis is one of the longest and most successful partnerships in soccer and, together, we will keep celebrating the brilliance of Brazilian soccer and honor the jogo bonito legacy.\u201d",

      "TikTok\u2019s future in the U.S. appeared uncertain on Friday after a federal appeals court rejected a legal challenge the company brought against a law that requires it to cut ties with its China-based parent company or be banned by mid-January",
      "TikTok's future in the U.S. appeared uncertain on Friday after a federal appeals court rejected a legal challenge to a law that requires the social media platform to cut ties with its China-based parent company or be banned by mid-January.",
      "A panel of three judges on The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled unanimously that the law withstood constitutional scrutiny, rebuffing arguments from the two companies that the statute violated their rights and the rights of TikTok users in the U.S.",
      "The government has said it wants ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, to divest its stakes. But if it doesn't and the platform goes away, it would have a seismic impact on the lives of content creators who rely on the platform for income as well as users who use it for entertainment and connection.",
      "Here are some details on the ruling and what could happen next:",
      "In their lawsuit, TikTok and ByteDance, which is also a plaintiff in the case, had challenged the law on various fronts, arguing in part that the statute ran afoul of the First Amendment and was an unconstitutional bill of attainder that unfairly targeted the two companies.",
      "But the court sided with attorneys for the Justice Department who said that the government was attempting to address national security concerns and the way in which it chose to do so did not violate the constitution.",
      "The Justice Department has argued in court that TikTok poses a national security risk due to its connections to China. Officials say that Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread, or suppress, information. However, the U.S. hasn't publicly provided examples of that happening.",
      "The appeals court ruling, written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg, said the law was \u201ccarefully crafted to deal only with control by a foreign adversary.\" The judges also rejected the claim that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Furthermore, Ginsburg wrote the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to \u201csuppress content or require a certain mix of content\u201d on TikTok.",
      "TikTok and ByteDance are expected to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, but it's unclear whether the court will take up the case.",
      "TikTok indicated in a statement on Friday the two companies are preparing to take their case to high court, saying the Supreme Court has \u201can established historical record of protecting Americans\u2019 right to free speech.\"",
      "\"We expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\u201d a company spokesperson said.",
      "Alan Morrison, a professor at The George Washington University Law School, said he expects the Supreme Court to take up the case because of the novelty of the issues raised in the lawsuit. If that happens, attorneys for the two companies still have to convince the court to grant them an emergency stay that will prevent the government from enforcing the Jan. 19 divestiture deadline stipulated in the law, Morrison said.",
      "Such a move could drag out the process until the Justices make a ruling.",
      "Tiffany Cianci, a TikTok content creator who has supported the platform, said she was not shocked about the outcome of the court's ruling on Friday because lower courts typically defer to the executive branch on these types of cases. She believes the company will have a stronger case at the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cI believe that the next stages are more likely to produce a victory for TikTokers and for TikTok as a whole,\u201d Cianci said.",
      "Another wild card is President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the recent presidential campaign that he is now against such action.",
      "The Trump transition team has not offered details on how Trump plans to carry out his pledge to \u201csave TikTok.\" But spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement last month that he plans to \u201cdeliver\u201d on his campaign promises.",
      "After Trump takes office on Jan. 20th, it would fall on his Justice Department to enforce the law and punish any potential violators. Penalties would apply to any app stores that would violate a prohibition on TikTok and to internet hosting services which would be barred from supporting it.",
      "Some have speculated that Trump could ask his Justice Department to abstain from enforcing the law. But tech companies like Apple and Google, which offer TikTok's app on their app stores, would then have to trust that the administration would not come after them for any violations.",
      "Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said enforcement discretion \u2014 or executive orders \u2014 can not override existing law, leaving Trump with \u201climited room for unilateral action.\"",
      "There are other things Trump could potentially do. It's possible he could invoke provisions of the law that allow the president to determine whether a sale or a similar transaction frees TikTok from \u201cforeign adversary\u201d control. Another option is to urge Congress to repeal the law. But that too would require support from congressional Republicans who have overwhelmingly supported the prospect of getting TikTok out of the hands of a Chinese company.",
      "In a statement issued Friday, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, said he was \u201coptimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok\u201d and allow its continued use in the United States.",
      "ByteDance has said it won't sell TikTok. And even if it wanted to, a sale of the proprietary algorithm that powers TikTok is likely to get blocked under Chinese export controls that the country issued in 2020.",
      "That means if TikTok is sold without the algorithm, its likely that the buyer would only purchase a shell of the platform that doesn't contain the technology that made the app a cultural powerhouse.",
      "Still, some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in buying it.",
      "This week, a spokesperson for McCourt\u2019s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital. The spokesperson did not disclose the identity of the participants."

      "The U.S. government has ordered testing of the nation\u2019s milk supply for bird flu to better monitor the spread of the virus in dairy cows",
      "The U.S. government on Friday ordered testing of the nation's milk supply for bird flu to better monitor the spread of the virus in dairy cows.",
      "Raw or unpasteurized milk from dairy farms and processors nationwide must be tested on request starting Dec. 16, the Agriculture Department said. Testing will begin in six states \u2014 California, Colorado, Michigan, Mississippi, Oregon and Pennsylvania.",
      "Officials said the move is aimed at \u201ccontaining and ultimately eliminating the virus,\" known as Type A H5N1, which was detected for the first time in March in U.S. dairy cows. Since then, more than 700 herds have been confirmed to be infected in 15 states.",
      "\u201cThis will give farms and farmworkers better confidence in the safety of their animals and ability to protect themselves, and it will put us on a path to quickly controlling and stopping the virus\u2019 spread nationwide,\u201d Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement.",
      "The risk to people from bird flu remains low, health officials said. Pasteurization, or heat treatment, kills the virus in milk, leaving it safe to drink.",
      "Veterinarians, farmers, scientists and academics have been calling for nationwide milk testing for months, said Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, who led the efforts.",
      "\u201cIt's another step in the right direction,\u201d Poulsen said. \u201cThey're coming around that we need a better handle on it.\u201d",
      "Dairy farmers and processors across the U.S. have been reluctant to test animals or milk for the virus, fearing economic or other repercussions. Jamie Jonker, chief science officer of the National Milk Producers Federation, said the industry supports USDA efforts to eliminate the virus.",
      "Under the federal order, dairy farmers and those who handle raw milk intended for pasteurization must provide samples of the milk on request for testing for bird flu. It requires reporting of positive tests to the USDA and it requires herd owners to provide basic information to allow tracing of the disease in cattle.",
      "The move follows an April 24 federal order that mandated testing of certain dairy cattle before they could move between states and required reporting of any positive tests. Despite that order, the virus has continued to spread, Poulsen noted.",
      "Raw milk from infected cows contains high loads of live virus, testing has shown.",
      "At least 58 people in the U.S. have been infected with bird flu, mostly farm workers who became mildly ill after close contact with infected cows, including their milk, or infected poultry.",
      "Bird flu has also been spreading among wild birds and a number of other animals.",
      "Federal officials continue to warn against drinking raw milk, which can contain a host of germs that make people sick. In California, officials quarantined a farm and halted distribution of milk after bird flu virus was detected in raw milk sold in stores. Raw Farm of Fresno issued a voluntary recall of raw milk and cream produced after Nov. 9.",

      "A federal appeals court panel on Friday unanimously upheld a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok as soon as next month, handing a resounding defeat to the popular social media platform as it fights for its survival in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied TikTok's petition to overturn the law \u2014 which requires TikTok to break ties with its China-based parent company ByteDance or be banned by mid-January \u2014 and rebuffed the company's challenge of the statute, which it argued had ran afoul of the First Amendment.",
      "\u201cThe First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\u201d said the court's opinion, which was written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg. \u201cHere the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary\u2019s ability to gather data on people in the United States.\u201d",
      "TikTok and ByteDance \u2014 another plaintiff in the lawsuit \u2014 are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, though its unclear whether the court will take up the case.",
      "\u201cThe Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said in a statement.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the TikTok ban was conceived and pushed through based upon inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people,\u201d Hughes said. Unless stopped, he argued the statute \u201cwill silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in the US and around the world on January 19th, 2025.\u201d",
      "Though the case is squarely in the court system, it's also possible the two companies might be thrown some sort of a lifeline by President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the presidential campaign that he is now against such action.",
      "\u201cHe wants to save TikTok,\u201d Rep. Michael Waltz, Trump's pick for national security adviser, said Friday during an interview on Fox Business.",
      "The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April, was the culmination of a yearslong saga in Washington over the short-form video-sharing app, which the government sees as a national security threat due to its connections to China.",
      "The U.S. has said it\u2019s concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that\u2019s difficult to detect. The European Union on Friday expressed similar concerns as it investigates intelligence that suggests Russia possibly abused the platform to influence the elections in Romania.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Friday.",
      "TikTok, which sued the government over the law in May, has long denied it could be used by Beijing to spy on or manipulate Americans. Its attorneys have accurately pointed out that the U.S. hasn\u2019t provided evidence to show that the company handed over user data to the Chinese government, or manipulated content for Beijing\u2019s benefit in the U.S. They have also argued the law is predicated on future risks, which the Department of Justice has emphasized pointing in part to unspecified action it claims the two companies have taken in the past due to demands from the Chinese government.",
      "Friday\u2019s ruling came after the appeals court panel, composed of two Republicans and one Democrat appointed judges, heard oral arguments in September.",
      "In the hearing, which lasted more than two hours, the panel appeared to grapple with how TikTok\u2019s foreign ownership affects its rights under the Constitution and how far the government could go to curtail potential influence from abroad on a foreign-owned platform. On Friday, all three denied TikTok\u2019s petition.",
      "In the court's ruling, Ginsburg, a Republican appointee, rejected TikTok's main legal arguments against the law, including that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder, or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. He also said the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to \"suppress content or require a certain mix of content\u201d on TikTok.",
      "\u201cContent on the platform could in principle remain unchanged after divestiture, and people in the United States would remain free to read and share as much PRC propaganda (or any other content) as they desire on TikTok or any other platform of their choosing,\u201d Ginsburg wrote, using the abbreviation for the People\u2019s Republic of China.",
      "Judge Sri Srinivasan, the chief judge on the court, issued a concurring opinion.",
      "TikTok\u2019s lawsuit was consolidated with a second legal challenge brought by several content creators \u2014 for which the company is covering legal costs \u2014 as well as a third one filed on behalf of conservative creators who work with a nonprofit called BASED Politics Inc. Other organizations, including the Knight First Amendment Institute, had also filed amicus briefs supporting TikTok.",
      "\u201cThis is a deeply misguided ruling that reads important First Amendment precedents too narrowly and gives the government sweeping power to restrict Americans\u2019 access to information, ideas, and media from abroad,\u201d said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the organization. \u201cWe hope that the appeals court\u2019s ruling won\u2019t be the last word.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, lawmakers who had pushed for the legislation celebrated the court's ruling.",
      "\"I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,\u201d said Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China.",
      "Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who co-authored the law, said \u201cit's time for ByteDance to accept\u201d the law.",
      "To assuage concerns about the company\u2019s owners, TikTok says it has invested more than $2 billion to bolster protections around U.S. user data.",
      "The company has also argued the government\u2019s broader concerns could have been resolved in a draft agreement it provided the Biden administration more than two years ago during talks between the two sides. It has blamed the government for walking away from further negotiations on the agreement, which the Justice Department argues is insufficient.",
      "Attorneys for the two companies have claimed it\u2019s impossible to divest the platform commercially and technologically. They also say any sale of TikTok without the coveted algorithm \u2014 the platform\u2019s secret sauce that Chinese authorities would likely block under any divesture plan \u2014 would turn the U.S. version of TikTok into an island disconnected from other global content.",
      "Still, some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in purchasing the platform. Both men said earlier this year that they were launching a consortium to purchase TikTok\u2019s U.S. business.",
      "This week, a spokesperson for McCourt\u2019s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said unnamed participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital."

      "Deciding whether Juan Soto tops Shohei Ohtani for baseball\u2019s largest contract could be in the eye of the beholder because of all the deferred money in Ohtani\u2019s deal",
      "NEW YORK -- Deciding whether Juan Soto tops Shohei Ohtani for baseball\u2019s largest contract could be in the eye of the beholder because of all the deferred money in Ohtani's deal.",
      "Ohtani agreed last December to a $700 million, 10-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers, easily exceeding the previous high set when Mike Trout and the Los Angeles Angels struck a $426.5 million, 12-year agreement through 2030.",
      "Ohtani\u2019s deal includes $680 million in deferred money payable from 2034-43. There are several interpretations for how to value that deal in current dollars:",
      "1. For baseball's luxury tax, the average annual value is pegged at $46.08 million using a 4.33% discount rate.2. The players' association uses a 5% rate, which puts the value at $43.75 million per season.3. For MLB's regular payroll, a 10% rate results in a $28.21 million per year rate.",
      "1. For baseball's luxury tax, the average annual value is pegged at $46.08 million using a 4.33% discount rate.",
      "2. The players' association uses a 5% rate, which puts the value at $43.75 million per season.",
      "3. For MLB's regular payroll, a 10% rate results in a $28.21 million per year rate.",
      "Soto could get a contract of 10-to-15 years for $600 million or more.",
      "His agent, Scott Boras, is not a big fan of deferred money and thinks teams might not insist on delaying the cash.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s much less of an issue than it was before,\u201d Boras said. \u201cDeferral as a mechanism for me, is it: Will it impede my ability to get the greatest asset I can acquire? And the answer to that is I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to want to do anything that impedes their primary pursuit and goal.\u201d",
      "The interest figure used for discounting to determine luxury tax value is set in the collective bargaining agreement as the federal mid-term rate defined in section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code for the October preceding the initial contract year.",
      "That rate dropped to 3.7% this offseason, which meant if Ohtani\u2019s deal had been agreed to this month, its annual luxury tax value would have been about $49.3 million. That would have resulted in an additional $3.5 million annual tax bill for the Dodgers, who will exceed the top threshold and would pay additional tax at a 110% rate on each dollar.",
      "MLB\u2019s regular payrolls, which use the same rate as the one for calculating the qualifying offer price based on the 125 largest contracts, use the prime rate set by J.P. Morgan Chase on the preceding Nov. 1 plus 1%, rounded to the nearest full percentage point. That figure dropped to 9% for this offseason.",
      "Deferred compensation must be funded by the second July 1 after the season in which it was earned, discounted to a present-day value at a 5% rate.",
      "Los Angeles owes deferred payments just over $1 billion due from 2028-46 to Ohtani, Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman, Will Smith, Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez, Blake Snell and Tommy Edman.",
      "\u201cIt's just trying to kick dollars down the road,\u201d St. Louis Cardinals president of baseball operations John Mozeliak said at the general managers meetings last month.",
      "Ohtani's payments are two-thirds of the total owed.",
      "\u201cIt was a unique situation for where a club was, a unique situation for a player who has very significant earning potential outside of strictly his compensation from a club,\" New York Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns said. \u201cThose other ones are much more representative of what you see in sort of standard contracts around the industry. Each organization, each ownership group is going to have a slightly different perspective on this, on how they\u2019re calculating the returns off of that deferred compensation.\u201d",
      "Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman said his team's leadership from Guggenheim Baseball Management has the expertise to fund deferred compensation wisely.",
      "\"A lot of our ownership group are from financial background and can have that money going to work right now,\" he said.",
      "MLB proposed during collective bargaining on June 21, 2021, to put an end to the practice.",
      "\u201cFor contracts entered into after the effective date of the Basic Agreement, deferred compensation of any kind will not be permitted,\u201d the proposal read, according to a copy obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "That idea was rejected by the union and not included in the five-year agreement that expires in December 2026.",
      "New York Yankees general manager Brian Cashman thinks his team's large resources encourage players to seek their money as soon as possible.",
      "\u201cWe're open to deferrals,\" he said. \"A lot of times players are less open to doing deferrals for us than they are for maybe other markets, but if we can do stuff that benefits us, of course we will.\u201d",

In September, Stellantis recalled nearly 1.5 million Ram pickup trucks worldwide to fix a software problem that can disable the electronic stability control system.",
      "Last week Stellantis announced that CEO Carlos Tavares was stepping down after nearly four years in the top spot of the carmaker.",
      "In addition to the recalls, Stellantis has been struggling with falling sales that have led to layoffs and contributed to ballooning inventory on dealer lots. Last quarter, Stellantis reported that net revenues plunged 27% from the same period a year ago.",

      "Scottie Scheffler ended his biggest year with another victory",
      "NASSAU, Bahamas -- Scottie Scheffler returned from a two-month break and nothing changed. He won the Hero World Challenge on Sunday with a 9-under 63 to tie the tournament record at Albany Golf Club and win by six shots.",
      "Scheffler, the first player since Tiger Woods in 2009 to spend an entire calendar year at No. 1 in the world, won for the ninth time in 21 starts, a tally that included a second Masters title, an Olympic gold medal and the FedEx Cup.",
      "He started the final round one shot behind Justin Thomas, took the lead on the par-5 third hole, stayed in front with a 50-foot birdie putt on No. 4 and never looked back.",
      "Tom Kim tried to stay close until he missed a 19-inch par putt on the par-5 11th. He birdied the final hole for a 68 and was runner-up when Thomas, whose faint hopes ended with a bogey on the 18th, drove into the water on the 18th for another bogey. He shot 71 and finished third.",
      "Scheffler finished at 25-under 263 to tie the tournament record at Albany first set by Bubba Watson in 2015, and his six-shot victory was the largest in the nine years Tiger Woods' holiday tournament has been held in the Bahamas.",
      "Jordan Spieth holds the tournament records for 72-hole score (262) and margin (10 shots) the one year it was held at Isleworth in 2014.",
      "\u201cVery satisfying,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cI did a lot of good stuff today on the course. It feels nice to take a break and come back and continue to play some really solid golf.\u201d",
      "Already the best in golf, Scheffler brought a new \u201cclaw\u201d putting grip to the Hero World Challenge in a bid to get even better. He used the grip on putts from about 15 feet and in, and he finished the week third in the key putting statistic against a 20-man field.",
      "\u201cHe really doesn't do anything wrong,\u201d tournament host Tiger Woods said in the NBC booth during the final round.",
      "What reminded Woods of his own great run \u2014 and there was a lot of them for Woods \u2014 was how few mistakes Scheffler makes during a round or a tournament. Albany was another example. He made only two bogeys over 72 holes.",
      "Thomas, whose last victory was the 2022 PGA Championship at Southern Hills, started well enough. He also dropped two early shots on the par 3s and twice had duffed chips, one of them on the par-5 ninth that kept him from making birdie in a bid to keep up with Scheffler.",
      "Scheffler had a three-shot lead with three holes to play when he made a rare mistake off the tee, finding a sandy area right of the fairway. He made clean contact out of the sand to 12 feet for birdie, while Thomas went just long and over the green, leading to bogey.",
      "Still to come for Scheffler is teaming up with Rory McIlroy in a made-for-TV match at Shadow Creek in Las Vegas on Dec. 17 to face LIV Golf stars Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka.",
      "Scheffler earned $1 million for winning the unofficial tournament. That was his smallest paycheck of the year for winning except for the Olympics \u2014 the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee paid gold medalists $37,500.",
      "He joined Viktor Hovland as the only back-to-back winners at Albany. Woods won back-to-back, and a total of five times, when the tournament was held at Sherwood Country Club.",
      "Kim lives in Dallas and used to play with Scheffler all the time before Scheffler's wife gave birth to their first child. Kim knows what to expect.",
      "\u201cIt's not where we home and shoots even par, 1 over, and he comes out here and wins,\u201d Kim said. \u201cHe does it all the time. I think the biggest thing that I see is that he\u2019s always trying to get better. Despite winning nine times this year, he\u2019s always finding little ways and I think it\u2019s really, really cool to see and you can take a lot from that.\u201d",
      "In the last 40 years, Scheffler's winning rate of 43% worldwide is third behind Woods in 2006 (nine wins in 19 starts) and Woods in 2002 (10 wins in 22 starts).",
      "\u201cI never really played golf for legacy. That\u2019s not something I think about day to day. I play because I love the competition,\u201d Scheffler said. \"I like trying to get the most out of myself out here on the golf course. That\u2019s why I\u2019m always trying to improve, trying to do little things to get better he golf course.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think about records, I don\u2019t think about achievements, wins, losses, I just try and get the most out of myself and come out here and compete and have a good attitude.\u201d",
      "What next?",
      "\u201cContinue to work on the stuff in the offseason and get ready for next season,\u201d Scheffler said.",

      "Tua Tagovailoa threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Jonnu Smith in overtime and the Miami Dolphins overcame Aaron Rodgers\u2019 first 300-yard passing game in nearly three years to beat the New York Jets 32-26",
      "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- Tua Tagovailoa wouldn't want to repeat everything that was said in the Miami Dolphins' huddle Sunday when they trailed the New York Jets in the fourth quarter.",
      "\u201cJust know we were getting after everyone inside the huddle,\" Tagovailoa said, \"to make sure you're blocking the way you need to block, you're running the routes the way you need to be \u2014 you need to be in the right spots.\"",
      "Whatever was said helped keep Miami's slim playoff hopes alive as the Dolphins (6-7) overcame 8- and 3-point fourth-quarter deficits, as well as one of Aaron Rodgers' best games in years, to beat the Jets 32-26.",
      "Tagovailoa sealed it with a 10-yard touchdown pass to Jonnu Smith in overtime to help the Dolphins spoil Rodgers' first 300-yard passing game in nearly three years and beat the Jets for the ninth straight time in Miami.",
      "After Jason Sanders tied it with 7 seconds left in regulation with a 42-yard field goal, Tagovailoa quickly moved the Dolphins down the field.",
      "That came after Anders Carlson gave the struggling Jets (3-10) \u2014 who were eliminated from postseason contention for the 14th straight year \u2014 the lead with a 42-yarder with 52 seconds remaining. But Malik Washington put the Dolphins in great position to help set up Sanders' field goal with a 45-yard kickoff return to Miami's 46-yard line.",
      "\u201cIt was one of those moments where you make a split (second)- decision and just take it and see what happens next,\" the rookie Washington said, \"and be a football player.\u201d",
      "Tagovailoa was 33 of 47 for 331 yards and two TDs. He had just one incompletion on Miami's eight-play, 70-yard scoring drive that was capped by Smith's fourth touchdown of the season. Smith didn\u2019t have a reception before catching three passes for 44 yards on the winning drive.",
      "\u201cA win means a lot,\u201d said Tagovailoa, who has 300 yards passing in three straight games. \u201cIt means a lot because we have no room for error to lose another game.\"",
      "Rodgers was 27 of 39 for 339 yards, ending a drought of 34 regular-season games without a 300-yard passing game \u2014 dating to Dec. 12, 2021, while with Green Bay \u2014 and had a TD pass to Davante Adams.",
      "But Rodgers could only watch from the sideline in overtime as the Jets never got the ball after blowing a second straight second-half lead.",
      "\u201cA lot of different ways we\u2019ve lost these games,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cEverybody has some skin on that, but we had opportunities on offense. Whatever happens on defense doesn\u2019t matter. We got to get to 30 (points). We didn\u2019t do it.\u201d",
      "Rodgers and Adams connected for a 3-yard score in the third quarter, the pair's 79th touchdown in the regular and postseason. They passed Pittsburgh's Ben Roethlisberger and Antonio Brown for the fourth-most by a quarterback-receiver duo in NFL history.",
      "Adams finished with nine catches and 109 yards.",
      "Down 8 at the start of the fourth, Tagovailoa found Tyreek Hill for a 4-yard touchdown, and Jaylen Waddle caught the two-point conversion to tie it at 23. Hill caught 10 passes for 115 yards, and Waddle added 99 yards on nine catches.",
      "The Jets had taken a 20-15 lead in the third on Adams' touchdown that was set up by a 42-yard pickup by Garrett Wilson, who beat cornerback Jalen Ramsey on a double move to get open. A 40-yard field goal by Carlson later stretched New York's lead to 8 after the Dolphins went scoreless in the quarter.",
      "\u201cActually, when we were down 23-15, when we were trotting back on the field, everybody knew what was at stake at that moment,\u201d Hill said. \u201cWe know if we lose, it\u2019s over. Our season is over.\u201d",
      "The matchup pitted the Jets' No. 2-ranked pass defense against Tagovailoa, the NFL's most accurate passer, and Miami's No. 9-ranked pass defense against the four-time MVP Rodgers who has had a subpar season.",
      "Both quarterbacks were strong and the teams played rather evenly at first, with each scoring on their first three possessions. The first punt of the game was on Miami's first drive of the second half, and the Jets scored on their first five possessions.",
      "Tagovailoa had just three incompletions in the first half and was 3 for 3 on Miami's final drive of the second quarter, moving the Dolphins into field goal range in 45 seconds to set up a 57-yarder by Sanders, which tied the kicker's career best.",
      "Sanders also made kicks of 39 and 24 yards, and De'Von Achane had a 2-yard touchdown run on Miami's opening possession.",
      "Rodgers moved the Jets inside Miami's 20 three times in the first half. Isaiah Davis ran for a 17-yard score, and Carlson made field goals of 28 and 30 yards.",
      "Wilson caught seven passes for 114 yards.",

      "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- The New Orleans Saints took two leaps against the New York Giants. One by defensive tackle Bryan Bresee saved a much-needed win. The other by quarterback Derek Carr may have damaged their already slim chances of winning the NFC South.",
      "The most important thing for the Saints (5-8) on Sunday was they hung on to beat the Giants 14-11 and stayed alive. The playoff hopes for the Giants (2-11) ended weeks ago, and they found another way to lose as they extended their skid to eight games, one shy of the matching the team record.",
      "Carr was the the biggest concern for New Orleans. He injured his left, non-throwing hand when he leapt to try for a first down and crashed to the turf with just under four minutes to play. Bresee preserved the win when he blocked a potential game-tying 35-yard field goal by Graham Gano with 11 seconds left.",
      "With four games left, the Saints are two games behind first-place Tampa Bay (7-6) and one behind Atlanta.",
      "\u201cIt keeps us in the mix,\u201d Saints interim coach Darren Rizzi said after winning for the third time in four games since replacing Dennis Allen. \u201cWe\u2019re down to the end of the year. It\u2019s the middle of December and when you are playing games that matter, that still count and have a chance to affect the final outcome, that\u2019s a big deal.\u201d",
      "The 33-year-old Carr finished 20 of 31 for 219 yards. He was hurt with just under four minutes to play when he dived for a first down near the Saints 40 and landed hard. He was replaced by Jake Haener.",
      "Rizzi said Carr would get tests on his left hand. He had no information on whether the QB would enter the concussion protocol or be available next weekend.",
      "Carr was not available for comment after the game.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s just trying to win and in a game like that, a first down or two and you put them away,\" said Saints tight end Juwan Johnson, who caught an 11-yard TD in the third quarter. \u201cHe tried to do it for us.\u201d",
      "New York got the ball at its 27 with 1:21 to play and drove to the Saints 12, with Drew Lock scrambling for 25 yards on fourth down and then finding Malik Nabers for 23 yards. The Giants tried twice to throw to the end zone for a winning touchdown before sending out Gano to try to force overtime. Gano's kick was a little low and the Giants couldn't defend the jumping Breese, who got a hand on the ball.",
      "\u201cI really didn\u2019t think I got enough of it at first,\u201d Bresee said. \u201cI looked back and saw that it missed. I was super excited.\u201d",
      "Gano, who made a 43-yard field goal in the first half and had a 48-yarder in the fourth quarter nullified by a personal foul, said he kicked the last ball solidly but Bresee got a thumb on it.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s frustrating for our team, especially working so hard to come back like that,\u201d Gano said. \u201cSo many guys had big plays and we worked really hard at coming back and it\u2019s tough to have a game end that way.\u201d",
      "Tyrone Tracy scored from 1 yard out with 4:11 left in the fourth quarter and Lock hit Nabers on a 2-point conversion to get New York within three, but it wasn\u2019t enough to prevent the Giants from falling to 0-7 at home.",
      "The Giants lost nine in a row in 2019 and it led to the firing of coach Pat Shurmur. Coach Brian Daboll and general manager Joe Schoen are on the hot seat now in their third seasons.",
      "Fan frustration is mounting. A small plane circled MetLife Stadium roughly 90 minutes before the game trailing a banner calling the Giants a \u201cdumpster fire\u201d and asking co-owner John Mara to overhaul the team that has made the playoffs twice since winning the Super Bowl in February 2012.",

      "Sam Darnold threw for 347 yards and five touchdowns, both career highs, and the Minnesota Vikings pulled away from Kirk Cousins and the Atlanta Falcons 42-21 for their sixth straight victory",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Sam Darnold tossed aside his stoic demeanor for a moment after realizing he was on the videoboard, aggressively twirling a towel to further stoke the crowd's fire after the Minnesota Vikings had pulled away from Kirk Cousins and the Atlanta Falcons late in the game.",
      "\u201cI just felt the buzz. That was pure passion, pure joy, man,\u201d Darnold said.",
      "Darnold added yet another highlight to his brilliant first season with the Vikings, passing for 347 yards and five touchdowns, both career highs, in a 42-21 victory over the foundering Falcons on Sunday to stretch their winning streak to six games.",
      "\u201cIt just felt like it was one of those days to keep the gas pedal down,\u201d said coach Kevin O'Connell, who enjoyed his team's first 40-point game in three seasons on the job.",
      "Darnold passed for 250 yards after halftime to help the Vikings (11-2) break a 21-all tie early in the fourth quarter and stay one game behind NFC North-leading Detroit with a final-week matchup looming with the Lions. Jordan Addison had eight catches for 133 yards and three scores and Justin Jefferson racked up seven receptions for 132 yards and two touchdowns after going the past six games without scoring.",
      "\u201cThis is something that we want to do and we can do every single week,\u201d Jefferson said.",
      "Cousins, whose departure in free agency for Atlanta prompted Minnesota to sign Darnold as a bridge to currently injured rookie J.J. McCarthy, threw two more interceptions without a touchdown in this unhappy homecoming following a mixed six-year run with the Vikings.",
      "Booed as he took the field, Cousins and the Falcons (6-7) left with a fourth consecutive loss to tumble out of first place in the NFC South and fall one game behind Tampa Bay.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re playing well you usually aren\u2019t as good as people are telling you when they\u2019re patting you on the back, and if you\u2019re in a rut you\u2019re usually not as bad as people kind of leaving you for dead,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cThe reality\u2019s usually somewhere in the middle. You just have to keep playing and see where the dust settles in January.\u201d",
      "Cousins went 23 for 37 for 344 yards for the Falcons, who crossed midfield on all nine of their possessions and finished with 496 total yards. He overthrew Ray-Ray McCloud III on fourth down in the first quarter, and the Falcons settled for short field goals just before and right after halftime.",
      "Their fate was sealed when McCloud fumbled the kickoff at the 32 after the Vikings went 70 yards in six plays for the go-ahead touchdown pass to Addison, who scored again seven plays later.",
      "The Falcons handed the Vikings an earlier touchdown when Kentavious Street was called for defensive holding during a field-goal attempt late in the second quarter, giving Darnold a fresh set of downs before a 12-yard laser to Jefferson on a post route on third-and-6.",
      "\u201cYou just can\u2019t have the self-inflicted wounds and expect to win football games like we had today,\u201d coach Raheem Morris said.",
      "Bijan Robinson had 22 carries for 92 yards and a touchdown and Tyler Allgeier rushed nine times for 63 yards and a score for the Falcons against the NFL\u2019s leading run defense.",
      "Cousins, who was picked off four times last week, hesitated as he wound up to throw on first down from the Minnesota 47 in a tie game early in the second quarter and then inexplicably fired a pass straight to Josh Metellus as he sat in a zone in front of Drake London. Cousins has a NFL -most 15 interceptions.",
      "Byron Murphy snagged an overthrow for the second one near the goal line with a 35-21 lead and 6:26 left. Darnold, who went 22 for 28 without a turnover-worthy play despite heavy first-half pressure, then directed a seven-play, 98-yard drive to seal it.",
      "\u201cI think we grew up a lot today offensively,\u201d O'Connell said.",
      "Addison and Jefferson became the first duo in Vikings history to each have 100-plus receiving yards and two-plus touchdown catches in the same game. Addison also became the first Vikings player with three receiving touchdowns in a game since Stefon Diggs caught three from Cousins in 2019. Murphy has six interceptions this season, the most for the Vikings since Jimmy Hitchcock had seven in 1998.",
      "Falcons: CB Mike Hughes (knee) was back in the lineup after missing two games. Minnesota's 2018 first-round draft pick returned an interception for a touchdown against Atlanta in his NFL debut here.",
      "Vikings: CB Stephon Gilmore (hamstring) and backup OLB Patrick Jones (knee) were out. TE Josh Oliver (wrist/ankle) returned from a two-game absence, and LS Andrew DePaola (hand) and PK Will Reichard (quadriceps) were back from four-game injured reserve stints.",

      "Baker Mayfield threw for 295 yards and three touchdowns, helping the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat the Las Vegas Raiders 28-13 and take over sole possession of first place in the NFC South",
      "TAMPA, Fla. -- The surging Tampa Bay Buccaneers are back over .500, a fourth straight NFC South title within reach.",
      "Now, they hope to finish the task by building on a three-game winning streak that's propelled them to the top of the division following a stretch in which they lost five of six games.",
      "\u201cIt's one thing getting to first place. It's a whole other thing staying there,\u201d coach Todd Bowles said after Sunday's sloppy 28-13 win over the reeling Las Vegas Raiders. \u201cWe've got four games left. It's going to be a battle all the way through. We have to come ready every week.\u201d",
      "Baker Mayfield threw for 295 yards and three touchdowns, and the Bucs won for the third straight week against a last-place opponent to move ahead of fading Atlanta in the NFC South.",
      "The Falcons, who hold a tiebreaker advantage after sweeping the season series between the rivals, have lost four in a row.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't have to be pretty. Obviously, there are a lot of things that I would personally like to have back, but it's a resilient group. We play for each other,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cGuys step up when other people go down and that's what football is all about. It teaches you life lessons.\u201d",
      "Mayfield tossed scoring passes of 15 yards and 29 yards to rookie Jalen McMillan. Rachaad White scored on a 5-yard reception and a 3-yard run for the Bucs, who pulled away in the second half after the Raiders (2-11) lost quarterback Aidan O'Connell to a knee injury that coach Antonio Pierce said \u201cdoesn't look good.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Connell was carted off the field after being shoved to the ground by Bucs defensive lineman Calijah Kancey after throwing a pass late in the third quarter.",
      "The quarterback, in his second game back after being sidelined nearly six weeks with a broken thumb, remained on the ground after an 8-yard, third-down completion to Jakobi Meyers. Kancey chased O\u2019Connell out of the pocket toward the Bucs sideline and shoved him from behind after the ball was released.",
      "Kancey was not penalized for a late hit.",
      "\u201cPrayers to him. I pray for a speedy recovery,\u201d Kancey said. \u201cI hope everything's good on their end. I definitely took a knee and prayed for him.\u201d",
      "White rushed for 90 yards on 17 carries. His TD run in the fourth quarter put Tampa Bay up 21-10. McMillan's second TD finished an 80-yard drive and put the game out of reach after Desmond Ridder led the Raiders to a field goal that got Las Vegas within 21-13 with three minutes remaining.",
      "The Raiders have lost an NFL-high nine straight games.",
      "\u201cI appreciate the effort, the grit, the fight,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cListen, it's tough. And these guys, they're not flinching or blinking. They still believe. ... All of those guys are fighting until the very end. Proud of the effort.\u201d",
      "Mayfield turned the ball over three times in the first half to help the Raiders stay close.",
      "O'Connell fumbled one play after Mayfield tossed his first interception. But four plays later, Raiders linebacker Amari Burney sacked Mayfield, forcing a fumble that led to O'Connell's 1-yard TD run that trimmed Tampa Bay's early lead to 14-7.",
      "The fumble recovery by Tre'von Moehrig was the first by the Las Vegas defense this season. Jack Jones' end zone interception denied Mayfield an opportunity to build on a 14-10 lead just before halftime.",
      "Raiders tight end Brock Bowers, who began the day leading the NFL in receptions with 84, had three catches for 49 yards and broke Sam LaPorta's year-old record for receptions in a season by a rookie tight end. LaPorta had 86 catches for the Detroit Lions in 2023.",
      "\"It\u2019s cool, but it would be cooler with some more wins,\u201d Bowers said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s having a great individual year,\u201d Pierce added. \u201cI wish it could lead to more success for our team.\u201d",
      "Raiders: O'Connell left the game with 1:23 remaining in the third quarter and was replaced by Ridder. O'Connell finished 11 of 19 passing 104 yards and an interception. He was sacked once.",
      "Buccaneers: Played without LB K.J. Britt (ankle), S Mike Edwards (hamstring), CB Josh Hayes (hamstring) and OLB Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (ankle). S Antoine Winfield Jr. (knee) and RB Bucky Irving (back) left in the second quarter and did not return. WR Ryan Miller (concussion) departed in the fourth quarter.",
      "Raiders: Host Atlanta on Monday, Dec. 16.",
      "Buccaneers: Visit the Los Angeles Chargers next Sunday.",

      "New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr injured his left hand late in the fourth quarter of Sunday\u2019s 14-11 victory over the New York Giants when he went airborne while trying for a first down and crashed to the turf",
      "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr injured his left hand late in the fourth quarter of Sunday's 14-11 victory over the New York Giants when he went airborne while trying for a first down and crashed to the turf.",
      "Carr tried to leap over a Giants tackler and landed at the New Orleans 39-yard line, extending his non-throwing hand to break his fall. He was on the turf for a minute or two before walking to the medical tent. He was examined and slowly walked to an area where X-rays are done.",
      "\u201cA phenomenal effort trying to make a first down,\u201d interim coach Darren Rizzi said of the play that happened with the Saints leading 14-11 and just under four minutes remaining.",
      "Carr missed three games earlier this season with an oblique injury. Tight end Juwan Johnson, who had a TD catch on Sunday, said it looks like the QB will miss more time. Carr was not available to speak to reporters after the game.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s just been having a rough go. We\u2019re behind him,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe\u2019s still Derek Carr, aside from the football field. You just have to be there for him, emotionally, spiritually and physically.\u201d",
      "The injury could hurt the already slim playoff hopes of the Saints (5-8), who trail Tampa Bay by two games and Atlanta by one in the weak NFC South.",
      "Rizzi was asked whether Carr would enter the concussion protocol after his jarring impact with the turf, but the coach could not confirm that.",
      "Johnson said Carr had told teammates it was time to lay it on the line before he got hurt.",
      "\u201cAnd that\u2019s the true example of laying out on the line. The dude just cares about his team a lot,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Carr finished 20 of 31 for 219 yards with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Johnson in the third quarter. He also led a 98-yard drive that Kendre Miller capped with a 6-yard run in the first quarter as New Orleans won for the third time in four games under Rizzi, who took over last month when Dennis Allen was fired.",
      "Jake Haener replaced Carr and handed off to Miller, who was stopped on third-and-1 by Giants linebacker Micah McFadden. The Saints punted.",
      "After an interception by New Orleans' Demario Davis, Haener went three-and-out on the next series. The Giants got the ball back with 1:21 to play and came within a thumb of forcing overtime.",
      "New York drove to the Saints 12-yard line and defensive tackle Bryan Bresee got a thumb on Graham Gano's game-tying 35-yard field goal attempt.",

      "Russell Wilson threw for 158 yards and two touchdowns and the Pittsburgh Steelers pulled away from the mistake-prone Cleveland Browns 27-14",
      "PITTSBURGH -- Cam Heyward has been on good teams before. Ones that have captured divisions. Ones that have won playoff games, though admittedly not in a while.",
      "The longtime Pittsburgh Steelers defensive tackle, now well into his dotage in his 14th season, can't quite remember having a group like the one that he plays on now.",
      "\u201cWe have a complete team,\u201d Heyward said.",
      "A team that began the season riddled with question marks now finds itself steamrolling toward Christmas with everything on the table.",
      "Russell Wilson threw for 158 yards and two touchdowns, Heyward recorded two sacks and the Steelers beat the Cleveland Browns 27-14 on Sunday even with leading receiver George Pickens watching from the sideline while missing the first game of his career due to a groin injury.",
      "While it took Wilson and the rest of the offense time to get going with the productive if volatile Pickens out of the mix, Wilson found his footing in the second half by connecting on touchdown passes to Pat Freiermuth and Van Jefferson as the Steelers (10-3) moved two games ahead of Baltimore for the AFC North lead with four weeks to go.",
      "Two weeks after a messy pratfall in the snow, Pittsburgh avoided being swept by the Browns for the first time since 1988 by taking advantage of the countless opportunities mistake-prone Cleveland (3-10) provided.",
      "Jameis Winston threw two interceptions, Dustin Hopkins missed two makeable field goals when the outcome was still in doubt and a series of ill-time flags added up to the Browns reaching double-digit losses for the 18th time since the franchise returned in 1999.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe the Pittsburgh Steelers beat the Cleveland Browns,\u201d Winston said. \u201cI believe the Cleveland Browns beat the Cleveland Browns.\u201d",
      "While Winston avoided the pick-6s that have dogged him throughout his career \u2014 including last week in Denver \u2014 but did little after hitting Jerry Jeudy for a 35-yard touchdown in the first quarter that gave the Browns an early lead. Winston finished 24 of 41 for 211 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions.",
      "Nick Chubb ran for 48 yards in his return to Pittsburgh after a devastating knee injury on the same field 15 months ago forced him to miss more than a year. Yet the Steelers kept Myles Garrett relatively in check after the defensive star racked up three sacks in Cleveland's snowy upset on Nov. 21, and Pittsburgh's defense provided the spark that brought the offense to life.",
      "The surge began when Winston's screen pass intended for Chubb landed in the hands of 6-foot-4, 309-pound Steelers defensive tackle Keeanu Benton, who lugged his first career interception 11 yards. Najee Harris bulled over from 1 yard out five plays later to give the Steelers a lead they wouldn't relinquish.",
      "\u201cThat's what good teams do this time of year,\u201d Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin said. \u201cSomebody makes a play, the other side of the ball backs it up. That's what we're trying to do.\u201d",
      "Cleveland had chances to keep the Steelers within sight, but Hopkins saw a 38-yard field goal at breezy Acrisure Stadium late in the first half sail wide left, then had a 43-yarder drift wide right early in the third quarter.",
      "\u201cI need to find a good swing,\u201d said Hopkins, who has an NFL-high nine misses. \u201cThe swing has been tough to find this year.\u201d",
      "The Steelers scored on the ensuing possession when Wilson executed a perfect run-pass option by faking the ball to Jaylen Warren, rolling right and finding Jefferson wide-open in the end zone from 10 yards out to make it 20-7.",
      "Pittsburgh's Elandon Roberts stuffed Jerome Ford for a 5-yard loss on fourth down to end Cleveland's next possession, and Wilson connected with Freiermuth down the seam. The tight end stumbled into the newly painted yellow end zone to send the Browns back to Cleveland with a loss, just like they have during every regular season visit since 2004.",
      "It also sets the stage for a daunting finishing stretch for the Steelers, who face Philadelphia, Baltimore and Kansas City over the next three weeks, with two of the games coming on short rest.",
      "While Pittsburgh has quieted much of the noise that surrounded the team after a massive offensive overhaul in the offseason \u2014 led by the acquisition of Wilson \u2014 the Steelers understand the real test is still to come.",
      "\u201cWhy not test us before the playoffs, get a feel?\u201d Freiermuth said. \u201cThey're all playoff teams we're playing, so it'll be great.\u201d",
      "Browns: CB Mike Ford Jr. was placed in the concussion protocol in the first quarter.",
      "Steelers: DT Larry Ogunjobi (groin) left in the first half and did not return. ... DB Donte Jackson (back) exited in the third quarter.",

      "PHILADELPHIA -- The mood in the Eagles' locker room was a bit more bleak than it should have been for a team riding a nine-game winning streak and celebrating a franchise rushing record.",
      "Former 1,000-yard receiver DeVonta Smith \u2014 who caught a touchdown pass and not much else \u2014 was exasperated at the offensive no-show.",
      "A.J. Brown, who holds a slew of team receiving records, had as much to offer in his sour postgame interview as he did on the field when he was held to four catches.",
      "This was the sullen attitude of a team still in the hunt for a top seed in the NFC?",
      "Here's the good news for the Philadelphia: Saquon Barkley rushed for 124 yards to break the Eagles season record, and Jalen Hurts threw two touchdown passes and ran for a score in Sunday's 22-16 win over the Carolina Panthers.",
      "Barkley's consistent brilliance aside, Hurts and the Eagles slogged through another rough offensive outing.",
      "\u201cEverybody has a reason to want more,\u201d Hurts said.",
      "The Eagles (11-2) maintained their position as the No. 2 team in the NFC, behind Detroit (12-1), after a mostly lethargic effort against the Panthers (3-10).",
      "Hurts\u2019 passing numbers were a pedestrian 14 of 21 for 108 yards. Brown had four catches for 43 yards \u2014 and threw his helmet in anger after a three-and-out \u2014 and Smith had four catches for 37 yards.",
      "What do the Eagles need to improve on?",
      "\u201cPassing,\u201d Brown deadpanned.",
      "How tough was it for the receivers to find a rhythm?",
      "\u201cIncredibly tough,\u201d he said.",
      "Hurts didn't do enough to get Smith and Brown involved, one reason why the lowly Panthers stayed in striking distance until the final possession.",
      "He took four sacks. He held the ball too long as open receivers ran with their arms up trying to get their QB's attention.",
      "\u201cI play my role in how we execute,\u201d Hurts said. \u201cBut ultimately it's about what position we put ourselves in. It's not my choice.\u201d",
      "That message will surely reverberate through coach Nick Sirianni and offensive coordinator Kellen Moore's offices this week.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s fair that the questions are about our pass game right now,\u201d Sirianni said.",
      "The Eagles at least had Barkley to bail them out.",
      "Barkley added another milestone in his MVP push when he used a 9-yard run in the fourth quarter to surpass LeSean McCoy's Eagles record of 1,607 yards, set in 2013. Barkley now has 1,623 yards with four games left.",
      "\u201cHow cool is it that we have a team rushing record in Week 13?\u201d Sirianni said.",
      "Hurts had flashes of form, like when he hit Grant Calcaterra with a 4-yard TD pass and Barkley ran in the 2-point conversion for a 22-16 lead early in the fourth.",
      "Bryce Young gamely moved the Panthers into Eagles territory on the final drive. He completed a 13-yard pass on fourth down that moved the ball to the 38, and a second-down pass to Xavier Legette gave the Eagles a brief scare when the receiver seemed to have the ball in the end zone.",
      "He didn't. Young eluded a pass rush on fourth down but his final attempt was incomplete. He finished 19 of 34 for 191 yards.",
      "Panthers coach Dave Canales said Legette \u201cabsolutely\u201d had to make the catch.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a big play we\u2019re counting on. He\u2019d be the first one to tell you he\u2019s got to make that play,\u201d Canales said. \u201cBryce steps up, makes a beautiful throw in the situation. We had the coverage we wanted, all that. Those are the plays that we\u2019ve just got to find a way to make for us to get back on the winning column.\u201d",
      "A 12 1/2-point underdog according to BetMGM Sportsbook, the Panthers played more like a team with playoff seeding at stake.",
      "Chuba Hubbard, who rushed for 92 yards and topped 1,000 on the season, made it 16-14 on a 1-yard run in the third quarter. Eddy Pineiro, who kicked a 38-yard field goal in the first quarter, missed the extra point.",
      "Eagles safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson, who was examined earlier for a concussion, changed the game late in the second quarter when he picked off Young\u2019s deep pass at Philadelphia\u2019s 41. Hurts scrambled 15 yards on the next drive and finished it with a 4-yard TD pass to Smith for a 14-10 lead.",
      "Gardner-Johnson\u2019s pick bailed out an uneven effort by the Eagles.",
      "They failed to score on their opening drive for the 13th time this season, but the offensive bursts that usually follow never came. Hurts scored on tush push early in the second quarter, his 13th rushing score of the season, for a 7-3 lead.",
      "With nothing to lose, the Panthers went for it on fourth-and-3, and Young hit Tommy Tremble for a 3-yard TD and a 10-7 advantage.",
      "The Eagles did just enough. Their challenge now is getting the receivers' production up \u2014 and getting them happy \u2014 headed into the postseason.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a relief, right?\" Jaguars coach Doug Pederson said of the locker room after the win. \"You know, it\u2019s the excitement. It\u2019s the joy of the work that you put in. And you\u2019re finally rewarded.\u201d",
      "The Titans (3-10) came in needing to win out to even have a chance of their first playoff berth since the 2021 season ended with a divisional loss on their home field. Tennessee has fired both a general manager and coach since then.",
      "The Titans had two late chances to win.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one that we definitely feel like we should have won, could have won and had opportunities to win,\u201d Titans quarterback Will Levis said.",
      "Their best chance ended with 1:11 left as Levis missed Nick Westbrook-Ikhine in the end zone on fourth-and-3 at the Jaguars 9. The second ended with Levis missing Tyler Boyd on fourth-and-15 from the Tennessee 35 with 28 seconds remaining.",
      "Mac Jones filled in ably enough for Lawrence to get his first win in three starts this season.",
      "He shook off two interceptions and one sack, throwing for 220 yards. In the second half, he connected over and over with rookie Brian Thomas Jr. The first-round draft pick out of LSU finished with career highs with eight catches on 12 targets for 86 yards.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t quit this time, which is really important for us moving forward,\" Jones said of the Jaguars. \"There was no quit.\u201d",
      "Pederson also said there was no panic or finger-pointing, just subtle adjustments.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one thing about Mac,\u201d Pederson said of his quarterback. \"I mean, he just sticks to it. He grinds it out.\u201d",
      "Cam Little started the Jaguars' comeback in the low-scoring affair with a 23-yard field goal early in the fourth.",
      "Nick Folk kicked a pair of field goals for the Titans. Tennessee dropped to 1-5 at home this season under first-year coach Brian Callahan, who put this loss on the inability to score on two red zone trips.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the difference in a tight ball game in a divisional game,\" Callahan said. \"You got to score touchdowns down there and we didn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Levis shook off a hard hit to his right, throwing shoulder when sacked by Josh Hines-Allen to end the first half. He stretched his shoulder as he walked off the field to the locker room but didn\u2019t miss a play, returning for the second. He finished with 168 yards passing.",
      "The Titans defense, coming off an ugly performance in last week\u2019s loss at Washington, came up with two interceptions. Cornerback Chido Awuzie got the first pick in his first game since Sept. 22 after being activated off injured reserve Saturday.",
      "Tennessee couldn't get points off either turnover against the NFL's worst defense in yards allowed and next to worst in points given up per game. Missing three starters with injuries, the Titans couldn't stop the Jags in the fourth quarter.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m tired of saying we\u2019ve got to do better, play better,\u201d Titans two-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman Jeffery Simmons said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have no answers. Complementary football wasn\u2019t there.\u201d",
      "The Titans scratched rookie Jha\u2019Quan Jackson who has five fumbles this season, including one of each of the past two weeks. Mason Kinsey, promoted from the practice squad, handled punt returns.",
      "The Jaguars unexpectedly scratched RT Anton Harrison because of illness. Cole Van Lanen replaced him, making his first start since being a sixth-round draft pick by Green Bay in 2021. ... S Darnell Savage, who went down at the end of a 21-yard run by Tony Pollard, was being evaluated for a concussion.",
      "Titans OLB Harold Landry III was hurt on the Jaguars\u2019 first drive of the third quarter but was back on the next series.",

      "Saquon Barkley has broken LeSean McCoy's Eagles franchise record for rushing yards in a season",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Saquon Barkley knew the Eagles season rushing record could be his on Sunday with the type of stellar performance that has become the standard during his first season in Philadelphia.",
      "As for the exact moment Barkley hit the milestone, he wasn't sure \u2014 until the \u201cMVP!\u201d chants echoed throughout the Linc after a 9-yard run in the fourth quarter.",
      "\u201cThe records are great, they put a smile on your face,\u201d Barkley said, \u201cbut the season is far from over.\u201d",
      "Needing 109 yards to break LeSean McCoy's record, Barkley rushed for 124 yards and pushed his season total to 1,623 in a 22-16 victory over Carolina.",
      "Barkley needed just 13 games to pass McCoy, who rushed for 1,607 yards in 2013. He also overtook Wilbert Montgomery, who had 1,512 yards in 1978.",
      "\u201cI never wrote the goal down to break it,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cYou're always aware of it. That's how I train. That's how I operate in the offseason. I want to be great.\u201d",
      "Barkley also maintained his pace to break Eric Dickerson\u2019s NFL single-season rushing record of 2,105 yards, set in 1984 with the Los Angeles Rams.",
      "\u201cThat would be extremely cool to do,\u201d Barkley said. \u201cIf it happens, it happens, and not with the mindset of, I'm scared to go try to do it. Whatever it takes to win football games.\u201d",
      "Barkley is averaging 124.8 yards per game. At that pace and with one more game to play than Dickerson, he would become the top single-season rusher in NFL history. He needs 483 yards yards over the final four games to top Dickerson\u2019s 40-year-old record.",
      "He averaged 6.2 yards on 20 carries against the Panthers to help the Eagles win their ninth straight game.",
      "McCoy, who was inducted into the team's Hall of Fame this season, remains the franchise\u2019s rushing leader with 6,792 yards. Referencing his old uniform number, McCoy congratulated Barkley on social media with \u201ca lot of love, coming from 2-5.\"",
      "\u201cBeing a fan of Shady's growing up, and seeing the spectacular things he was able to do with the ball in his hand, to be able to have my name mentioned with him definitely means a lot,\u201d Barkley said.",
      "Barkley left the New York Giants in the offseason and signed a three-year deal worth $26 million guaranteed to join the Eagles, who made him the highest-paid running back in franchise history.",
      "The 27-year-old has been worth every dollar.",
      "Barkley is among the favorites for league MVP, according to BetMGM Sportsbook. Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen was the only player with better MVP odds entering Sunday.",
      "Barkley has a franchise-record nine 100-yard rushing games in a season. Although he was held out of the end zone Sunday, he began the day leading the league with four rushing touchdowns of 25-plus yards.",
      "Barkley, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2018 NFL draft, topped 1,000 yards three times in his six seasons with the Giants. He finished with 1,312 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns in 2022 and rushed for 1,307 yards and 11 scores as a rookie.",
      "Eagles general manager Howie Roseman, who had been unwilling to spend on elite running backs, pounced on Barkley and the decision was celebrated as a success in Philly from the first game of the season.",
      "Barkley rushed for two scores and caught a TD pass in the opener against Green Bay. His three touchdowns were the most by an Eagles player in his debut since Terrell Owens in 2004.",
      "Barkley only soared in production and popularity from there, his highlight reel stamped by a reverse leap over the head of a Jacksonville defender last month.",
      "He's since vaulted over every running back ahead of him on the Eagles rushing list \u2014 and has a chance at NFL history.",

      "TikTok\u2019s future in the U.S. appeared uncertain on Friday after a federal appeals court rejected a legal challenge the company brought against a law that requires it to cut ties with its China-based parent company or be banned by mid-January",
      "TikTok's future in the U.S. appeared uncertain on Friday after a federal appeals court rejected a legal challenge to a law that requires the social media platform to cut ties with its China-based parent company or be banned by mid-January.",
      "A panel of three judges on The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled unanimously that the law withstood constitutional scrutiny, rebuffing arguments from the two companies that the statute violated their rights and the rights of TikTok users in the U.S.",
      "The government has said it wants ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, to divest its stakes. But if it doesn't and the platform goes away, it would have a seismic impact on the lives of content creators who rely on the platform for income as well as users who use it for entertainment and connection.",
      "Here are some details on the ruling and what could happen next:",
      "In their lawsuit, TikTok and ByteDance, which is also a plaintiff in the case, had challenged the law on various fronts, arguing in part that the statute ran afoul of the First Amendment and was an unconstitutional bill of attainder that unfairly targeted the two companies.",
      "But the court sided with attorneys for the Justice Department who said that the government was attempting to address national security concerns and the way in which it chose to do so did not violate the constitution.",
      "The Justice Department has argued in court that TikTok poses a national security risk due to its connections to China. Officials say that Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok's U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread, or suppress, information. However, the U.S. hasn't publicly provided examples of that happening.",
      "The appeals court ruling, written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg, said the law was \u201ccarefully crafted to deal only with control by a foreign adversary.\" The judges also rejected the claim that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Furthermore, Ginsburg wrote the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to \u201csuppress content or require a certain mix of content\u201d on TikTok.",
      "TikTok and ByteDance are expected to appeal the case to the Supreme Court, but it's unclear whether the court will take up the case.",
      "TikTok indicated in a statement on Friday the two companies are preparing to take their case to high court, saying the Supreme Court has \u201can established historical record of protecting Americans\u2019 right to free speech.\"",
      "\"We expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\u201d a company spokesperson said.",
      "Alan Morrison, a professor at The George Washington University Law School, said he expects the Supreme Court to take up the case because of the novelty of the issues raised in the lawsuit. If that happens, attorneys for the two companies still have to convince the court to grant them an emergency stay that will prevent the government from enforcing the Jan. 19 divestiture deadline stipulated in the law, Morrison said.",
      "Such a move could drag out the process until the Justices make a ruling.",
      "Tiffany Cianci, a TikTok content creator who has supported the platform, said she was not shocked about the outcome of the court's ruling on Friday because lower courts typically defer to the executive branch on these types of cases. She believes the company will have a stronger case at the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cI believe that the next stages are more likely to produce a victory for TikTokers and for TikTok as a whole,\u201d Cianci said.",
      "Another wild card is President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the recent presidential campaign that he is now against such action.",
      "The Trump transition team has not offered details on how Trump plans to carry out his pledge to \u201csave TikTok.\" But spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement last month that he plans to \u201cdeliver\u201d on his campaign promises.",
      "After Trump takes office on Jan. 20th, it would fall on his Justice Department to enforce the law and punish any potential violators. Penalties would apply to any app stores that would violate a prohibition on TikTok and to internet hosting services which would be barred from supporting it.",
      "Some have speculated that Trump could ask his Justice Department to abstain from enforcing the law. But tech companies like Apple and Google, which offer TikTok's app on their app stores, would then have to trust that the administration would not come after them for any violations.",
      "Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said enforcement discretion \u2014 or executive orders \u2014 can not override existing law, leaving Trump with \u201climited room for unilateral action.\"",
      "There are other things Trump could potentially do. It's possible he could invoke provisions of the law that allow the president to determine whether a sale or a similar transaction frees TikTok from \u201cforeign adversary\u201d control. Another option is to urge Congress to repeal the law. But that too would require support from congressional Republicans who have overwhelmingly supported the prospect of getting TikTok out of the hands of a Chinese company.",
      "In a statement issued Friday, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, said he was \u201coptimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok\u201d and allow its continued use in the United States.",
      "ByteDance has said it won't sell TikTok. And even if it wanted to, a sale of the proprietary algorithm that powers TikTok is likely to get blocked under Chinese export controls that the country issued in 2020.",
      "That means if TikTok is sold without the algorithm, its likely that the buyer would only purchase a shell of the platform that doesn't contain the technology that made the app a cultural powerhouse.",
      "Still, some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in buying it.",
      "This week, a spokesperson for McCourt\u2019s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital. The spokesperson did not disclose the identity of the participants."

      "A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat",
      "A surprising study of temperature-related deaths in Mexico upends conventional thinking about what age group is hit hardest by heat. Researchers found at higher temperatures and humidity, the heat kills far more young people under 35 than those older than 50.",
      "For decades, health and weather experts have warned that the elderly and the youngest children were most vulnerable in heat waves. But this study looking at all deaths in Mexico from 1998 to 2019 shows that when the combination of humidity and temperature reach uncomfortable levels, such as the mid to upper 80s Fahrenheit (around 30 degrees Celsius) and 50% relative humidity, there were nearly 32 temperature-related deaths of people 35 years old for every temperature-related death of someone 50 and older.",
      "The study in Friday's journal Science Advances shows an especially surprising spike of heat-related deaths in an age group thought to be young and robust: People between 18 and 35. That age group alone had nine times as many temperature-related deaths as those older than 50.",
      "Study authors and outside experts are scrambling to figure out why. Demographics alone don't explain why more young adult Mexicans are dying in high heat than their elders. Two theories: Outdoor workers who can't escape the heat, and young people who don't know their limits.",
      "The trend is likely to widen as the world warms from human-caused climate change, according to computer simulations run by the study team.",
      "\u201cWe found that younger people are especially vulnerable to humid heat,\u201d study co-author Jeffrey Shrader, a climate economist at Columbia University, said. \u201cAs the climate warms, we're really going to be shifting the burden of temperature-related mortality towards younger individuals and away from older individuals who tend to be more vulnerable to cold temperatures.\u201d",
      "Data from cold weather shows more than 300 deaths of Mexican residents 50 and older for every young person dying from cold temperatures, according to the study.",
      "\u201cPeople of all ages are increasingly at risk from the rising temperatures, and this study shows that those that we might have considered relatively safe from heat-related adverse health outcomes might not be so much so,\u201d said Marina Romanello, executive director of the Lancet Countdown that monitors health effects of climate change. She was not part of the study team.",
      "\u201cHeat is a much more dangerous silent killer than most people acknowledge it to be, and that heat is increasingly putting our health and survival at risk,\" Romanello said in an email.",
      "Study authors decided to examine weather-related deaths in Mexico because that country not only has detailed mortality data, but it has a variety of different climates making it an ideal place to study in depth, Shrader said.",
      "Researchers also want to figure out whether this is just a situation in Mexico or other warmer sections of the globe have similar spikes in young adult deaths in high heat and humidity.",
      "Initially the team just wanted to look at deaths and what scientists call wet-bulb globe temperatures, but when they looked at age differences, they were surprised and looked in more detail, Shrader said. Wet-bulb temperature, which is intended to mirror how the body cools itself, is derived using a complicated measurement system that factors in humidity and solar radiation. A wet-bulb globe temperature of 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) is thought to be the limit for human survivability. Most places don\u2019t reach that level.",
      "Researchers determined temperature-related mortality by complex statistical analysis that compares numerous factors in the number of deaths and removes everything they can except temperature fluctuations, said study co-author Andrew Wilson, a Columbia climate economics researcher.",
      "Researchers also calculated the ideal temperature for when there are the fewest excess deaths at each age group. Younger adults' sweet temperature spot is about nine degrees Fahrenheit (five degrees Celsius) cooler than it is for older people, Shrader and Wilson said.",
      "Some outside health and climate experts were initially puzzled at the higher youth mortality seen in the study. Co-author Patrick Kinney, a professor of urban health and sustainability at Boston University, said it was likely the study included a higher proportion of outdoor workers exposed to heat than prior studies did.",
      "Study co-author Tereza Cavazos, a climate scientist at the Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education in Mexico, said she remembers her father's generations taking siestas in the high heat of the day and that was healthy. That doesn't happen so much now, she said.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of population that is vulnerable in the future. Not even in the future, right now,\u201d Cavazos said. She mentioned three Mexican heat waves this year that hit in the middle of the country and kept the deadly heat going overnight so people had little relief. Usually cool nights allow a body to recover.",
      "Younger people often have a sense of invulnerability to weather extremes and do things that increase their risk, such as play sports in high heat, Cavazos said.",
      "\u201cHigh humidity makes it a lot harder for the body to cool itself through sweating \u2013 which is how our body primarily stays cool,\" said Dr. Renee Salas, an emergency medicine physician and climate change expert at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. She was not part of the study team. \"So someone young and healthy working outside in heat and high humidity can reach a point where the body can no longer cool itself safely \u2013 causing a deadly form of heat injury called heat stroke.\u201d",

      "A federal appeals court panel on Friday unanimously upheld a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok as soon as next month, handing a resounding defeat to the popular social media platform as it fights for its survival in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied TikTok's petition to overturn the law \u2014 which requires TikTok to break ties with its China-based parent company ByteDance or be banned by mid-January \u2014 and rebuffed the company's challenge of the statute, which it argued had ran afoul of the First Amendment.",
      "\u201cThe First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\u201d said the court's opinion, which was written by Judge Douglas Ginsburg. \u201cHere the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary\u2019s ability to gather data on people in the United States.\u201d",
      "TikTok and ByteDance \u2014 another plaintiff in the lawsuit \u2014 are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, though its unclear whether the court will take up the case.",
      "\u201cThe Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" TikTok spokesperson Michael Hughes said in a statement.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the TikTok ban was conceived and pushed through based upon inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information, resulting in outright censorship of the American people,\u201d Hughes said. Unless stopped, he argued the statute \u201cwill silence the voices of over 170 million Americans here in the US and around the world on January 19th, 2025.\u201d",
      "Though the case is squarely in the court system, it's also possible the two companies might be thrown some sort of a lifeline by President-elect Donald Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term but said during the presidential campaign that he is now against such action.",
      "\u201cHe wants to save TikTok,\u201d Rep. Michael Waltz, Trump's pick for national security adviser, said Friday during an interview on Fox Business.",
      "The law, signed by President Joe Biden in April, was the culmination of a yearslong saga in Washington over the short-form video-sharing app, which the government sees as a national security threat due to its connections to China.",
      "The U.S. has said it\u2019s concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that\u2019s difficult to detect. The European Union on Friday expressed similar concerns as it investigates intelligence that suggests Russia possibly abused the platform to influence the elections in Romania.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement Friday.",
      "TikTok, which sued the government over the law in May, has long denied it could be used by Beijing to spy on or manipulate Americans. Its attorneys have accurately pointed out that the U.S. hasn\u2019t provided evidence to show that the company handed over user data to the Chinese government, or manipulated content for Beijing\u2019s benefit in the U.S. They have also argued the law is predicated on future risks, which the Department of Justice has emphasized pointing in part to unspecified action it claims the two companies have taken in the past due to demands from the Chinese government.",
      "Friday\u2019s ruling came after the appeals court panel, composed of two Republicans and one Democrat appointed judges, heard oral arguments in September.",
      "In the hearing, which lasted more than two hours, the panel appeared to grapple with how TikTok\u2019s foreign ownership affects its rights under the Constitution and how far the government could go to curtail potential influence from abroad on a foreign-owned platform. On Friday, all three denied TikTok\u2019s petition.",
      "In the court's ruling, Ginsburg, a Republican appointee, rejected TikTok's main legal arguments against the law, including that the statute was an unlawful bill of attainder, or a taking of property in violation of the Fifth Amendment. He also said the law did not violate the First Amendment because the government is not looking to \"suppress content or require a certain mix of content\u201d on TikTok.",
      "\u201cContent on the platform could in principle remain unchanged after divestiture, and people in the United States would remain free to read and share as much PRC propaganda (or any other content) as they desire on TikTok or any other platform of their choosing,\u201d Ginsburg wrote, using the abbreviation for the People\u2019s Republic of China.",
      "Judge Sri Srinivasan, the chief judge on the court, issued a concurring opinion.",
      "TikTok\u2019s lawsuit was consolidated with a second legal challenge brought by several content creators \u2014 for which the company is covering legal costs \u2014 as well as a third one filed on behalf of conservative creators who work with a nonprofit called BASED Politics Inc. Other organizations, including the Knight First Amendment Institute, had also filed amicus briefs supporting TikTok.",
      "\u201cThis is a deeply misguided ruling that reads important First Amendment precedents too narrowly and gives the government sweeping power to restrict Americans\u2019 access to information, ideas, and media from abroad,\u201d said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the organization. \u201cWe hope that the appeals court\u2019s ruling won\u2019t be the last word.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, lawmakers who had pushed for the legislation celebrated the court's ruling.",
      "\"I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,\u201d said Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China.",
      "Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, who co-authored the law, said \u201cit's time for ByteDance to accept\u201d the law.",
      "To assuage concerns about the company\u2019s owners, TikTok says it has invested more than $2 billion to bolster protections around U.S. user data.",
      "The company has also argued the government\u2019s broader concerns could have been resolved in a draft agreement it provided the Biden administration more than two years ago during talks between the two sides. It has blamed the government for walking away from further negotiations on the agreement, which the Justice Department argues is insufficient.",
      "Attorneys for the two companies have claimed it\u2019s impossible to divest the platform commercially and technologically. They also say any sale of TikTok without the coveted algorithm \u2014 the platform\u2019s secret sauce that Chinese authorities would likely block under any divesture plan \u2014 would turn the U.S. version of TikTok into an island disconnected from other global content.",
      "Still, some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire Frank McCourt, have expressed interest in purchasing the platform. Both men said earlier this year that they were launching a consortium to purchase TikTok\u2019s U.S. business.",
      "This week, a spokesperson for McCourt\u2019s Project Liberty initiative, which aims to protect online privacy, said unnamed participants in their bid have made informal commitments of more than $20 billion in capital."

      "The 27-nation bloc\u2019s executive branch is using its sweeping digital rulebook to scrutinize the video-sharing app's role in the vote. which saw the far-right populist Calin Georgescu coming from out of nowhere to take top spot. But the election was thrown into turmoil Friday after the country\u2019s top court annulled results from the first round of voting.",

It\u2019s the second time the commission has asked the TikTok for information since the election\u2019s first round of voting on Nov. 24, and comes a day after it ordered the Chinese-owned platform to retain all election-related files and evidence.",
      "TikTok declined to comment.",
      "\u201cWe are concerned about mounting indications of coordinated foreign online influence operation targeting ongoing Romanian elections, especially on TikTok,\u201d Henna Virkkunen, the commission\u2019s executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, security and democracy, said in a post on X.",

      "BANGKOK -- China has banned exports of key materials used to make a wide range of products, including smartphones, electric vehicles, radar systems and CT scanners, swiping back at Washington after it expanded export controls to include dozens of Chinese companies that make equipment used to produce advanced computer chips.",
      "Both sides say their controls are justified by national security concerns and both accuse the other of \u201cweaponizing\u201d trade. Analysts say the latest restrictions could have a wide impact on manufacturing in many industries and supply chains.",
      "\u201cCritical mineral security is now intrinsically linked to the escalating tech trade war,\u201d Gracelin Baskaran and Meredith Schwartz of the Center for Strategic International Studies, wrote in a report on Beijing's decision.",
      "The full impact will depend partly on whether U.S. industries can compensate for any loss of access to the strategically important materials, equipment and components.",
      "Here\u2019s why this could be a tipping point in trade conflict between the two biggest economies, coming at a time when antagonisms already were expected to heat up once President-elect Donald Trump takes office, given his vows to hike tariffs on imports of Chinese-made products.",

Beijing also tightened controls on exports of graphite, which is used in EV and grid-storage batteries. China is the largest source for most of these materials and also dominates refining of those materials, which are used both for consumer goods and for military purposes.",

      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced its measures after the U.S. government ordered a slew of new measures meant to prevent sales to China of certain types of advanced semiconductors and the tools and software needed to make them. Washington also expanded its \u201centity list\u201d of companies facing strict export controls to include 140 more companies, nearly all of them based in China or Chinese-owned.",
      "Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the revised rules were intended to impair China\u2019s ability to use advanced technologies that \u201cpose a risk to our national security.\u201d The updated regulations also limit exports to China of high-bandwidth memory chips that are needed to process massive amounts of data in advanced applications such as artificial intelligence.",
      "Export licenses will likely be denied for any U.S. company trying to do business with the 140 companies newly added to the \u201centity list,\u201d as well as the dozens of others already on the list. The aim, officials said, is to stop Chinese companies from leveraging U.S. technology to make their own semiconductors.",
      "The Biden administration has been expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls while encouraging an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of semiconductors in the U.S. and other Western countries.",
      "Washington also extended the restrictions on exports of advanced semiconductor technology to companies in other countries, though it excluded companies in key allies like Japan, South Korea and the Netherlands that are thought to have adequate export controls of their own.",
      "In a word: very. For the U.S., Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and other producers of advanced technology and components, access to materials with such properties as high conductivity is crucial: gallium and germanium increasingly are used in advanced semiconductors in place of silicon.",
      "The materials subject to Chinese export controls are among 50 the United States Geologic Survey has designated as \u201ccritical minerals\u201d \u2014 non-fuel minerals essential to U.S. economic or national security that have supply chains vulnerable to disruption.",
      "Gallium topped that list. It is needed to make the same high-bandwidth memory chips the U.S. wants to avoid allowing China to access for use in artificial intelligence and defense applications. It's used to make LEDs, lasers and magnets used in many products. Germanium is used for optical fiber and solar panels, among other uses.",
      "A USGS study recently estimated the likely total cost to the U.S. economy from disruptions to supplies of gallium and germanium alone at more than $3 billion. But the situation is complicated. China imposed licensing requirements on exports of both metals in July 2023. It has not exported either to the U.S. this year, according to Chinese customs data. Antimony exports also have plunged.",
      "China produces the lion's share of most critical minerals, but there are alternatives. Japan also imports nearly all of its gallium, for example, but it also extracts it by recycling scrap metal.",
      "Washington has been moving to tap sources other than China, forming a \"Minerals Security Partnership\" with the EU and 15 other countries. President Joe Biden's visit to Africa this week highlighted that effort. Potential supply disruptions also have spurred efforts to tap U.S. deposits of rare earths and other critical materials in southeastern Wyoming, Montana, Nevada, Minnesota and parts of the American Southwest.",
      "Germanium has been extracted from zinc mined in Alaska and Tennessee and the U.S. government has a stockpile. The Department of Defense has a recycling program that can extract scrap germanium from night vision lenses and tank turret windows.",
      "But China's dominance as a supplier gives it an overwhelming cost advantage, and U.S. resource companies face strong pressures over the potential environmental impact of mines and refineries.",
      "Since then-President Trump launched a trade war against Beijing that has ramped up over time, China has adopted a relatively constrained and cautious approach in responding to the U.S. limits on access to advanced technology.",
      "Much depends on the future course of overall relations. It is unclear if Trump will follow through on his vows to push tariffs sharply higher once he takes office or if such declarations are the opening gambits in future trade negotiations.",
      "China hit back with its own tariff hikes, but excluded many items crucial for its own economy. It sanctioned certain companies, especially defense contractors doing business with Taiwan, but refrained from outright bans on exports of vital materials to the U.S.",
      "This time may be different.",
      "Just after China's Commerce Ministry announced its export ban, various Chinese industry associations including automakers and the China Semiconductor Association issued statements denouncing Washington's moves to curb access to strategically sensitive technologies and declaring that U.S. computer chips are unreliable.",
      "Beijing's announcement also extends its ban on exporting Chinese-produced gallium and other critical minerals to the U.S. to apply to all countries, entities and individuals, saying violators will \u201cbe held accountable according to law.\u201d",

    "published": "Sat, 07 Dec 2024 00:02:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Iran is poised to &ldquo;quite dramatically&rdquo; increase its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium",
    "story": [
      "Iran is poised to \u201cquite dramatically\u201d increase its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium",
      "MANAMA, Bahrain -- Iran is poised to \u201cquite dramatically\u201d increase its stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium as it has started cascades of advanced centrifuges, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency warned Friday.",
      "The comments from Rafael Mariano Grossi came just hours after Iran said it conducted a successful space launch with its heaviest payload ever, the latest for its program that the West alleges improves Tehran\u2019s ballistic missile program.",
      "The launch of the Simorgh rocket comes as Iran\u2019s nuclear program now enriches uranium at 60%, a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels of 90%. While Iran maintains its program is peaceful, officials in the Islamic Republic increasingly threaten to potentially seek the bomb and an intercontinental ballistic missile that would allow Tehran to use the weapon against distant foes like the United States.",
      "The moves are likely to further raise tensions gripping the wider Middle East over Israel\u2019s continued war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip and as an uneasy ceasefire holds in Lebanon. However, Iran may as well be preparing the ground for possible talks with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump, who in his first term unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers.",
      "The U.S. intelligence community in a report released Thursday said that while \u201cIran is not building a nuclear weapon\u201d it has \u201cundertaken activities that better position it to produce one, if it so chooses.\u201d",
      "The Iranian debate over seeking the bomb \u201crisks emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran\u2019s decision-making apparatus and shifting the thinking of current and future Iranian elites about the utility of nuclear weapons,\u201d the report added.",
      "Grossi, speaking to journalists in Bahrain, on the sidelines of the International Institute of Strategic Studies\u2019 Manama Dialogue, said his inspectors planned to see just how many centrifuges Iran would be spinning after Tehran informed his agency of its plans.",
      "\u201cI think it is very concerning,\u201d Grossi said. \u201cThey were preparing and they have all of these facilities sort of in abeyance and now they are activating that. So we are going to see.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cIf they really make them turn \u2014 all of them \u2014 it's going to be a huge jump.\u201d",
      "An IAEA statement issued shortly after Grossi's remarks said Iran had begun feeding two cascades of advanced IR-6 centrifuges with uranium previously enriched up to 20% at its underground Fordo facility. That site is located under a mountain, protecting it from airstrikes.",
      "Cascades are a group of centrifuges that spin uranium gas together to more quickly enrich the uranium. The IR-6 centrifuges enrich uranium faster than Iran\u2019s baseline IR-1 centrifuges, which have been the workhorse of the country\u2019s atomic program. Adding 20% uranium, as opposed to 5% uranium previously planned, further speeds up that process.",
      "\u201cThe facility\u2019s updated design information showed that the effect of this change would be to significantly increase the rate of production,\u201d the IAEA statement said. Iran separately will start feeding natural uranium into eight other IR-6 cascades at Fordo as well to produce 5%-enriched uranium, it added.",
      "The IAEA warned in late November that Iran was preparing to begin enriching uranium with thousands of advanced centrifuges. That came as a response to the Board of Governors at the IAEA condemning Iran for failing to cooperate fully with the agency.",
      "Iran did not acknowledge the preparations. The Iranian mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Meanwhile, the launch Friday took place at Iran\u2019s Imam Khomeini Spaceport in rural Semnan province, some 220 kilometers (135 miles) east of Tehran. That\u2019s the site of Iran\u2019s civilian space program, which has suffered a series of failed Simorgh launches in the past.",
      "The Simorgh carried what Iran described as an \u201corbital propulsion system,\u201d as well as two research systems to a 400-kilometer (250-mile) orbit above the Earth. A system that could change the orbit of a spacecraft would allow Iran to geo-synchronize the orbits of its satellites, a capability Tehran has long sought.",
      "It also carried the Fakhr-1 satellite for Iran\u2019s military, the first time Iran\u2019s civilian program is known to have carried a military payload.",
      "Iran also put the payload of the Simorgh at 300 kilograms (660 pounds), heavier than all its previous successful launches within the country. State television carried footage of a correspondent discussing the payload just as the Simorgh lifted off into the sky, as people called out: \u201cGod is the greatest!\u201d",
      "The U.S. military referred questions about the launch to the country\u2019s Space Command, which did not respond. Space experts said tracking data appeared to show the launch successfully put objects in orbit.",
      "The United States has previously said Iran\u2019s satellite launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution and called on Tehran to undertake no activity involving ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. U.N. sanctions related to Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program expired in October 2023.",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s work on space-launch vehicles \u2014 including its Simorgh \u2014 probably would shorten the timeline to produce an intercontinental ballistic missile, if it decided to develop one, because the systems use similar technologies,\u201d a U.S. intelligence community report released in July said.",
      "Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons and says its space program, like its nuclear activities, is for purely civilian purposes. However, U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003.",
      "Under Iran\u2019s relatively moderate former President Hassan Rouhani, the Islamic Republic slowed its space program for fear of raising tensions with the West. The late hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who came to power in 2021, pushed the program forward. Raisi died in a helicopter crash in May.",
      "Iran\u2019s reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, who has been signaling he wants to negotiate with the West over sanctions, has yet to offer a strategy when it comes to Iran\u2019s ambitions in space. The Simorgh launch represented the first for his administration from the country\u2019s civil space program. Iran\u2019s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard conducted a successful launch of its parallel program in September.",

      "In an era when online anger and social tensions are increasingly directed at the businesses consumers count on, Meta last year spent $24.4 million to surround CEO Mark Zuckerberg with security",
      "NEW YORK -- He\u2019s one of the most famous corporate leaders in the world, delivering products embraced by billions. But it\u2019s the haters that companies like Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta worry about.",
      "In an era when online anger and social tensions are increasingly directed at the businesses consumers count on, Meta last year spent $24.4 million on guards, alarms and other measures to keep Zuckerberg and the company\u2019s former chief operating officer safe.",
      "Some high-profile CEOs surround themselves with security. But the fatal shooting this week of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson while he walked alone on a New York City sidewalk has put a spotlight on the widely varied approaches companies take in protecting their leaders against threats.",
      "Thompson had no personal security and appeared unaware of the shooter lurking before he was gunned down.",
      "And today\u2019s political, economic and technological climate is only going to make the job of evaluating threats against executives and taking action to protect them even more difficult, experts say.",
      "\u201cWe are better today at collecting signals. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re any better at making sense of the signals we collect,\u201d says Fred Burton of Ontic, a provider of threat management software for companies.",
      "After Thompson's shooting, Burton said, \u201cI\u2019ve been on the phone all day with some organizations asking for consultation, saying, \u2019Am I doing enough?\u201d",
      "Since the killing, some health insurers have taken steps to safeguard their executives and rank-and-file workers.",
      "Medica, a Minnesota-based nonprofit health care firm, said Friday it is temporarily closing its six offices for security reasons and will have its employees work from home.",
      "\u201cAlthough we have received no specific threats related to our campuses, our office buildings will be temporarily closed out of an abundance of caution,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "A Medica spokesman said the company had also removed biographical information about its executives from its website as a precaution.",
      "UnitedHealth Group, parent of the insurer Thompson led, removed photos of its top executives from its website hours after the shooting, later removing their names and biographies.",
      "But well before the attack, some of the biggest U.S. companies, particularly those in the tech sector, were spending heavily on personal and residential security for their top executives.",
      "Meta, whose businesses include Facebook and Instagram, reported the highest spending on personal security for top executives last year, filings culled by research firm Equilar show.",
      "Zuckerberg \u201cis synonymous with Meta and, as a result, negative sentiment regarding our company is directly associated with, and often transferred to, Mr. Zuckerberg,\u201d the Menlo Park, California, company explained earlier this year in an annual shareholder disclosure.",
      "At Apple, the world\u2019s largest tech company by stock valuation, CEO Tim Cook was tormented by a stalker  who sent him sexually provocative emails and even showed up outside his Silicon Valley home at one point before the company\u2019s security team successfully took legal action against her in 2022.",
      "Cook is regularly accompanied by security personnel when he appears in public. Still, the company\u2019s $820,000 allotted last year to protect top executives is a fraction of what other tech giants spent for CEO security.",
      "Just over a quarter of the companies in the Fortune 500 reported spending money to protect their CEOs and other top executives. Of those that did, the median payment for personal security doubled over the last three years to about $98,000.",
      "In many companies, investor meetings like the one UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Thompson was walking to when he was shot are viewed as very risky because details on the location and who will be speaking are highly publicized.",
      "\u201cIt gives people an opportunity to arrive well in advance and take a look at the room, take a look at how people would probably come and go out of a location,\u201d said Dave Komendat, president of DSKomendat Risk Management Services, which is based in the greater Seattle area.",
      "Some firms respond by beefing up security. For example, tech companies routinely require everyone attending a major event, such as Apple\u2019s annual unveiling of the next iPhone or a shareholder meeting, to go through airport-style security checkpoints before entering.",
      "Others forgo in-person meetings with shareholders. Government health insurance provider Centene Corp. joined that group Thursday, citing the UnitedHealthcare executive's death in announcing that its upcoming Investor Day will be held online, rather than in-person as originally planned.",
      "\u201cBut there are also company cultures that really frown on that and want their leaders to be accessible to people, accessible to shareholders, employees,\u201d Komendat said.",
      "Depending on the company, such an approach may make sense. Many top executives are little known to the public, operating in industries and locations that make them far less prone to public exposure and to threats.",
      "\u201cDetermining the need for and appropriate level of an executive-level protection program is specific to each organization,\u201d says David Johnston, vice president of asset protection and retail operations at the National Retail Federation. \u201cThese safeguards should also include the constant monitoring of potential threats and the ability to adapt to maintain the appropriate level of security and safety.\u201d",
      "Some organizations have a protective intelligence group that uses digital tools such as machine learning or artificial intelligence to comb through online comments to detect threats not only on social media platforms such as X but also on the dark web, says Komendat. They look for what\u2019s being said about the company, its employees and its leadership to uncover risks.",
      "\u201cThere are always threats directed towards senior leaders at companies. Many of them are not credible,\u201d Komendat said. \u201cThe question always is trying to determine what is a real threat versus what is someone just venting with no intent to take any additional action.\u201d",
      "Burton, a former special agent with the U.S. Diplomatic Security Service, points out that despite the current climate, there is little in the way of organized groups that target companies.",
      "Today, one of the primary worries are loners whose rantings online are fed by others who are like-minded. It\u2019s up to corporate security analysts to zero in on such dialogue and decide whether or not it represents a real threat.",
      "And CEOs aren\u2019t the only targets of disgruntled customers. In the U.S., there were 525 workplace fatalities due to assault in 2022, according to the National Safety Council. Industries including healthcare, education and service providers are more prone to violence than others, and taxi drivers are more than 20 times more likely to be murdered on the job than other workers, the group said.",
      "But the ambush of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s Thompson this week is bound to get some CEOs second-guessing.",
      "\u201cWhat invariably happen at moments like this in time is you will get additional ears listening\u201d to security professionals seeking money to beef up executive protection, Burton says.",
      "\u201cBecause I can guarantee you there\u2019s not a CEO in America who\u2019s not aware of this incident.\u201d",

      "Democrats in Michigan are pressing to pass reproductive health care legislation before the party loses its majority with the new legislative session next year",
      "LANSING, Mich. -- Michigan Democrats are pushing this month to pass legislation they say will improve reproductive health care, in particular the safety of digital health data, ahead of Republicans taking over the state House in 2025.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is backing a bill designed to protect reproductive health data including data logged on menstrual cycle tracking apps. Similar legislation that has passed in other states is aimed at keeping the data from being used to target people seeking abortions.",
      "\u201cThis feels like a very urgent need for us to get this done while we have a window in Michigan with the Democratic majority for the next few weeks,\u201d said state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, sponsor of the digital privacy bill.",
      "The rush is a reaction to expectations that it will be harder to pass the reproductive health care policies Democrats favor after Republicans take control of the state House in January. Democrats kept control of the state Senate in the November election.",
      "Republicans have opposed the digital privacy bill over a section they say will stifle anti-abortion advertising.",
      "Other reproductive health bills to be considered during the December session that began Tuesday include a package on Black maternal health and an expansion of access to birth control.",
      "After the overturn of Roe v. Wade, some women in states with strict abortion bans began to worry that their health information could be used to track their reproductive status. Apps that track menstrual cycles became a major focus point.",
      "Abortion is constitutionally protected in Michigan. But McMorrow does not trust President-elect Donald Trump's campaign promise to veto any possible national abortion ban nor his campaign's efforts to distance itself from Project 2025, which proposed a rollback on abortion and contraception access.",
      "Period tracking apps allow women to take detailed day-by-day notes about their health, from how heavy their period flow is to additional symptoms such as cramping. They can log pregnancies and miscarriages.",
      "\u201cThese tools are really valuable,\u201d McMorrow said. \u201cI just want to make sure that the guardrails are there when indications from the incoming federal administration is they would potentially weaponize the data in a way that is very dangerous.\u201d",
      "Federal law bars medical providers from sharing health data without a patient\u2019s consent but doesn\u2019t prevent digital tech companies from tracking menstrual cycles or an individual\u2019s location and selling it to data brokers. Legislation for federal bans have never gained momentum, largely because of opposition from the tech industry.",
      "How the legislation works varies from state to state. Washington state has digital privacy law that broadly covers all health-related data while Virginia has a law that explicitly prohibits the issuance of search warrants, subpoenas or court orders for electronic or digital menstrual health data.",
      "Michigan\u2019s proposal would require businesses or organizations to use reproductive health data only for the services it provides, and consumers must be informed of how the data is being used. In order to sell that data, an entity would need explicit, signed consent from the consumer. Consumers would also have the option to opt out from their data being sold at any time.",
      "It would also regulate retailers, who often compile data to target consumers with advertisements, and the use of geofencing, which allows marketers to target consumers with ads based on their location.",
      "The bill would prohibit identifying who is receiving reproductive health care by using location information and targeting them with advertisements. This would apply to people visiting fertility or abortion clinics.",
      "The geofencing provision of the bill has drawn objection from anti-abortion advocates. Genevieve Marnon, legislative director for Right to Life of Michigan, said in committee testimony Tuesday that the bill would prevent women visiting an abortion clinic from being reached by anti-abortion ads.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t safeguarding women\u2019s reproductive health data,\" she said. \u201cIt is limiting the options presented to women.\u201d",
      "Republican Sen. John Damoose, who voted against the bill in committee, believes the geofencing provision encroaches on freedom of speech and religion by preventing anti-abortion advertising.",
      "The bill was voted out of committee Tuesday on party lines and advanced Thursday toward a final vote in the Senate chamber.",
      "Kimya Forouzan, principal state policy director at the Guttmacher Institute, expects the topic to be taken up by other state legislatures next year. Guttmacher, which supports abortion rights, tracks reproductive health trends.",
      "Over the past two years, Michigan Democrats have passed bills repealing a number of anti-abortion laws, including the state\u2019s 1931 ban, and adding surrogacy protections to state law. Lawmakers are considering a number of others related to reproductive health this month.",
      "A group of bills focused on improving maternal health for Black women would create a doula scholarship, among other measures. The Senate voted its package on the topic through to the House on Tuesday.",
      "Rep. Jaime Churches, a Democrat from the downriver area of Detroit who lost her seat in November, is trying to gain traction for two bills that would require insurance to cover fertility treatments, including in vitro fertilization and intrauterine insemination.",
      "Three bills seeking to expand access to birth control through insurance have passed the state House. McMorrow also introduced a series of bills aimed at providing long-lasting reversible contraception, such an implants or intrauterine devices, to patients who have given birth before they are discharged from a hospital.",
      "There is competition among Democrats for time during this short, lame duck session. Advocates for economic development, infrastructure and gun control measures are among the many looking to push through bills in the month that is left. Major contention over new paid sick leave and minimum wage requirements is likely to garner attention. Those discussions could reduce the amount of time available to debate reproductive health measures.",

      "The most expensive dinosaur fossil ever discovered will be on view in New York starting this weekend",
      "NEW YORK -- The most expensive dinosaur fossil ever discovered will be on view in New York starting this weekend, American Museum of Natural History officials announced Wednesday.",
      "The giant stegosaurus fossil, dubbed \u201cApex,\u201d is 11 feet (3.3 meters) tall and 27 feet (8.2 meters) nose to tail. The display will start in a giant atrium at the museum\u2019s entrance before being moved to the museum's existing fossil halls next year.",
      "The museum also confirmed the identity of the philanthropist who purchased Apex. Billionaire hedge fund manager and longtime museum donor Ken Griffin bought it at an auction in July for $45 million, the most ever paid for dinosaur remains. Sean Decatur, president of the American Museum of Natural History, said that Griffin approved a long-term loan of Apex, as well as allowing scientists to take samples from the fossil for analysis.",
      "\u201cThis partnership allows Apex to have pride of place at a museum world-renowned for its dinosaur collection and for its longstanding leadership in paleontology and, even more exciting, enables us to pursue specialized Stegosaurus research centered around this extraordinary and scientifically important specimen,\u201d Decatur said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Of the more than 80 stegosauri made available to scientific institutions, very few are substantially complete, the statement said. Apex is the most complete specimen ever found, Decatur said. With about 80% of its 320 bones preserved, it is miraculous for creature that has been dead for 150 million years.

Like Apex, the Stan fossils were purchased by a private individual with plans to make it available to the public. The T. rex has been slated to be on display in Abu Dhabi, in United Arab Emirates, at a museum that opens in late 2025.",

Here are some things to know about tsunamis:",
      "A tsunami, a word that comes from the Japanese characters for harbor and wave, is a series of extremely long waves caused by the sudden displacement of the ocean, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "\u201cMost tsunamis, and the largest, result from earthquakes on reverse faults. These tsunami-generating earthquakes originate mainly in subduction zones, where tectonic plates collide and one is forced under the other,\u201d the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.",
      "If this is large enough and closer to the ocean floor, the energy from the earthquake can cause the ocean floor to suddenly rise or fall. \u201cThis sudden vertical displacement of the ocean floor is what typically sets a tsunami in motion,\u201d NOAA said.",
      "\u201cTsunamis radiate outward in all directions from the point of origin and can move across entire ocean basins,\u201d the service says.",
      "When the waves reach land, they can cause coastal flooding, and the powerful currents can last several hours or days.",
      "The weather service calls a tsunami as \u201cone of the most powerful and destructive natural forces.\u201d",
      "Tsunamis that cause damage or death near earthquakes occur about two times a year, according to the Global Historical Tsunami Database.",
      "A tsunami racing across an ocean and causing damage or deaths more than 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) away happens about twice a decade.",
      "Tsunamis can occur in any ocean, sea or large body of water. But certain areas are prone to tsunamis because of their proximity to the source and other factors, such as depth and the shape of the ocean floor.",
      "The database says between 1900 and 2015, there were 754 confirmed events. Of those, 78% were in the Pacific Ocean. According to the database, Japan has had the most tsunamis since 1900, followed by Russia and Indonesia.",

      "Another magnitude 9.1 earthquake struck in Japan in 2011, creating a tsunami with waves reaching 127 feet (39 meters). The tsunami caused about 18,000 deaths and prompted a nuclear power plant accident."

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- NASA announced more delays Thursday in sending astronauts back to the moon more than 50 years after Apollo.",
      "Administrator Bill Nelson said the next mission in the Artemis program -- flying four astronauts around the moon and back \u2013 is now targeted for April 2026. It had been on the books for September 2025, after slipping from this year.",
      "The investigation into heat shield damage from the capsule's initial test flight two years ago took time, officials said, and other spacecraft improvements are still needed.",
      "This bumps the third Artemis mission \u2014 a moon landing by two other astronauts \u2014 to at least 2027. NASA had been aiming for 2026.",
      "NASA\u2019s Artemis program, a follow-up to the Apollo moonshots of the late 1960s and early 1970s, has completed only one mission. An empty Orion capsule circled the moon in 2022 after blasting off on NASA\u2019s new Space Launch System rocket.",
      "Although the launch and lunar laps went well, the capsule returned with an excessively charred and eroded bottom heat shield, damaged from the heat of reentry. It took until recently for engineers to pinpoint the cause and come up with a plan.",
      "NASA will use the Orion capsule with its original heat shield for the next flight with four astronauts, according to Nelson, but make changes to the reentry path at flight's end. To rip off and replace the heat shield would have meant at least a full year's delay and stalled the moon landing even further, officials said.",
      "During the flight test, NASA had the capsule dip in and out of the atmosphere during reentry, and gases built up in the heat shield's outer layer, officials said. That resulted in cracking and uneven shedding of the outer material.",
      "The commander of the lunar fly-around, astronaut Reid Wiseman, took part in Thursday\u2019s news conference at NASA headquarters in Washington. His crew includes NASA astronauts Victor Glover and Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen.",
      "\u201cDelays are agonizing and slowing down is agonizing and it\u2019s not what we like to do,\u201d Wiseman said. But he said he and his crew wanted the heat shield damage from the first flight to be fully understood, regardless of how long it took. Now they can focus with this \u201clarge decision behind us.\"",
      "Twenty-four astronauts flew to the moon during NASA's vaulted Apollo program, with 12 landing on it. The final bootprints in the lunar dust were made during Apollo 17 in December 1972.",
      "Nelson said the revised schedule should still have the United States getting astronauts back on the lunar surface before China, which has indicated 2030 for a crew moon landing.",
      "The space agency has put all the Artemis contractors, including Elon Musk's SpaceX, on notice to \u201cdouble-down\u201d to meet the schedule deadlines, according to Nelson. SpaceX's mega rocket Starship \u2014 making test flights from Texas with increasing frequency \u2014 is how astronauts will get from the Orion capsule in lunar orbit down to the surface on the first two Artemis moon landings.",

      "Bitcoin burst on the scene after trust had withered in the financial system and Washington\u2019s ability to protect people from it",
      "NEW YORK -- Born from the ashes of the 2008 global financial crisis, bitcoin arrived after trust had withered in the financial system and in Washington's ability to protect those who must participate in it. Now, it's Washington's very embrace of bitcoin that's helping to send its price to records and lining the pockets of its believers.",
      "Bitcoin briefly surged above $103,000 after President-elect Donald Trump said he intends to nominate Paul Atkins, a former regulator who's seen as friendly to crypto, as the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He would replace Gary Gensler, who critics say has been overly aggressive in his oversight of crypto.",
      "It's the latest leg in an astonishing run for bitcoin, whose swings in price are already notoriously extreme.",
      "Bitcoin has more than doubled this year, with a particularly big jump coming after Election Day, when its price was sitting below $70,000. During his campaign, Trump called for making the United States \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet.\"",
      "The crypto industry, meanwhile, did its part to bring politicians friendly to digital currencies into Washington. Crypto corporations poured over $119 million into influencing federal elections in 2024, primarily into a political action committee dedicated to electing pro-crypto candidates and defeating crypto skeptics, according to a recent review by Public Citizen.",
      "It's a large amount. Crypto companies accounted for 44% of all the corporate money contributed during this year\u2019s elections, according to the consumer advocacy organization.",
      "Such a tight embrace marks an interesting twist from bitcoin's early days, when someone or a group of someones under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto created a kind of electronic cash that wouldn't be beholden to any government or financial institution.",
      "In the white paper announcing bitcoin, Namakoto said the traditional way of doing business on the internet \u201cworks well enough for most transactions.\u201d But, Nakamoto said, it \u201cstill suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model,\u201d where a third party like a bank needs to process payments.",
      "Instead, Nakamoto suggested harnessing computing power around the world as a way to create a digital currency that can\u2019t be double-spent. \u201cWhat is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.\u201d That is what became the bitcoin network.",
      "Since then, bitcoin has moved from the financial fringes toward the mainstream, in jagged fits and starts. While it hasn't taken off as a way to pay for groceries, it found popularity as a kind of \u201cdigital gold,\u201d or a way to store value in something that's not subject to the direct influence of a federal government or a central bank.",
      "In its early days, it had a reputation for use by drug dealers, scammers, crypto enthusiasts, libertarians and others who were looking to move money without oversight by the government. Now, it's also found its way into more investor portfolios. Earlier this year, the SEC approved exchange-traded funds that track the spot price of bitcoin. Such ETFs give investors a relatively easy way to buy bitcoin directly in their existing trading accounts.",
      "Through its life, bitcoin has soared through a series of manic bull runs as well as \u201ccrypto winters\u201d that brought extreme declines. It went from just over $5,000 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to nearly $69,000 by late 2021, before crashing below $17,000 following hikes to interest rates by the Federal Reserve and the 2022 collapse of crypto exchange FTX.",
      "With bitcoin in its latest bull run, the man who's about to roll into the White House seemed to take at least some credit.",
      "\u201cCONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!!\u201d Trump said in a post on his Truth Social network. \u201c$100,000!!! YOU\u2019RE WELCOME!!!\u201d"

      "Smartmatic does not need to give Fox News any information about U.S. federal charges against the voting machine company\u2019s co-founder over alleged bribery in the Philippines",
      "NEW YORK -- Smartmatic won't be required to give Fox News a trove of information about U.S. federal charges against the voting machine company's co-founder over alleged bribery in the Philippines, a judge ruled Thursday.",
      "Fox News and parent Fox Corp. sought the information to help fight Smartmatic's $2.7 billion defamation suit over broadcasts about the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Smartmatic says its business was gutted when Fox aired false claims that the election-tech company helped rig the voting.",
      "Fox says it was simply reporting on newsworthy allegations made by then-President Donald Trump and his allies.",
      "At the same hearing, Judge David B. Cohen also turned down Smartmatic's request to question two Fox Corp. board members. The company has already questioned others.",
      "The Aug. 8 indictment of Smartmatic co-founder Roger Pi\u00f1ate and two other executives concerns a geographically distant matter: Smartmatic's efforts to get work in the Philippines between 2015 and 2018.",
      "But Fox maintains the criminal case is pertinent to Smartmatic's business prospects, and therefore to the election-tech company's claims about what it lost and stands to lose because of Fox's 2020 coverage.",
      "\u201cAs of Aug 8, governments will have to take into account the risks of doing business with a company (where some executives have been) accused of serious corruption by the U.S. Department of Justice,\" Fox lawyer Brad Masters told a New York court Thursday.",
      "He asked the court to order Smartmatic to provide any documents that it has given to the DOJ for the bribery investigation; any customer inquiries about the criminal charges; and any staff communications about the matter and its impact on the company.",
      "The indictment accuses Pi\u00f1ate and two other Smartmatic executives of scheming to pay over $1 million in bribes to a Filipino election official to deploy the company's machines and pay promptly for them. Federal prosecutors say the payments were made through sham loan agreements and via a slush fund created by overcharging for the machines.",
      "Pi\u00f1ate, who has served as Smartmatic\u2019s president, and at least one of the other executives have pleaded not guilty to conspiring to violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and to money laundering. It\u2019s unclear from court records whether the third executive has entered a plea or has an attorney who can comment on the charges.",
      "Boca Raton, Florida-based Smartmatic itself isn\u2019t charged in the criminal case. The company put the executives on leave and sought to reassure voters that elections are \u201cconducted with the utmost integrity and transparency.\u201d",
      "Smartmatic's lawyers contend the indictment is irrelevant to the defamation suit, which is about election-fraud claims that Trump's attorneys made on Fox News programs.",
      "The indictment is \u201cmerely an allegation,\u201d Smartmatic attorney Caitlin Kovacs argued Thursday. She suggested Fox wanted to \u201cplay prosecutor to the jury\u201d and \u201caccuse Smartmatic of a crime that they didn\u2019t commit.\u201d",
      "Cohen denied two similar requests from Fox while the federal investigation was ongoing. He said Thursday that the indictment didn't change his mind.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a mere accusation. It raises no presumption of guilt,\u201d he said.",
      "Smartmatic is suing over shows in which Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell portrayed the company as part of a broad conspiracy to steal the 2020 vote from Trump, a Republican and the winner of this year's election.",
      "Federal and state election officials, exhaustive reviews in battleground states and Trump\u2019s own then-attorney general found no widespread fraud that could have changed the outcome of the 2020 election. Nor did they uncover any credible evidence that the vote was tainted. Dozens of judges, including some whom Trump appointed, rejected his fraud claims.",
      "Fox News ultimately aired an interview with an election technology expert who refuted the allegations against Smartmatic.",
      "As is normal in the run-up to a civil trial, various players connected to both parties have been questioned under oath by the other side's lawyers. These out-of-court sessions are called depositions.",
      "Smartmatic wanted Thursday to get depositions ordered for Fox Corp. board members Chase Carey and Roland Hernandez. The two attended meetings where critical decisions were made, Smartmatic argues.",
      "Fox lawyer Devin Anderson said there's no indication that Carey and Hernandez \u201chave any relevant information\u201d to add. Smartmatic already has questioned other board members, including Executive Chair and CEO Lachlan Murdoch and former House Speaker Paul Ryan, as well as Fox founder Rupert Murdoch, the attorney said.",
      "Depositions generally aren't made public at this stage of a case.",
      "Smartmatic lawyer Erik Connolly said after court that the company was pursuing other information to show \u201cthat Fox Corp. controlled the disinformation spread by Fox News.\u201d",
      "A message seeking comment was sent to Fox. The news network is countersuing Smartmatic, claiming the defamation case violates a New York law against baseless suits aimed at squelching reporting or criticism on public issues.",
      "Smartmatic recently settled defamation suits against One America News Network and Newsmax. Fox News settled for $787 million last year with another voting-technology company, Dominion Voting Systems."

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Known across the globe as the stuck astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams hit the six-month mark in space Thursday with two more to go.",
      "The pair rocketed into orbit on June 5, the first to ride Boeing\u2019s new Starliner crew capsule on what was supposed to be a weeklong test flight. They arrived at the International Space Station the next day, only after overcoming a cascade of thruster failures and helium leaks. NASA deemed the capsule too risky for a return flight, so it will be February before their long and trying mission comes to a close.",
      "While NASA managers bristle at calling them stuck or stranded, the two retired Navy captains shrug off the description of their plight. They insist they\u2019re fine and accepting of their fate. Wilmore views it as a detour of sorts: \u201cWe\u2019re just on a different path.\u201d",
      "\u201cI like everything about being up here,\u201d Williams told students Wednesday from an elementary school named for her in Needham, Massachusetts, her hometown. \"Just living in space is super fun.\u201d",
      "Both astronauts have lived up there before so they quickly became full-fledged members of the crew, helping with science experiments and chores like fixing a broken toilet, vacuuming the air vents and watering the plants. Williams took over as station commander in September.",
      "\u201cMindset does go a long way,\u201d Wilmore said in response to a question from Nashville first-graders in October. He\u2019s from Mount Juliet, Tennessee. \u201cI don\u2019t look at these situations in life as being downers.\u201d",
      "Boeing flew its Starliner capsule home empty in September, and NASA moved Wilmore and Williams to a SpaceX flight not due back until late February. Two other astronauts were bumped to make room and to keep to a six-month schedule for crew rotations.",
      "Like other station crews, Wilmore and Williams trained for spacewalks and any unexpected situations that might arise.",

      "NASA astronaut Frank Rubio found that out the hard way when the Russian Space Agency had to rush up a replacement capsule for him and two cosmonauts in 2023, pushing their six-month mission to just past a year.",
      "Boeing said this week that input from Wilmore and Williams has been \u201cinvaluable\" in the ongoing inquiry of what went wrong. The company said in a statement that it is preparing for Starliner's next flight but declined comment on when it might launch again.",
      "NASA also has high praise for the pair.",
      "\u201cWhether it was luck or whether it was selection, they were great folks to have for this mission,\u201d NASA's chief health and medical officer, Dr. JD Polk, said during an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "On top of everything else, Williams, 59, has had to deal with \u201crumors,\u201d as she calls them, of serious weight loss. She insists her weight is the same as it was on launch day, which Polk confirms.",
      "During Wednesday's student chat, Williams said she didn't have much of an appetite when she first arrived in space. But now she's \u201csuper hungry\u201d and eating three meals a day plus snacks, while logging the required two hours of daily exercise.",
      "Williams, a distance runner, uses the space station treadmill to support races in her home state. She competed in Cape Cod\u2019s 7-mile Falmouth Road Race in August. She ran the 2007 Boston Marathon up there as well.",
      "She has a New England Patriots shirt with her for game days, as well as a Red Sox spring training shirt.",
      "\u201cHopefully I\u2019ll be home before that happens -- but you never know,\u201d she said in November. Husband Michael Williams, a retired federal marshal and former Navy aviator, is caring for their dogs back home in Houston.",

      "As part of the road map unfurled Thursday, Waymo plans to begin testing its driverless Jaguars in Miami next year, giving the robotaxis time to learn their way around Florida's biggest city before they start charging for rides in 2026. The move comes less than a month after Waymo opened up its robotaxi service to anyone looking for a ride in an 80-square-mile (129-square-kilometer) expanse in Los Angeles, extending its reach beyond its two major markets in Phoenix and San Francisco.",
      "Waymo also has plans to launch fleets in Atlanta and Austin next year as part of a partnership with the ride-hailing leader Uber.",

      "The steady expansion into new markets is starting to fulfill what once seemed like a fantastical dream when Google began a secret self-driving car project dubbed \"Chauffeur\u201d in 2009 that ultimately spun off as Waymo in 2016.",
      "Although Waymo is still piling up substantial losses under its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., the service now provides more than 150,000 weekly trips without any history of catastrophic traffic accidents. That track record has increased confidence that Waymo will be able to continue to steer its robotaxis into more markets and eventually produce a steady stream of profits \u2014 an expectation that helped it recently raise $5.6 billion from Alphabet and a list of other major investors.",

      "Sierra Leone has started a nationwide rollout of the single-dose Ebola vaccine",
      "FREETOWN, Sierra Leone -- Authorities in Sierra Leone on Thursday started a nationwide rollout of the single-dose Ebola vaccine, the first such campaign in West Africa where a deadly outbreak 10 years ago resulted in the death of thousands.",
      "The 2014 Ebola outbreak \u2013 the deadliest in history \u2013 was primarily in West Africa but affected Sierra Leone the most, with nearly 4,000 deaths out of the more than 11,000 recorded globally. The country also lost 7% of its healthcare workforce to the outbreak.",
      "The nationwide vaccine campaign, implemented by the government in partnership with the global vaccine alliance Gavi, the World Health Organization and the United Nations children\u2019s agency, will target 20,000 frontline workers across the country, officials said.",
      "\u201cThis is an investment in the safety of our people and a healthier Sierra Leone,\u201d Health Minister Dr. Austin Demby said.",
      "There had been no approved vaccine at the time of the 2014 outbreak that recorded up to 28,000 cases, starting in Guinea before spreading across land borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia, the other two countries affected the most.",
      "Three years have passed since the last case was recorded in Guinea, although officials have spoken of remaining threats in endemic regions.",
      "Among those killed by the disease during the 2014 outbreak were nine relatives of Hassan Kamara, a resident of Freetown. Of the 11 people he was living with at the time, only he and his baby daughter survived.",
      "\u201cThey died in front of me,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel bad sometimes speaking about this because of what I went through.\"",
      "Thursday\u2019s campaign, which launched in the capital, Freetown, was welcomed by health workers.",
      "Collins Thomas, a community health worker in Freetown, remembers losing many colleagues in 2014 as they managed patients during the outbreak in Freetown.",
      "\u201cIt was scary, because we knew nothing about the disease and learned along the line. With this vaccine, we know we are protected,\u201d Thomas said.",
      "Gavi chief executive Dr. Sania Nishtar said the organization is \u201cincredibly proud\u201d of how its support for timely and equitable access to vaccines has helped save lives and protect communities.",
      "\u201cTo have the first nationwide preventive vaccination campaign take place in the country most deeply impacted by the 2014 outbreak makes this historic milestone even more meaningful,\u201d he said.",

      "A pair of European satellites has rocketed into orbit on a mission to create artificial solar eclipses",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A pair of European satellites rocketed into orbit Thursday on the first mission to create artificial solar eclipses through fancy formation flying in space.",
      "Each fake eclipse should last six hours once operations begin next year. That's considerably longer than the few minutes of totality offered by a natural eclipse here on Earth, allowing for prolonged study of the sun's corona, or outer atmosphere.",
      "The launch took place from India.",
      "\u201cWe are a very happy science team here\u201d in India, the European Space Agency's mission scientist Joe Zender said via email.",
      "Billed as a tech demo, the two satellites will separate in a month or so and fly 492 feet (150 meters) apart once reaching their destination high above Earth, lining up with the sun so that one spacecraft casts a shadow on the other.",
      "This will require extreme precision, within just one millimeter, equivalent to a fingernail's thickness, according to the European Space Agency. To maintain their position, the satellites will rely on GPS, star trackers, lasers and radio links, flying autonomously.",
      "Each cube-shaped spacecraft is less than 5 feet (1.5 meters) across. The shadow-casting satellite holds a disk to block the sun from the telescope on the other satellite. This disk will mimic the moon in a natural total solar eclipse, with the darkened satellite posing as Earth.",
      "\u201cThis has a huge scientific relevance\u201d in addition to testing high-precision formation flying,\u201d said the European Space Agency\u2019s technology and engineering director Dietmar Pilz.",
      "Scientists need the glaring face of the sun completely blocked in order to scrutinize the wispy crown-like corona encircling it, getting an especially good look close to the solar rim on this mission. They're particularly interested to learn why the corona is hotter than the surface of the sun, and also want to better understand coronal mass ejections, eruptions of billions of tons of plasma with magnetic fields out into space.",
      "The resulting geomagnetic storms can disrupt power and communication on Earth and in orbit. Such outbursts can also produce stunning auroras in unexpected places.",
      "With a lopsided orbit stretching from 370 miles (600 kilometers) to 37,000 miles (60,000 kilometers) away, the satellites will take nearly 20 hours to circle the world. Six of those hours \u2014 at the farther end of certain orbits \u2014 will be spent generating an eclipse. Other orbits will be strictly for formation flying experiments, according to the European Space Agency.",
      "The first eclipse results should be available in March, following checkout of both craft.",
      "Zender said eclipses will be created at least twice a week, with six hours of totality each time for corona observations. The frequency will depend on solar activity, he noted, and prove a boon for scientists who now must travel across the world for a mere three to five minutes of totality during the occasional eclipse.",
      "The $210 million mission, dubbed Proba-3, is aiming for at least 1,000 hours of \u201con demand\u201d totality during its two-year operation. Once their job is done, both satellites will gradually drop lower until they burn up in the atmosphere, likely within five years.",
      "Liftoff was delayed a day by a last-minute issue with the backup propulsion system of one of the satellites, crucial for precision formation flying. The European Space Agency said engineers relied on a computer software fix.",

      "HANOI, Vietnam -- Vietnam has suspended the operations of Chinese online retailer Temu after it failed to meet a government deadline to register the company by the end of November.",
      "It is unclear if Temu, a unit of Chinese e-commerce giant Pinduoduo, will be allowed to resume its business once it registers. The suspension comes after the ministry had raised concerns about the authenticity of Temu\u2019s extremely cheap products and their impact on Vietnamese manufacturers.",
      "Temu said Thursday it was working with the Vietnam E-commerce and Digital Economy Agency and the Ministry of Industry and Trade to register its e-commerce services and had submitted required documents.",
      "Temu began selling goods in Vietnam in October with aggressive discounts and free shipping. The government had warned the company that its app and website would be blocked if it did not register before an end-of-November deadline, official Vietnam News Agency cited the Ministry of Industry and Trade as saying.",

      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- Richard Andre Newman thought he would live the rest of his life in his quiet, leafy neighborhood in suburban Virginia. He was born and raised in Bren Mar Park, where children ride their bikes and neighbors wave hello.",
      "But now, as he\u2019s approaching 60, he\u2019s considering selling his Fairfax County home and moving away. That\u2019s because he\u2019s getting a new neighbor: Plaza 500, a 466,000-square-foot data center and an adjacent electrical substation to be built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds and a community center.",
      "Newman feels helpless to stop it.",
      "\u201cI planned on staying here until I died,\u201d he said, \u201cuntil this came up.\u201d",
      "The sprawling, windowless warehouses that hold rows of high-speed servers powering almost everything the world does on phones and computers are increasingly becoming fixtures of the American landscape, popping up in towns, cities and suburbs across the United States.",
      "Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and local governments are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies. But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas, abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents are pushing back against the world\u2019s most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.",
      "Tyler Ray, a vocal critic of data centers and leader in the fight against the Virginia project, said the incentives offered are not enough to counteract the consequences of building a facility so close to homes.",
      "\u201cAll that we are asking for is, as the county is trying to bring in this data center income, that they are doing it in a way that doesn\u2019t run residents away from their homes,\u201d he said.",
      "In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling hills of the area\u2019s westernmost counties. Cyclists who ride the popular Washington & Old Dominion trail are at times flanked by data centers, and the thousands of commuters who head into the nation\u2019s capital each day can see them in the distance from the Metro.",
      "Plaza 500, one of the latest proposals in the area, is encroaching on neighborhoods like never before, said Newman, who heads a homeowners association in the community.",
      "The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials promised a significant property tax boost and, in addition to permanent positions in the data center itself, hundreds of temporary construction and electrical jobs to build the facility.",
      "Tyler Ray and his husband moved to the Bren Pointe community in 2022, hoping to balance proximity to Washington with a desire for green space.",
      "But shortly after the couple moved in, Starwood Capital began scoping out a commercial property near their new home as a possible location for the Plaza 500 project.",
      "When Ray and his neighbors learned of the proposal, they held protests, attended regular county meetings and drew media attention to their concerns to try and stop the development. But their efforts were largely unsuccessful: the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project would be grandfathered in under the old rules.",
      "Ray worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by 2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help power the data centers\u2019 hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere.",
      "A spokesman for the firm declined to respond to questions for this story.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how a general resident, even someone who has been engaging intently on an issue,\u201d Ray said, \u201chas any chance to go up against the data center industry.\u201d",
      "For local governments, attracting data centers to their municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in 2024 that Virginia\u2019s existing data centers brought in $1 billion in tax revenue, more than the $750 million in tax breaks given to the tech companies that own them in 2023.",
      "For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of direct jobs \u2014 often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently that its two data centers in Loudoun County, which has about 440,000 residents, created only around 150 direct jobs. But data center advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction, technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730 indirect jobs.",
      "Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax County should reap the benefits.",
      "\u201cI have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the big picture,\u201d Smith said. \u201cData centers are not going away.\u201d",
      "On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the 4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia river.",
      "Last year, AWS, which is owned by Amazon, paid roughly $34 million in property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a $66 million tax break. The company also paid out $10 million total in two, one-time payments to a community development fund and spent another $1.7 million in charitable donations in the community in 2023.",
      "That money has been instrumental in updating infrastructure and bolstering services for the roughly 12,000-person county, going toward a new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer, police body cameras, and $5,000 grants for homebuyers among other things.",
      "Still, some residents are skeptical of the scale of tax break deals. Suspicions started years ago, when three formerly elected officials allegedly helped approve data center deals while owning a stake in a company that contracted with AWS to provide fiber optic cables for the data centers. In June, they each paid $2,000 to settle an ethics complaint against them.",
      "Those officials are no longer in office. But some remain wary of the relationships between the company and local officials, and raised eyebrows at one of the latest data center deals which gives AWS an estimated $1 billion in tax breaks spread over the 15 years to build five new data centers.",
      "Former county commissioner Jim Doherty described a meeting with AWS officials soon after he was elected to office at an upscale restaurant in Boardman, where large windows opened onto the Columbia River.",
      "The AWS representatives asked what Doherty wanted to accomplish as a commissioner. \u201cThey said, \u2018Tell us what your dreams are. Tell us what you need. Tell us what we can do for you,\u2019\u201d Doherty recalled. Other former officials have described similar interactions. Doherty said AWS didn\u2019t ask for anything in return, but the exchange left him uneasy.",
      "\u201cWe engage with stakeholders in every community where we operate around the world, and part of that outreach is to better understand a community\u2019s goals,\u201d said Kevin Miller, AWS' Vice President of global data centers. \u201cThis helps AWS be a catalyst for communities to achieve those goals, and reflects our ongoing commitment to being good neighbors.\u201d",
      "Doherty and another former county commissioner Melissa Lindsay said they pushed unsuccessfully in 2022 for AWS to pay more in taxes in new data center negotiations. They also lobbied to hire outside counsel to negotiate on their behalf, feeling outgunned by the phalanx of AWS-suited lawyers.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to blow it up. We didn\u2019t want to run them off,\" said Lindsay. \u201cBut there were better deals to be made.\u201d",
      "Boardman Mayor Paul Keefer and Police Chief Rick Stokoe say their direct line to AWS allows them to get the most out of the company.",
      "\u201cThis road right here? Wouldn\u2019t happen if it wasn\u2019t for AWS,\u201d said Keefer, riding in the passenger seat of Stokoe\u2019s cruiser, pointing out the window at construction workers shifting dirt and laying pavement. Both Keefer and Stokoe have been in positions to vote on whether to authorize tax breaks for AWS.",
      "\u201cThese companies would not be here if they weren\u2019t getting some kind of incentive,\u201d Stokoe said. \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t be any money to talk about.\u201d",

      "Bitcoin has topped the $100,000 mark, extending a rally in the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency sparked by the election of Donald Trump",
      "NEW YORK -- Bitcoin topped $100,000 for the first time this week as a massive rally in the world's most popular cryptocurrency, largely accelerated by the election of Donald Trump, rolls on.",
      "The cryptocurrency officially to rose six figures Wednesday night, just hours after the president-elect said he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to be the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Bitcoin has soared since Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5. The asset climbed from $69,374 on Election Day, hitting as high as $103,713 Wednesday, according to CoinDesk. And the latest all-time high arrives just two years after bitcoin dropped below $17,000 following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.",
      "Bitcoin fell back below the $100,000 by Thursday afternoon, sitting above $99,000 by 4 p.m. ET. Even amid a massive rally that has more than doubled the value of bitcoin this year, some experts continue to warn of investment risks around the asset, which has quite a volatile history.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now. But chances are you\u2019ve heard about it more and more over the last few years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it\u2019s typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like ethereum, XRP, tether and dogecoin have also gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \u201cdigital alternative\u201d to traditional money, but most daily financial transactions are still conducted using fiat currencies such as the dollar. Also, bitcoin can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.",
      "Trump, who was once a crypto skeptic, has pledged to make the U.S. \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "On Thursday morning, hours after bitcoin surpassed the $100,000 mark, Trump congratulated \u201cBITCOINERS\u201d on his social media platform Truth Social. He also appeared to take credit for the recent rally, writing, \u201cYOU\u2019RE WELCOME!!!\u201d",
      "Top crypto players welcomed Trump\u2019s election victory last month, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they\u2019ve long lobbied for \u2014 which, generally speaking, aim for an increased sense of legitimacy without too much red tape. And the industry has made sizeable investments along the way. Back in August, Public Citizen, a left-leaning consumer rights advocacy nonprofit, reported finding that crypto-sector corporations spent more than $119 million in 2024 to back pro-crypto candidates across federal elections.",
      "Trump made his latest pro-crypto move when he announced his plans Wednesday to nominate Atkins to chair the SEC. Atkins was an SEC commissioner during the presidency of George W. Bush. In the years since leaving the agency, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation. He joined the Token Alliance, a cryptocurrency advocacy organization, in 2017.",
      "Under current chair Gary Gensler, who will step down when Trump takes office, the SEC has cracked down on the crypto industry \u2014 penalizing a number of companies for violating securities laws. Gensler has also faced ample criticism from industry players in the process.",
      "One crypto-friendly move the SEC did make under Gensler was the approval in January of spot bitcoin ETFs, or exchange trade funds, which allow investors to have a stake in bitcoin without directly buying it. The spot ETFs were the dominant driver of bitcoin's price before Trump's win \u2014 but, like much of the crypto\u2019s recent momentum, saw record inflows postelection.",
      "Bitcoin surpassing the coveted $100,000 mark has left much of the crypto world buzzing.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing isn\u2019t just a rally \u2014 it\u2019s a fundamental transformation of bitcoin\u2019s place in the financial system,\u201d Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder of crypto custodian Anchorage Digital, said in a statement \u2014 while pointing to the growth of who's entering the market, particularly with rising institutional adoption.",
      "Still, others note that the new heights of bitcoin's price don't necessarily mean the asset is going mainstream. The $100,000 level is \u201cmerely a psychological factor and ultimately just a number,\u201d Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at British investment company AJ Bell, wrote in a Thursday commentary.",
      "That being said, bitcoin could keep climbing to more and more all-time highs, particularly if Trump makes good on his promises for more crypto-friendly regulation once in office. If Trump actually makes a bitcoin reserve, for example, supply changes could also propel the price forward.",
      "\u201cIt is hard to overstate the magnitude of the change in Washington\u2019s attitude towards crypto post-election,\u201d Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, said via email Thursday, reiterating that prices could keep rising if trends persist. \u201cThere is a lot more demand than there is supply, and that\u2019s usually a pretty good recipe for success.\u201d",
      "Still, as with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is never promised. Worldwide regulatory uncertainties and environmental concerns around bitcoin \u201cmining\" \u2014 the creation of new bitcoin, which consumes a lot of energy \u2014 are among factors that analysts like Coatsworth note could hamper future growth. And, as still a relatively young asset with a history of volatility, longer-term adoption has yet to be seen through.",
      "Today\u2019s excitement around bitcoin may make many who aren\u2019t already in the space want to get in on the action. For those in a position to invest, Hougan says it's not too late \u2014 noting that bitcoin is still early in its development and most institutional investors \u201cstill have zero exposure.\u201d",
      "At the same time, Hougan and others maintain that it's important to tread cautiously and not bite off more than you can chew. Experts continue to stress caution around getting carried away with crypto \u201cFOMO,\u201d or the fear of missing out, especially for small-pocketed investors.",
      "\u201cA lot of people have got rich from the cryptocurrency soaring in value this year, but this high-risk asset isn\u2019t suitable for everyone,\u201d Coatsworth noted Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s volatile, unpredictable and is driven by speculation, none of which makes for a sleep-at-night investment.\u201d",
      "In short, history shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you\u2019ve made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.",
      "Coatsworth points to recent research from the Bank for International Settlements, a Switzerland-based global organization of central banks, which found that about three-quarters of retail buyers on crypto exchange apps likely lost money on their bitcoin investments between 2015 and 2022.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, during high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. And the late-2022 collapse of FTX significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall, with bitcoin falling below $17,000.",
      "Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs, and again, now the post-election frenzy. But lighter regulation from the coming Trump administration could also mean less guardrails.",

      "Speaking with \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz, Donalds said that local and federal law enforcement like U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will take the lead on deportations, which he said would focus on immigrants convicted of crimes and those who have already been given legal deportation orders but remain in the country.",
      "\"When you're talking about military assets being used, that's only in an extreme last resort. There are more than 6,000 officers who have who have dedicated their lives to having to remove illegal aliens from our country, people who already have a legal deportation order, but it hasn't been effectuated by Joe Biden,\" Donalds said.",
      "\"I think if you're going to use military assets, that's in the last resorts, but that's only for logistical purposes, Martha. And so, I think that what we have to be very careful of is not to try to throw out this idea that you're going to have troops in the United States going door to door. That is not going to happen.\"",

      "\"Just speaking with you anecdotally, it's at a minimum going to be 2 million, but it's going to be more, because the amount of people who already have a deportation order, people who are in our country who have committed crimes, people who have already been convicted of murder, they need to go and go immediately,\" Donalds told Raddatz.",

      "A federal judge paused the child sexual abuse case involving President-elect Donald Trump's education secretary pick Linda McMahon, her husband Vince McMahon and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).",
      "The Maryland lawsuit, filed in October by five John Does who worked as the ringside crew when they were teens, alleges WWE co-founders Linda and Vince McMahon turned a blind eye to years of sexual abuse of the underaged \"ring boys\" by an announcer and executives at the company. The McMahons have denied the claims.",
      "The stay in the case is a major development for the businesswoman and former Small Business Administration head -- Linda McMahon's cabinet role is tasked with investigating sexual misconduct in education programs.",

The CVA could repeal the statute of limitations in certain civil actions relating to child sexual abuse, according to Maryland House Bill 1. This includes sexual abuse and any other sexual conduct that is a crime.",
      "Earlier this week, the defendants, WWE, it's parent company TKO, and the McMahons, sought a stay in the case until the Maryland Supreme Court rules on CVA's constitutionality.

    "story": [
      "He's \"going to be a future force to be reckoned with,\" one Republican said.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has been the ultimate GOP mover and shaker since 2015, using his sway to impact the party far beyond just his own political career. Now, Vice President-elect JD Vance has some early opportunities to make his own mark.",
      "Vance, still Ohio's junior senator, has shepherded some of Trump's Cabinet picks around and can use his ties to his colleagues to promote others. He is also in touch with Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine as he mulls who to tap to replace Vance in the Senate until 2026, when that person would then have to run in a special election to serve the rest of the seat's term.",
      "It's unlikely that Vance -- or anyone -- can emulate Trump's unique ability to affect change in the party. But Vance is the country's second-highest ranking Republican and considered Trump's heir apparent, making the upcoming opportunities chances to glimpse the power the 40-year-old holds across the GOP to promote the incoming administration's goals but also his own stock beyond his formal role.",
      "\"It's pretty clear that he is in a pole position after Trump to help lead the party. So, he's going to, I think, take these opportunities to show the party that he's a loyal soldier to Donald Trump, but he's also going to be a future force to be reckoned with,\" said former Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who remains in touch with Trump's team.",
      "Vance is not a sherpa for every single Cabinet pick, but he did escort former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz, Trump's failed attorney general pick, and Pete Hegseth, tapped to lead the Pentagon, around Capitol Hill. He's also making calls to Senate colleagues about some of Trump's Cabinet choices, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
      "He's also in what one source described as semi-regular contact with DeWine as the two-term governor mulls who to appoint to the Senate seat that Vance is vacating. The decision is ultimately DeWine's, and there currently doesn't appear to be a favorite for the role, but sources said they would be surprised if the person was someone who rubbed Vance and Trump the wrong way.",
      "\"Ohio is his domain, so I think you can expect that his voice in the upcoming Senate race will be important,\" one source close to Vance said. \"There is a want to land on somebody that everybody involved will be happy with, DeWine, Trump and JD.\"",
      "To be certain, Vance can only move the needle so far with Cabinet confirmations and Senate appointments, decisions that are up to a Senate looking for chances to assert its independence and a governor who has clashed with Trump but remained electorally viable. There will also be tougher battles to come as the next administration works to muscle through its policy priorities, and Trump will still run the show as a dominant political figure who virtually blocks out the sun.",
      "But the dual conversations over appointments could offer early indications of how much Republicans listen when Vance speaks, even as someone's No. 2.",
      "\"He talks to [senators] a lot,\" said one source in Vance's orbit. \"They're his colleagues still for another four weeks. So, yeah, he works the phones. He was on Capitol Hill this week. I think he wants to see folks get in there so the administration can hit the ground running on day one.",
      "\"He's a surrogate for when the President has to be in multiple places at the same time. He's influential, but I don\u2019t know that he's more persuasive than the president as such. He\u2019s augmenting,\" the person added.",
      "Already, Vance has seen some of his allies elevated in the incoming administration.",
      "James Braid, who was Vance's deputy chief of staff in the Senate, will be the White House's formal liaison to Congress. Daniel Driscoll, another Vance ally, was tapped to be secretary of the Army. Trump picked hedge fund manager and Vance friend Scott Bessent as his treasury secretary after he donated millions to the presidential ticket.",
      "And Vance has already proven his sway by helping now-Ohio Republican Sen.-elect Bernie Moreno win Trump's endorsement in the Ohio Senate primary this year and then get him over the finish line against Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown who had defied political gravity for several cycles.",
      "There have been setbacks, too -- Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration after sexual misconduct allegations dogged his nomination, and Hegseth is facing headwinds over allegations of sexual assault and heavy drinking that he's denied. However, it's unclear how much outside help could improve their chances given the gravity of the allegations.",
      "\"This is a chance to see how many of Vice President-Elect Vance's confidants end up in the Cabinet, and whether they are Cabinet secretaries, or the other place to take a very serious look is the undersecretaries,\" said Steve Stivers, a former congressman who leads the Ohio Chamber of Commerce. \"It's not just the Cabinet secretaries, but the undersecretaries that matter here, because those will be people filling their r\u00e9sum\u00e9 being ready to move up.\"",
      "Still, there's no guarantee that Vance will be able to be as big of a mover and shaker as normally possible for vice presidents in Trump's White House.",
      "The president-elect is famously wary of others enjoying too bright of a spotlight, and there could be other high-profile Republicans who are also anticipated to be power players after Trump leaves office, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump's pick to lead the State Department, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is rumored to be in the mix for Pentagon chief if Hegseth's nomination falls through.",
      "\"Obviously, he has a great opportunity here. But I think for folks to say it's a fait accompli that JD Vance is somehow ahead of the rest of the field today, I just don't think that's accurate,\" said one former senior Trump administration official.",
      "\"What is he going to do that's outside of the Trump shadow, that is actually him, that is not him acting as a liaison for Donald Trump? And of those things, what does he do that pisses off Donald Trump? Because it's a guy that doesn't really like people operating outside of his shadow.\"",
      "But at the end of the day, Vance will have a more elevated platform than any other Republican in the country except for one, and Trump enters office as a lame duck because of constitutional term limits, possibly leaving Vance well-positioned for a potential vacuum in a party dominated by Trump for nearly a decade.",
      "\"Trump picked him for a specific reason, and that reason is to carry the mantle. Now, he's 40 years old. That dude could be around for a while. Trump was looking ahead,\" said Ohio GOP strategist Mike Hartley. \"I think he's going to give him every opportunity to succeed.\"",

      "Senior staffers from the Trump and Harris campaigns met at Harvard University's Campaign Managers Conference on Friday to discuss the summer of 2024, which gave way to an unprecedented political season that included a disastrous debate performance for President Joe Biden, a subsequent new Democratic nominee in Vice President Kamala Harris, and two assassination attempts on former President Donald Trump.",
      "Much of the debate focused on the 107 days with Harris as the new Democratic nominee and how the campaigns had to tweak their strategies on a highly truncated timeline. The following are highlights from the sprawling, wide-ranging conversation.",
      "Sparks flew toward the end of their discussion when a member of the Trump campaign said the former president \"outworked\" Harris.",
      "\"Why didn't you trust your candidate more?\" questioned Taylor Budowich, deputy campaign manager for the Trump campaign. \"Why didn't you put her out more? You said \u2026 you couldn't ever compete with the amount of attention Donald Trump got. You never gave her a shot.\"",
      "The Harris campaign pushed back at Budowich, saying that its strategy was successful and not that the Trump campaign outworked them.",
      "\"Your strategy was a good strategy, but you have no idea how hard the people on the other side worked,\" said Quentin Fulks, principal deputy campaign manager for the Harris campaign. \"I have no idea how hard you all work.\"",
      "Budowich interjected, saying he was referring to Harris and not the entire campaign, but Fulks asserted that Harris worked hard.",
      "\"I didn't say she didn't work hard. I said she got outworked,\" Budowich clarified.",
      "Fulks defended the vice president, explaining that it was not a fair comparison because the Harris campaign had a different strategy, which he said wasn't successful. He reiterated that it was nothing related to her work ethic.",
      "Asked by ABC News' Brittany Shepherd about the fallout from President Joe Biden seeming to call Trump supporters garbage on a call hosted by the nonprofit Voto Latino during the final weeks of the campaign, Fulks said Democrats need to do a better job at not creating self-inflicted wounds -- pointing to some in his own party very quickly criticizing Biden after the White House, and Biden himself, attempted to clarify the statement, in comparison to what he sees to be Republicans' very long leash for Donald Trump.",
      "\"Our people, once again, continue to shoot ourselves in the foot,\" Fulks said.",
      "\"The discipline on the Right is better than the discipline on the Left,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd that is not about morals, values, any of that. It's literally about discipline and seeing the big picture of how you win and what you can swallow in order to get to a win.\"",
      "Jen O'Malley Dillon, Harris campaign chairwoman, didn't stray with the repeated messaging on Biden's debate performance, reiterating he had a \"bad night\" and pointing to Obama as a precedent of incumbents having uneven debates, and argued the campaign saw a real path for Biden to win the election despite it all.",
      "\"So, we very much felt like we throughout had a path to 270. We felt like we had the right candidate, the person we believed in, and the person was leading our country quite well,\" O'Malley Dillon said. \"We still believe that.\"",
      "Without pointing to a particular moment, Fulks conceded that early in the debate, campaign staff could tell Biden wasn't performing.",
      "Trump's team was far more pointed, saying it was evident Biden \"was not going to survive\" the election cycle \"about a minute\" into the debate, according to Chris LaCivita, Trump's co-campaign manager.",
      "\"I think that for us, and this was with all due respect to the president, we felt like there were challenges that were on full display at the debate,\" said James Blair, the Trump campaign's political director. \"There's also been days where those challenges seem less apparent. That night was not one of them.\"",
      "Referring to Biden's debate performance and what followed, O'Malley Dillon said, \"There has probably not been a more difficult period for a campaign team to navigate.\"",
      "Blair quickly interjected, noting that two assassination attempts and navigating the indictments were also challenging to navigate, and O'Malley Dillon later acknowledged the difficulty of the Trump team's summer and mentioned she reached out to Susie Wiles, Trump campaign manager, in the aftermath.",
      "When asked about the large number of Democrats calling for Biden to drop out of the race following his disastrous debate performance, Fulks referred to it as a \"slow bleed.\"",
      "Fulks later agreed with a point LaCivita made earlier in the day: Visuals matter when running for office, and the Biden campaign wanted to put Biden out in public, doing a series of events to counter his debate performance.",
      "\"I think Chris is right,\" Fulks said. \"Something visual happened in front of people's eyes. The only way to combat that is to give them something visual. And the only visual play you have at that point is putting Joe Biden in front of as many people as possible, which is what we tried to do. And so, when he caught COVID, it's almost like a dagger.\"",
      "The Trump campaign said it was preparing for what ended up becoming inevitable, adding that it began tracking and opposition research and polling alternative running mates as early as May on Harris but also ranged in other possible candidates, such as Michelle Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.",
      "Clearly a pivotal political moment as much as it was a harrowing personal moment for both campaigns, the first assassination attempt on Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, \"severely limited where we could campaign because, after the first attempt, they basically told us, lock down, no more outdoor events,\" said Tony Fabrizio, chief pollster for the Trump campaign. \"And if we want to do an outdoor event, it needed, like, double the lead time.\"",
      "The Harris campaign, for its part, pulled its negative advertising in the days after the assassination attempt.",
      "\"We also were mindful about the way that we were campaigning. \"There's no place for political violence in democracy. And we wanted to make sure that our campaign was reflecting that in this moment,\" added Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Harris campaign manager.",
      "The Harris campaign, pressed multiple times on whether it was made aware of Biden's decision to drop out of the 2024 race prior to him making the announcement public or if there were any conversations beforehand about the possibility of Biden dropping out, asserted it found out shortly before he made his announcement and that there were no conversations beforehand.",
      "Asked if there was any chance of another Democrat becoming the nominee besides Harris, Fulks said there's always a possibility but noted that Biden wanted to throw his support behind Harris. He added that a Democratic primary this late in the cycle would have been messy.",
      "\"From my perspective, Vice President Harris was the only commonsense choice to be made. But I think that President Biden made that -- she's his vice president and she was loyal to him, and he decided to support her,\" Fulks said.",

      "Tim Parlatore said the woman is now free to speak publicly.",
      "Pete Hegseth's attorney has threatened legal action against a woman who accused President-elect Donald Trump's selection for defense secretary of sexual assault -- if she repeats what he calls \"false\" claims and his client ultimately fails to get confirmed.",
      "Tim Parlatore said in an interview on CNN Thursday night that a confidentiality agreement covering both her and Hegseth, part of a 2020 settlement with the former Fox News host, is no longer in effect, and that the unidentified woman, who filed a police report in 2017 alleging Hegseth sexually assaulted her in a hotel, is now free to speak publicly about the case.",
      "However, Parlatore said he would consider a lawsuit against the woman for civil extortion or defamation if she made what he called false claims that jeopardized his client's future in the Trump administration or \"his future employment opportunities.\"",
      "\"If she doesn't tell the truth, if she repeats these false statements, then she will be subject to a defamation lawsuit. But now that she -- and she's well aware of that, her attorney was well aware that because of the breach of the agreement that is no longer in any force, in effect, she is free to speak if she wants,\" the attorney said.",
      "Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee that would hold Hegseth's confirmation hearings, told CNN Thursday that the threat to potentially sue Hegseth's accuser is meant to intimidate her and is \"reprehensible.\"",
      "\"What they're doing, essentially, is threatening or intimidating a potential witness,\" he said.",
      "Details of her allegations about the October 2017 incident were compiled in a Monterey Police Department report released last month. At the time, the woman told investigators that she encountered Hegseth at an event afterparty at a California hotel where both had been drinking.",
      "The woman claimed she did not recall how she ended up in Hegseth's room later and said he sexually assaulted her, according to the report. Hegseth \"took her phone from her hands\" and, when she attempted to leave, \"blocked the door with his body,\" according to what she told investigators.",
      "Hegseth told investigators the sexual encounter was consensual. No charges were brought. However in December 2020, Hegseth paid the woman an undisclosed sum as part of a settlement because he feared his career would suffer if her allegations were made public, according to Parlatore.",
      "The woman, who is only identified in the police report as Jane Doe, has not publicly come forward.",
      "Hegseth has repeatedly reiterated that he was not charged and has denied the assault allegations.",
      "He has come under heavy fire over the last few weeks over news reports about the incident and other allegations of heavy drinking, mismanagement, extramarital affairs and other controversies.",
      "Trump has stood by his selection and Hegseth has dismissed questions about whether he would withdraw.",

      "Tesla and X CEO Elon Musk spent over a quarter of a billion dollars to help get President-elect Donald Trump back in the White House, according to newly released campaign finance records.",
      "The billionaire tech mogul spent over $270 million of his own money through two super PACs that promoted Trump's candidacy and other Republicans, including one that appeared to refer to deceased liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, according to filings released Thursday night by the Federal Election Commission.",
      "Musk spent roughly $240 million on his pro-Trump super PAC America. The PAC was created after Musk endorsed Trump in July, which made Musk the single largest political spender in the shortest period of time.",
      "Half of the PAC's money came in the final weeks of the election and in the weeks following the election, and by Nov. 25, the PAC only had $2 million left in the account, according to the FEC.",
      "Much of the money was spent on direct mail, canvassing and phone calls, the PAC's filing showed.",
      "The filing also showed a total of nine $1 million payments given to nine individuals labeled as \"spokesperson consultant,\" which appeared to be the swing state voters that won Musk's controversial daily $1 million prize.",
      "Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner sued the PAC in October contending Musk was running an illegal lottery in Pennsylvania.",
      "Common Pleas Court Judge Angelo Foglietta denied an injunction request a few weeks later after an attorney for the PAC testified that the giveaway wasn't random, despite Musk's claims that they were.",

      "A spokesperson says Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also plans to follow all ethics rules.",
      "Mehmet Oz, the celebrity doctor picked by President-elect Donald Trump to oversee the country's Medicare and Medicaid programs, has agreed to stop promoting health and wellness products if confirmed by the Senate, according to a spokesperson for the Trump transition.",
      "Likewise, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2013 who recently raised eyebrows by appearing on his wife's social media account apparently showering naked in the background while she promoted her beauty line \u2013 also has agreed to disclose his finances and undergo a federal ethics review if confirmed as health secretary, said spokesperson Katie Miller.",
      "\"Both Mr. Kennedy and Dr. Oz plan to divest where appropriate and fully cooperate with the Office of Government of Ethics,\" Miller told ABC News.",
      "Whether Trump's nominees planned to follow traditional ethics rules that have governed Washington policymakers for decades had been an open question.",
      "Trump has picked several billionaires to lead his Cabinet, while Kennedy and Oz promoted wellness companies in new online posts even after being named as part of the incoming administration.",
      "Experts say it's still possible for any nominee to try to test the bounds of ethics rules.",
      "While many requirements are spelled out in law, Trump's Justice Department would be in charge of enforcing those rules. Trump also would ultimately be in charge of the federal ethics office after inauguration and would be responsible for pursuing or authorizing any disciplinary or corrective action among his cabinet members.",
      "Still, the transition's promise to follow ethics rules is an important first step, aid Delaney Marsco, ethics director for the nonprofit Campaign Legal Center.",
      "\"It is one of the most basic commitments to not commit a criminal conflict of interest violation\" when taking a government job, Marsco said.",
      "\"The price of having all this power is that you have to use it to serve the public. And part of that deal is that you can't have financial conflicts of interest that would cloud your judgment,\" she added.",
      "Ethics laws require office holders to either divest investments that pose a conflict of interest or recuse themselves from making decisions related to those investments.",
      "Separate federal regulations impose standards of conduct that generally prohibit government officials from promoting products online that could be seen as a kind of federal endorsement.",
      "Five days after Oz was named as the incoming head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \u2013 a federal agency that oversees federal health insure for 160 million Americans and regulates private insurers \u2013 he turned to social media to promote iHerb, an online retailer that sells vitamins and supplements.",
      "\"Thanksgiving is a perfect excuse for practicing gratitude -- which also happens to be a proven way to reduce stress. You can also reduce stress with adaptogens like ashwagandha from a trusted source like iHerb. Happy Thanksgiving!\" Oz wrote on X, with a similar video message posted on his personal Instagram account.",
      "Last month, Kennedy posted a similar post promoting an online fitness game called BoxBollen shortly after Trump named him to be health and human services secretary.",
      "\"The ideal stocking stuffer! \" Kennedy said in a video playing the game and wearing the game's headband.",
      "Kennedy quickly deleted his post.",
      "Miller said Kennedy has canceled his promotional contract already, while Oz plans to end his relationship with iHerb to avoid any potential conflict of interest.",
      "Oz also does not have any ongoing contractual agreements with weight-loss drugs, which he has promoted in the past on his syndicated television show.",
      "Separately, Oz's regular posts promoting iHerb prompted calls this week by the liberal consumer watchdog group Public Citizen for an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. FTC rules requires online influencers to make clear in their posts if they are being paid to promote products.",
      "The FTC declined to comment on whether it would consider such a request. There are no records of past actions against Oz by the FTC.",
      "Less clear is how federal ethics rules might apply to the business owned by Kennedy's wife, Cheryl Hines, which sells home and body products.",
      "Marsco of the Campaign Legal Center said spouses typically aren't required to step away from their jobs or businesses because their partner was hired by the U.S. government. However, government officials are required to recuse themselves from making decisions that could impact their spouse's employment and would still have to divest financial holdings that conflict with their work.",
      "Those details would have to be worked out with the ethics office and enforced by the president, she said. Under the law, the couple could divest their financial interest in the company to Hines' adult daughter while he remains in office.",
      "Marsco said these requirements won't kick in until after Trump takes office and they are officially nominated.",
      "\"Assuming they follow through with what they've said, which is that they're going to fully cooperate and divest and follow all the conflict of interest laws and rules, then that is what is frankly expected of people in their position,\" she said."

    "summary": "A $30 million investment in Donald Trump's new crypto venture made by a Chinese billionaire accused of fraud by the SEC is sparking concerns from government watchdogs.",
    "story": [
      "Justin Sun's investment could deliver a Trump company an eight-figure payday.",
      "A sudden infusion of $30 million into Donald Trump's nascent cryptocurrency venture from a Chinese billionaire sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly defrauding investors could potentially deliver an eight-figure payday to a company associated with the president-elect.",
      "The investment has sparked new concerns about Trump's ability to potentially profit from foreign investors, and his positions on cryptocurrency following a presidential campaign in which he vowed to make the United States \"the crypto capital of the planet.\"",
      "Justin Sun -- a cryptocurrency billionaire famous in part for his purchase of a $6 million banana art piece last month -- announced his $30 million investment in the Trump-backed World Liberty Financial last week, making him the company's largest investor.",
      "The influx of cash also triggered a provision that allows an entity affiliated with Trump to receive 75% of the company's net revenue, based on the terms outlined in a recent company filing.",
      "DT Marks DEFI LLC, a company affiliated with Trump, stands to profit more than $15 million following Sun's investment, renewing concerns about the potential influence on Trump's cryptocurrency positions and the future of the SEC lawsuit against Sun and his companies for allegedly violating securities laws. Sun and his companies have denied wrongdoing.",
      "\"It's hard to have more influence when you're talking about money in politics than someone who just directly gave you eight figures,\" said Jordan Libowitz, a vice president at the progressive watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.",
      "The investment comes as Trump recently announced a series of pro-crypto nominees for his administration, including veteran regulator and cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Silicon Valley venture capitalist David Sachs to be White House AI and crypto czar.",
      "Trump has denied all allegations that he has profited from the presidency.",
      "\"President Trump removed himself from his multi-billion-dollar real estate empire to run for office and forewent his government salary,\" Trump-Vance transition spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to ABC News. \"Unlike most politicians, President Trump didn't get into politics for profit -- he's fighting because he loves the people of this country and wants to make America great again.\"",
      "World Liberty Financial and Justin Sun did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Despite once calling cryptocurrency a \"scam,\" Trump threw his support in September behind World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance platform that could eventually be a marketplace for borrowing and lending various cryptocurrencies.",
      "\"We have to be No. 1,\" Trump said at the announcement, regarding the United States' position in the crypto market. \"I think AI is really important, but I think crypto is one of those things we have to do,\"",
      "World Liberty Financial makes money, at this time, through the sale of tokens, which gives investors a say in the company's governance; however, the tokens don't offer a share of the company's revenue and can't be resold.",
      "Trump is not an officer or employee of the company, but DT Marks DEFI LLC receives a bulk of World Liberty Financial's revenue if the venture is a success, leading some ethics experts to raise concerns that the company could be a vehicle for directing funds to Trump.",
      "\"To call it an ethical problem is to understate how fundamentally corrupt it is,\" said Robert Weissman, the co-president of consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. \"They've set up a way for people to funnel money to Donald Trump, and now it's happening.\"",
      "Two months after its launch, the company failed to make much traction in the cryptocurrency space after it faced criticism about its ambiguous business plan beyond its association with Trump. According to James Butterfill, the head of research at asset management company CoinShares, the company's early marketing materials offered little more than \"buzzwords.\"",
      "The weak launch also suggested its founders and the Trumps would make little to no money from the venture. Because World Liberty Financial had made less than $30 million in revenue prior to Sun's investment, all of the money raised by the company would be held in a reserve to cover operating expenses while the Trumps would make nothing, according to terms in the company's so-called \"gold paper.\"",
      "Enter Justin Sun, the eclectic cryptocurrency billionaire who -- prior to spending millions on a banana duct-taped to a wall -- attracted headlines for spending more than half a million dollars on an NTF of a pet rock, and $4.5 million for a lunch with Warren Buffet.",
      "His $30 million investment through Tron -- the popular cryptocurrency he founded in 2017 -- made him the largest investor in the project and fueled resurgence of interest in the once-struggling platform.",
      "\"The U.S. is becoming the blockchain hub, and Bitcoin owes it to @realDonaldTrump!\" Sun wrote on X announcing his investment.",
      "Last year the SEC sued Sun and his companies with securities fraud for allegedly manipulating the value of a cryptocurrency and paying celebrities including Lindsey Lohan, Ne-Yo, and Jake Paul to promote the assets without disclosing they had been paid. Sun and his companies have denied wrongdoing, and the celebrities have settled the case without admitting or denying the allegations.",
      "Tron and other cryptocurrencies have also faced criticism for allegedly enabling criminals to make financial transactions undetected, with a report from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime calling Tron \"a preferred choice for crypto money launderers in East and Southeast.\" Tron's leadership called the report's allegation \"inaccurate\" and said it \"supports the UN's stance against malicious actors in the blockchain space.\"",
      "After his $30 million investment, World Liberty Financial named Sun an adviser, saying that his \"insights and experience will be instrumental\" to the company's growth.",
      "Weissman told ABC News he was concerned about the arrangement.",
      "\"It's exactly the sort of figure that you'd want to run away from if you were starting a business, and instead they're embracing it,\" Weissman said of World Liberty Financial and Sun.",
      "The investment could prove to be lucrative for Sun, given Trump's association with the project and the number of cryptocurrencies that have rallied following the election. On Thursday, shares of the leading cryptocurrency bitcoin surpassed $100,000 for the first time.",
      "\"With a lot of crypto, having good PR or a good kind of voice helps a lot to get something noticed, and there's no better time for World Liberty Financial,\" Butterfill said. \"The lines between the private endeavor that this is and the public connections that Trump has are quite blurred, and the kind of people running World Liberty Financial will probably play on that a little bit.\"",
      "Trump's name and likeness are seen throughout World Liberty Financial's website and marketing materials, and Trump himself is listed as the company's \"chief crypto advocate,\" though the firm discloses that neither Trump nor his family members are officers of the company. According to the company, World Liberty Financial is \"inspired\" by Trump and hopes to introduce the platform \"to a broader audience that may have previously been unfamiliar or hesitant to engage with decentralized assets and cryptocurrency.\"",
      "\"They're trying to take advantage of President-elect Trump's popularity and the fact that he just won an election, and see if they can get this business up and running and off the ground,\" said Scott Amey, general counsel at the watchdog Project on Government Oversight.",
      "Though Sun and Trump have never met, several ethics experts ABC News spoke with also raised concerns that the investment -- and Trump's possible profit from it -- could influence Trump's policy toward cryptocurrencies, including whether the Securities and Exchange Commission continues to pursue the aggressive litigation brought under the Biden administration.",
      "\"If you face charges from the SEC, it's a pretty good investment to put money in the future president's hands in order to influence who might end up making those decisions at the SEC,\" said Libowitz.",
      "Steve Witkoff, Trump's longtime friend who, along with his sons, is a co-founder of World Liberty Financial, told ABC's \"Good Morning America\" in September that Trump's foray into crypto would not pose a conflict because he would likely place his assets into a trust -- as Trump did during his first administration when he placed his assets into a revocable trust controlled by his sons and a business associate.",
      "But that arrangement would not fully remedy the concerns about conflicts stemming from Trump's crypto venture, according to multiple experts. Trump is still able to broadly understand the state of his assets, he can still profit from them, and he has the authority to regain control of the assets -- all of which limit the trust's effectiveness in preventing conflicts, several experts said.",
      "\"Absent divesting and stepping away from these investments totally, he still stands to profit from them,\" said Amey.",

      "Rose Sewcharran, director of Wonderlust Adventures, the private tour operator who plans to take visitors to Jonestown, said she was buoyed by the support.",
      "\u201cWe think it is about time,\u201d she said. \u201cThis happens all over the world. We have multiple examples of dark, morbid tourism around the world, including Auschwitz and the Holocaust museum.\u201d",
      "The November 1978 mass suicide-murder was synonymous with Guyana for decades until huge amounts of oil and gas were discovered off the country\u2019s coast nearly a decade ago, making it one of the world\u2019s largest offshore oil producers.",
      "New roads, schools and hotels are being built across the capital, Georgetown, and beyond, and a country that rarely saw tourists is now hoping to attract more of them.",
      "An obvious attraction is Jonestown, argued Astill Paul, the co-pilot of a twin-engine plane that flew U.S. Rep. Leo J. Ryan of California and a U.S. news crew to a village near the commune a day before hundreds died on Nov. 18, 1978. He witnessed gunmen fatally shoot Ryan and four others as they tried to board the plane on Nov. 18 and fly back to the capital.",
      "Paul told the AP he believes the former commune should be developed as a heritage site.",
      "\u201cI sat on the tourism board years ago and did suggest we do this, but the minister at the time lashed the idea down because the government wanted nothing to do with morbid tourism,\u201d he recalled.",
      "Until recently, successive governments shunned Jonestown, arguing that the country\u2019s image was badly damaged by the mass murder-suicide, even though only a handful of Indigenous people died. The overwhelming majority of victims were Americans like Vilchez who flew to Guyana to follow Jones. Many endured beatings, forced labor, imprisonment and rehearsals for a mass suicide.",
      "Those in favor of a tour include Gerry Gouveia, a pilot who also flew when Jonestown was active.",
      "\u201cThe area should be reconstructed purely for tourists to get a first-hand understanding of its layout and what had happened,\" he said. \u201cWe should reconstruct the home of Jim Jones, the main pavilion and other buildings that were there.\u201d",
      "Today, all that is left is bits of a cassava mill, pieces of the main pavilion and a rusted tractor that once hauled a flatbed trailer to take temple members to the Port Kaituma airfield.",
      "Until now, most visitors to Jonestown have been reporters and family members of those who died.",
      "Organizing an expedition on one\u2019s own is daunting: the area is far from the capital and hard to access, and some consider the closest populated settlement dangerous.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still a very, very, very rough area,\u201d said Fielding McGehee, co-director of The Jonestown Institute, a nonprofit group. \u201cI don\u2019t see how this is going to be an economically feasible kind of project because of the vast amounts of money it would take to turn it into a viable place to visit.\u201d",
      "McGehee warned about relying on supposed witnesses who will be part of the tour. He said the memories and stories that have trickled down through generations might not be accurate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a game of telephone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does not help anyone understand what happened in Jonestown.\u201d",
      "He recalled how one survivor had proposed a personal project to develop the abandoned site, but those from the temple community said, \u2018Why do you want to do that?\u2019",
      "McGehee noted that dark tourism is popular, and that going to Jonestown means tourists could say they visited a place where more than 900 people died on the same day.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the prurient interest in tragedy,\u201d he said.",
      "If the tour eventually starts operating, not everything will be visible to tourists.",
      "When Vilchez returned to Guyana in 2018 for the first time since the mass suicide-murder, she made an offering to the land when she arrived in Jonestown.",
      "Among the things she buried in the abandoned commune where her sisters and nephews died were snippets of hair from her mother and father, who did not go to Jonestown.",
      "\u201cIt just felt like a gesture that honored the people that died,\u201d she said.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico\u2019s Senate has voted to charge cruise ship passengers $42 per head for port calls, drawing sharp criticism from the tourism industry.",
      "Mexican business chambers say the immigration charge \u2014 from which cruise passengers used to be exempt \u2014 may hurt the country\u2019s half-billion-dollar-per-year cruise industry.",
      "The measure approved late Tuesday has already been passed in the lower house and will go into effect in 2025. The changes were part of a bill that also increases airport immigration charges and entry fees for nature reserves.",
      "Mexico\u2019s Caribbean coast is home to Cozumel, the busiest port of call for cruise ships in the world. The National Confederation of Commerce, Service and Tourism Chambers said the $42 charges could make other countries\u2019 Caribbean ports more competitive than Mexico\u2019s.",
      "\u201cThis could result in a significant decrease in visitors,\u201d Octavio de la Torre, the president of the federation, said Monday.",
      "In the past, cruise ship passengers were exempted from the immigration fee, because they slept aboard the vessels and some didn\u2019t even get off the ship during port calls. Now, even those people would apparently be charged the $42 fee, according to the new law.",
      "There have been initiatives throughout the world to curb cruise ships for fear of over-tourism, but that train left the station long ago in the case of Mexico\u2019s Caribbean coast. Cozumel has been the world\u2019s busiest port of call for years, welcoming about four million cruise passengers per year.",

      "The Mexican Association of Shipping Agents cried foul last week.",
      "\u201cIf this measure is implemented, it would make Mexican ports of call among the most expensive in the world, severely affecting their competitiveness with other Caribbean destinations,\u201d the association said in a statement.",
      "Mexico\u2019s ruling Morena party is already running enormous budget deficits to fund its favorite building projects like railways and oil refineries \u2014 some of which are being built by the army. The government is desperate to find new revenue sources."

    "story": [
      "A U.S. Senate subcommittee has held a hearing to question the growing use of airline fees to charge passengers for things like early boarding and better seats",
      "Members of a U.S. Senate subcommittee took aim at airline executives Wednesday for using an expanding menu of fees to charge customers for early boarding, better seats and other comforts that used to be part of the ticket price.",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said he thinks the federal government should review and perhaps fine the airlines for their use of what he called junk fees.",
      "Blumenthal, the chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said seat fees were pure profit for the airlines because they don't have to create new seats or incur other expenses by allowing customers to pick where to sit.",
      "Some senators expressed frustration during Wednesday's hearing when airline executives could not explain how they set the amount of various fees. They said the vagaries of airline pricing make it hard for consumers to budget for trips.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all captives on your airplanes at a certain point. You just say, \u2018You want to pick seat? We\u2019re just going to charge you some random amount more,\u2019\u201d Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., said. \u201cIt would be good if you guys could be transparent about what you do and why.\u201d",
      "The fees don't seem to be discouraging anybody. Americans are flying more than ever.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration reported screening nearly 3.1 million travelers at airports around the country on Sunday, a new single-day record. The 15 busiest days in TSA history have all occurred this year, with traffic at airport checkpoints up 5% over 2023.",
      "Airline executives bristle at the term \u201cjunk fees,\u201d and argue they are merely giving consumers what they want: choices.",
      "\u201cOur customers who prioritize affordability have the option to choose a lower-fare product and, in doing so, opt out of paying for additional services that they do not want,\u201d Andrew Nocella, the chief commercial officer of United Airlines, said in testimony prepared for the panel's hearing. \u201cBut we also have customers who seek more services, and they retain the ability to choose the services they value, for an incremental fee, like a seat with extra legroom or checked bags.\u201d",
      "Airlines have been adding fees on desirable seats to take advantage of increasing demand.",
      "The airline executives took offense at the charge that they are gouging travelers.",
      "\u201cIt has never been more affordable to fly,\" said Steve Johnson, chief strategy officer for American Airlines.",
      "Transportation Department figures indicate that airfares have fallen by about one-third since 2000 when taking inflation into account. However, those figures do not include fees.",
      "Senators said fees should be described clearly during the ticket-buying process. The executives said their airlines do that.",
      "Some subcommittee members also criticized airlines for the way they enforce fees.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., sparred with executives of Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines, which paid employees $26 million in bonuses for spotting customers whose carry-on bags were too big to fit under a seat. The passengers were forced to pay a fee \u2014 up to $77 on Spirit and $99 on Frontier \u2014 to use an overhead bin.",
      "\u201cIf people want to know why it\u2019s such a terrible experience to fly, this is news for them today,\u201d Hawley told the airlines executives Wednesday. \u201cYour airlines are paying millions of dollars to your employees to harass people who have already paid!\u201d",
      "Frontier Chief Commercial Officer Robert Schroeter and his counterpart at Spirit, Matthew Klein, said ensuring that people follow the rules was a matter of fairness to all passengers.",
      "When Hawley asked why bag fees may vary from one customer to another, Schroeter said Frontier must cover its costs.",
      "\u201cOverall, our job is to generate the most revenue we can so we can keep profitable as an airline,\u201d he said.",
      "U.S. airlines raised more than $7 billion from fees on checked bags last year, with American Airlines and United Airlines leading the pack. They scooped up another $1 billion in ticket-change and cancellation fees, although that was about one-third of what they raised before the coronavirus pandemic, when the biggest airlines dropped change fees.",
      "Exact figures on other types of fees are hard to determine, but the Senate panel reported last week that United, American, Delta Air Lines, Frontier and Spirit collected a combined total of more than $12 billion in seat fees between 2018 and 2023. That included charges for things such as more legroom or an aisle seat near the front of the plane.",
      "Airline fees have been a frequent target of criticism by the Biden administration, all the way up to President Joe Biden.",
      "A Transportation Department rule that took effect in October requires airlines to make automatic cash refunds for tickets and fees when flights are canceled.",
      "The airline industry is suing to block another regulation requiring more prominent disclosure of baggage and cancellation fees. An appeals court has blocked that rule, and its fate is uncertain under President-elect Donald Trump. Blumenthal asked the five executives to drop the lawsuit. None agreed to do so.",
      "The airline industry and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg have continued to fight over fees and other regulations, even after the November election."

      "Biden spoke at the White House hours after rebel groups completed a takeover of the country following more than a dozen years of violent civil war and decades of leadership by Assad and his family. Biden said the United States was monitoring reports of the whereabouts of Assad, with Russian state media saying he had fled to Moscow and received asylum from his longtime ally.",
      "The outgoing Biden administration and President-elect Donald Trump were working to make sense of new threats and opportunities across the Middle East.",
      "Biden credited action by the U.S. and its allies for weakening Syria's backers \u2014 Russia, Iran and Hezbollah. He said \u201cfor the first time\u201d that they could no longer defend Assad's grip on power.",
      "\u201cOur approach has shifted the balance of power in the Middle East,\" Biden said, after a meeting with his national security team.",
      "Trump said Sunday that Assad had fled because close ally Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, \u201cwas not interested in protecting him any longer.\u201d",
      "Those comments on Trump's social media platform came a day after he used another post to decry the possibility of the U.S. intervening militarily in Syria to aid the rebels, declaring, \u201cTHIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT.\" The Biden administration said it had no intention of intervening.",
      "The U.S has about 900 troops in Syria, including forces working with Kurdish allies in the opposition-held northeast to prevent any resurgence of the Islamic State group. Biden said he intended for those troops to remain, adding that U.S. forces on Sunday conducted \u201cprecision air strikes\" on IS camps and operations in Syria.",
      "U.S. Central Command said the operation hit more than 75 targets.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re clear-eyed about the fact that ISIS will try and take advantage of any vacuum to reestablish its credibility, and create a safe haven,\" Biden said, using a different acronym for the group. \"We will not let that happen.\u201d",
      "The Syrian opposition that brought down Assad is led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which the U.S. says is a terrorist organization with links to al-Qaida, although the group says it has since broken ties with al-Qaida.",
      "\u201cWe will remain vigilant,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMake no mistake, some of the rebel groups that took down Assad have their own grim record of terrorism and human rights abuses.\u201d He added that the groups are \u201csaying the right things now.\u201d",

The official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the situation and spoke on condition of anonymity, also said the U.S. has focused over the past several days on chemical weapons that had been controlled by the Assad government, aiming to ensure they were secured.",
      "Still, Assad's fall adds to an already tense situation throughout much of region on many fronts \u2014 including Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza and its fragile ceasefire with Hezbollah in Lebanon.",
      "Like Biden, Trump, who takes office in five-plus weeks, made a connection between the upheaval in Syria and Russia's war in Ukraine, noting that Assad's allies in Moscow, as well as in Iran, the main sponsor of Hamas and Hezbollah, \u201care in a weakened state right now.\u201d",
      "Vice President-elect JD Vance, a veteran of the U.S.-led war in Iraq, wrote on social media Sunday to express skepticism about the insurgents.",
      "\u201cMany of \u2018the rebels\u2019 are a literal offshoot of ISIS. One can hope they\u2019ve moderated. Time will tell,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump has suggested that Assad's ouster can advance the prospects for an end to fighting in Ukraine, which was invaded by Russia in February 2022.",
      "The president-elect wrote that Putin's government \u201clost all interest in Syria because of Ukraine\u201d and Trump called for an immediate ceasefire, a day after meeting in Paris with the French and Ukrainian leaders.",
      "Daniel B. Shapiro, a deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East, said the American military presence will continue in eastern Syria but was \u201csolely to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS and has nothing to do with other aspects of this conflict.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe call on all parties in Syria to protect civilians, particularly those from Syria\u2019s minority communities to respect international military norms and to work to achieve a resolution to include the political settlement,\u201d Shapiro said.",
      "\u201cMultiple actors in this conflict have a terrible track record, to include Assad\u2019s horrific crimes, Russia\u2019s indiscriminate aerial bomb bombardment, Iranian-back militia involvement and the atrocities of ISIS,\" he added.",
      "Shapiro also said \u201cno one should shed any tears over the Assad regime.\u201d",
      "As they pushed toward the Syrian capital of Damascus, the opposition forces freed political detainees from government prisons. The family of missing U.S. journalist Austin Tice renewed calls to find him.",
      "\u201cTo everyone in Syria that hears this, please remind people that we\u2019re waiting for Austin,\u201d Tice\u2019s mother, Debra, said in comments that hostage advocacy groups spread on social media. \"We know that when he comes out, he\u2019s going to be fairly dazed & he\u2019s going to need lots of care & direction. Direct him to his family please!\u201d",
      "Tice disappeared in 2012 outside Damascus as the civil war was intensifying.",
      "\"We\u2019ve remained committed to returning him to his family,\u201d Biden said at the White House. \"We believe he\u2019s alive, we think we can get him back but we have no direct evidence to that yet. And Assad should be held accountable.\u201d",
      "The president added: \u201cWe have to identify where he is.\"",
      "The U.S. has no new evidence that Tice is alive but continues to operate under the assumption that he is, according to a U.S. official. The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly, added that the U.S. will continue to work to identify Tice's whereabouts and to try to bring him home .",

    "summary": "Donald Trump says he can&rsquo;t guarantee his promised tariffs on key U.S. foreign trade partners won&rsquo;t raise prices for American consumers",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump says he can\u2019t guarantee his promised tariffs on key U.S. foreign trade partners won\u2019t raise prices for American consumers",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump said he can't guarantee that his promised tariffs on key U.S. foreign trade partners won't raise prices for American consumers and he suggested once more that some political rivals and federal officials who pursued legal cases against him should be imprisoned.",
      "The president-elect, in a wide-ranging interview with NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that aired Sunday, also touched on monetary policy, immigration, abortion and health care, and U.S. involvement in Ukraine, Israel and elsewhere.",
      "Trump often mixed declarative statements with caveats, at one point cautioning \u201cthings do change.\u201d",
      "A look at some of the issues covered:",
      "Trump has threatened broad trade penalties, but said he didn\u2019t believe economists' predictions that added costs on those imported goods for American companies would lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers. He stopped short of a pledge that U.S. households won't be paying more as they shop.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t guarantee anything. I can\u2019t guarantee tomorrow,\u201d Trump said, seeming to open the door to accepting the reality of how import levies typically work as goods reach the retail market.",
      "That's a different approach from Trump's typical speeches throughout the 2024 campaign, when he framed his election as a sure way to curb inflation.",
      "In the interview, Trump defended tariffs generally, saying they are \"going to make us rich.\u201d",
      "He has pledged that, on his first day in office in January, he would impose 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico and Canada unless those countries satisfactorily stop illegal immigration and the flow of illegal drugs such as fentanyl into the United States. He also has threatened additional tariffs on China to help force that country to crack down on fentanyl production.",
      "\u201dAll I want to do is I want to have a level, fast, but fair playing field,\u201d Trump said.",
      "He offered conflicting statements on how he would approach the justice system after winning election despite being convicted of 34 felonies in a New York state court and being indicted in other cases for his handling of national security secrets and efforts to overturn his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cHonestly, they should go to jail,\u201d Trump said of members of Congress who investigated the Capitol riot by his supporters who wanted him to remain in power.",
      "The president-elect underscored his contention that he can use the justice system against others, including special prosecutor Jack Smith, who led the case on Trump\u2019s role in the siege on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump confirmed his plan to pardon supporters who were convicted for their roles in the riot, saying he would take that action on his first day in office.",
      "As for the idea of revenge driving potential prosecutions, Trump said: \u201cI have the absolute right. I\u2019m the chief law enforcement officer, you do know that. I\u2019m the president. But I\u2019m not interested in that.\"",
      "At the same time, Trump singled out lawmakers on a special House committee who had investigated the insurrection, citing Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., and former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo.",
      "\u201cCheney was behind it ... so was Bennie Thompson and everybody on that committee,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Asked specifically whether he would direct his administration to pursue cases, he said, \u201cNo,\u201d and suggested he did not expect the FBI to quickly undertake investigations into his political enemies.",
      "But at another point, Trump said he would leave the matter up to Pam Bondi, his pick as attorney general. \u201cI want her to do what she wants to do,\u201d he said.",
      "Such threats, regardless of Trump's inconsistencies, have been taken seriously enough by many top Democrats that Biden is considering issuing blanket, preemptive pardons to protect key members of his outgoing administration.",
      "Trump did seemingly back off his campaign rhetoric calling for Biden to be investigated, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not looking to go back into the past.\u201d",
      "Trump repeatedly mentioned his promises to seal the U.S.-Mexico border and deport millions of people who are in the U.S. illegally through a mass deportation program.",
      "\u201cI think you have to do it,\u201d he said.",
      "He suggested he would try to use executive action to end \u201cbirthright\u201d citizenship under which people born in the U.S. are considered citizens \u2014 although such protections are spelled out in the Constitution.",
      "Asked specifically about the future for people who were brought into the country illegally as children and have been shielded from deportation in recent years, Trump said, \u201cI want to work something out,\u201d indicating he might seek a solution with Congress.",
      "But Trump also said he does not \u201cwant to be breaking up families\u201d of mixed legal status, \u201cso the only way you don\u2019t break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back.\u201d",
      "Long a critic of NATO members for not spending more on their own defense, Trump said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d would remain in the alliance \u201cif they pay their bills.\u201d",
      "Pressed on whether he would withdraw if he were dissatisfied with allies\u2019 commitments, Trump said he wants the U.S. treated \u201cfairly\u201d on trade and defense.",
      "He waffled on a NATO priority of containing Russia and President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Trump suggested Ukraine should prepare for less U.S. aid in its defense against Putin\u2019s invasion. \u201cPossibly. Yeah, probably. Sure,\u201d Trump said of reducing Ukraine assistance from Washington. Separately, Trump has called for an immediate ceasefire.",
      "Asked about Putin, Trump said initially that he has not talked to the Russian leader since Election Day last month, but then hedged: \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to him recently.\u201d Trump said when pressed, adding that he did not want to \u201cimpede the negotiation.\u201d",
      "The president-elect said he has no intention, at least for now, of asking Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to step down before Powell's term ends in 2028. Trump said during the campaign that presidents should have more say in Fed policy, including interest rates.",
      "Trump did not offer any job assurances for FBI Director Christopher Wray, whose term is to end in 2027.",
      "Asked about Wray, Trump said: \u201cWell, I mean, it would sort of seem pretty obvious\u201d that if the Senate confirms Kash Patel as his pick for FBI chief, then \u201che\u2019s going to be taking somebody\u2019s place, right? Somebody is the man that you\u2019re talking about.\u201d",
      "Trump promised that the government efficiency effort led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will not threaten Social Security. \u201cWe're not touching Social Security, other than we make it more efficient,\u201d he said. He added that \u201cwe're not raising ages or any of that stuff.\u201d",
      "He was not so specific about abortion or his long-promised overhaul of the Affordable Care Act.",
      "On abortion, Trump continued his inconsistencies and said he would \u201cprobably\u201d not move to restrict access to the abortion pills that now account for a majority of pregnancy terminations, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. But pressed on whether he would commit to that position, Trump replied, \u201cWell, I commit. I mean, are -- things do -- things change. I think they change.\u201d",
      "Reprising a line from his Sept. 10 debate against Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump again said he had \u201cconcepts\u201d of a plan to substitute for the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which he called \u201clousy health care.\u201d",
      "He added a promise that any Trump version would maintain insurance protections for Americans with preexisting health conditions. He did not explain how such a design would be different from the status quo or how he could deliver on his desire for \u201cbetter health care for less money.\u201d",

      "Police don\u2019t know who he is, where he is, or why he did it",
      "NEW YORK -- Police don't know who he is, where he is, or why he did it.",
      "As the frustrating search for UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson\u2019s killer got underway for a fifth day Sunday, investigators reckoned with a tantalizing contradiction: They have troves of evidence, but the shooter remains an enigma.",
      "One conclusion they are confident of, however: It was a targeted attack, not a random one.",
      "They know he ambushed Thompson at 6:44 a.m. Wednesday as the executive arrived at the Hilton for his company\u2019s annual investor conference, using a 9 mm pistol that resembled the guns farmers use to put down animals without causing a loud noise. They know ammunition found near Thompson\u2019s body bore the words \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose,\u201d mimicking a phrase used by insurance industry critics.",
      "The fact that the shooter knew UnitedHealthcare group was holding a conference at the hotel and what route Thompson might take to get there suggested that he could possibly be a disgruntled employee or client, NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said.",
      "Over the weekend, police divers were seen searching a pond in Central Park, where the killer fled after the shooting. Officers have been scouring the park for days for any possible clues and found his backpack there Friday. They didn\u2019t immediately reveal what, if anything, it contained but said it would be tested and analyzed.",
      "Early Sunday afternoon, police declined to comment on the contents of the backpack, or on the results of the search in the pond, saying no updates were planned.",
      "The bag\u2019s apparent manufacturer did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press.",
      "Investigators have urged patience, saying the process of logging evidence that stands up in court isn\u2019t as quick as it looks like on TV.",
      "Hundreds of detectives are combing through video recordings and social media, vetting tips from the public and interviewing people who might have information, including Thompson\u2019s family and coworkers and the shooter\u2019s randomly assigned roommates at the Manhattan hostel where he stayed.",
      "Investigators caught a break when they came across security camera images of an unguarded moment at the hostel in which he briefly showed his face.",
      "Retracing the gunman\u2019s steps using surveillance video, police say, it appears he left the city by bus soon after the shooting outside the New York Hilton Midtown. He was seen on video at an uptown bus station about 45 minutes later, Kenny said.",
      "With the high-profile search expanding across state lines, the FBI announced late Friday that it was offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction, adding to a reward of up to $10,000 that the NYPD has offered. Police say they believe the suspect acted alone.",
      "Police distributed the images to news outlets and on social media but so far haven\u2019t been able to ID him using facial recognition \u2014 possibly because of the angle of the images or limitations on how the NYPD is allowed to use that technology, Kenny said.",
      "Late Saturday, police released two additional photos of the suspected shooter that appeared to be from a camera mounted inside a taxi. The first shows him outside the vehicle and the second shows him looking through the partition between the back seat and the front of the cab. In both, his face is partially obscured by a blue, medical-style mask."

    "summary": "It was 1906 when U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt designated the first national monument &mdash; Devils Tower in Wyoming",
    "story": [
      "It was 1906 when U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt designated the first national monument \u2014 Devils Tower in Wyoming",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt did in 1906 what Congress was unwilling to do through legislation: He used his new authority under the Antiquities Act to designate Devils Tower in Wyoming as the first national monument.",
      "Then came Antiquities Act protections for the Petrified Forest in Arizona, Chaco Canyon and the Gila Cliff Dwellings in New Mexico, the Grand Canyon, Death Valley in California, and what are now Zion and Bryce Canyon national parks in Utah.",
      "The list goes on, as all but three presidents have used the act to protect unique landscapes and cultural resources.",
      "President Joe Biden has created six monuments and either restored, enlarged or modified boundaries for a handful of others. Native American tribes and conservation groups are pressing for more designations before he leaves office.",
      "The proposals range from an area dotted with palm trees and petroglyphs in Southern California to a site sacred to Native Americans in Nevada's high desert, a historic Black neighborhood in Oklahoma and a homestead in Maine that belonged to the family of Frances Perkins, the nation\u2019s first female cabinet member.",
      "Roosevelt signed the Antiquities Act after a generation of lobbying by educators and scientists who wanted to protect sites from commercial artifact looting and haphazard collecting by individuals. It was the first law in the U.S. to establish legal protections for cultural and natural resources of historic or scientific interest on federal lands.",
      "For Roosevelt and others, science was behind safeguarding Devils Tower. Scientists have long theorized about how once-molten lava cooled and formed the massive columns that make up the geologic wonder. Narratives among Native American tribes, who still conduct ceremonies there, detail its formation.",
      "Biden cited the spiritual, cultural and prehistoric legacy of the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante areas in southern Utah when he restored their boundaries and protections through his first use of the Antiquities Act in 2021.",
      "The two monuments were among 29 that President Barack Obama created while in office. Amid concerns that Obama overstepped his authority and limited energy development, President Donald Trump rolled back their size, while adding a previously unprotected portion to Bears Ears.",
      "Biden called Bears Ears \u2014 the first national monument to be established at the request of federally recognized tribes \u2014 a \u201cplace of healing.\u201d",
      "Early designations often pushed tribes from their ancestral homelands.",
      "In one of his final acts as president in 1933, Herbert Hoover used the Antiquities Act to set aside Death Valley as a national monument. It's now one of the largest national parks \u2014 not to mention the hottest, driest and lowest.",
      "While establishing the monument brought an end to prospecting and the filing of new mining claims in the area, it also meant the Timbisha Shoshone were forced from the last bit of their traditional territory. It took several decades for the tribe to regain a fraction of the land.",
      "Biden's administration has made strides in working with some tribes on managing public lands and incorporating more Indigenous knowledge into planning and policymaking.",
      "Avi Kwa Ame National Monument was Biden's second designation. The site outside of Las Vegas is central to the creation stories of tribes with ties to the area.",
      "Republican Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo said at the time that the White House didn't consult his administration before making the designation in 2023 \u2014 and in effect blocked clean energy projects and other development in the state.",
      "Similar opposition bubbled up when Biden designated Baaj Nwaavjo I\u2019tah Kukveni National Monument in Arizona just months later. This time it wasn't the prospect of clean energy projects sprouting up across the desert, but rather uranium mining near the Grand Canyon that had tribes and environmentalists pushing for protections.",
      "Biden certainly didn't break any records with the number of monuments he designated or the amount of land set aside. But conservationists say more strategic use of the authority under the Antiquities Act will be valuable going forward as developers look to build more solar and wind farms and mine for lithium and other minerals required for a green energy transition.",
      "They are pushing for Biden in his final weeks to expand California's Joshua Tree National Park and establish a new monument that would stretch from the Joshua Tree border to the Colorado River where it divides California and Arizona. The proposed Chuckwalla National Monument has the support of several tribes.",
      "Such a designation would add a significant piece to one of the largest contiguous protected corridors in the U.S. \u2014 spanning thousands of square miles along the Colorado River from Canyonlands in Utah, through the monuments already designated by Obama and Biden to the desert oases of Southern California.",
      "\u201cThe concern out there is that so much land is getting used for renewable energy and it just kills the desert completely. And so if we\u2019re not more proactive about protecting these places in the desert, we could lose them forever,\u201d said Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of government affairs for the National Parks Conservation Association.",
      "Biden's designations have gone beyond the canyons and mesas of the West.",
      "In May, he designated a national monument at the site of the 1908 race riot in Springfield, Illinois. That designation came as he tried to retain relevance in his final months in office and boost Vice President Kamala Harris's presidential campaign while Trump cut into Democrats' historic edge with Black voters.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Celebrities, cultural icons and a few surprise guests are gathering for the annual Kennedy Center Honors celebration Sunday evening in Washington.",
      "This year's recipients of the lifetime achievement award for artistic accomplishment are director Francis Ford Coppola,the Grateful Dead, jazz trumpeter Arturo Sandoval, and singer-songwriter Bonnie Raitt. In addition, the venerable Harlem theater The Apollo, which has launched generations of Black artists, is being recognized.",
      "There will be personalized tributes with performances and testimonials from fellow artists during the gala at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Medallions were presented during the traditional Saturday night ceremony at the State Department.",
      "The tribute performances are often kept secret from the recipients themselves, most notably in 2018 when Cyndi Lauper flat out lied to her longtime friend Cher about being unable to attend. Lauper appeared on stage to perform Cher's hit, \u201cIf I Could Turn Back Time.\u201d",
      "Several of the latest honorees have themselves participated in past tributes to friends and colleagues at the Kennedy Center.",
      "Coppola spoke during fellow director Martin Scorsese\u2019s induction in 2007. Sandoval performed in the tribute to his mentor, jazz trumpet legend Dizzy Gillespie. Raitt has taken part in tributes to Buddy Guy and Mavis Staples. Raitt even attended the Kennedy Center Honors in the 1970s when her father, Broadway performer John Raitt, was taking part in a tribute to composer Richard Rogers.",
      "The tribute to the Grateful Dead is expected to double as a memorial to the band's founding bass player Phil Lesh, who died in October at age 84.",
      "This could also be the last Kennedy Center Honors ceremony without political intrigue for a while.",
      "During Republican Donald Trump's first four years in office, Kennedy Center officials were forced to walk a public tightrope between the tradition of the president attending the ceremony and the open antipathy toward Trump from multiple honorees. In 2017, recipient Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Trump attended. Trump, who takes office in January, skipped the ceremony for the entirety of his first term.",
      "At a ceremony at the White House before attending the awards event itself, President Joe Biden praised each honoree. He also had an audience member, actor Robert De Niro, stand before declaring, \u201cIf I get in trouble, I\u2019m coming to you pal.\u201d",
      "De Niro grinned and nodded and others in attendance, including the honorees, laughed at what appeared to be a reference to De Niro sometimes playing hardnosed enforcers in movies like \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d But Biden actually meant he might seek the actor\u2019s help for post-presidency career advice.",
      "\u201cThings are not looking good for February,\u201d Biden joked. Then he conceded that he couldn\u2019t sing or dance but suggested he might still find a way to help De Niro\u2019s production company.",

    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is jubilant about President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- Shortly after Donald Trump\u2019s win in last month\u2019s U.S. election, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rushed to congratulate the president-elect: \u201cHistory\u2019s greatest comeback!\u201d he gushed.",
      "If Trump\u2019s staunchly pro-Israel first term and his nominations for top administration positions are any indication, Netanyahu\u2019s glee is justified.",
      "But much has transpired since Trump left office in early 2021. The wars in the Middle East, the lofty ambitions of Netanyahu\u2019s far-right governing coalition and Netanyahu\u2019s personal relationship with him could dampen that enthusiasm and complicate what on the surface looks like a seamless alliance.",
      "\u201cFor Bibi, this is his dream. He wanted this,\u201d said Mazal Mualem, an Israeli journalist and Netanyahu biographer, referring to the Israeli leader by his nickname. \u201cFor Bibi, it\u2019s too good to be true.\u201d",
      "With Netanyahu set to testify in his corruption trial and facing an international arrest warrant over the war in Gaza, Trump's backing will be all the more significant.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, he adopted policies largely favorable to Netanyahu. Trump broke with longstanding U.S. policy to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, moving the U.S. Embassy to the contested city over Palestinian objections.",
      "He recognized Israel\u2019s claim to the Golan Heights, which the international community considers occupied Syrian territory. He also turned a blind eye to Israeli settlement construction in the occupied West Bank and presented a peace plan that would leave dozens of settlements intact.",
      "The Palestinians seek all of the West Bank, captured in 1967, as the heartland of a future state, with east Jerusalem as its capital. The international community considers settlements in both areas illegal.",
      "At Netanyahu\u2019s urging, Trump withdrew the U.S. from an Obama-era deal between world powers and Iran over its nuclear program and ramped up sanctions against Iran, while also killing a top Iranian general.",
      "And in the final days of his presidency, Trump brokered a series of diplomatic deals between Israel and Arab countries, shattering a longstanding assumption that Arab countries would not normalize ties without progress on Palestinian statehood. The accords marked a major foreign policy achievement for Netanyahu.",
      "Likely to top Netanyahu\u2019s wish list this time around is for Trump to be tough against Iran or perhaps even provide Israel with the weaponry it needs for an effective strike against Iran's nuclear program. Netanyahu will also want to see progress on normalization with Saudi Arabia, but he will seek to minimize Israeli concessions to the Palestinians in return. And he will likely expect Trump to give Israel a free hand in Gaza and not pressure it to withdraw troops, even under a ceasefire deal.",
      "In the weeks since Trump\u2019s reelection, Netanyahu and his allies have expressed hope that the good times will return after strained relations with the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cThe belief for now is that Trump will deliver,\u201d said Aviv Bushinsky, a former adviser to Netanyahu. He said Netanyahu\u2019s appointment of a hard-line settlement advocate as ambassador to Washington was a sign of the Israeli leader\u2019s confidence in the future under Trump.",
      "Netanyahu could certainly use the boost, especially after seeing his popularity drop after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks.",
      "Despite important battlefield gains against Hamas, including the death of its leader in October, and the recent ceasefire that ended nearly 14 months of fighting with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, opinion polls have repeatedly predicted that Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition would fall far short of a required majority to stay in power if new elections were held now.",
      "Netanyahu is also scheduled to testify in his long-running corruption trial this month, setting the stage for a spectacle that could draw unwelcome attention. And the International Criminal Court warrant, which could complicate his travel to dozens of countries worldwide, is a new blow to the Israeli leader. Some of Netanyahu's aides are also embroiled in a series of scandals over leaked or doctored sensitive wartime documents.",
      "But there are no guarantees that Netanyahu will get what he wants from Trump.",
      "For starters, its not clear whether their relationship is as strong as it once was. Netanyahu upset Trump when he congratulated President Joe Biden for his win in 2020, despite Trump\u2019s claims that the election was stolen from him. Although Netanyahu visited Trump in Florida earlier this year, it\u2019s not clear if Trump will hold a grudge once back in office.",
      "Trump also returns to the White House with a Middle East roiled by conflict, potentially scrambling their alignment.",
      "Although the ceasefire with Hezbollah appears to be holding, Israel is still fighting in Gaza 14 months after the Hamas attack that triggered the war. Trump has indicated he wants Israel to wrap things up in the war-ravaged Palestinian enclave, but he hasn't said what that might entail. He has demanded that Israeli hostages held in Gaza be freed before he is sworn in in January, warning that if they are not released, there will be \u201cHELL TO PAY,\u201d without elaborating.",
      "It is far from clear whether Netanyahu\u2019s postwar vision of Gaza \u2014 which includes an open-ended military presence in the territory \u2013 is acceptable to Trump.",
      "Trump also may have bigger plans for the region. He has talked in the past of normalizing ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia, the wealthiest and most influential Arab country. His first-term peace plan, while heavily favoring Israel, nonetheless called for the establishment of a Palestinian state, albeit far smaller than what the Palestinians seek.",
      "Progress on either of these tracks would require Israel to make concessions to the Palestinians.",
      "Saudi Arabia has repeatedly said there will be no normalization with Israel without a clear path to Palestinian independence \u2014 an idea that Netanyahu and his hard-line governing partners reject. Even if Netanyahu comes around, his government would almost certainly collapse.",
      "\u201cNetanyahu is convinced that he will be able to recruit Trump to his goals, as happened in the past. However, the American president-elect has been sending, as usual, difficult-to-decipher messages since the victory on Nov. 5,\u201d wrote Amos Harel, a commentator with the liberal Haaretz daily.",
      "Trump\u2019s strategy on Iran is also murky. Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel relations at Israel\u2019s Bar-Ilan University, said Netanyahu expects Trump to resume exerting \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Tehran to rein in its nuclear program, but he might give negotiations a chance in a second term bid to secure a legacy as a peacemaker.",
      "Trump\u2019s possible positions on any of these issues could force Netanyahu to choose sides, setting him up for a clash with the parties that hold the key to his political survival.",
      "\u201cNetanyahu has described Trump as Israel\u2019s greatest friend in the White House. And if Trump asks something of him, he won\u2019t be able to say no,\u201d Gilboa said. \u201cAll sorts of problems can arise here.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Housing Secretary Angela Rayner has said overhauling planning rules to bypass local authorities will remove \"chaos and subjectiveness\" from the system.",
      "The planned changes will give local authority planning officers the power to rubberstamp development proposals without permission from council committees, as long as they comply with locally agreed plans and national regulations on standards.",
      "House builders have broadly welcomed the streamlining but the Conservatives have accused Labour of \"ignoring\" communities.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Rayner told councils to \"get your plans in order\" as the government targets its manifesto pledge to build 1.5 million new homes.",
      "The deputy prime minister said the government will require all councils to formalise developments' plans, the absence of which has caused developments to \"get stuck in the system\".",
      "Rayner continued: \"Because we haven't had these compulsory plans locally, we've seen speculative development where greenbelt land has been developed on... we've told councils they've got to have those plans.",
      "\"If developers follow the national framework, which protects the environment and looks at other elements, then they shouldn't be stuck in the system for years.\"",
      "She pushed back on the suggestion the government is riding roughshod over councils, saying the changes were necessary to bring about what would be the biggest increase in house building since the 1950s.",
      "\"It's going to take a lot of change to deliver that,\" Rayner added.",
      "Tory shadow Treasury minister Richard Fuller said the government's building target is \"reasonable\", but added: \"If you want to achieve that, you've got to bring the people with you, and, unfortunately, Labour seem to be saying that Angela [Rayner] is best and local people can be ignored.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer restated his pledge to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029 despite accepting it could be \"a little too ambitious\".",

      "Amber's director Jeremy Abbott told the BBC the club made the decision because \"we really want the music and the experience to be front and centre\", but the issue is being debated on social media.",
      "Some posted on Instagram concerns that clubs could suffer as social media videos of their night act as free adverts, while others welcomed the move as \"partying with privacy\".",

      "Another woman said: \u201cIt does make the vibe better, because the less people [are] on their phone, engaging more with the DJ and stuff, that\u2019s the better environment to have.\"",

      "So are Britain's clubs at a turning point? Is now the time to get phones off the dancefloor and people's minds back on the music?",
      "Sacha Lord, night time economy adviser for Greater Manchester, thinks so. \"These phones are killing the dancefloor, they\u2019re killing the atmosphere,\u201d he says.",

      "But Dr Lee Hadlington, senior lecturer in cyberpsychology at Nottingham Trent University, says for those clubbers, \"part of their enjoyment is to document their night in terms of photos and memories\".",
      "At Amber's, phones are not banned outright but clubbers will be required to put a sticker over the camera lens to prevent photos being taken. A content team will be on hand to take and post photos online instead.",
      "People violating the rule will be \"politely asked to stop\", says Abbott. \"If you are seen doing it again, you will be asked to leave the venue.\"",
      "The rule comes at a tricky time for Britain's nightclub scene, which has struggled to recover from the numerous Covid lockdowns.",
      "Between June 2020 and June this year, the number of clubs has fallen from 1,266 to 786, according to figures from the Night Time Industries Association and research firm NeilsenIQ.",
      "Abbott concedes Amber's no phones rules is a risk but says the club has been \"blown away\" by the response.",

      "Cyberpsychologist Dr Hadlington says for these clubbers, it could be about a fear of missing out on social media action.",
      "\"The paradox is they\u2019re spending more time posting about it than they're enjoying the good time,\" he says.",
      "It might be a relatively new concept in the UK, but in Berlin, 90% of venues have a no-phones-on-the-dancefloor code, according to Lutz Leichsenring, former spokesperson for Clubcommission Berlin and co-founder of VibeLab.",
      "He says that with more tourists coming to the German capital to enjoy the scene, \"I think people really appreciated that this policy was a part of clubbing\".",
      "And, on a personal note, he says that for him, \"it is very, very weird when I\u2019m in a club where people around me take pictures and film the whole time\".",
      "Amber's is adopting the same policy that London nightclub fabric has had in place since reopening in 2021 after Covid. The venue has actually been camera-free since it opened its doors in 1999 but as technology changed and smartphones became more ubiquitous it has tweaked its policy.",

      "He says for the most part clubbers abide by the rule. \"It\u2019s not an aggressive enforcement,\" he says. \"We have posters up in the club and then beyond that if people do use it and our team do see them we invite them not to.\"",

      "But how this run-of-the-mill vehicle was sold is now at the heart of a far more remarkable, multi-billion pound saga.",
      "Lenders and dealers have been accused of hiding commission payments made when cars were bought on finance deals.",
      "A recent Court of Appeal ruling in the case of Mr Johnson, and two other car buyers, raised the possibility of millions of motorists receiving compensation.",
      "Not everyone agrees with that conclusion.",
      "As MPs prepare to quiz the boss of the financial regulator over its role, there seems to be an industry consensus that only the highest court in the land should settle this affair.",
      "That, were it to happen, could put payouts in greater doubt, or at least delay them for many months.",
      "Mr Johnson from Cwmbran, Torfaen in south Wales was aged 27 when he was on the lookout for his first car in 2017.",
      "He had been cycling to and from his job as a factory supervisor. He and his fiancee, now wife, Kirsty, were taking buses and taxis to visit family and friends after they had moved home.",
      "Buying a car made sense. So too did going to a dealership whose advert he \"heard 10 to 15 times every day\" on the radio at work.",
      "He took the Suzuki for a test drive, decided to buy it and paid a deposit.",
      "\"I thought it was a financially sound decision to get a newer car, so it would have fewer problems,\" he says.",
      "'Ridiculous' commission",
      "Mr Johnson earned just over \u00a313,000 a year, so finance involved a hire-purchase agreement and an extra personal loan.",

      "\"I had always thought that car dealerships made their money by making a profit on the cars that they sell rather than by arranging finance,\" he said in his witness statement.",

      "\"I had no idea before then. Commission as part of the industry is not necessarily a bad thing,\" he says. \"But it was kept out of sight. If they are deceiving customers then, to me, that's disgusting.\"",
      "His case went to court. He says he almost missed the date after the notification went into his email junk folder. He lost.",

      "Motorists who bought cars on finance could share in billions",
      "The other two car buyers involved were Andrew Wrench, described as \"a postman with a penchant for fast cars\", and student nurse Amy Hopcraft.",
      "Mr Wrench has since spoken about how shocked he was at the impact of the ruling, but it was the principle of fairness that fired him up.",
      "The same is true of a surprised Mr Johnson, who never thought his case would even get to court. But he says he is someone who doesn't like to think of people losing out.",
      "\"And lots of people who did not have the money to buy a car were ripped off,\" he says.",
      "Wider impact",

      "In the conclusions of a clear, 46-page judgement are three even clearer words: \"fully informed consent\".",
      "They ruled it would be illegal for the lender to pay any commission to the dealer without the fully informed consent of the buyer.",
      "In other words, customers should be told clearly how much commission would be paid, and agree to it, without those details being buried in the terms and conditions of the loan.",
      "Bearing in mind that something like 80% or 90% of cars are bought on finance - that is about two million vehicles a year, then the potential for many deals past and present failing that test is high.",

      "'Justice delayed'",
      "Kevin Durkin from HD Law, who represents Mr Johnson, says the Court of Appeal decision was clear, and redress payments should start to be made where necessary.",
      "Failing to do so means \"justice delayed is justice denied\", he says.",

      "The defendants in the case involving Mr Johnson, Mr Wrench and Ms Hopcraft have requested the Supreme Court take a look at it.",
      "Banks have seen success before at the Supreme Court regarding mass compensation claims. In 2009, it found in their favour over the issue of bank overdraft charges.",
      "However, banks did have to pay out billions of pounds over the PPI (payment protection insurance) scandal.",
      "The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, has written to the Supreme Court requesting a speedy decision on motor finance, given the potential impact on the market and consumers.",
      "In the meantime, it will face questions - starting when leading figures, including chief executive Nikhil Rathi, appear before the Treasury Committee on Tuesday.",
      "Did the FCA go far enough?",
      "In 2021, the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender, based on the interest rate charged to the customer. It said this provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a rate that was higher than necessary.",
      "By banning these so-called discretionary commission arrangements, it declared it would save drivers \u00a3165m a year.",
      "Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.",
      "However, it didn't decide to ban commissions or fees on a wider scale, or stipulate how dealers should disclose they were receiving payments from lenders.",
      "It may now face the ire of motorists who say it should have done more to protect them, as well as lenders and dealers who feel the regulator gave them the green light to carry on paying commission in the same way.",
      "It is planning to extend the time dealers have to deal with complaints.",
      "It wants any mass compensation, should that come to pass, to be administered in an orderly fashion. The nature of any such redress is currently uncertain.",
      "So, for now, disgruntled drivers who believe they may have a claim are stuck at a red with no clear idea when the lights will change."

      "\"Latest figures continue to show improving levels of demand for mortgages, as an easing in mortgage rates boost buyer confidence,\" said Amanda Bryden, head of mortgages at Halifax.",
      "She said that stronger employment, as well as falling interest rates, would be expected to bring further house price rises for the rest of this year and into next year.",

      "London remains the most expensive place in the UK to buy a house, with the average property there costing \u00a3545,439, according to the Halifax.",
      "Northern Ireland continues to record the strongest house price growth in the UK, with an average price of \u00a3203,131.",
      "In England, the North West region continued to see the strongest growth, increasing by 5.9% compared to last year. An average property there now costs \u00a3237,045.",
      "House prices were up 5.5% on last year in the West Midlands, with an average home costing \u00a3257,982.",
      "Halifax said Scotland saw a modest rise in house prices with the average property now costing \u00a3208,957, which is 2.8% more than the year before.",
      "Halifax's house price data is based on its own mortgage lending, which does not include buyers who purchase homes with cash, or buy-to-let deals. Cash buyers account for about a third of housing sales."

      "\"I feel like I've been conned by the government,\" she said, adding that she did not believe spray foam insulation should be available for sale until there is a better understanding of the product.",
      "'Un-mortgageable'",
      "While the Green Homes Grant scheme closed in 2021, spray foam insulation is still available under the Great British Insulation Scheme as the government seeks to improve the energy efficiency of homes and drives towards its 2030 \"net zero\" target.",

      "UnitedHealthcare boss Brian Thompson, 50, was fatally shot in the back on Wednesday morning outside the Hilton hotel in Midtown Manhattan.",
      "Police say Thompson was targeted in a pre-planned killing, for which they do not yet have a motive.",
      "Investigators are using surveillance photos, bullet casings with cryptic messages written on them, and the suspect's movements to track him down. They are also working with the FBI and authorities in other states as the search expands beyond New York.",
      "Here's what we know about the suspect and the investigation.",
      "What lines are police chasing?",
      "Police are working with \"a lot of leads\", said former FBI special agent Michael Tabman. On Friday, the FBI offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction.",
      "Police have put together more than 200 images of the suspect from his arrival in New York until he fled Midtown Manhattan after shooting Thompson, according to the BBC's US partner CBS News.",
      "On Thursday they shared two images - the clearest ones so far - of the suspect, one which shows him smiling with his black face mask pulled down.",
      "A hostel receptionist reportedly told police that the photo was taken when she asked him to show his face, in a flirtatious moment.",
      "The man was staying at the hostel on the Upper West Side in New York, where he reportedly used a fake New Jersey license as identification. Police say they have executed a search warrant at the hostel.",
      "Authorities have also been doing a \"full sweep\" of Central Park - a 2.5 mile (4km) long and 0.5 miles (0.8km) wide area in the heart of the city - and on Friday found a backpack they believe the suspect was carrying at the time of the attack. It has been sent for forensic testing, CBS reports.",
      "Officials are also attempting to make use of DNA evidence, including a water bottle and candy wrapper from the crime scene, as well as a Starbucks coffee cup, that they believe are linked to the suspect.",
      "A mobile phone was also discovered in an alley along the suspect's escape route.",
      "So far, fingerprints found left behind have been unusable for identification, police said.",

      "Authorities have been able to put together an incomplete timeline of his movements in the city, from his arrival on 24 November to when he fled after the attack on 4 December.",
      "New York Police Department (NYPD) Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said on Friday that the suspect arrived in the city on a bus that originated from Atlanta, though it's unclear where he caught the bus along its route.",
      "He then took a cab to the vicinity of the Hilton, the hotel where he would later kill Thompson, and spent about 30 minutes there before heading to the hostel.",
      "At the hostel he had two roommates but neither saw his face as he wore his mask while he was around them, Mr Kenny said.",
      "The suspect left the hostel early on Wednesday, returned to the vicinity of the Hilton and stopped at a Starbucks.",
      "Thompson was shot at around 06:45 EST (11:45 GMT).",
      "At 06:48, the suspect entered Central Park. Shortly before 07:00 he left the park and at 07:04 took a cab to the Port Authority bus terminal.",
      "How did the shooting and escape happen?",
      "The shooting took place in a busy part of Manhattan close to Times Square and Central Park. Thompson had been scheduled to speak at an investor conference later in the day.",
      "According to police, the suspect - who was clad in his mask and light brown or cream-coloured jacket - appeared to be waiting for Thompson for five minutes outside the Hilton hotel where he was expected to speak.",
      "Thompson, who arrived on foot, was shot in the back and leg, and was pronounced dead about half an hour later at a local hospital.",
      "The NYPD said that the suspect's weapon appeared to jam, but that he was able to quickly fix it and keep shooting.",
      "CCTV footage appears to show the gunman had fitted a suppressor, also known as a silencer, to the weapon.",
      "Investigators reportedly believe the firearm is a BT Station Six 9, a weapon which is marketed as tracing its roots back to pistols used in World War Two.",
      "Police have reportedly visited gun stores in Connecticut to try to determine where the weapon was purchased.",
      "After the shooting, video shows the suspect fleeing the scene on foot. Officials say he later got on an e-bike, which he rode toward Central Park.",
      "Police believe he left New York, possibly on a bus headed for Atlanta, Georgia, sources familiar with the matter have told CBS News.",
      "Atlanta police released a statement on Friday confirming they are helping New York authorities in the investigation.",
      "Three words written on bullet casings",
      "Investigators have so far not identified a motive in the killing, but they are focusing in part on words written in Sharpie on bullet casings discovered at the scene of the crime.",
      "The words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were discovered on the casings.",
      "Investigators believe this could be a reference to the \"three D's of insurance\" - a known reference made by opponents of the industry.",
      "The terms refer to tactics used by insurance companies to refuse payment claims by patients in America's complicated and mostly privately run healthcare system.",
      "The words resemble - but are not exactly the same as \u2013 the title of a book called Delay, Deny, Defend: Why Insurance Companies Don't Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It.",
      "The book, published in 2010, was written by Jay Feinman, a legal scholar at Rutgers University in New Jersey. It's billed as an expos\u00e9 of the insurance industry and a how-to guide for Americans on how to navigate the system.",
      "Professor Feinman declined to comment when the BBC contacted him.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 18:52:29 GMT",
    "summary": "Scrapping the two-child cap and changes to tax thresholds are among plans for the next financial year.",
    "story": [
      "A vow to scrap the two-child benefit cap and changes to basic and intermediate tax thresholds are among the plans for the Scottish government for the next financial year.",
      "The announcements were made by Finance Secretary Shona Robison as she revealed her tax and spending plans for 2025/26.",
      "Other talking points included an extra \u00a32bn for the NHS and a \u00a3768m investment in affordable homes.",
      "Here are five key takeaways from this year's Scottish Budget.",
      "1. Two-child benefits cap",
      "The biggest announcement in the budget actually isn\u2019t part of the tax or spending plans for next year.",
      "It was Shona Robison\u2019s \u201crabbit out of the hat\u201d moment of announcing that the Scottish government would move to scrap - or offset, or mitigate - the two-child benefits cap.",
      "That\u2019s a UK-wide policy, imposed by the Department of Work and Pensions on welfare payments such as universal credit and child tax credits - so it will take some time, and will need some help from the UK government.",
      "It\u2019s not yet clear what the mechanism will be, how it will work, or how much it will cost.",
      "The Scottish Fiscal Commission says it was only sent the proposal last week, and that it hasn\u2019t had time to cost it; they call it a \u201cfiscal risk\u201d.",
      "But be in no doubt that this is a big challenge to Labour.",
      "It comes days after an announcement on the winter fuel payment also designed to outflank Anas Sarwar\u2019s party and embarrass the UK administration.",
      "If all goes to plan then the SNP government will start sending out payments to families of the 15,000 children affected in April 2026. One month before the next Holyrood election.",
      "Labour says it's willing to listen to ideas, but points out that there is not a penny in the coming year\u2019s budget to support it.",
      "They will surely need to come up with a more substantial response before that election comes much closer.",
      "2. Taxes",
      "There were no big changes to the devolved income tax system in this budget.",
      "There was some tinkering with thresholds, which will have a political impact if not a big financial one.",
      "Robison is increasing the thresholds for the basic and intermediate rates - two of the lower rungs in Scotland\u2019s six-band ladder of taxes.",
      "Because Chancellor Rachel Reeves has frozen those thresholds in the rest of the UK, it means Scots earning less than \u00a330,300 will pay less tax than if they lived in England or Wales.",
      "The difference is less than \u00a330 a year, but it allows Robison to say that 51% of Scottish taxpayers pay less.",
      "One bill that will almost certainly be going up is council tax. But with last year\u2019s one-off freeze on local rates coming to an end, it will be down to your local representatives to decide.",
      "Rather than wielding a stick by imposing any sort of cap, Robison instead sought to guilt local authorities into holding down increases, saying that \u201cwith record funding there is no reason for big increases in council tax next year\u201d.",
      "She says there\u2019s an extra \u00a31bn for local government - but it remains to be seen how much of that councillors will be free to allocate, and how much will fall into ring-fenced areas.",
      "Every year the government says it has increased funding for councils, then councils hit back that it\u2019s not enough, and there\u2019s a row over exactly how much money is enough money.",
      "We will no doubt go around in circles on that until budgets at a local and national level are finalised next year.",
      "3. Spending priorities",
      "The budget totalled more than \u00a363bn, and previously ubiquitous talk of tough decisions and austerity was notably absent. There was a positive tone - like Robison suddenly had some cash to splash on the government\u2019s favourite policies.",
      "John Swinney has made the eradication of child poverty as his top priority, and as ever there is cash in the budget for the flagship Scottish Child Payment.",
      "The cash to mitigate the two-child cap doesn\u2019t feature in this budget - only some money to set up that system, whatever it turns out to look like.",
      "In total, spending on social security is up by \u00a3800m - highlighting a key feature of devolved government, in the SNP\u2019s appetite for big state interventions and welfare safety nets.",
      "You can include in that last week\u2019s announcement about winter fuel payments, which are being partially reinstated from next year.",
      "This week Mr Swinney has also (unsurprisingly) earmarked the NHS as a core priority, and as expected it has a record funding settlement - \u00a321bn, or a third of the total budget.",
      "That includes almost \u00a3200m to cut waiting times and cash for local hospital projects in Edinburgh, Fort William and Airdrie.",
      "There were also billions of pounds for net zero and climate policies - including money from the ScotWind fund, a pot of cash raised by auctioning off plots of the seabed for offshore wind, which Robison had previously feared she might need to use for day-to-day funding.",
      "And there is \u00a3768m for affordable housing, which chiefly goes to reverse a cut made under Humza Yousaf\u2019s administration last year, but does ultimately leave spending higher and will apparently create 8,000 new homes in the coming year.",
      "4. Growing the economy",
      "A big focus of governments across the UK has been economic growth. Rachel Reeves has put it at the core of everything she is doing as chancellor, as Robison said a thriving economy was \u201can essential requirement\u201d.",
      "The finance secretary had been challenged to match the chancellor\u2019s support for firms in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors - a 40% relief on business rates.",
      "Scotland has a slightly different system of \u201cnon-domestic rates\u201d, but ultimately Robison said there would be a similar 40% relief for the vast majority of hospitality premises.",
      "Retail and leisure were notably absent (although there is some support for music venues), and we will see how far this shakes out in terms of who does and doesn\u2019t qualify for funding.",
      "The Scottish Hospitality Group has said it is a \u201csignificantly more restricted\u201d offer than that down south, calling it a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d.",
      "A motif of Ms Robison\u2019s speech was name-checking her cabinet colleagues as she spoke to each of their portfolio areas.",
      "That felt particularly notable in the case of Kate Forbes - an influential figure as the woman John Swinney brought into government in part to mend fences with business.",
      "She has highlighted more money for town centre regeneration as well as a tripling of investment in the offshore wind supply chain, which it is said will leverage ten times that figure in private investment.",
      "This approach of public cash opening the door to huge flows of private funds is a favourite tactic of Ms Reeves - and indeed is the core purpose of GB Energy.",
      "That UK energy firm is set to have some company when it sets up in Aberdeen, with Ms Robison pledging to establish a hub or offshore wind in the North East.",
      "5. Politics",
      "The SNP does not have a majority in the Scottish Parliament, and thus needs the help of other parties to pass a budget.",
      "John Swinney has talked about wanting to reach out to opponents and run a collaborative administration.",
      "But there is no chance of a deal with the Conservatives, who want a billion pounds of tax cuts, or Labour, who really just want an election.",
      "That leaves the Greens and the Lib Dems as the most likely dance partners.",
      "Robison quite deliberately nodded to the key asks of both parties. There was funding for ferries, mental health and dentistry for the Lib Dems. The Greens demanded \u00a34.7bn for green policies - and she pledged \u00a34.9bn.",
      "The Greens welcomed some of the measures, but said \u201csignificant further changes\u201d were needed. They are particularly suspicious of the sums on offer for councils.",
      "The Lib Dems welcomed even more of Robison\u2019s announcements, with leader Alex Cole-Hamilton reeling off a whole series of measures where he said it was right the government had listened to him.",
      "The draft budget is really the starting point for talks, which won\u2019t come to a head until the first votes at Holyrood in February.",
      "But the fevered talk of snap elections which followed the collapse of the Bute House Agreement has faded. A deal with someone still feels the most likely outcome.",

      "But some have criticised the plans, arguing that public ownership will not make much difference unless it is paired with fresh investment in the railways.",

      "The move is part of Labour's wider plans to renationalise rail services as operators' contracts either end or reach a break.",
      "Under the existing system, Britain's railway lines are run by train operating companies as franchises for a fixed length of time.",

      "\"Jaguar has no desire to be loved by everybody,\" said Gerry McGovern as he strode across the stage on a slightly chilly evening in Miami last week. It was a bold statement from Jaguar Land Rover's creative director, but it summed up the aura around the relaunch of one of the UK's most famous brands.",
      "On 18 November, a short teaser ad was released that ignited social media. Lasting just 30 seconds, it showed models in bizarre and brightly coloured outfits but did not feature a single car.",
      "The New York Post described it as \"the latest example of idiotic and woke corporate virtue signalling\". Elon Musk took a dig on X, asking Jaguar's official account: \"Do you sell cars?\"",
      "Then came the actual launch at a Miami art fair. Mr McGovern stood on stage beside two cars, resplendent in \"Miami Pink\" and \"London Blue\" shades. Both were examples of Jaguar's new Type 00 \u2013 a concept car that won't ever go on sale, but is meant to showcase the brand's plans for the future. Angular, aggressive, with a huge bonnet and more than a hint of Batmobile, the new design also polarised opinions.",
      "\"Even Gen Z hate the new 'woke' Jaguar!\" declared the Daily Mail. \"Mark my words, Jaguar will go bust,\" Reform Party leader Nigel Farage predicted on X. But the former Top Gear presenter James May told the BBC that the fact the ad was being talked about so widely has \"got to be a bit of a result for Jaguar, hasn't it\"?",
      "Jaguar's managing director Rawdon Glover also hit back, insisting the company needed to be \"bold and disruptive\" in order to get its message across.",
      "But some insiders argue that Jaguar's problems run deeper than a five-minute frenzy on social media.",
      "A 'steady road to nowhere'",
      "Even before the furore over the advert, \"the brand was on a steady road to nowhere\", argues Matthias Schmidt, founder of industry intelligence firm Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "\"The traditional Jaguar demographic was slowly being diluted through natural attrition and customers jumping ship to other brands.\"",
      "So, the publicity that the ad and the launch have drawn appear to have been welcomed within the business.",
      "As Gerry McGovern drily quipped from the stage: \"We're delighted to have your attention.\"",
      "Controversy, he added, had always surrounded British creativity when it was at its best.",
      "Behind all the noise, what is happening at Jaguar is pretty simple. It is being re-launched as an all-electric brand as part of a major restructuring at JLR, instigated by its parent company, the Indian conglomerate Tata.",
      "Jaguar's current models, including the I-Pace, the E-Pace and the F-Type, are no longer being sold in the UK. Instead, the first of a new generation of cars will hit the road in 2026.",
      "Alongside this transition to battery power comes a move upmarket, with the new models expected to cost upwards of \u00a3100,000.",
      "The reasons for doing all this are twofold. Firstly, Jaguar has been struggling to sell enough cars or to make enough money. Secondly, JLR needs to build more electric cars to satisfy regulators, who are working to phase out the sale of new petrol and diesel models.",
      "Steve McQueen and the glory days",
      "It's a far cry from the brand's glory days, when the E-Type placed Jaguar firmly at the heart of swinging-sixties British cool. Steve McQueen owned one. So did Frank Sinatra. Peter Sellers gave one to his wife, Swedish superstar Britt Ekland. George Best, who knew a thing or two about fast cars and a fast lifestyle, had several.",
      "But for decades, the stereotype of a Jaguar buyer has been a well-to-do company boss - almost certainly male, with expensive cufflinks and a set of golf clubs in the boot. Not so long ago he might have been seen smoking a cigar as well.",
      "That might be a little unfair on Jaguar. It has has clearly tried to appeal to female buyers and to families, with offerings such as the F-Pace. Nicknamed the \"She-Type\", this was praised by Good Housekeeping magazine after its launch for its seats designed with women in mind.",
      "But Jaguar continues to be perceived by many as a supplier of upmarket exec-mobiles - and this is a segment of the market where competition is fierce.",
      "\"They've been chasing BMW and Audi sales for years and despite some decent cars have struggled to be profitable,\" explains Rachel Burgess, magazine editor at Autocar.",
      "\"Now, they're trying to target the likes of Bentley and Porsche, looking at high net-worth individuals, who would be spending far more on a car than the level at which Jaguars used to be priced.\"",
      "A long-brewing reinvention",
      "The reinvention of Jaguar has been brewing for many years. Tata bought the brand from Ford in 2008, following nearly two decades under American ownership. During that period, Ford invested significant sums and overhauled its manufacturing and quality control processes. But it failed to make the business profitable and, at the height of the global financial crisis, put Jaguar up for sale.",
      "After taking control of both Jaguar and Land Rover, Tata merged the two into JLR: that brought stability and removed immediate doubts over Jaguar's future.",
      "But while JLR has performed relatively well over the past decade, despite the downturn caused by the Covid pandemic, it is the part of the business that used to be Land Rover that has been driving recent growth.",
      "This has been largely thanks to strong demand for luxury SUVs in markets such as North America and China, as well as in the UK.",
      "In April, the company reported an increase in annual sales across its Range Rover, Defender and Discovery brands of nearly 25%, helping to drive revenues and profits up across the business. Jaguar's sales did rise as well \u2013 by 7%. But that came after five years of steady decline.",
      "In the 2018-19 financial year, Jaguar sold more than 180,000 vehicles. In 2023-24, the figure was 66,866 \u2013 a relatively small proportion of JLRs overall sales of 431,737.",
      "By 2021, other pressures were mounting on JLR, not least the introduction of increasingly stringent environmental rules in the UK and the EU. At the time, JLR had only one electric model in its line-up, the I-Pace.",
      "In February 2021, JLR's chief executive Thierry Bollor\u00e9 announced a new strategy: a wholesale revamp of its range, with all models to become available in electric form by the end of the decade. But crucially, he said Jaguar would be \"re-imagined\" as an all-electric brand.",
      "Although Mr Bollor\u00e9 would leave at the end of the following year, his plan was picked up by his successor, Adrian Mardell \u2013 who promised the company would invest \u00a315bn to turn it into reality.",
      "Within JLR, there is widespread recognition that something had to change.",
      "Fewer cars, bigger profit margins",
      "\"Jaguar's performance over the past 10 years has been challenging,\" Rawdon Glover admitted in a previous BBC interview. He pointed out that Jaguar had been trying to succeed in a high-volume market, where the bigger players can keep their costs down through economies of scale.",
      "\"While our vehicles were highly competent, and critically acclaimed, actually the ability to commercially succeed in that environment was challenging,\" he said.",
      "The move upmarket, in theory at least, gives Jaguar the opportunity to sell fewer cars, but with much bigger profit margins.",
      "\"I'm fully in agreement that they had to do something,\" says Andy Palmer, an industry veteran and former CEO of Aston Martin who has also been a leading executive at Nissan.",
      "\"But it's very brave to be planning to walk away from 85% of your customer base. They are going to have to find new customers to replace them. And acquisition of new customers is always more expensive than retaining existing ones.\"",
      "The big question, though, is whether the changes being made are the correct ones.",
      "'Like a luxury hotel that doesn't refurbish'",
      "Arguably, one of the reasons why Jaguar's rebrand has attracted such attention is because although relatively few people buy the actual cars, the name itself still resonates with cultural significance, thanks to a heritage going back more than seven decades.",
      "In its early days, under founder Sir William Lyons, Jaguar was truly innovative, and it knew how to grab attention. In 1948, it launched the XK120, an elegant two-seater sports car with swooping lines and a powerful six-cylinder engine. As the name implied, it had a top speed of 120mph, making it the world's fastest production car at the time.",
      "In a country still recovering from the ravages of World War Two, this was a revelation. Jaguar had originally planned to build just 200, but demand was so high, it ended up making more than 12,000.",
      "Victories in motorsport put Jaguar's name in lights, especially at the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans - but the company continued to produce striking machines off track as well.",
      "A number of these have stood the test of time, not least the Mark II and its successor, the S-Type. First produced in 1959, this was a luxury saloon that happened to have plenty of bad-boy appeal.",
      "Arguably Jaguar's greatest moment, however, came with the launch of the E-Type in 1961, which came with 150mph performance, and movie-star cachet. It was the car to be seen in and gave the Jaguar badge a lustre that lasted for decades.",
      "But nostalgia alone will not sell cars. Jaguar has been harking back to former glories for a long time.",
      "\"I would certainly say they've been trading off nostalgia for decades,\" says Matthias Schmidt.",
      "Prior to the relaunch, he says Jaguar has been \"like a luxury hotel that doesn't feel the need to refurbish its brand\". He adds: \"The failure to look over one's shoulders and see what the competition is doing can be fatal.\"",
      "Genius or risky?",
      "This week's relaunch seems designed to get the brand out of a comfortable rut and attempt to make it edgy again, while retaining at least some of its past cachet. Or, as Gerry McGovern put it from the Miami stage, \"recapture the essence of Jaguar's original creative conviction\".",
      "Under normal circumstances, the debut of a new car might gain a certain amount of attention in motoring magazines and websites, but it would rarely, if ever, get onto the front pages.",
      "The company has not said who was behind the teaser ad that went viral - generating more than three million views on YouTube - but JLR has been working with Accenture's creative marketing arm, Accenture Song, for three years.",
      "Accenture has not commented.",
      "Branding experts have mixed views about the campaign.",
      "\"What we had was a really bold advertising campaign, that has now been followed through seamlessly with a concept car that completely matches the campaign,\" says Mark Beaumont, founder of branding agency Dinosaur.",
      "\"It is potentially a masterclass in advertising awareness\".",
      "But Tim Parker, strategy director at Conran Design thinks it is a risky strategy. \"They have indeed copied nothing that has come before in the brand's rich heritage, but at what cost?",
      "\"Few brands ever succeed by alienating their traditional customer base over the longer term,\" he continues. \"If the goal is to build relevance in a crowded luxury EV market, then differentiation makes sense \u2013 but only if the underlying strategy is coherent.\"",
      "'Does the world need the Jaguar brand?'",
      "What we have not seen yet, however, or at least in any detail, is an actual road-going car. The concept is just that \u2013 an idea.",
      "Jaguar is in the process of developing three new models, the first of which is unlikely to go on sale until late 2026. All we have been told is that it will be powerful, with more than 575hp, and have a range of more than 430 miles.",
      "It has begun road-testing, and a handful of leaked photos show a large boxy machine that is both similar to the concept \u2013 and very different.",
      "Why these Israeli men volunteered to fight - but now refuse to return to Gaza",
      "'I spent 30 years as a therapist to killers - and no-one is born evil'",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "For any car company, trying to negotiate the transition to electric vehicles without alienating any of its customers is going to be challenging. And for a brand like Jaguar, with the scent of petrol and the sound of six and 12 cylinder engines built into its DNA, it likely to be even harder.",
      "But among all of this is another question that hasn't yet been asked. That is, does that DNA even matter any more - and how useful really is it when it comes to selling cars today?",
      "Andy Palmer puts it more bluntly: Jaguar, he thinks, may well be disposable.",
      "\"I think it's a very fair question to ask \u2013 does JLR actually need the Jaguar brand? Does the world need the Jaguar brand?\"",
      "We won't find out the answer until 2026. In the meantime, we know what Jaguar's plan is. Now it has to deliver.",

    "summary": "Sweden has a reputation for strong gender equality, but some young women are giving up their jobs.",
    "story": [
      "Sweden has a global reputation for championing gender equality, so why are young women embracing a social media trend that celebrates quitting work?",
      "Vilma Larsson, 25, previously had jobs in a grocery store, a care home and a factory. But she quit work a year ago to become a stay-at-home-girlfriend, and says she\u2019s never been happier.",
      "\u201cMy life is softer. I am not struggling. I am not very stressed.\u201d",
      "Her boyfriend works remotely in finance, and while he spends his days on his laptop, she\u2019s at the gym, out for coffee, or cooking. The couple grew up in small towns in central Sweden, but now travel a lot, and are spending the winter in Cyprus.",
      "\u201cEvery month he gives me a salary from his money that he made. But if I need more, I'll ask him. Or if I need less, I don't - I just save the rest,\u201d explains Ms Larsson.",
      "She shares her lifestyle on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok, where she\u2019s amassed 11,000 followers. Some of her posts have had almost 400,000 likes, although she says she\u2019s not making an income from her content.",
      "She uses the hashtags \u201chemmaflickv\u00e4n\u201d and \u201chemmafru\u201d (Swedish for stay-at-home girlfriend and housewife) and describes herself as a \u201csoft girl\u201d \u2013 an identity that embraces a softer, more feminine way of living rather than focussing on a career.",
      "The soft girl lifestyle has been a microtrend on social media in different parts of the world since the late 2010s. But in Sweden \u2013 with five decades of policies designed to promote dual income households behind it \u2013 the concept\u2019s recent popularity has sparked both surprise and division.",
      "Ungdomsbarometern \u2013  Sweden\u2019s largest annual survey of young people \u2013 first put the national spotlight on Swedes embracing the soft girl trend a year ago, after it became a popular choice when 15 to 24-year-olds were asked to predict trends for 2024.",
      "Another study released by Ungdomsbaromatern this August suggested it was even becoming an aspiration among younger schoolgirls, with 14% of seven to 14-year-olds identifying as soft girls.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about leaning away from this \u2018girl boss\u2019 ideal that we've seen for a lot of years, where there are very, very high demands for success in every aspect of life,\u201d explains Johanna G\u00f6ransson, a researcher for Ungdomsbarometern.",
      "There is no official data on the number of young \u201csoft girls\u201d quitting work altogether and living off their partners like Ms Larsson, and Ms G\u00f6ransson says it is likely to be a small proportion.",
      "But it\u2019s nevertheless become a major talking point in Sweden, from opinion pieces in broadsheet newspapers, to panel discussions at Almedalen \u2013 a huge annual cross-party political event \u2013 and on Swedish public service television.",
      "Gudrun Schyman \u2013 the co-founder and former leader of Sweden\u2019s feminist party Feministiskt initiativ - says she\u2019s taken part in recent debates on the issue. She believes women living off their partners wealth is \u201cvery dangerous\u201d, and \u201ca step backwards\u201d for gender equality.",
      "Ms Schyman argues that young Swedes have been influenced by the country\u2019s right-wing coalition government, which collaborates with the nationalist Sweden Democrats party, as well as the \u201cbroader development\u201d of populism in Europe and the United States.",
      "She also thinks there\u2019s a lack of awareness about life in Sweden before it embraced policies designed to promote gender equality, such as heavily subsidised childcare and shared parental leave. \u201cYoung women today don't carry the history of how women had to fight for their rights - the right to work, the right to have a salary, and the right to economic independence.\u201d",
      "At the other end of the political spectrum, the Sweden Democrats party has been positive towards the soft girls trend.",
      "\u201cI think that people should get to decide over their own life,\u201d says Denice Westerberg, national spokesperson for the party\u2019s youth wing. \u201cAnd if you have that economic possibility to do that [live off a partner] then good for you.",
      "\u201cWe still live in a country with all the opportunities to have a career. We still have all the rights, but we have the right to choose to live more traditionally.\u201d",
      "Aside from ideological debates, discussions have focussed on the social and cultural factors that could be influencing young women to quit work - or at least aspire to a softer lifestyle.",
      "Sweden has a reputation for work life balance - most employees get six-weeks holiday a year, and less than 1% work more than 50 hours a week.",
      "Still, Ungdomsbaromatern\u2019s research suggests rising stress levels amongst young people, and Ms G\u00f6ransson believes soft girls trend may be an extension of recent global work trends such as \u201cquiet quitting\u201d, which encourages employees not to overextend themselves.",

      "The conclusion of the tour leaves Swift at a crossroads. This Eras Tour will be the yardstick against which the rest of her career will be measured - and her next move will be watched closely by fans and critics alike.",
      "So what options does she have?",
      "\"Taylor is a very future-minded thinker, so I imagine she has the next few years already completely planned out.\" says Bryan West, a dedicated Taylor Swift reporter for USA Today and The Tennessean, who has seen the Eras tour 89 times.",
      "Noting Swift's tendency to dovetail her projects, he thinks there will be some sort of \"news-making\" announcement at her final show.",
      "Most likely, this will be the reveal of Reputation (Taylor's Version) - the latest instalment of her re-recorded album series, complete with bonus tracks from the vault.",
      "That said, fans have been anticipating that announcement all year and the album is yet to materialise, despite numerous, tantalising hints it's on its way.",
      "West has some other theories, too.",
      "\"We've seen film crews at many of the gigs, so I'd not be shocked if she's been shooting a documentary this entire time.",
      "\"And in her new book, she said, 'See you next era', so there have been reports that she's working on new music.\"",
      "A longer term prospect is that Swift will pivot to film. In December 2022, she signed a deal to direct a film for Searchlight Pictures, based on her own original script.",
      "Making the announcement, Searchlight presidents David Greenbaum and Matthew Greenfield called her \"a once in a generation artist and storyteller\", but the trail has gone cold since then. Perhaps she'll return to the director's chair in 2025?",

      "Pushin' strollers",
      "\"She needs to take some time off, first and foremost,\" says Jack Saunders, host of Radio 1's New Music Show, \"because it's completely unrealistic to expect a human being to operate at the performance level that she has been doing for the last couple of years and dive straight back in.",
      "\"We've heard a lot from Taylor - so it's healthy for us and it's healthy for her to step back and take some time away, so that she can fuel herself for whatever's next.\"",
      "Indeed, Swift has hinted she's tiring of the music industry grind.",
      "Clara Bow, a track from her latest album The Tortured Poets Department, is a barbed commentary on the industry's lust for new blood.",
      "Other songs find her daydreaming about wedding rings and \"pushin' strollers\" - so there's every possibility Swift will take a year off to focus on her romance with American football star Travis Kelce.",
      "\"She probably will take a break,\" says West, \"but she's not one that necessarily sits still. She's always creating. She's always coming up with new projects.\"",
      "If Swift does head back to the studio, singer-songwriter Self Esteem hopes she'll spend the cultural (and financial) capital she's built up over the last two years to do something unexpected.",
      "\"If I was her, I'd indulge myself in making music in all the different genres and styles I hadn't been able to explore because of branding and expectations,\" she says.",
      "\"And it sounds really worthy, but I can't wait until I have enough money to fund working class people who can't get access to music - so if I was her, I'd do that.\"",
      "(It's worth noting that Swift has a history of charitable giving, including donations to local foodbanks on every stop of the Eras tour).",
      "Whatever happens, a left-hand swerve makes sense; in her Eras Tour book, the star says she \"hates to do the same thing twice\".",
      "But for this weekend, Michelle just wants to savour the final moments of a one-off phenomenon.",
      "\"We love concerts in my family. I love the buzz of being in a whole crowd of people excited about the same thing,\" she says, \"but this feels different.",
      "\"I love how the tour has brought people all over the world together.",
      "\"It will certainly be interesting to see what her next move is,\" she adds, \"but I can't bring myself to speculate.",
      "\"I'll just wait and see - because, whatever she does next, Taylor and her team should be very proud of the joy that was brought to so many during the Eras Tour run.\""

    "title": "Lauren Mayberry of Chvrches: I was always trying to make everyone happy",
    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 00:37:07 GMT",
    "summary": "The Chvrches singer on going solo, and the loneliness of being the only woman in a touring band.",
    "story": [
      "Lauren Mayberry is a peacemaker.",
      "Since 2011, she's been frontwoman of the Glaswegian band Chvrches, topping festival bills and the album charts with a trademark barrage of distorted synths and razor-sharp melodies.",
      "Mayberry was the baby of the band - just 23 when she joined, and years younger than her bandmates, Iain Cook and Martin Doherty.",
      "But their chemistry was instant. Chvrches' debut single, The Mother We Share, was written and recorded in 48 hours, using the only three synths they owned - but it became a word of mouth hit, earning them airplay on BBC Radio 1 and support slots with Passion Pit and Depeche Mode.",
      "In the press, they carefully presented themselves as a band, with each member receiving equal billing. But Mayberry says she worried about being the junior partner.",
      "\"I was always conscious that I was younger than the other guys, and they had a lot more experience,\" she says.",
      "\"They\u2019d been to music school, and I hadn't. So I always felt like I was on the back foot, in terms of where I sat in the hierarchy.\"",
      "That feeling was amplified during a 2019 tour of Australia.",
      "The itinerary gave the band a four-day break in Melbourne, and Mayberry was looking forward to spending the downtime with her bandmates and the crew - until she discovered they'd made separate plans and she was stranded in her hotel room.",
      "\"I remember being very upset and hurt by that because I was always worrying about everyone else and taking care of everybody, and it was a humbling moment,\" she says.",
      "\"In the end, I hired a little car and drove to an Australian spa town and had a wee cry listening to Taylor Swift\u2019s Cruel Summer.\"",
      "Looking back, she thinks that being the only woman in the touring party left her carrying the \"emotional labour\" of keeping the show on the road.",
      "\"I feel like I twisted myself into a pretzel sometimes to make everyone happy.",
      "\"Then I\u2019d look back and think, \u2018And were you happy?'",
      "\"Not really, but I was keeping the peace.\"",
      "She considered leaving the band after that Australian incident. Then Covid struck, and Chvrches ended up making a fourth album, 2021's Screen Violence, remotely.",
      "She finally took the plunge a year later, but not before signing a new record deal with her bandmates, assuring the future of the project.",
      "\"I was conscious it would give people a sense of security, that I\u2019d made a commitment,\" she says.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s how it actually works, but that was my hope.\"",
      "She\u2019s keen to stress there\u2019s no bad blood: Doherty and Cook have given her their full support. Still, it\u2019s natural for someone leaving a band to define themselves in opposition to that music - otherwise what\u2019s the point?",
      "As Mayberry succinctly puts it: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to make a crap knock-off Chvrches record.\u201d",
      "In recording sessions, she'd flinch when anyone pulled out a vintage synth. Instead, she pursued a more organic, lyrics-first approach.",
      "But after a decade in a trio, the instinct to compromise was hard-wired.",
      "\u201cI'm very used to arguing my point, then trying to see other people's point of view,\" she says.",
      "\"So it was a real learning curve to be like, \u2018No, this is my opinion, and if I don't think it's right, then it's not right, and that's the end of the conversation'.\u201d",
      "Crying wolf",
      "The result is Vicious Creature, an album that showcases new depths to Mayberry\u2018s voice, which fluctuates between vulnerability and venom, while paying homage to her pop heroines.",
      "She channels the spirit of All Saints on the album opener Something In The Air; and borrows the choppy, sampled strings of Annie Lennox's Walking On Broken Glass to power the single Crocodile Tears.",
      "The latter is a furious riposte to an emotionally manipulative man, where Mayberry snarls: \u201cWhat a man will say just to get his way / Always crying wolf, so I\u2019m sad to say / I don\u2019t really wanna hear it from you, babe\".",
      "The singer says she's role-playing in that song, inspired by the dark, subversive femininity of Velma Kelly in the musical Chicago, or Cabaret's Sally Bowles.",
      "It's one of several songs that survived the first incarnation of the album - tentatively titled Fiction - that would be \"dark, theatrical and character driven\".",
      "Slowly, over time, more personal songs started to creep into the mix.",
      "The syncopated pulse of Change Shapes is a condemnation of music industry sexism (\"I'm a doll inside a box, with a ball and a chain\"). Sorry, Etc tells a similar story over a chaotic hybrid of garage rock and drum & bass.",
      "\"There were definitely a few songs where it was at best expressing frustrations and at worst [feeling] kind of hurt,\" about her life in music, Mayberry says.",
      "The album's most intimate moment is a muted piano ballad called Oh, Mother.",
      "Over three verses, Mayberry documents the shifting relationship with her mother - from the unquestioning love of childhood to adolescent disgust and, finally, the realisation that their time together is limited.",
      "\"It kills me to know you won't be around,\" she sings gently. \"Oh mother, what will I do without you?\"",
      "The last song written for the record, the words poured out after Mayberry's friend and co-writer Dan McDougall sketched out the chords in the studio.",
      "Discussing the lyrics, which were inspired by a family illness, the singer becomes a little emotional.",
      "\"When you're living in the shadow of things like that, it's on your mind all the time,\" she says.",
      "\"I think about it all the time. When I go away on tour, I always think, \u2018Oh, is this the tour where I'm gone and I miss it\u2019.",
      "\"So that last afternoon in the studio was quite a weepy one... But then we went to Nando's. So it's all about balance.\"",
      "Oh, Mother is the sort of song she could never have written in Chvrches, Mayberry says.",
      "\"It's not a place that we would go emotionally or sonically,\" she says.",
      "\"I think the best songs happen when the lyrics and the meaning and the sonics interlink but [with Chvrches] I was writing things in my notebooks and thinking, \u2018This is never going to fit with what the band have built\u2019.\"",
      "Change is never easy, though. While some reviews have called the album a \"masterclass in pop alchemy\", others have said Mayberry \"still sounds like someone finding their feet\".",
      "Fans of Chvrches' industrial sound have expressed disappointment too, but the singer has learned to distance herself from criticism.",
      "\"When people are like, \u2018Screw you\u2019, I rationalise it like this: You\u2019re mad at me, but you're mad at me because life is hard, and our music made your life a bit easier for a minute. And now you're like, \u2018Please don't take that away.\u2019",
      "\"When I was 24, that was overwhelming, but it made sense once I could compartmentalise it.",
      "\"You are the representative of something that means so much to this person - so when you do something else, it threatens the idea of that existing.\"",
      "The flipside of that equation comes in concert. When Mayberry plays a song like Asking For A Friend, with its reassuring mantra, \"you still matter\", she often sees \"someone in the audience having a wee dance-cry\".",
      "\"And when people cry, I cry. Everyone's like, 'Are you ok?' but I'm just caught up in the moment.",
      "\"But I hope that\u2019s why I\u2019m good at my job, because I have some kind of empathy.",
      "\"It\u2019s inconvenient for my life, but hopefully good for the crowd.\""

      "Our rendezvous is in a large underground space and we\u2019re surrounded by three vast screens. It\u2019s fairly dark inside but the sunglasses remain in place during our conversation.",
      "I tentatively ask what they\u2019re for. Are they a shield or for something more prosaic, short-sightedness perhaps?",
      "\u201cThey help me see and they help me not see,\u201d Wintour tells me, somewhat enigmatically. \u201cThey help me be seen and not be seen. They are a prop, I would say\u201d.",
      "The Lightroom in London uses digital projection and audio technology in a high-walled space to generate an immersive experience for visitors.",
      "It has previously hosted a blockbuster David Hockney show and Tom Hanks\u2019s exhibition on the history of space travel.",
      "Now the exhibition space gives audiences a front-row seat at some of the most spectacular fashion shows in history, tapping into Vogue\u2019s archive and contributor network.",
      "Wintour admits that \u201cfor someone who goes to so many shows, you get a little, not jaded, but you get used to the experience\".",
      "Since most visitors to the exhibition will not have had the chance to attend such events, she says they were keen to make sure it felt as though they were actually there.",
      "As the reigning queen of the fashion world, Wintour has had a real front-row seat for decades - often on a delicate gold chair, the kind of furniture that is ubiquitous at the high end catwalk viewings where her invitation is always a dead cert.",
      "In the blurb to the exhibition, Wintour writes that she has \u201cprobably spent a year of my life waiting for fashion shows, which are famously tardy, to begin\u201d.",
      "She tells me the American designer Marc Jacobs once held a runway show that was an hour and a half late, but \u201cwe all yelled at him so much after that, the next season, he not only started the show on time, he actually started five minutes early\u201d.",
      "The Italian designer Gianni Versace, though, was \u201calways on time\u201d,",
      "\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter who wasn\u2019t there, it could have been the Pope, he didn\u2019t care\u201d.",
      "That would have suited Wintour, who is \u201chorribly punctual, usually early\u201d.",
      "She arrives early for our interview. Fortunately, I\u2019d been warned it was a character trait and we were ready.",
      "The Vogue show offers audiences a series of vibrant chapters, narrated by Cate Blanchett, which tell the story of fashion and the runway.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite nostalgic to sit in the space and look at the incredible changes that have happened in fashion,\" Wintour tells me.",
      "We\u2019re treated to a series of the magazine's front covers from the early days, black and white footage of the first catwalk shows and images of the couture salons of the early twentieth century.",
      "Fashion then was \u201cvery elitist - you had to be invited and it was a very tight little world,\u201d says Wintour.",
      "Contrast that with the debut show by the musician and entrepreneur Pharrell Williams for Louis Vuitton in 2023. A pop-culture event, it was held on the Pont Neuf in Paris, with the likes of Beyonce, Rihanna and of course Wintour in attendance, and got one billion views online.",
      "The democratisation of fashion means, as Wintour puts it, \u201cnow everyone can come to the party, which is as it should be\u201d.",
      "The exhibition also takes us back to 2017 when Karl Lagerfeld devised a space-station inspired runway set, complete with a rocket blasting off as models stood beside it decked in Chanel. Wintour told me it was \u201cextraordinary\u2026 and you couldn't wait to see what he was going to come up with next\u201d.",
      "Lagerfeld had form. Ten years earlier for Fendi, he had broken new ground, using the Great Wall of China as a catwalk, his models parading along the stone. Fashion designers of his stature clearly don\u2019t do things by halves.",
      "To insiders, Wintour has been one of the most significant players in fashion for the best part of 40 years - a maker of careers, an advocate for the power of fashion to meld with the A-list of entertainment.",
      "She\u2019s the driving force behind the annual Met Gala in New York, which sees the worlds of fashion and fame collide and go viral in a spectacle of outrageous outfits and celebrity appearances on the first Monday of every May.",
      "Those not on the inside are more likely to wonder just how closely Wintour resembles Miranda Priestly, the fictional tyrannical magazine boss from the film The Devil Wears Prada, whose portrayal by Meryl Streep is seared into the memories of fans.",
      "\u201cIs there some reason that my coffee isn\u2019t here? Has she died or something?\u201d Priestly inquires dismissively about her assistant.",
      "\u201cDetails of your incompetence do not interest me,\u201d she later tells her.",
      "On Wintour\u2019s trip to London, she leant in to the comparison, attending the gala performance of the new musical version of the film. There, she told the BBC that it was \"for the audience and for the people I work with to decide if there are any similarities between me and Miranda Priestly\u201d.",
      "When we spoke, I wanted to know if she finds the public persona of Anna Wintour - the sharp, bobbed hair, the meticulous outfits, the glasses - a role she feels she has to perform.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really think about it,\" she says. \"What I\u2019m really interested in is the creative aspect of my job.\"",
      "Wintour tells me she only brought one or two suitcases with her to London and she won\u2019t be drawn on whether she dresses down when she\u2019s at home in the US. \"It\u2019s really about respect in how you present yourself.\"",
      "More than one person has told me that nobody ever says 'no' to Wintour. Donatella Versace says the same in the recent Disney documentary, In Vogue: The 90s.",
      "Wintour demurs. \u201cThat is absolutely untrue. They often say no, but that\u2019s a good thing. No is a wonderful word\u201d.",
      "Do you think people are frightened of you, I ask her. \u201cI hope not,\u201d she replies.",
      "Under her leadership, through talent, force of personality and an eye for what sells, Wintour has tried to future proof Vogue, turning it into a global brand. She is also global content advisor for Conde Nast, the magazine's publisher.",
      "In the modern era, when influencers can take photos of fashion moments and pump them out immediately, Wintour has successfully positioned Vogue as an arbiter of taste and style.",
      "Fashion and advertising are entwined in Vogue's content but Wintour doesn\u2019t accept my premise that fashion journalism can be sycophantic.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s simply not true and it\u2019s sometimes, I think, frustrating to us that work in fashion, that there is an outside perception fashion is frivolous and superficial.",
      "\"In fact, it\u2019s a huge business. We give employment to millions of people around the world.\"",
      "I take that answer to mean that Wintour, the daughter of a former editor of the Evening Standard newspaper, sees herself more as a fashion ambassador than a journalist.",
      "But of course she is also a journalist, arguably one of the most famous journalistic faces on the planet - and one that has no obvious successor.",
      "I ask her, at 75, how much longer she plans to stay in her role.",
      "\u201cI have no plans to leave my job,\u201d she says, adding: \u201cCurrently.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Presenter Gregg Wallace is a national figure, who has been in people\u2019s living rooms several times a week for 20 years.",
      "His programmes, most prominently MasterChef, are made by independent production companies.",
      "But his name and face are associated with the BBC, and, as allegations continue to emerge, the corporation is under fire.",
      "It\u2019s the last thing it needs, so soon after other high profile scandals including the disgraced BBC News presenter Huw Edwards.",
      "The BBC has questions to answer about the allegations over what it knew about Wallace\u2019s behaviour on and off set, and - if it was alerted to these types of allegations - what it did about them.",
      "BBC News has been made aware of two occasions when complaints were made. One, by the radio host Aasmah Mir, related to Celebrity MasterChef in 2017.",
      "She says she complained to the production company behind the show and later spoke to the BBC\u2019s Kate Phillips who was then controller for entertainment commissioning. I understand Phillips was later assured that the issue had been addressed.",
      "Another complaint, just a year afterwards, concerned Impossible Celebrities, made by a different production company.",
      "In a letter from 2018 seen by BBC News, Phillips wrote that she had spoken to Wallace for 90 minutes to make clear what the BBC expected of him. She also confirmed in the letter that many aspects of his behaviour were unacceptable and unprofessional.",
      "Six years on, the emerging allegations about Wallace\u2019s conduct raise questions about whether executives - at the production company Banijay and the BBC - reacted appropriately.",
      "But BBC News has not been told whether the BBC executives involved in Wallace\u2019s shows were made aware of any complaints about him after 2018 and the conversation between him and Phillips. If they weren\u2019t, there is some plausible deniability that they thought the issues raised had been sorted.",
      "Then again, that defence may only go so far. There are wider questions about how much a TV executive should probe, if they are aware that rumours have begun to swirl.",
      "Popbitch, the weekly celebrity newsletter that makes its way into the inboxes of most media executives, had run stories involving allegations about Wallace\u2019s language and behaviour in the past, for example. When does the odd gossipy claim about talent misbehaviour become an issue bosses should take a look at?",
      "Should more questions have been asked by the BBC after 2018?",
      "Some have made the point that these types of scandals involving high profile TV presenters only seem to emerge when the media shines a light on them.",
      "It\u2019s only then, it is argued, that executives take action and launch an investigation. The claim is that before journalists get involved, the executives are more concerned with protecting the star, the show and their bottom line.",
      "In light of Huw Edwards, the BBC launched a workplace review into preventing abuses of power. At the time, the BBC chair Samir Shah said there \"continues to be a sense that powerful people 'get away with it'.\"",
      "But for me, how the Wallace claims may have been handled isn\u2019t entirely comparable to the Edwards scandal.",
      "Huw Edwards was employed directly by the BBC, Wallace is contracted by production companies that make his shows and sell them to the BBC.",
      "To put this in context, 326 independent companies made programmes for the BBC in the year 2023/4, accounting for 55% of the BBC\u2019s TV hours.",
      "I have picked up some frustration on the corporate side of the BBC that the corporation is taking criticism for a programme that it doesn't make.",
      "A BBC insider told me it essentially bought a product from a third party and is now being held to account for the actions of staff in a different organisation.",
      "My assessment is that if there were complaints - or claims of bad behaviour on set - the first port of call would have been the production company.",
      "But that defence - that the BBC is at arm's length on this one - only goes so far. Audiences don\u2019t make that distinction. In the end, they associate Wallace with the BBC, not a production company.",
      "The damage rests at the BBC\u2019s door.",

The director general Tim Davie has already said he\u2019d like to ban the word \"talent\" for the BBC\u2019s stars, to help end the hierarchies that can be a part of programme making when powerful, highly paid people with audience recognition are involved.",
      "But, understandably, the review won\u2019t have oversight of the independent sector. These are independent companies responsible for their own codes.",
      "It would however be useful for the review to lay out what BBC processes are triggered when rumours begin to emerge about a particular star and what the BBC expects from its executives and indeed the production companies it buys programmes from.",
      "Philippa Childs, the head of union Bectu, told Radio 4 on Wednesday \"the time has come for the whole industry to come together and accept that there does need to be some independent scrutiny of how broadcasters [and] production companies work, to try and address this endemic problem\".",

      "But some cases linked to him resulted in harm, including life-long injuries and amputation.",
      "Mr Jabbar left the hospital in 2023 after a report by the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) found some of the surgery had been \"inappropriate\" and \"incorrect\".",

      "Following the RCS report, GOSH said each of Mr Jabbar's 723 patients would receive an independent report to conclude what level of harm they had suffered.",
      "The reviews, which are being carried out by specialist surgeons who did not work at GOSH, are based on patient notes provided by the hospital.",
      "Families have started receiving reports about the care their children received. BBC News has now spoken to four families - and had indirect contact with 12 more - who say the reports do not reflect their children's experiences and often raise more questions than they answer.",
      "Many of the reports were concluded without any interviews or interaction with the family or patient, they say.",
      "Parents describe the reports as part of a \"culture of cover-up\", telling the BBC that GOSH has \"failed their children\", leaving them physically and mentally damaged.",
      "One mother told us: \"Mr Jabbar was known for not writing up records or keeping notes correctly, but these reviews have been based on hospital notes. My daughter's report doesn't reflect her journey at all.\"",
      "A GOSH spokesperson said the hospital was deeply sorry and wanted \"every patient and family who comes to our hospital to feel safe and cared for\".",
      "\"We commissioned an independent review of patient care, which is in line with the NHS England guidelines,\" they added.",

      "\"It says she had six procedures. I can count 10,\" Mr Stalham says.",
      "\"Not a single one of Bunty's surgeries worked, and none of them were of any benefit to her whatsoever. When they were trying to lengthen her leg they ended up shortening it by about eight inches.\"",

      "\"I felt lucky my boy was being seen by the best in the world,\" Ms Omar says. \"I didn't question what was being recommended because I trusted them entirely.\"",
      "At the time, Mansur was complaining of a sore knee. After two operations carried out by Mr Jabbar, Mansur suffered nerve damage resulting in foot drop, which can cause difficulty lifting or moving your foot and can affect the way you walk.",

      "She says the last time she saw Mr Jabbar was in 2022. After that, she says she was told the surgeon was away, but at no stage did the hospital say Mr Jabbar was being investigated.",
      "Ms Omar says this meant Mansur's care was further delayed and three appointments with Mr Jabbar were booked, then cancelled and rearranged.",
      "A GOSH spokesperson says families were told in August 2022 that Mr Jabbar was on sabbatical leave.",
      "A GOSH spokesperson says: \"Assessing psychological harm is, however, complex due to many factors, and so we will always discuss concerns families may have and will do our best to ensure patients get the care and support they need going forward.\"",

      "The independent review into Mansur's care concluded that he suffered \"moderate harm\" through his treatment from Mr Jabbar.",
      "Mansur was five years old when he first saw Mr Jabbar. He is now 12 years old and awaiting more surgery. He will never bend his knee, can only walk short distances and now uses a wheelchair.",
      "\"To say that a boy who has lost his childhood to this man has suffered 'moderate harm' is just the final insult for me,\" Ms Omar says.",

      "In response to the BBC's report, the hospital responded ; \"We completely appreciate that for families who have experienced pain and distress these findings may never feel adequate. We will always discuss concerns families may have and will do our best to ensure patients get the care and support they need going forward.\"",
      "Mr Jabbar worked at four other London hospitals, including three in the private sector - St John and St Elizabeth, the Cromwell and the Portland.",

      "It will be offered to people with a body mass index (BMI) of more than 35 and at least one obesity-related health problem - potentially 3.4 million people.",
      "But because of concerns it could overwhelm services, and in particular GPs, NICE has agreed to give the NHS more than a decade to introduce it - an unprecedented move for a medication.",

      "NICE chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Benger acknowledged it would mean \u201cmany people would have to wait\u201d.",
      "But he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had to make this difficult decision in order to protect vital NHS services and also to test ways of delivering this new generation of weight-loss medications.\u201d",
      "Patient groups have expressed disappointment at the decision to give the NHS so long.",
      "Questions remain",
      "Only those patients under the care of specialist weight-management services will be offered it initially \u2013 matching the approach taken with a similar weight-loss drug, Wegovy.",
      "But from June, the NHS will start offering it to others.",
      "It is unclear exactly how this will be done \u2013 GP practices are likely to be in charge of referring patients, but questions remain over who will be providing the ongoing support involving diet and exercise and monitoring.",
      "NHS England is expected to publish guidance on this in the new year. It could involve the use of apps or separate services being established to support GPs.",
      "Mounjaro, or tirzepatide, which is made by Eli Lilly, makes you feel fuller so you eat less. In trials, people on it have lost a fifth of their body weight.",
      "Wegovy, also known as semaglutide, which is already available on the NHS, works in a similar way. But that can only be given to those under the care of specialist weight-loss management.",
      "There are around 40,000 people estimated to be in that position.",
      "The drugs can be bought privately. Both medicines are also already available for people with type 2 diabetes \u2013 although semaglutide is marketed as Ozempic for those patients.",
      "The rollout of Mounjaro opens up the option of this new generation of weight-loss drugs to the wider public who are struggling with severe obesity.",
      "To be eligible, patients will also need to have one obesity-related condition, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure or heart disease.",
      "Under the rollout plans, those with the highest clinical need will be prioritised first.",
      "It is estimated around 220,000 will benefit in the first three years.",
      "NICE then plans to evaluate how that is working, before pushing ahead with the wider rollout.",
      "As this is final draft guidance, it is still possible rollout could be delayed if there are any appeals made against the decision. If there is not, the guidance will be rubber-stamped before Christmas, NICE said.",
      "Concerns",
      "Mounjaro, which is given via weekly injections, will cost the NHS \u00a3122 per patient per month for the maximum dose, but NICE judged it to be cost-effective given the cost of obesity.",
      "There is a risk that users can put weight back on once they stop using it.",
      "Ministers in Wales will be using the guidance from NICE to inform their rollout.",
      "It is already recommended for use in Scotland \u2013 although the NHS is reportedly struggling with its rollout.",
      "Helen Kirrane, of Diabetes UK, said Mounjaro had a \u201csignificant\u201d role to play in tackling obesity.",
      "But she added: \u201cWe have concerns over the length of time it might take for people to gain access.\u201d",

      "She said the phased rollout was needed to protect access to other NHS services that patients rely on.",
      "And Prof Kamila Hawthorne, of the Royal College of GPs, warned the drug should not be seen as a \"silver bullet\", adding that it did not come without risk and would not be the right course of treatment for everyone who is eligible.",

    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 10:34:22 GMT",
    "summary": "Officials will be able to rubberstamp development plans without local authority permission under the changes.",
    "story": [
      "Housing Secretary Angela Rayner has said overhauling planning rules to bypass local authorities will remove \"chaos and subjectiveness\" from the system.",
      "The planned changes will give local authority planning officers the power to rubberstamp development proposals without permission from council committees, as long as they comply with locally agreed plans and national regulations on standards.",
      "House builders have broadly welcomed the streamlining but the Conservatives have accused Labour of \"ignoring\" communities.",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Rayner told councils to \"get your plans in order\" as the government targets its manifesto pledge to build 1.5 million new homes.",
      "The deputy prime minister said the government will require all councils to formalise developments' plans, the absence of which has caused developments to \"get stuck in the system\".",
      "Rayner continued: \"Because we haven't had these compulsory plans locally, we've seen speculative development where greenbelt land has been developed on... we've told councils they've got to have those plans.",
      "\"If developers follow the national framework, which protects the environment and looks at other elements, then they shouldn't be stuck in the system for years.\"",
      "She pushed back on the suggestion the government is riding roughshod over councils, saying the changes were necessary to bring about what would be the biggest increase in house building since the 1950s.",
      "\"It's going to take a lot of change to deliver that,\" Rayner added.",
      "Tory shadow Treasury minister Richard Fuller said the government's building target is \"reasonable\", but added: \"If you want to achieve that, you've got to bring the people with you, and, unfortunately, Labour seem to be saying that Angela [Rayner] is best and local people can be ignored.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer restated his pledge to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029 despite accepting it could be \"a little too ambitious\".",
      "The fast-track planning process would apply to housing proposals and associated infrastructure such as schools, if they had already been broadly agreed as part of local development plans where councils set out a strategy for land use in their areas.",
      "If the proposals \"comply\" with these plans, the government has said, they could \"bypass planning committees entirely to tackle chronic uncertainty, unacceptable delays and unnecessary waste of time and resources\".",
      "According to government planning statistics, between January and March 2024 only 19% of major applications were determined within the statutory 13-week period and only 38% of minor applications were determined in the statutory eight-week period.",
      "Judge Labour on six targets, Starmer says in major speech",
      "Starmer seeks to take control after bumpy start",
      "Will Keir Starmer be able to meet his new pledges?",
      "The push for more homes may be popular among those voters struggling to get on the housing ladder.",
      "But even small housing projects are often opposed by people living nearby for a variety of reasons, including concerns about the impact on local schools, doctors, roads and parking.",
      "Rayner said ministers across government had been instructed to ensure new infrastructure projects are targeted at areas which will see new housing development.",
      "She added: \"Many people will say, 'I don't mind housing but we don't have the roads, we're already struggling to get a GP appointment'. Fixing those foundations at the same time is crucial to get the buy-in from those local areas.\"",
      "Taking away the option for local people to prevent a development by making a case at a planning committee may result in a political backlash, particularly in rural areas.",
      "Labour has already angered farmers by bringing agricultural land within the scope of inheritance tax, and needs to nurture support outside cities if it is to maintain political strength.",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA) said that, far from planning delays being to blame for holding up house building, a million proposed homes had in fact been agreed in principle by councils in their local strategies but developers had not brought forward plans.",
      "Councillor Adam Hug, housing spokesperson for the association representing councils, said local authorities and communities \"need to be full partners in tackling the housing crisis together\".",
      "He added this could be achieved with \"new development supported by the infrastructure needed to make communities thrive and proper consultation and engagement that can help ensure local people are able to benefit\".",
      "The Home Builders Federation (HBF) said that while \"democratic involvement and oversight of planning\" was a \"fundamental element of the process\" it could be \"very frustrating for applicants to have the principle of development debated over and over again\".",
      "The housing ministry also hopes to streamline the strategic planning process and introduce a requirement for better training for members of planning committees. A Planning and Infrastructure Bill will be introduced next month.",
      "Many in local government and the housebuilding industry believe the now-mandatory target of 1.5 million new homes by 2029 will be impossible to meet.",
      "A Conservative spokesman said the government had \"set a house building 'target' that the OBR has already said they can't achieve because of their own Budget\".",
      "The HBF agreed with the LGA that councils needed more planning resources and also called for more financial help for young home buyers.",
      "Kate Henderson, the National Housing Federation's chief executive, told the BBC reforms were needed to meet the \"massive challenge\" of hitting the government's \"really ambitious\" house-building target.",
      "She said local authorities have to \"plan for the population now and for the population in the future\", and called on government to facilitate coordination across council areas to ensure social and affordable housing is provided as part of any increase in house-building.",
      "Next week the government will announce further reforms by updating England's planning rulebook, the National Planning Policy Framework."

      "It comes as three lead bishops for safeguarding in the Church of England described the speech as \"utterly insensitive\" in a letter to some abuse survivors.",

      "In his speech, Mr Welby told the House of Lords a head had to roll after the publication of the review into the handling of the scandal.",
      "The speech prompted a furious backlash from abuse victims who said it displayed no remorse for the suffering of survivors and said Welby's delivery of jokes had struck a \"frivolous\" tone.",
      "\"The reality is that there comes a time if you are technically leading a particular institution or area of responsibility where the shame of what has gone wrong \u2013 whether one is personally responsible or not \u2013 must require a head to roll,\" the archbishop said in the Lords on Thursday.",
      "\"And there is only, in this case, one head that rolls well enough.\"",
      "He also referred to a 14th century predecessor who had been beheaded, adding: \"I hope not literally.\"",
      "On Thursday, Mark Stibbe, who has previously told the BBC he was groomed and beaten by Smyth in the 1970s, said the archbishop's joke about \"one head\" rolling was \"disturbing\".",

      "Another of Smyth's victims, given the pseudonym Graham Jones in the Makin report, said Mr Welby had got the tone of his speech \"entirely wrong\".",

      "\"I understand that my words - the things that I said, and those I omitted to say - have caused further distress for those who were traumatised, and continue to be harmed, by John Smyth's heinous abuse, and by the far reaching effects of other perpetrators of abuse,\" the statement said.",
      "\"It did not intend to overlook the experience of survivors, or to make light of the situation - and I am very sorry for having done so.",
      "\"It remains the case that I take both personal and institutional responsibility for the long and retraumatising period after 2013, and the harm that this has caused survivors.",
      "He concluded: \"I continue to feel a profound sense of shame at the Church of England's historic safeguarding failures.\"",
      "Joanne Grenfell, Julie Conalty and Robert Springett, Church of England lead bishops for safeguarding, wrote to some abuse survivors after Mr Welby's speech, calling it \"mistaken and wrong\".",

      "\"It was mistaken and wrong. We acknowledge and deeply regret that this has caused further harm to you in an already distressing situation.\"",
      "The letter said the church had \"seriously failed\" to meet its safeguarding obligations \"over many years\" and described Mr Welby's speech as \"the antithesis of all that we are now trying to work towards in terms of culture change and redress with all of you\".",
      "Mr Welby will step down on 6 January, with the Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, taking charge until a permanent replacement is found - a search expected to take around six months.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 18:52:29 GMT",
    "summary": "Scrapping the two-child cap and changes to tax thresholds are among plans for the next financial year.",
    "story": [
      "A vow to scrap the two-child benefit cap and changes to basic and intermediate tax thresholds are among the plans for the Scottish government for the next financial year.",
      "The announcements were made by Finance Secretary Shona Robison as she revealed her tax and spending plans for 2025/26.",
      "Other talking points included an extra \u00a32bn for the NHS and a \u00a3768m investment in affordable homes.",
      "Here are five key takeaways from this year's Scottish Budget.",
      "1. Two-child benefits cap",
      "The biggest announcement in the budget actually isn\u2019t part of the tax or spending plans for next year.",
      "It was Shona Robison\u2019s \u201crabbit out of the hat\u201d moment of announcing that the Scottish government would move to scrap - or offset, or mitigate - the two-child benefits cap.",
      "That\u2019s a UK-wide policy, imposed by the Department of Work and Pensions on welfare payments such as universal credit and child tax credits - so it will take some time, and will need some help from the UK government.",
      "It\u2019s not yet clear what the mechanism will be, how it will work, or how much it will cost.",
      "The Scottish Fiscal Commission says it was only sent the proposal last week, and that it hasn\u2019t had time to cost it; they call it a \u201cfiscal risk\u201d.",
      "But be in no doubt that this is a big challenge to Labour.",
      "It comes days after an announcement on the winter fuel payment also designed to outflank Anas Sarwar\u2019s party and embarrass the UK administration.",
      "If all goes to plan then the SNP government will start sending out payments to families of the 15,000 children affected in April 2026. One month before the next Holyrood election.",
      "Labour says it's willing to listen to ideas, but points out that there is not a penny in the coming year\u2019s budget to support it.",
      "They will surely need to come up with a more substantial response before that election comes much closer.",
      "2. Taxes",
      "There were no big changes to the devolved income tax system in this budget.",
      "There was some tinkering with thresholds, which will have a political impact if not a big financial one.",
      "Robison is increasing the thresholds for the basic and intermediate rates - two of the lower rungs in Scotland\u2019s six-band ladder of taxes.",
      "Because Chancellor Rachel Reeves has frozen those thresholds in the rest of the UK, it means Scots earning less than \u00a330,300 will pay less tax than if they lived in England or Wales.",
      "The difference is less than \u00a330 a year, but it allows Robison to say that 51% of Scottish taxpayers pay less.",
      "One bill that will almost certainly be going up is council tax. But with last year\u2019s one-off freeze on local rates coming to an end, it will be down to your local representatives to decide.",
      "Rather than wielding a stick by imposing any sort of cap, Robison instead sought to guilt local authorities into holding down increases, saying that \u201cwith record funding there is no reason for big increases in council tax next year\u201d.",
      "She says there\u2019s an extra \u00a31bn for local government - but it remains to be seen how much of that councillors will be free to allocate, and how much will fall into ring-fenced areas.",
      "Every year the government says it has increased funding for councils, then councils hit back that it\u2019s not enough, and there\u2019s a row over exactly how much money is enough money.",
      "We will no doubt go around in circles on that until budgets at a local and national level are finalised next year.",
      "3. Spending priorities",
      "The budget totalled more than \u00a363bn, and previously ubiquitous talk of tough decisions and austerity was notably absent. There was a positive tone - like Robison suddenly had some cash to splash on the government\u2019s favourite policies.",
      "John Swinney has made the eradication of child poverty as his top priority, and as ever there is cash in the budget for the flagship Scottish Child Payment.",
      "The cash to mitigate the two-child cap doesn\u2019t feature in this budget - only some money to set up that system, whatever it turns out to look like.",
      "In total, spending on social security is up by \u00a3800m - highlighting a key feature of devolved government, in the SNP\u2019s appetite for big state interventions and welfare safety nets.",
      "You can include in that last week\u2019s announcement about winter fuel payments, which are being partially reinstated from next year.",
      "This week Mr Swinney has also (unsurprisingly) earmarked the NHS as a core priority, and as expected it has a record funding settlement - \u00a321bn, or a third of the total budget.",
      "That includes almost \u00a3200m to cut waiting times and cash for local hospital projects in Edinburgh, Fort William and Airdrie.",
      "There were also billions of pounds for net zero and climate policies - including money from the ScotWind fund, a pot of cash raised by auctioning off plots of the seabed for offshore wind, which Robison had previously feared she might need to use for day-to-day funding.",
      "And there is \u00a3768m for affordable housing, which chiefly goes to reverse a cut made under Humza Yousaf\u2019s administration last year, but does ultimately leave spending higher and will apparently create 8,000 new homes in the coming year.",
      "4. Growing the economy",
      "A big focus of governments across the UK has been economic growth. Rachel Reeves has put it at the core of everything she is doing as chancellor, as Robison said a thriving economy was \u201can essential requirement\u201d.",
      "The finance secretary had been challenged to match the chancellor\u2019s support for firms in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors - a 40% relief on business rates.",
      "Scotland has a slightly different system of \u201cnon-domestic rates\u201d, but ultimately Robison said there would be a similar 40% relief for the vast majority of hospitality premises.",
      "Retail and leisure were notably absent (although there is some support for music venues), and we will see how far this shakes out in terms of who does and doesn\u2019t qualify for funding.",
      "The Scottish Hospitality Group has said it is a \u201csignificantly more restricted\u201d offer than that down south, calling it a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d.",
      "A motif of Ms Robison\u2019s speech was name-checking her cabinet colleagues as she spoke to each of their portfolio areas.",
      "That felt particularly notable in the case of Kate Forbes - an influential figure as the woman John Swinney brought into government in part to mend fences with business.",
      "She has highlighted more money for town centre regeneration as well as a tripling of investment in the offshore wind supply chain, which it is said will leverage ten times that figure in private investment.",
      "This approach of public cash opening the door to huge flows of private funds is a favourite tactic of Ms Reeves - and indeed is the core purpose of GB Energy.",
      "That UK energy firm is set to have some company when it sets up in Aberdeen, with Ms Robison pledging to establish a hub or offshore wind in the North East.",
      "5. Politics",
      "The SNP does not have a majority in the Scottish Parliament, and thus needs the help of other parties to pass a budget.",
      "John Swinney has talked about wanting to reach out to opponents and run a collaborative administration.",
      "But there is no chance of a deal with the Conservatives, who want a billion pounds of tax cuts, or Labour, who really just want an election.",
      "That leaves the Greens and the Lib Dems as the most likely dance partners.",
      "Robison quite deliberately nodded to the key asks of both parties. There was funding for ferries, mental health and dentistry for the Lib Dems. The Greens demanded \u00a34.7bn for green policies - and she pledged \u00a34.9bn.",
      "The Greens welcomed some of the measures, but said \u201csignificant further changes\u201d were needed. They are particularly suspicious of the sums on offer for councils.",
      "The Lib Dems welcomed even more of Robison\u2019s announcements, with leader Alex Cole-Hamilton reeling off a whole series of measures where he said it was right the government had listened to him.",
      "The draft budget is really the starting point for talks, which won\u2019t come to a head until the first votes at Holyrood in February.",
      "But the fevered talk of snap elections which followed the collapse of the Bute House Agreement has faded. A deal with someone still feels the most likely outcome.",

      "But, when asked by Badenoch for details about the new information, he replied: \"I'm not going to disclose private information.\"",

Maybe she'll want to retract that statement.\u201d",
      "Last week, Haigh became the first minister to resign since the Labour government took office in July.",
      "On Thursday evening, Sky News and The Times revealed details of her past conviction.",
      "Haigh subsequently issued a statement giving further details of the incident, which took place in 2013 when she was working for insurance company Aviva.",
      "She said she had reported a mugging to the police and that a work mobile phone was one of the items that had been stolen.",
      "She later said she found the handset in a drawer at home.",
      "Turning on the phone \"triggered police attention\", she said, and the matter was taken to magistrates' court for making a false report to police.",
      "Haigh said: \"Under the advice of my solicitor I pleaded guilty \u2013 despite the fact this was a genuine mistake from which I did not make any gain.\"",
      "She received a conditional discharge six months before becoming an MP in the 2015 general election.",
      "Early on Friday, the morning after the details of the conviction emerged, Haigh sent a resignation letter to the prime minister, saying she did not want to become a distraction.",
      "The BBC has been told by Whitehall sources that she had told Sir Keir about her conviction when he picked her to be in his shadow cabinet in 2020.",
      "She did not tell the government's propriety and ethics team about it when she became a member of the cabinet after Labour won July's general election.",
      "She believed it was sufficient to have disclosed her spent conviction to Sir Keir when Labour was in opposition, the BBC has been told.",
      "On Friday, a Downing Street spokesperson refused to say what Sir Keir knew about the conviction, only that he accepted her resignation after \"further information\" emerged.",
      "The spokesperson was questioned for 25 minutes on the issue but refused to give more details.",
      "A regular briefing with journalists after Wednesday\u2019s Prime Minister Questions was no different, with a Labour spokesperson present simply saying they would not get into \u201cprivate discussions with former cabinet ministers\u201d.",
      "However the BBC understands that some in Downing Street were unhappy Haigh had not run her explanation past them before releasing it to the media on Thursday and felt she should have told senior civil servants about the conviction on becoming a minister.",
      "On Wednesday, Badenoch's spokesperson said: \u201cIt's not good enough to say this is a private matter.\u201d",
      "\"Did he know about the criminal conviction and put her in the Cabinet anyway? Or did he not and that is why he fired her on Friday?",

    "story": [
      "Councils in England facing soaring homelessness costs are urging the government to foot more of the bill, the BBC can reveal.",
      "Local authorities which house people in temporary accommodation generally pay the up-front costs and claim the cash back from central government.",
      "But the cross-party Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils across England, says a 2011 decision to freeze the amount they can claim back has cost them almost \u00a3740m in the last five years.",

      "\u201cYou've seen the dramatic increase in the cost of rents since 2011,\" Adam Hug, the LGA\u2019s housing spokesperson, told the BBC.",
      "\"So it's getting increasingly expensive in a constrained market to find places that are suitable for people to live at costs that councils can afford.\"",
      "That lack of available accommodation options has meant many councils have had to use more expensive options, such as hotels and bed and breakfasts, to house those in need.",
      "Official government data released last week showed a record 123,100 households were in temporary accommodation at the end of June, a 16% rise on last year.",
      "Matt Downie, chief executive of homelessness charity Crisis, told the BBC: \u201cAs more and more people are pushed into homelessness due to rising living costs and sky-high rents, they have nowhere else to go but to their local council, who too often have nowhere to put them but into expensive temporary accommodation that is often unfit for their needs.\u201d",
      "If someone meets the conditions for receiving temporary accommodation, it is often up to their local council to find them somewhere to stay.",
      "The council is then usually reimbursed by the Department for Work and Pensions, using the individual\u2019s benefits.",

      "But the coalition government froze that cap based on 2011 rates and no government has since unfrozen it.",
      "\u201c[Then-Chancellor] George Osborne and his gang decided to pass the buck to local authorities, and try and bear down on the benefits bill at the cost of many other things,\u201d said Hug, who is also the Labour leader of Westminster City Council.",

      "Labour\u2019s general election manifesto promised \u201ca new cross-government strategy, working with mayors and councils across the country, to put Britain back on track to ending homelessness\u201d.",
      "While the chancellor did commit an extra \u00a3230m to combat homelessness in the Budget, no such strategy has yet been launched.",

These are meetings where Sir Keir brings those responsible for each mission into Downing Street to hold them accountable for what the data is showing in their area and asking them how they propose to improve. It\u2019s an idea which was pioneered by Sir Tony Blair on the advice of Michael Barber, his delivery adviser, who recently returned to government.",
      "The frequency of these stocktakes will soon increase, a senior government source said, adding: \u201cIf we are saying that this is the mission of the government and this is how people should judge its success and failure then it is clearly something you need the PM driving through.\u201d",
      "In the next few weeks Pat McFadden, the cabinet minister helping the prime minister to coordinate policy across Whitehall, will give a speech with more detail on the government\u2019s plans for civil service reform.",
      "Both he and Sir Keir are said to be seized of the need to bring more outside expertise into government and to make better use of data and artificial intelligence.",
      "The government\u2019s stated aims here are bold. Announcing the appointment of Sir Chris Wormald this week as the new cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, Sir Keir charged him with \u201cnothing less than the complete re-wiring of the British state\u201d.",
      "There was no shortage of people in Whitehall questioning whether the longest-serving head of a government department  - Sir Chris has run the health department for eight years and education for four before that  - is the right person to transform Whitehall. Sir Chris's supporters say that within the current system he is one of those most open to reform.",
      "The appointment was received with open contempt by Cummings, who sarcastically described it as a \u201ctruly beautiful, artistic\u201d decision which should serve as a \u201cwake up call\u201d that \u201cthe Westminster system is totally determined to resist any change\u201d.",
      "And on that, at the very least, the success of this government depends on Dominic Cummings being wrong."

      "What are the milestones?",
      "All of the milestones are to be completed by the next general election, likely in 2029 - and in the case of clean power, to be \"on track\" for the 2030 deadline.",

      "It's easy to become confused when Sir Keir talks about what his government wants to do.",
      "As we understand it, the six \u201cmilestones\u201d set out today are things he wants voters to judge the government against by 2029, when the next election is likely to be held.",
      "They follow the six \"first steps\" he set out in May, just before the general election was called.",
      "The six milestones are ways to measure the five missions he set out in February 2023.",
      "The missions \u2013 like building an NHS fit for the future \u2013 are meant to be the driving purpose for the government. These are what civil servants have been ordered to prioritise.",
      "All of this is built upon three foundations - economic stability, secure borders and national security, according to Sir Keir.",
      "95% clean power by 2030",
      "The prime minister said being \u201con track\u201d for 95% clean power by 2030 was one of his milestones.",
      "But before and during the election, Labour constantly spoke about \u201czero carbon electricity by 2030\u201d - and this was what the party's manifesto promised.",
      "Sir Keir denied he was rowing back on 100% zero carbon, telling reporters that the \"clean energy pledge is today exactly what it was in the election\" and \"there was always going to be a mix [of energy sources]\".",
      "Is he right?",
      "The 95% clean power figure follows advice from the National Energy Systems Operator (NESO), which recently said a clean power system is one where demand is met by \u201cmainly renewables, with gas-fired generation used rarely to ensure security of supply\u201d.",
      "It says gas should \u201cprovide less than 5% of Great Britain\u2019s generation in a typical weather year\u201d.",
      "Two years ago Sir Keir also acknowledged that fossil fuels may be needed as a \u201cfall back\u201d.",

      "Warning for 'tepid' civil servants",
      "One of the most striking things about the PM's speech was how much of it was aimed at shaking up the civil service.",
      "Too many in Whitehall, he said, were \"comfortable in the tepid bath of managed decline\".",
      "Amid plenty of frustration at the top of his administration about their capacity to drive change, the PM said \"mission-led government\" was not just about delivering changed public services, but also about changing the nature of government itself.",

      "According to calculations by the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focused on living standards, that would be a slightly better performance than the 0.3% average growth in RHDI per person in the previous Parliament.",
      "But it would be worse than just about every other Parliament for decades.",
      "The second measure is GDP (a measure of the size of the economy) divided by the size of the population, which the prime minister says will rise for every region of the UK.",

      "These citizen science researchers, all of them locals, have spotted nearly 3,000 pygmy blue whales over the past 10 years - Prof Edyvane considers that a \u201ctruly extraordinary\u201d number.",
      "Timor-Leste has one of the world\u2019s highest concentrations of marine mammals.",
      "During the migration season - October and November - hundreds of pygmy blue whales pass through the country\u2019s waters as they make the epic journey spanning thousands of kilometres from the Banda Sea, which lies to the north of Timor-Leste, to southern Australia.",
      "But the area has been under-researched, says Prof Edyvane, who started the citizen science monitoring programme in 2014.",
      "During the last two whale seasons, she has based herself in Subaun, about 50km (31 miles) from the capital Dili, working with fishermen, students and dive tour operators to document the cetaceans.",
      "They have documented \"some of the lesser known, intimate reproductive behaviours of blue whales, some for the very first time,\" says Prof Edyvane, a researcher at Charles Darwin University and Australian National University.",
      "In 2022, for instance, tourists with a local tour operator invovlved in the programme captured underwater footage of a mother nursing her calf, offering a glimpse into the species\u2019 reproductive behaviours, which have remained largely unknown.",
      "\"It\u2019s very, very exciting,\u201d she adds.",
      "The programme started as a Facebook group, inviting local tour operators, fishermen and residents to share sightings of cetaceans.",
      "Prof Edyvane trained them on surveying methods and taught them how to use telephoto cameras and drones so that they could conduct aerial and boat surveys.",
      "\u201cWhen locals see the whales swimming by, they will post pictures on Facebook and WhatsApp. Updates come on a real-time basis and when someone shares something, everyone gets very excited,\u201d Prof Edyvane says.",
      "In 2016, the team worked with a dive tour operator to launch the first whale-watching tour.",
      "It was only last year that they set up a \u201cresearch station\u201d outside the da Cunha\u2019s village home - photos show a simple hut overlooking the bay. Outside are two tables, plastic chairs and white boards mounted on the hut's walls.",
      "During this year's whale season, undergraduates from the National University of East Timor and University Oriental Timor-Leste gathered at the research station to help with the sightings.",
      "Even such a basic structure has made the task easier.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re able to monitor all day and all night,\" Prof Edyvane says. \"We\u2019ve also been able to get the most incredible footage. The whales come in so close sometimes we can actually hear their blows.\"",
      "Citizen researchers like these have become powerful eyes and ears on the ground for marine scientists, says wildlife scientist Vanessa Pirotta.",
      "\u201cThe combination of people having access to tools like drones and social media means we have insights into things that are happening while we may be behind the desk writing grants to fund our work,\u201d she said.",
      "The increase in research activity in Subaun has also led to a rise in tourism.",
      "The demand for whale-watching tours has increased, diving instructor Cassio Schumacher tells the BBC, adding that these tours are \u201cbooked up years in advance\u201d.",
      "Local non-profits have warned of the risks of unregulated whale tourism and the government has said it intends to use Prof Edyvane's research  to \u201cfully protect and conserve\" the marine life that pass through Timor-Leste\u2019s waters.",
      "Prof Edyvane believes that with regulation, whale tourism has the potential to create jobs and grow Timor-Leste\u2019s economy.",
      "The country is one of the poorest in the world, where average annual incomes in cities hover around $1,500, according to the International Monetary Fund. In Subaun, most villagers work as subsistence fishermen and farmers, earning just about $600 to $900 a year.",
      "The da Cunha family has now started preparing meals from local produce and the day\u2019s catch for the students and tourists - an additional source of income.",
      "\u201cWe enjoyed having the guests around and will love to do it again,\" Faustino, 51, tells the BBC on a WhatsApp video call.  \"We will make it a better experience [next season].\"",
      "His son, Zacarias, has also been contracted to provide drone services for the project. Prof Edyvane says she plans to train him to give talks about whales in English.",
      "The 26-year-old says what he appreciates is that the visitors are learning to protect the area: \u201cThe university students learn fast and well to defend this area.\"",
      "As for the tourists, he says the locals are happy to teach them. \"We remind tourists not to swim with the whales but instead watch them from a distance.\"",

      "Shepherd J\u00f3zsef R\u00e1cz and his sons keep 500 ewes up on the high pasture here. It\u2019s a hard life: when he\u2019s not worrying about milking his sheep, which he does three times a day, he\u2019s worrying about protecting them from predators.",
      "Each year, J\u00f3zsef loses five or six of his herd to a wolf, or a bear. It\u2019s why he keeps 17 dogs.",
      "\u201cA good dog is the best tool a shepherd has, to protect his flock at night, and in the daytime too,\u201d the farmer says.",
      "On Tuesday, 45 years of strict protection for grey wolves in Europe came to an end, after conservation officials adopted EU measures to downgrade the animal's protected status.",
      "The news means that grey wolves will be moved from Annex II (strictly protected) to Annex III (protected) of the Bern Convention.",
      "This will remove many of the safeguards that have allowed the animals to flourish in Europe and means that from the beginning of March next year, each EU country will be able to set an annual quota of wolves to kill.",
      "The Commission argued that the number of wolves in the EU has almost doubled, from 11,000 in 2012 to over 20,000 today, and that they were causing too much damage to livestock.",
      "The Worldwide Fund for Nature  (WWF) has called the decision \"extremely disappointing\".",
      "\"Wolf populations have barely recovered after going extinct in most parts of Europe, and weakening their protection could jeopardise this fragile recovery,\" said the WWF in a statement.",
      "The organisation also accused the Commission of prioritising political decisions over science, saying the decision was influenced by \"personal reasons after Commission President Von der Leyen\u2019s pony was killed by a wolf in 2022\".",
      "Wildlife campaigners have argued that improved protection methods, including trained sheep dogs, would be a better solution than removing safeguards. They say that wolves keep down numbers of deer and wild boar, which damage trees and crops. Wolves also prevent the spread of diseases by eating sick animals.",
      "In the town of Baile Tusnad, in a valley near J\u00f3zsef\u2019s village, wildlife experts met recently to discuss large carnivores. Most, though not all, oppose the hunting of wolves and bears.",
      "\u201cAfrican swine fever is spreading all over Europe,\u201d said Michal Haring, a biologist from Slovakia, \u201cand the wolf is a very good \u2018doctor\u2019 for this, suppressing the disease. Wolves cannot catch it.\u201d",
      "Another argument against shooting wolves is that they hunt in packs of five to eight, usually a pair and their offspring. If the older wolves are shot, the pack fragments, making it harder for them to catch deer and wild boar.",
      "\u201cIndividual wolves are more likely to attack sheep and other domesticated animals,\u201d Mr Haring explains.",
      "Campaigners also pointed to a 2023 EU report, which states that only around 50,000 of Europe\u2019s 68 million sheep and goats are killed by wolves each year \u2013 0.065% of the total number \u2013 adding that the overall impact of wolves on EU livestock is \u201cvery small\u201d.",
      "Moreover, it says there have been no fatal wolf attacks on humans for 40 years.",
      "\u201cIf we expect countries like India or Indonesia to protect their tigers,\u201d says Laurent Schley, head of the Wildlife department in the Luxembourg government, \u201cand Africans to protect lions and elephants, then we as relatively rich Europeans should be willing to tolerate some wolves.\u201d Luxembourg is one of the few western European countries where no wolves have been sighted yet, Mr Schley believes it\u2019s only a matter of time.",
      "\u201cWe have very high densities of deer and wild boar, so the conditions for the wolf are there.",
      "\"Of course, if individual wolves or packs start killing too much livestock, or were to show aggression towards humans, we would have to draw the line. Human safety always comes first.\u201d",
      "But back on the mountainside, J\u00f3zsef says wolves are dangerous because \u201cthey\u2019re clever animals\u201d. He favours tougher legal measures to cull the predators.",
      "Bears approach through the forest, treading on branches and alerting his dogs, J\u00f3zsef says: if they break into the wickerwork enclosure where his herd stay at night, they will only grab one animal.",
      "If a pack of wolves get in though, they can kill dozens of sheep at a time.",
      "Last year, J\u00f3zsef\u2019s favourite dog, Moody, was killed by wolves, in broad daylight, as they moved from one pasture to the next. All they found was his bloodied pelt.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 03:20:29 GMT",
    "summary": "Its record price is making headlines - but that's just one part of the cryptocurrency's tumultuous story.",
    "story": [
      "The price of Bitcoin has for the first time broken past the $100,000 mark, hitting a new record high.",
      "The value of the world's biggest cryptocurrency has been boosted by hopes US President-elect Donald Trump will adopt crypto-friendly policies.",
      "The milestone was reached hours after Trump said he would nominate former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Paul Atkins to run the Wall Street regulator.",
      "Mr Atkins is seen as being far more pro-cryptocurrency than the current head of the SEC, Gary Gensler.",
      "The $100,000 milestone prompted celebrations from cryptocurrency fans around the world.",
      "Bitcoin's wildly fluctuating value has always attracted interest, with its backers reacting with delight when it has passed previous price thresholds - and defiance during its slumps.",
      "But this particular landmark has been especially keenly anticipated. For weeks charts, memes and predictions have swirled around social media about when the price would hit the figure thought to be one of the holy grails of the crypto world.",
      "Millions of viewers even tuned in to online watch parties as the price hovered close to $100k.",
      "The value of a single bitcoin is one of the barometers of optimism in the cryptocurrency industry which is now estimated to be worth $3.3tn, according to analysis firm Coin Market Cap.",
      "Trump's election victory last month was the catalyst for the latest surge.",
      "The president-elect has vowed to make the US \"the crypto capital of the planet\" - a remarkable turnaround given as recently as 2021 he was calling Bitcoin a \"scam.\"",
      "Also remarkable is just how Bitcoin's price has rocketed. A valuation of $100k represents a 40% increase on election day in the U.S. and more than double the price it started the year at.",
      "But there's lots more to Bitcoin than the dizzying changes in its value.",
      "From its enigmatic inventor to the bringing down of the so-called Crypto King, it's a story with many twists and turns, which has seen the making - and losing - of huge fortunes.",
      "So here's the BBC's list of the seven wildest moments - so far - in Bitcoin's tumultuous history.",
      "1. The mysterious creator of Bitcoin",
      "Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto.",
      "They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email.",
      "Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers.",
      "But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out.",
      "In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be a false lead caused by some mistranslated information.",
      "Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi.",
      "Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him.",
      "2. Making history... with pizza",
      "Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza.",
      "On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas.",
      "A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day.",
      "A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online.",
      "Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin.",
      "The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars!",
      "3. Becoming legal tender",
      "In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender.",
      "Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar.",
      "Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country.",
      "While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped.",
      "He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country.",
      "As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years.",
      "The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country.",
      "It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value.",
      "A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value.",
      "4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust",
      "In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions.",
      "These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part.",
      "Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves.",
      "At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment.",
      "But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts.",
      "Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth.",
      "Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact.",
      "5. Bitcoins in the rubbish dump",
      "Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (\u00a378m) - and then  accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details.",
      "That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him",
      "The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline.",
      "Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling.\"",
      "6. Crypto King fraudster",
      "No-one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community.",
      "FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days.",
      "Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research.",
      "Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: \"I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.\"",
      "After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years.",
      "7. Investment bank boom",
      "Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies.",
      "In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any.",
      "Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs.",
      "It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined.",
      "Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold."

      "'Dark web in your pocket'",
      "Telegram is used by around 950 million people worldwide and has previously positioned itself as an app focussed on its users' privacy rather than the policy norms prioritised by other global social media companies.",
      "But reporting from the BBC and other news organisations highlighted criminals using the app to advertise drugs as well as offer cybercrime and fraud services and, most recently, CSAM.",
      "It led one expert to brand it \"the dark web in your pocket.\"",
      "In August, its billionaire owner was detained at an airport north of Paris.",

      "The company maintains that his arrest is unfair, and that he should not be held liable for what users do on the platform.",
      "Nonetheless, Telegram has since announced a series of changes to the way it operates, including:",

      "Mr Durov has also vowed to \u201cturn moderation on Telegram from an area of criticism into one of praise\u201d.",
      "The partnership with the IWF appears to be the latest step in that process.",
      "The IWF is one of a few organisations in the world that is legally able to search for child sexual content to get it taken down.",
      "Its ever-evolving list of known abuse content is used by websites to detect and block matches to stop it spreading.",
      "Telegram says that before becoming a member of IWF it removed hundreds of thousands of pieces of abuse material each month using its own systems. The IWF membership will strengthen its mechanisms, the company said.",
      "The app is marketed as a fully end-to-end encrypted messaging service - meaning only the sender and recipient of a message can read it - like WhatsApp and Signal.",
      "But in fact the majority of communication is done with standard encryption, raising questions about how secure from hacking and interception it is.",
      "Mr Durov, who was born in Russia and now lives in Dubai, has citizenship in Russia, France, the United Arab Emirates and the Caribbean island nation of St Kitts and Nevis.",
      "Telegram is particularly popular in Russia, Ukraine and former Soviet Union states as well as Iran.",

    "story": [
      "Luxury car maker Jaguar has unveiled its new electric concept car and, like a recent controversial teaser video, it has divided opinion.",
      "Some on social media said the new Type 00 car was \"exciting\" and \"absolutely stunning\", while others called it \"rubbish\" and told Jaguar's designers to \"go back to the drawing board\".",
      "However, the carmaker has suggested the reaction is exactly what it wanted, as it tries to reset its brand to revive sluggish sales.",
      "\"Jaguar needs to be bold and disruptive in order to cut through and get our message across,\" boss Rawdon Glover told the BBC.",
      "He said his goal was to restore Jaguar's image as a luxury brand, while no longer trying to compete by pumping out large numbers of cars.",
      "Jaguar has long been the weakest link within the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) group, which also makes Range Rovers and Land Rover Defenders.",
      "Since 2018, sales have plunged from 180,000 to just 67,000 last year.",
      "Last month, JLR stopped selling new Jaguars in the UK altogether, ahead of its relaunch as an electric-only brand in 2026",
      "The firm also announced a new logo, alongside a so-called \"social media tease\", which featured models dressed in bright colours but no actual vehicles.",
      "Many criticised the advert as \"woke\", with Elon Musk - boss of Jaguar competitor Tesla - asking \"Do you sell cars?\"",
      "Others criticised the change to Jaguar's iconic growling cat badge, which has been altered and no longer appears on the front of the car.",
      "Mr Glover has defended the effort, saying the debate helped to draw \"more eyeballs\" to the firm for this week's unveiling of the new concept car.",
      "\"In that context... the strategy was successful,\" he said.",
      "\"We absolutely don't want to ostracize any of our customer base ... But, as I say, [the] most important thing for us is we need to attract a new audience to Jaguar's brand to make sure that we are safeguarding the next 90 years of Jaguar's future.\"",
      "'Trust and reserve judgement' on rebrand, says Jaguar",
      "JLR halts UK Jaguar sales before electric relaunch",
      "JLR announced the transition to electric vehicles in 2021, keeping all of its three British plants open as part of the strategy.",
      "It said the decision to stop selling new Jaguar cars in the UK last month was a deliberate move to \"create some breathing space\" before unveiling its new look.",
      "The Type 00 model unveiled at a Miami art fair is a concept car and so will not go into production for sale to the public.",
      "Instead, the vehicle, which features an ultra-long bonnet and big wheels, gives a pointer to the direction of the brand's new models.",
      "Mr Glover said Jaguar had \"ripped up the rulebook\" with the new design, which is also intended to evoke Jaguars past when the brand was in its heyday.",
      "The rebrand comes with a higher price point, with Jaguar aiming for the luxury market.",
      "\"Nobody needs a vehicle at \u00a3120,000. You have to want one,\" he said.",

      "But many on social media were nonplussed by the preview.",
      "James May, broadcaster and former presenter of Top Gear, said he was \"slightly disappointed\" by the design and its price.",
      "\"I wanted something more futuristic,\" he told the BBC. \"I mean, Jaguar have been saying they will copy nothing, but there's quite a bit of other concept cars in that new Jag.\"",
      "May said Jaguar cars had traditionally been \"very reasonably priced compared with, for example, Aston Martin\".",
      "\"So I'd like to see something more like half the price that they're toting at the moment.\"",
      "'Too big'",
      "Beatrix Keim, director at the Center of Automotive Research, said that Jaguar's concept car was \"too big, too unreal\".",
      "\"This is not the way to go,\" she said, given that there are already big cars in the market and \"electric cars cannot only be for the rich\".",
      "\"Of course, Jaguar is a luxury brand,\" she added. \"But I don't think that this is the direction which Jaguar at current point of time needs, because it's losing out on volume as well. And this is not a volume car.\u201d",

      "Game developers have been hit by slowing demand after the pandemic - but some are also concerned about the impact of AI on jobs.",
      "Advances in the technology have the potential to allow many of the mundane parts of game development to become automated.",

      "Its handheld consoles haven't historically fared as well as its home offerings, and the CEOs wouldn't be drawn on whether there may be a new PlayStation Portable (PSP) in the future.",
      "But Mr Nishino said the way players play games is changing, and pointed to its handheld PlayStation Portal - a cross between a controller and a screen - which he said has been \"a huge success\".",

      "He pointed to 2018's God of War, which is being developed as a show for Amazon Prime, as his favourite PlayStation game from the past 30 years.",

      "It has proved to be a runaway success, with Sony's four home consoles prior to the PlayStation 5 each becoming one of the top ten best-selling gaming machines in history. The PS5 is on its way to joining them, too.",

      "He's certain to play a decisive part in defining Syria's new order after this sudden stunning end to a half century of repressive rule by the Assad family.

      "Live updates: Syrian rebels capture Damascus, saying Assad has fled",
      "Watch: BBC reports from inside Damascus",
      "What just happened in Syria?",
      "\"The story is not written yet,\" cautions Marie Forestier, senior Syria advisor for the European Institute of Peace. She, and other informed observers who happened to be attending the annual Doha Forum, point out that it was another rebel group, recently named as the Southern Operations room, working with people living in the city, who surged into the capital. The ranks of this force are dominated by fighters from the former Free Syrian Army (FSA), who worked closely with western powers at the start of Syria's 2011 uprising,",
      "\"The game starts now,\" is how Ms Forestier describes the start of this momentous new chapter marked by an explosion of celebration in the streets, but also critical questions about what emerges next.",
      "As the Islamist Hayat Tahrir-al Shams (HTS) pushed forward with astonishing speed, facing scant resistance, it sparked a rush by rebel forces in other regions of Syria as well as a surge of armed local groups keen to play a part in their own areas.",
      "\"Fighting the Assad regime was the glue that kept this de facto coalition together\", says Thomas Juneau, Middle East expert at the University of Ottawa's Graduate School of Public and International Affairs, who is also in Doha.",
      "\"Now that Assad has fled, continued unity among the groups that toppled him will be a challenge,\" he says.",
      "The groups include an umbrella alliance of Turkish-backed militias known as the Syrian National Army who, like the HTS, dominated a corner of northwest Syria. In the northeast, the mainly Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) groups have also gained ground and will be determined to hold on to their gains.",
      "But HTS's ambitious high-profile leader has seized the spotlight. His rhetoric and record are now under scrutiny by Syrians, as well as in neighbouring capitals, and far beyond. The commander whose militia first emerged as an Al-Qaeda affiliate broke ranks with the jihadist group in 2016 and has been trying to polish his image since then. For years, he's sent conciliatory messages abroad; now he is reassuring Syria's many minority communities they have nothing to worry about.",
      "\"There is a cautious welcome to his messages,\" maintains Ms Forestier. \"But we cannot forget the past eight years of his authoritarian rule and his background.\" The rule of HTS, both a political and paramilitary organisation, in the conservative province of Idlib was marked by the establishment of a working administration called the Salvation Government, which included limited freedom of religion, but was also marked by repressive measures.",
      "In Syria's second city of Aleppo, the first urban area seized by HTS in its lightning advance, its fighters have been trying to prove they are fit to rule.",
      "The group has also been sending reassuring messages to countries like Iraq that the war would not spill across their borders. Other neighbours, including Jordan, worry that Islamist successes next door could galvanise disgruntled militant groups within their borders. Turkey, certain to play a key role, has its own worries. It regards the SDF as a terrorist group linked to Turkey's proscribed PKK Kurdish group and will not hesitate to intervene militarily and politically, as its done for years, if its own interests are threatened.",
      "Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, had told the Doha Forum on Saturday that it was \"inadmissible\" that a group he called terrorists, a clear reference to HTS, could take control in Syria.",
      "By the evening, the UN's Special Envoy for Syria, Geir Pederson, told me there was a \"new understanding of a new reality.\"",
      "Regional foreign ministers, including President Assad's former staunch allies Iran and Russia, left wrong-footed by this spectacular turn of events, are still calling for efforts to forge an inclusive political process. That's echoed by Mr Pedersen.",
      "\"This dark chapter has left deep scars, but today we look forward with cautious hope to the opening of a new one\u2014one of peace, reconciliation, dignity, and inclusion for all Syrians\", he said after his meetings here in Doha, where halls packed with senior diplomats, scholars, and officials from the world over are buzzing with the latest news from Syria.",
      "Many observers here seem reluctant to draw quick conclusions about what kind of rule will emerge in a country known for its diversity of Christian and Muslim sects.",
      "\"I don't want to go down that line of thinking yet,\" said one Western diplomat asked about any concerns regarding a harsh Islamist-dominated order. \"We're just getting started with HTS, who have led a bloodless coup.\"",
      "Juneau agrees. \"For now, it is good to simply appreciate the truly historical collapse of one of the most brutal regimes of the past decades,\" he said.",

      "As rebel forces have swept across Syria, they have freed prisoners from government jails as they went.",
      "Throughout the civil war, which began in 2011, government forces held hundreds of thousands of people in detention camps, where human rights groups say torture was common.",
      "On Saturday Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) said it had freed more than 3,500 detainees from Homs Military Prison as the group took over the city.",
      "As they entered the capital hours later early on Sunday, HTS announced an \"end of the era of tyranny in the prison of Saydnaya\", which has become a by-word for the darkest abuses of Assad's era.",
      "In a 2022 report, ADMSP said Saydnaya \"effectively became a death camp\" after the start of the civil war.",
      "It estimated that more than 30,000 detainees had either been executed or died as a result of torture, lack of medical care or starvation between 2011 and 2018. Citing accounts from the few released inmates, at least another 500 detainees had been executed between 2018 and 2021, it said.",
      "In 2017, Amnesty International described Saydnaya as a \"human slaughterhouse\", in a report that alleged that executions had been authorised at the highest levels of the Assad government.",
      "The government at that time dismissed Amnesty's claims as \"baseless\" and \"devoid of truth\", insisting that all executions in Syria followed due process.",
      "Video cited by Reuters showed rebels shooting the lock off Saydnaya prison gate and used more gunfire to open closed doors leading to cells. Men poured out into the corridors.",
      "Other footage, which the Reuters news agency says was taken on the streets of Damascus, appears to show recently-freed prisoners running down the street.",
      "In it, one asks a passer-by what happened.",
      "\"We toppled the regime,\" they respond, eliciting an excited laugh from the former prisoner.",
      "Of all the symbols of the repressive nature of the Assad regime, the network of prisons into which those expressing any form of dissent were disappeared cast the longest and darkest shadow.",
      "In Saydnaya, torture, sexual assault and mass execution were the fate of thousands. Many never re-emerged, with their families often not knowing for many years whether they were alive or dead.",
      "One of those who survived the ordeal, Omar al-Shogre, told the BBC on Sunday about what he endured during three years of incarceration as a teenager.",
      "\"I know the pain, I know the loneliness and also the hopelessness you feel because the world let you suffer and did nothing about it,\" he said.",
      "\"They forced my cousin whom I loved so much to torture me and they force me to torture him. Otherwise we would both be executed.\"",
      "A Syrian human rights network estimates that more than 130,000 people have been subjected to detention in these conditions since 2011. But the history of these intentionally terrifying institutions goes back much further.",
      "Even in neighbouring Lebanon, the fear of being disappeared to a Syrian dungeon was pervasive during the many years that Damascus was the dominant foreign power.",
      "The deep hatred of the Assad regime - both father and son - that simmered under the surface in Syria  was due in large part to this industrial-scale mechanism of torture, death and humiliation that was intended to frighten the population into submission.",
      "For that reason, rebels factions in their lightning drive through Syria that toppled President Assad made sure in each city they captured to go to the central prison in each one and release the thousands held there.",
      "The image of these people emerging into the light from a darkness that had shrouded some for decades will be one of the defining images of the downfall of the Assad dynasty",

      "Not long after buying and publicly consuming a $6.2m banana as part of an artworld stunt, Chinese crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun made another eye-catching purchase, investing $30m ($23.5m) into a cryptocurrency firm called World Liberty Financial.",
      "The company had foundered since its October launch, investors seemingly leery of its prospects and its terms.",
      "But it boasted a potentially enticing feature: the chance to do business with a firm partnering with and promoted by none other than Donald Trump.",
      "Mr Sun's investment tipped the company over the threshold that allowed the president-elect to begin profiting from the venture. Trump and his family are now in the position to collect roughly $20m - and potentially far more.",
      "Mr Sun, who is currently fighting fraud charges in the US related to his own crypto business, did not respond to questions about what prompted his interest in the tokens, which cannot be traded.",
      "But the episode set off alarm bells among government ethics experts, who see it as an indication that Trump's expanding business ventures have made it easier than ever for those hoping to influence US policy to steer money his way.",
      "\"The conflicts have grown substantially with the scope of his business empire,\" said Richard Painter, who served as the White House's chief ethics lawyer during the George W Bush administration.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, Trump's team shrugged off the worries.",
      "In his first term, \"President Trump removed himself from his multi-billion-dollar real estate empire to run for office and forewent his government salary,\" Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said.",
      "\"Unlike most politicians, President Trump didn't get into politics for profit \u2013 he's fighting because he loves the people of this country and wants to make America great again.\"",
      "But Trump has taken little action in response to concerns about the potential for corruption, or appearance of it, as he prepares for a return to the White House.",
      "New opportunities",
      "Trump has faced questions about conflicts of interest before.",
      "During his first term as president, the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC became a symbol of the issue, as a go-to place for lobbyists, foreign diplomats, and allies to stay and spend.",
      "Critics argued that the hotel created a way for Trump to profit indirectly from his office. He faced accusations and lawsuits alleging he violated the US Constitution's ban on presidents receiving foreign emoluments \u2013 or profiting from their office.",
      "But experts said the growth of his business empire, which now includes a publicly traded social media company, a cryptocurrency firm, and ties to a Saudi-backed golf league, makes it possible for anyone hoping to curry favour to move money more quietly and in much greater sums.",
      "\"The scale has increased and the ease has increased,\" said Michael Ohlrogge, a law professor at New York University, who has studied Trump Media, which operates Truth Social and currently represents the bulk of Trump's $6bn fortune. \"You can only book so many hotel rooms.\"",
      "On Truth Social, for example, Prof Ohlrogge said a foreign government or business could purchase ads convincing investors the firm was gaining traction, prompting a pop in its share price.",
      "Though Trump Media commands a market value of more than $7bn, there has been little sign of such activity so far. The company reported less than $5m in ad sales this year.",
      "But given the stock market's \"amplifying\" effect, Prof Ohlrogge said it would not require a lot of spending to lead to potentially significant gains for Trump, who owns more than half the shares of the company.",
      "\"His pro-crypto stance\"",
      "Nowhere is the entanglement between Trump's business interests and his public duties as stark as in the crypto industry, where he has deepened his personal involvement, while simultaneously promising to champion it while in the White House.",
      "His plans include regulatory rollback and ideas such as a national Bitcoin reserve, in which the government would stockpile the cryptocurrency.",
      "\"One of the most important issues to be determined over the next couple years is how crypto is regulated,\" said Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel at the nonpartisan Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \"Well now, he's an active player in the crypto market. How it could be regulated [could] affect his personal wealth, what kind of position he takes.\"",
      "Nik Bhatia, founder of Bitcoin Layer, a firm that advocates investments in Bitcoin, said it would be a mistake to dismiss Trump's stance on crypto as driven only by his own financial interests.",
      "\"I don't see these moves motivated by self-interest - I see them representing the electorate,\" he said.",
      "But still, he said: \"I think there probably is a conflict of interest in that his pro-crypto stance will benefit his company.\"",
      "This week, Trump said he would nominate Paul Atkins, who has lobbied for the industry, to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).",
      "He is widely expected to dial back enforcement at the agency, which polices publicly traded firms such as Trump Media for issues such as fraud and insider trading. The SEC oversaw a crackdown on the crypto industry under President Joe Biden.",
      "Mr Sun, the World Liberty Financial investor, was caught up in the SEC crackdown last year, after the agency charged him and his company with failing to properly register with the government while selling certain digital assets, among other charges.",
      "Under new leadership, the agency could very well drop the case, said John Coffee, a professor at Columbia Law School and an expert in securities law.",
      "\"The leading characteristic of Mr Atkins is that he does not like enforcement and wants to greatly restrict the range of cases the SEC will bring,\" he said.",
      "In announcing his investment last month, Mr Sun did not mention the SEC complaint - which he has said lacks merit - but did cite Trump's views on crypto.",
      "\"The U.S. is becoming the blockchain hub, and Bitcoin owes it to @realDonaldTrump!\" he wrote on X. \"TRON is committed to making America great again and leading innovation. Let's go!\"",
      "Fewer guardrails",
      "There is little in US law that sets limits on conflict-of-interest - presidents are not bound by the same rules that regulate other government employees and cabinet officials.",
      "Though the US Constitution in theory bars presidents from taking presents from foreign governments while in office, the Supreme Court already has dismissed two previous lawsuits from Trump's first term involving potential conflicts of interests.",
      "Last summer, in a case involving Trump, it also ruled that presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution while in office.",
      "In the past, Trump has argued that his business was actually hurt by his time in the White House, as partners worried about controversy cut ties, and he faced investigations and lawsuits.",
      "Now preparing to enter the White House a second time, Trump has yet to unveil an ethics plan, as is customary, and has given little sign he plans to bow to such concerns.",
      "He has vowed to hold onto his Trump Media stake, continues to hawk Trump-branded merchandise and lend his name to ventures like World Liberty Financial.

    "summary": "Long-standing frustrations were revealed online after a health insurance executive was shot and killed in New York City.",
    "story": [
      "The \"brazen and targeted\" killing of health insurance executive Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare, outside a New York hotel this week shocked America. The reaction to the crime also exposed a simmering rage against a trillion-dollar industry.",
      "\"Prior authorisation\" does not seem like a phrase that would generate much passion.",
      "But on a hot day this past July, more than 100 people gathered outside the Minnesota headquarters of UnitedHealthcare to protest against the insurance firm's policies and denial of patient claims.",
      "\"Prior authorisation\" allows companies to review suggested treatments before agreeing to pay for them.",
      "Eleven people were arrested for blocking a road during the protest.",
      "Police records indicate they came from around the country, including Maine, New York, Texas and West Virginia, to the rally organised by the People's Action Institute.",
      "Unai Montes-Irueste, media strategy director of the Chicago-based advocacy group, said those protesting had personal experience with denied claims and other problems with the healthcare system.",
      "\"They are denied care, then they have to go through an appeals process that's incredibly difficult to win,\" he told the BBC.",
      "The latent anger felt by many Americans at the healthcare system - a dizzying array of providers, for profit and not-for-profit companies, insurance giants, and government programmes - burst into the open following the apparent targeted killing of Thompson in New York City on Wednesday.",
      "Thompson was the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, the insurance unit of health services provider UnitedHealth Group. The company is the largest insurer in the US.",
      "Police are still on the hunt for the suspected killer, whose motivation is unknown, but authorities have revealed messages written on shell casings found at the scene.",
      "The words \"deny\", \"defend\", and \"depose\" were discovered on the casings, which investigators believe could refer to tactics which critics say insurance companies use to avoid payouts and to increase profits.",
      "A scroll through Thompson's LinkedIn history reveals that many were angry about denied claims.",
      "One woman responded to a post the executive had made boasting of his firm's work on making drugs more affordable.",
      "\"I have stage 4 metastatic lung cancer,\" she wrote. \"We've just left [UnitedHealthcare] because of all the denials for my meds. Every month there is a different reason for the denial.\"",
      "Thompson's wife told US broadcaster NBC that he had received threatening messages before.",
      "\"There had been some threats,\" Paulette Thompson said. \"Basically, I don't know, a lack of [medical] coverage? I don't know details.\"",
      "\"I just know that he said there were some people that had been threatening him.\"",
      "A security expert says that frustration at high costs across a range of industries inevitably results in threats against corporate leaders.",
      "Philip Klein, who runs the Texas-based Klein Investigations, which protected Thompson when he gave a speech in the early 2000s, says that he's astonished the executive didn't have security for his trip to New York City.",
      "\"There's lot of anger in the United States of America right now,\" Mr Klein said.",
      "\"Companies need to wake up and realise that their executives could be hunted down anywhere.\"",
      "Mr Klein says he's been inundated with calls since Thompson was killed. Top US firms typically spend millions of dollars on personal security for high-level executives.",
      "In the wake of the shooting, a number of politicians and industry officials expressed shock and sympathy.",
      "Michael Tuffin, president of insurance industry organistion Ahip, said he was \"heartbroken and horrified by the loss of my friend Brian Thompson\".",
      "\"He was a devoted father, a good friend to many and a refreshingly candid colleague and leader.\"",
      "In a statement, UnitedHealth Group said it had received many messages of support  from \"patients, consumers, health care professionals, associations, government officials and other caring people\".",
      "But online many people, including UnitedHealthcare customers and users of other insurance services, reacted differently.",
      "Those reactions ranged from acerbic jokes (one common quip was \"thoughts and prior authorisations\", a play on the phrase \"thoughts and prayers\") to commentary on the number of insurance claims rejected by UnitedHealthcare and other firms.",
      "At the extreme end, critics of the industry pointedly said they had no pity for Thompson. Some even celebrated his death.",
      "The online anger seemed to bridge the political divide.",
      "Animosity was expressed from avowed socialists to right-wing activists suspicious of the so-called \"deep state\" and corporate power. It also came from ordinary people sharing stories about insurance firms denying their claims for medical treatments.",
      "Mr Montes-Irueste of People's Action said he was shocked by the news of the killing.",
      "He said his group campaigned in a \"nonviolent, democratic\" way - but he added he understood the bitterness online.",
      "\"We have a balkanised and broken healthcare system, which is why there are very strong feelings being expressed right now by folks who are experiencing that broken system in various different ways,\" he said.",
      "Mr Tuffin, head of the health insurance trade association, condemned any threats made against his colleagues, describing them as \"mission-driven professionals working to make coverage and care as affordable as possible\".",
      "The posts underlined the deep frustration many Americans feel towards health insurers and the system in general.",
      "\"The system is incredibly complicated,\" said Sara Collins, a senior scholar at The Commonwealth Fund, a healthcare research foundation.",
      "\"Just navigating and understanding how you get covered can be challenging for people,\" she said. \"And everything might seem fine until you get sick and need your plan.\"",
      "Recent Commonwealth Fund research found that 45% of insured working-age adults were charged for something they thought should have been free or covered by insurance, and less than half of those who reported suspected billing errors challenged them. And 17% of respondents said their insurer denied coverage for care that was recommended by their doctor.",
      "Not only is the US health system complicated, it's expensive, and huge costs can often fall directly on individuals.",
      "Prices are negotiated between providers and insurers, Ms Collins says, meaning that what's charged to patients or insurance companies often bears little resemblance to the actual costs of providing medical services.",
      "\"We find high rates of people saying that their healthcare costs are unaffordable, across all insurance types, even (government-funded) Medicaid and Medicare,\" she said.",
      "\"People accumulate medical debt because they can't pay their bills. This is unique to the United States. We truly have a medical debt crisis.\"",
      "A survey by researchers at health policy foundation KFF found that around two-thirds of Americans said insurance companies deserve \"a lot\" of blame for high healthcare costs. Most insured adults, 81%, still rated their health insurance as \"excellent\" or \"good\".",
      "Christine Eibner, a senior economist at the nonprofit think tank the RAND Corporation, said that in recent years insurers have been increasingly issuing denials for treatment coverage and making use of prior authorisations to decline coverage.",
      "She said premiums are about $25,000 (\u00a319,600) per family.",
      "\"On top of that, people face out-of-pocket costs, which could easily be in the thousands of dollars,\" she said.",
      "UnitedHealthcare and other insurance providers have faced lawsuits, media investigations and government probes over their practices.",
      "Last year, UnitedHealthcare settled a lawsuit brought by a chronically ill college student whose story was covered by news site ProPublica, which says he was saddled with $800,000 of medical bills when his doctor-prescribed drugs were denied.",

      "By 3pm, most of the protesters had converged in front of the National Assembly. The main thoroughfare was packed with people sitting in neat rows, as police officers lined the street.",
      "Protest flags fluttered in the cold winter breeze, while in the side streets vendors sold waffles and pastries stuffed with red-bean paste to hungry protesters.",
      "It was a diverse crowd made up of young students, office workers and retirees. Police estimated around 100,000 people showed up.",
      "With rock bands, large screens and crane cameras, South Korean protest rallies tend to resemble outdoor music festivals, and this one was no different. Throughout the afternoon, the crowd was entertained by jolly acapella tunes, sentimental folk songs, and protest anthems.",

      "\"Impeach! Impeach!\" the crowd chanted back.",

      "\"We are not going to back down until he is impeached\u2026 we will march on until our democracy finally triumphs over this madness done by this crazy president.\"",
      "Onstage, the protest leaders called on the crowd to surround the National Assembly. They hoped that by blocking the gates and trapping PPP lawmakers inside, they could buy the opposition enough time to persuade enough PPP members to vote for impeachment.",
      "The crowd surged forward to the gates. As protest leaders read out the names of every PPP lawmaker, protesters chanted \"Go back in, vote!\" after each name.",

      "But there were ominous signs. Kim told reporters that he had in fact voted against impeachment. And for hours, nobody else from the PPP joined.",
      "Finally, at about 9pm, the Speaker said he would close the vote early. Immediately, the festive mood evaporated. The impeachment bill needed just five more votes to proceed, but they were nowhere in sight - and time was running out.",
      "The crowd pressed closer to the gates. \"Go in, go in!\" they pleaded, urging PPP lawmakers to re-enter the chamber to vote.",
      "At 9.20pm, the speaker closed the vote. The crowd went silent as they watched parliamentary officials sift through the ballots.",
      "Some let out disappointed groans, while a few screamed angrily at the screens. The usual chant of \"impeach, impeach\" floated through the air, but it seemed to have lost its vigour.",
      "The speaker announced the bill could not pass. It did not meet the quorum of 200 votes for counting. In the crowd, a woman let out a pained cry and buried her face in her partner's chest, sobbing.",
      "The protest leaders rushed to the stage, this time to rally people's spirits.",
      "\"We will not stop until Yoon is punished. The people will not accept the existence of PPP. We will fight till the end, till Yoon is impeached,\" vowed one speaker. \"Dear people, will you join us in our fight to remove Yoon?\"",

      "Meanwhile, inside the National Assembly, opposition leaders vowed to table the impeachment bill again and again until they got rid of Yoon. They have the public on their side: three quarters of South Koreans want an impeachment, according to the latest polls, while Yoon's approval rating has slid even further to just 13%.",
      "In an attempt to end on a high note, the protest leaders played All I Want for Christmas as a send-off. \"Don't forget your belongings, and please take your rubbish with you,\" they urged the dispersing crowd, as Mariah Carey's voice echoed down the rapidly emptying avenue.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 19:39:02 GMT",
    "summary": "The IAEA agency says Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme has \"spawned in every direction\" over the last decade.",
    "story": [
      "The head of the UN nuclear watchdog has told the BBC Iran's decision to begin producing significantly more highly enriched uranium was \"very worrisome\".",
      "Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said Iran was increasing its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60%, just below the level of purity needed for a nuclear weapon.",
      "This will be seen by many in the region as Tehran's response to its military and diplomatic setbacks in Syria, Lebanon and Gaza in recent months.",
      "Mr Grossi said it was \"no secret\" some politicians in Iran were calling for the development of a nuclear weapon - but after holding talks in Tehran in recent weeks, he said that \"doesn't seem to be the path of choice\" by the current leadership.",
      "Mr Grossi was speaking on the margins of the Manama Dialogue conference in Bahrain run by the London-based think tank, the International Institute for Strategic Studies.",
      "He warned Israel against attacking Iranian nuclear facilities, saying the consequences would be \"very, very serious indeed\" in terms of Tehran's retaliation and the potential spread of radiation.",
      "He also said it was \"extremely concerning\" that more countries were thinking of acquiring nuclear weapons and that the public conversation about their use had become \"normalised\".",
      "In a report to IAEA governors on Friday, Mr Grossi said his inspectors had confirmed Iran was feeding more partially enriched uranium into the cascades of two centrifuges at its Fordow nuclear plant south of Tehran.",
      "\"The facility's updated design information showed that the effect of this change would be to significantly increase the rate of production of UF6 (uranium) enriched up to 60%,\" the report said. It assessed the facility would produce 34kg (75lb) of 60% uranium per month compared previously with 4.7kg.",
      "The IAEA had demanded further \"safeguard measures\" at Fordow \"as a matter of urgency to enable the agency to provide timely and technically credible assurances that the facility is not being misused to produce uranium of an enrichment level higher than that declared by Iran, and that there is no diversion of declared nuclear material\".",
      "Iran denies having a military nuclear programme. But Mr Grossi told the BBC its nuclear energy facilities had increased over the last decade.",
      "\"They have a nuclear programme that has grown, has spawned in every possible direction.",
      "\"The Iran of 2015 has nothing to do with Iran of 2025. Iran is starting production of 60% [uranium] at a much higher level of production, which means they will have the amounts necessary - if they so choose - to have a nuclear device in a much faster way. So we see an escalation in this regard, which is very worrisome.\"",
      "On a visit to Tehran last month, Mr Grossi said he had been given an assurance by Iranian leaders that they would limit their production of 60% enriched uranium.",
      "Iran's decision to increase production comes after little progress was made in nuclear talks between European and Iranian officials last week.",
      "Mr Grossi said there were groups in Iran that were \"very vocal\" calling for the country to \"do its own thing\" on nuclear weapons.",
      "\"In my conversations with the government, that doesn't seem to be the path of choice, but they sometimes refer to this as something they might need to reconsider. I hope not. I have told them this would be a regrettable choice.\"",
      "Israel has not yet launched a full-scale attack on Iran's nuclear facilities - but its ministers have openly discussed the possibility.",
      "Asked about the consequences of any such Israeli attack, Mr Grossi said: \"I don't think this would go without an answer, militarily speaking, so I think we need to avoid this.",
      "\"One should not forget that a big part of the nuclear programme in Iran is underground and very well protected. So kinetic action against the programme would require a vast deployment of force.",
      "\"I just hope that we are not going to get there. I know the radiological consequences if you attack a nuclear facility.\"",
      "Mr Grossi also warned that the world's nuclear non-proliferation regime was under stress, as established nuclear powers \"seem to be relying more on nuclear weapons or modernising their arsenals\".",
      "As a result, other nations were talking more about acquiring nuclear weapons.",
      "\"There are countries saying: well, why not us? If we see that we have a world... with new conflicts, the big [countries] are saying that perhaps they might use the nuclear weapons they have, maybe we should think about our own security.\"",

      "Online bidding started a month ago, with the slippers expected to fetch as much as $3m (\u00a32.35m) at auction, according to Heritage Auctions - an under-estimate by $25m (\u00a320m).",
      "The auctioneers called the slippers the \"Holy Grail of Hollywood memorabilia\" and said their selling price made them the most valuable movie memorabilia ever sold at auction.",
      "The winning bid prompted applause in the auction room in Dallas, with the sale coinciding with a renewed interest in the musical following the recent release of the prequel movie Wicked.",
      "Garland was only 16 when she played Dorothy in the classic 1939 musical The Wizard of Oz. Media outlet Variety ranked it second in its inaugural list of \"100 Greatest Movies of All Time\".",
      "The film is a musical adaptation of L Frank Baum's 1900 children's book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. While in the book, the magical slippers are silver, the producers for the film changed them to red to take advantage of the new Technicolor technology.",
      "In the film, as in the book, a pivotal moment occurs when Dorothy must click her heels three times as she repeats \"There's no place like home\" in order to leave the magical land of Oz and return to Kansas and her Auntie Em.",
      "While several pairs of shoes were worn by Garland during filming, only four are known to have survived.",
      "One of the pairs is on exhibit at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. But this pair up for auction has its own unique history.",
      "Collector Michael Shaw had loaned the slippers out to the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids, Minnesota, when they were stolen in 2005.",
      "Professional thief Terry Jon Martin used a hammer to smash the glass case and snatch the slippers, believing that their insured value of $1m must be because they were covered in actual gemstones.",
      "But when he took them to a \"fence\" - an intermediary who sells stolen goods to discreet buyers - he discovered they were just glass.",
      "So he gave the shoes to someone else. It wasn't until 2018 that the FBI recovered the shoes in a sting operation. What happened to them in those 13 years is still not known.",
      "In 2023, Martin - who was in his 70s and used a wheelchair - pleaded guilty to stealing them, and was sentenced to time served.",
      "\"There's some closure, and we do know definitely that Terry Jon Martin did break into our museum, but I'd like to know what happened to them after he let them go,\" John Kelsch, curator of the Judy Garland Museum, told CBS News Minnesota in 2023.",
      "\"Just to do it because he thought they were real rubies and to turn them over to a jewelry fence. I mean, the value is not rubies. The value is an American treasure, a national treasure. To steal them without knowing that seems ludicrous.\"",

    "story": [
      "Romania's constitutional court has annulled the result of the first round of voting in the presidential election just days before the second round was due to take place.",
      "It means the process will be restarted from scratch, with the government due to decide a date for a new vote.",
      "The first round was won by Calin Georgescu, an almost unknown far-right Nato-sceptic who has previously praised Vladimir Putin.",
      "The court's decision comes after intelligence documents were declassified, suggesting Georgescu benefitted from a mass influence operation \u2013 conducted from abroad \u2013 to interfere with the result of the vote.",
      "Hours after the court's decision, Georgescu told a Romanian TV channel that the country's democracy was \"under attack\", describing the verdict as a \"formalised coup d'etat\".",
      "He said he would \"go forward through the voting process\", implying that he would try to run again for president, though it's far from clear that that will be possible.",
      "Outgoing Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu said the court's decision to annul was \"the only correct solution after the declassification of the documents... which show that the result of the Romanians' vote was blatantly distorted as a result of Russia's intervention\".",
      "In an address on Friday evening, current President Klaus Iohannis confirmed he would remain in the role until a new president was elected.",

      "However, the court has decided to ask the government to rerun the entire electoral process, and therefore the electoral campaign.",
      "Last week, the court had ordered a recount of votes cast in Sunday's first round following allegations that social media platform TikTok gave \"preferential treatment\" to the surprise winner, Calin Georgescu.",

      "Georgescu, a radical with no party of his own, campaigned mainly on TikTok. The platform said it was \"categorically false to claim his account was treated differently to any other candidate\".",
      "He won 23% of the vote, with 19%, Elena Lasconi, of the opposition Save Romania Union and Ciolacu of the governing Social Democrats in third.",

      "\"We cannot tolerate a Muslim family living right in front of our local temple. This is also a question of the safety of our women,\" she said.",

We cannot allow people from another faith to come and live here. We will not allow them to enter and continue to protest as long as they don't go away,\" she added.",
      "Many of the residents also visited the district magistrate's office to lodge a complaint. Outside, they shouted slogans against Dr Bajaj and the Muslim couple.",
      "The protests have had their intended effect. On Friday, Dr Bajaj told the BBC that a resolution, mediated by the city's elected representative, had been reached and the new Muslim owners would re-sell the house to a Hindu family already living in the housing society.",
      "Dr Bajaj, who runs an eye hospital in the city and had lived in the society for more than six years, said he had sold the house to the Muslim couple who are both doctors and that their families had known each other for 40 years.

    "published": "Mon, 09 Dec 2024 00:05:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Cuba's hotels, already hit by power cuts, worry that Trump may increase the US's economic blockade.",
    "story": [
      "With winter nights drawing in across North America, Canadian \u201csnowbirds\u201d \u2013 citizens who flee their freezing temperatures for sunnier climes every year \u2013 are planning their annual trips to Florida or the Caribbean.",
      "Traditionally, Cuba has been hugely popular among Canadians, drawn to the pristine white sands of beach resorts like Varadero.",
      "They fill the void left by Americans wary of the travel restrictions imposed on them under the continuing US economic embargo of the largest island in the Caribbean.",
      "Figures show that almost one million Canadian tourists visited Cuba last year, the top country of origin for visitors by some margin.",
      "As such, a recent decision by the Canadian tour operator, Sunwings Vacations Group \u2013 one of Cuba\u2019s leading travel partners \u2013 to remove 26 hotels from its Cuba portfolio is a blow to the island\u2019s struggling tourism industry.",
      "Sunwings took the decision after Cuba endured a four-day nationwide blackout at the end of October, caused by failures with the country's aging energy infrastructure.",
      "This was followed by another national power cut last month, when Hurricane Rafael barrelled its way across the island, worsening an already-acute electricity crisis.",
      "A third countrywide blackout then happened on Wednesday, 4 Dec, after Cuba's largest power plant broke down.",
      "\u201cCuba has had some volatility in the last few weeks and that may shake consumer confidence,\u201d Sunwings\u2019 chief marketing officer, Samantha Taylor told the Pax News travel website last month.",
      "\u201cThere are incredible places to go in Cuba,\u201d she stressed, keen to emphasise that the company isn\u2019t pulling out of Cuba altogether. \u201cBut we also recognise that if clients are a little uncomfortable, we need to give them options.\u201d",
      "Specifically, that involved drawing up a list of what they called \u201chidden gems\u201d \u2013 alternative holiday destinations in the Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and Colombia.",
      "The implications for Cuba are clear.",
      "With tourism now the island\u2019s principal economic motor, and the main source of foreign currency earnings after remittances, that an important tour operator is pointing its customers towards other countries\u2019 beaches over crumbling energy infrastructure is a real concern.",
      "\u201cOur message to Canadians is that tourism is one of the economy\u2019s priorities,\u201d said Lessner G\u00f3mez, director of the Cuban Tourism Board in Toronto in a statement. \u201cThe Ministry of Tourism has been preparing for the winter season to deliver better services, uninterrupted supplies, a better airport experience, and more and new car rentals.\u201d",
      "While Cuba\u2019s tourism agency tries to ease fears about the extent of the electricity blackouts, few can deny that these have been extremely difficult months on the island. Hurricane Rafael was only the latest storm to hit Cuba in a frenetic Atlantic hurricane season in which more powerful and more frequent storms are the new normal.",
      "Of course, severe weather is a problem across the Caribbean. But for Cuba, there are other complications in play.",
      "Donald Trump\u2019s re-election to the White House and his choice for Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, stand to make life even more complicated for Cubans than it already is.",
      "\u201cThis is probably the Cuban Revolution\u2019s hardest moment,\u201d says former Cuban diplomat, Jes\u00fas Arboleya. \u201cAnd unfortunately, I see nothing on the horizon whatsoever which allows for an optimistic view of the future of US-Cuba relations.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump has handed US policy towards Cuba to those sectors of the Cuban American right who have essentially lived off anti-Castro policies since their origins.\u201d",
      "Mr Arboleya adds that Marco Rubio, currently a US Senator for Florida, is the leading voice among them. He is a Cuban American long opposed to the communist government in Havana.",
      "His parents were Cubans who moved to the US in 1956, three years before Fidel Castro seized power, but his grandfather fled the Castro-led turn to communism on the island.",
      "\u201cPeople are horrified by the idea of another Donald Trump presidency. It spells real trouble,\u201d echoes Cuban political commentator and editor of Temas magazine, Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez.",
      "Current US policy towards Cuba is \u201csomewhat schizophrenic\u201d, he argues.",
      "\u201cOn the one hand, the State Department facilitates support to the private sector, and [pushes for] economic changes in Cuba. But on the other hand, Congress and Senate seem to freeze any advances on those reforms.\u201d",
      "The expectation is, however, that a future Secretary of State Rubio will coalesce the US\u2019s Cuba policy around a single idea - maximum pressure on the island by tightening the already-harsh sanctions.",
      "Cubans fear that could mean the suspension of commercial flights to Cuba, or even the closure of the US Embassy in Havana, which was officially reopened in 2015 after decades of frosty relations.",
      "If implemented, such steps would be deliberately designed to further harm Cuba\u2019s floundering tourism trade, the aim to hit the communist-run nation when it\u2019s down. Tourist numbers to Cuba have almost halved since the high point of nearly five million visitors during the Obama-era d\u00e9tente with Cuba.",
      "Between 2015-2017 US visitors flocked to the island under more relaxed travel restrictions, keen to experience a country that had long been denied them. Around the same time, the Cuban government embarked on a major hotel-building spree, confident that demand would remain strong over the next decade.",
      "However, there followed a double blow to Cuban tourism from which it hasn\u2019t fully recovered. First, the Trump Administration rolled back President Obama\u2019s engagement policies, and then the Covid-19 pandemic sent the industry into freefall.",
      "With many of those hotels now registering much lower occupancy rates than originally predicted, and real difficulties in providing the five-star customer experience as advertised amid the blackouts and shortages, some question the strategy of putting so many eggs in the tourism basket in the first place.",
      "\u201cWhy has Cuba invested 38% [of government funds] on average over the past decade in hotels and infrastructure connected to international tourism, but only 8 to 9% on energy infrastructure?\u201d asks economist Ricardo Torres at the American University in Washington DC. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense. The hotels run on electricity.\u201d",
      "Even with all the current challenges, most visitors agree that Cuba remains a unique travel experience. The cliches \u2013 classic cars, cigars and mojitos \u2013 still appeal to many, while others prefer to travel the island absorbing its history, culture and music.",
      "Yet as tour operator Sunwings\u2019 decision to step back shows, some tourists are finding it hard to appreciate Cuba during its energy crisis, especially if it\u2019s about to be exacerbated by a hostile administration \u2013 and Secretary of State \u2013 in Washington."

    "title": "How a uranium mine became a pawn in the row between Niger and France",
    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 01:56:57 GMT",
    "summary": "France's nuclear giant has lost control of its uranium mining operations in the West African state.",
    "story": [
      "In the latest sign of a dramatic deterioration in relations, Niger's military rulers appear increasingly determined to drive France out of any significant sector in their economy - and particularly uranium mining.",
      "This week the French state nuclear company Orano announced that the junta - which deposed France's ally, President Mohamed Bazoum, in a coup in July 2023 - had taken operational control of its local mining firm, Soma\u00efr.",
      "The company's efforts to resume exports have for months been blocked by the regime and it is being pushed into financial crisis.",
      "And the impact could be felt more widely - although Niger accounts for less than 5% of the uranium produced globally, in 2022 it accounted for a quarter of the supply to nuclear power plants across Europe.",
      "So the timing could hardly be more awkward, as Western countries struggle to meet the challenge of climate change and cut their carbon emissions from electricity generation.",
      "For French President Emmanuel Macron, already wrestling with political crisis at home, the potential departure of Orano from Niger is certainly awkward in image terms.",
      "For it coincides with bruising news from other long-standing African partners - Chad has suddenly announced the ending of a defence agreement with Paris, while Senegal has confirmed its insistence on the eventual closure of the French military base in Dakar.",
      "But in any case, the crisis facing Orano in Niger represents a significant practical challenge for French energy supply.",
      "With 18 nuclear plants, totalling 56 reactors, which generate almost 65% of its electricity, France has been ahead of the game in containing carbon emissions from the power sector.",
      "But the country's own limited production of uranium ended more than 20 years ago.",
      "So, over the past decade or so, it has imported almost 90,000 tonnes - a fifth of which has come from Niger. Only Kazakhstan - which accounts for 45% of global output - was a more important source of supply.",
      "The continuing paralysis, or the definitive shutdown, of Orano's operations in Niger would certainly force France to look elsewhere.",
      "This should be achievable, as alternative supplies can be obtained from countries including Uzbekistan, Australia and Namibia.",
      "Last year, as West African neighbours responded to the coup in Niger by imposing a trade blockade that paralysed uranium exports, other suppliers readily stepped into the breach.",
      "The European Union's imports of the mineral from the country plunged by a third, but these were largely replaced by Canada.",
      "But there was also a politically awkward price to pay. EU imports of uranium from Russia rose by more than 70%, despite the heavy sanctions imposed on Moscow because of its invasion of Ukraine.",
      "And of course, it is Russia which has become the new best friend of the military leaders who have seized power in Niger and its allied neighbours, Burkina Faso and Mali, since 2020.",
      "Russian military contractors fight alongside the Malian army in its campaign against jihadists and ethnic Tuareg separatists, while they also help to protect the senior leadership of the juntas in Niger and Burkina Faso.",
      "So although France, and Europe more generally, would be able to find ways to cope with a definitive loss of Niger's uranium supply, the shift would not be entirely comfortable.",
      "In the short-term at least, EU states would probably become more reliant on Russia and its central Asian neighbours, thus undermining their own effort to maintain economic pressure on President Vladimir Putin during a potentially crucial period in the Ukraine crisis.",
      "Moreover, Niger's regime, whose attitude towards the EU as a whole has become almost as mistrustful as its broken relationship with France, continues to seek alternatives to its old Western partnerships.",
      "And Iran - a potential customer, of course, for uranium - has emerged as an option.",
      "Contacts between the two governments have deepened, with Niger's Prime Minister Ali Mahamane Lamine Zeine visiting Tehran in January. Rumours of a possible deal for the supply of uranium \"yellowcake\" (concentrate) briefly circulated a few months ago.",
      "Meanwhile, the outlook for Orano's hopes of restoring normal uranium operations and exports from Niger look dim, given the hostile attitude of the military regime in Niamey.",
      "That antipathy is partly explained by Macron's vocal condemnation of the July 2023 overthrow of Bazoum, who had been one of his closest African political and security partners.",
      "Paris firmly endorsed the tough stance of the West African regional grouping Ecowas, and there were even rumours that it might have been ready to provide tacit support had the bloc ever gone ahead with its short-lived threat to intervene militarily in Niger to reinstate Bazoum.",
      "In this poisonous atmosphere of hostility and mistrust, Orano was an obvious and convenient target for junta retaliation.",
      "The French company's predominant role in the uranium sector had for years fuelled resentment among many Nig\u00e9riens, amidst claims that the French company was buying their uranium on the cheap, despite periodic renegotiations of the export deal. Although the mining operations only started years after independence, they were seen as emblematic of France's ongoing post-colonial influence.",
      "After last year's coup, Orano itself tried to stay out of the diplomatic row, keep a low profile and carry on operating normally.",
      "But the Ecowas trade blockade prevented it from exporting the output from the Soma\u00efr mine, near Arlit, in the Sahara Desert.",
      "And even after the sanctions were lifted in late February, the usual uranium export route, via Benin's port of Cotonou, remained blocked, because the junta kept the border closed in an ongoing political row with Benin.",
      "Orano offered to fly the uranium out, but the regime shunned this suggestion.",
      "In June the junta cancelled the French company's rights to develop a new mine at the large Imouraren deposit, which had been seen as the uranium sector's principal new hope for future growth.",
      "Meanwhile, the export blockage was pushing Soma\u00efr, which by November was sitting on 1,150 tonnes of blockaded stocks of uranium concentrate worth $210m (\u00a3165m), into financial crisis.",
      "And when Orano decided to halt further production and prioritise the payment of workforce salaries, relations with the government deteriorated further into this week's almost total breakdown.",
      "Of course, it is not just the company but also Niger's economy that pays a price for this situation, in lost export earnings and risking hundreds of jobs.",
      "For Arlit and other communities in the desert north, this would be a devastating blow, despite talk of revived activity at a Chinese mining project in the region and some interest in the sector among other potential partners.",
      "But Niger's junta feels no need to make concessions to Orano because it is now buoyed by a sharp rise in oil exports, thanks to a new Chinese-built pipeline.",
      "With that financial cushion, the regime appears prepared to bear the cost of paralysing and probably dismantling the traditional uranium partnership with France - now its main international opponent.",

    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 01:10:18 GMT",
    "summary": "Shanthi tried her best to create a sense of normality for her children on the remote British island Diego Garcia.",
    "story": [
      "It's morning in a makeshift camp on the remote British island of Diego Garcia, and Shanthi's husband has just awoken to find their young children staring through a security fence.",
      "As the children watch an officer and guard dog patrol the secretive island, home to a strategic UK-US military base in the middle of the Indian Ocean, they make a stark remark: \"Even the dogs have more freedom than us.\"",
      "\"When I heard that I felt heartbroken,\" he says.",
      "It was a scene that captured their family's predicament - they were stranded on a mysterious military fortress by accident, yet had a son and daughter, aged five and nine, to raise.",
      "In an effort to find normality in the tiny camp they were housed in under constant surveillance, the family found ways to entertain themselves, to study, grow food and celebrate special occasions.",
      "Shanthi, not her real name, says they had paid $5,000 (\u00a33,900) in savings and given all of her gold jewellery to smugglers for an ambitious journey to Canada, more than 12,000 km away, with dozens of other Sri Lankan Tamils.",
      "They all said they were fleeing persecution in Sri Lanka and India, some because of links with the former Tamil Tiger rebels who were defeated in the civil war that ended in 2009.",
      "The fishing boat they were in leaked in rough seas, prompting their rescue by the Royal Navy who took them in October 2021 to Diego Garcia - and they were placed in the fenced-off migrant camp. Shanthi remembers her son asking if they had arrived in Canada.",
      "Her young children received no formal education on the island for the first six months there so, as a trained teacher, Shanthi began giving English lessons to the children in the camp.",
      "\"We started with the basics - the alphabet, nouns, verbs, present continuous,\" she says.",
      "Shanthi's husband later built a writing desk out of wooden pallets so the children could do homework in the tent.",
      "The children soon began to complain of boredom in the evenings so Shanthi - who had trained in Bharatanatyam, an Indian classical dance - began giving dance lessons, too, playing music downloaded from her phone.",
      "Three years after the family first arrived in the camp, they were finally sent to the UK this week in what the government described as a \"one off\" case in the interests of their welfare.",
      "\"It's like an open prison - we were not allowed to go outside, we were just living in a fence and in a tent,\" Shanthi, aged in her early 30s, says in an interview on the outskirts of London.",
      "\"Every day our life was the same.\"",
      "It was like living \"in a cage,\" she adds.",
      "While guards watched and military jets occasionally roared overhead, Shanthi and the other Tamils approached British forces on the island with a letter asking to be sent to a safe country. It marked the first time that asylum claims had ever been filed in the territory.",
      "This sparked a lengthy legal battle 6,000 miles away in the UK, and while that took its course, Shanthi and the others stuck there, took matters into her own hands.",
      "While the Tamils were not allowed to cook their own food, the camp was full of coconut trees, and Shanthi and others used the husks to line planters in which they grew their own vegetables - chilli, garlic and cucumber.",
      "\"They would sometimes give us red chilis so we dried them in the sun and collected the seeds and then grew them. In the salad sometimes we'd get cucumber so we collected the seeds and kept them in the sunlight and after they dried they would grow,\" she says.",
      "Every day, they would make sambol - a popular Sri Lankan side dish - by mashing the coconut and chilli.",
      "They struggled to eat the American food served to them from the base, and would put the vegetables in hot water with garlic and chilli to try to make curries.",
      "With limited access to clothing, particularly for the 16 children in the camp, Shanthi and other women stitched dresses from bed sheets. Come Christmas time, they turned paper napkins into flowers, and cut moon and star shapes out of food containers to decorate a tree.",
      "Relations with the guards that watched over them were often tense, but at Diwali, Shanthi says an \"officer with a good heart brought us a biryani\". On another occasion, a guard brought a cake for her son, who had been counting down the days to his birthday.",
      "But as time went on, Shanthi says, the feelings of helplessness grew.",
      "Life in the camp was to exist in a bubble - news of major wars breaking out in Ukraine and the Middle East trickled through from the guards watching over the migrants, but they were kept away from the base and consumed by their own lives.",
      "Access to the island, part of the Chagos Archipelago, is heavily restricted. It has officially had no resident population since the early 1970s when the UK evicted all the people living there so it could develop the strategic base.",
      "\"From day one until we left, every day we were living with rats,\" Shanthi says. \"Sometimes the rats would bite our children - their legs, fingers and hands. They stole our food. At nights sometimes they would crawl over our blankets and our heads.\"",
      "Giant coconut crabs and tropical fire ants would also crawl into the camp.",
      "During storms, rain water would pour in through holes in the tents, which had previously been used for Covid patients in the pandemic.",
      "When United Nations investigators visited the camp late last year, the children told them they dreamed of going for a picnic, riding a bike or eating an ice cream.",
      "At one point earlier this year, a medical official described the camp as being in \"complete crisis\", with mass self-harming and incidents of attempted suicide.",
      "\"My daughter was watching everything that happened. She'd say 'mum they've cut themselves. Should I cut myself?' So I'd say 'no, no. You can't do anything. I'll protect you. Come and listen to some music, come and take some paper and just draw,'\" she recalls through tears.",
      "Both she and her husband sob as they talk about the two times their daughter self-harmed.",
      "\"Both times I felt really bad and couldn't process it. When she did this, she told me she did it because she hoped if she died her parents and her brother would go to a safe third country,\" Shanthi says.",
      "There were also cases and allegations of sexual assault and harassment within the camp by other migrants, including against children.",
      "\"Over three years we suffered so much. I don't know how we survived,\" Shanthi says.",
      "Throughout the Tamils' time on the island, British authorities acknowledged that it was not a suitable place for them, and said they were looking for long-term solutions. The government said the group's wellbeing and safety was the \"top priority\".",
      "Shanthi says the happiest moment in the camp came recently when officials announced that they would be brought to the UK, where they would be given the right to remain for six months. Shanthi says no one in the camp slept that night.",
      "Upon arriving in the UK, Shanthi says she was struck by \"the cold\" - and it felt like waking from a coma. She had forgotten how to download apps, send WhatsApp messages or pay in shops.",
      "Her children talk of starting school, making friends and riding a double-decker bus.",
      "But the family's long-term future remains uncertain. They have now filed asylum claims in the UK in hopes of remaining. If unsuccessful, they will likely be returned to Sri Lanka.",
      "The UK agreed earlier this year to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius in a historic move. Under the deal, which has still to be signed, Diego Garcia would continue to operate as a UK-US military base but Mauritius would take responsibility for any future migrant arrivals.",
      "Shanthi brought a shell with her from Diego Garcia to remember her time there. One day, she plans to put it on a chain and wear it around her neck.",

    "summary": "It has been a steep fall for the 25-year-old batter, once hailed as Indian cricket's 'next big thing'.",
    "story": [
      "Last month, Rishabh Pant became the most expensive player in the history of the Indian Premier League (IPL) as he was signed by Lucknow SuperGiants for 27 crore rupees (\u00a32.54m) at the mega auction in Saudi Arabia.",
      "But it was the news of Prithvi Shaw - Pant's Delhi Capitals teammate - going unsold that grabbed more attention.",
      "Among those seated in the auction in positions to make bids were Sourav Ganguly and Ricky Ponting, who had been closely associated with Shaw in his years with Capitals, as also Rahul Dravid, who was coach when India won the under-19 World Cup under Shaw in 2018.",
      "Their disinterest was telling. Shaw found no takers.",
      "Ironically, just nine months earlier, before the start of the 2024 IPL season, it was Pant whose career looked in jeopardy.",
      "A horrific car crash in December 2022 had left him with multiple life-threatening injuries. But showing iron will, great determination and self-discipline, Pant fought his way back from what seemed a dead-end to his career.",
      "Pant faced the challenges of IPL 2024 head-on and excelled, earning a rapid recall to international cricket. He was part of the T20 World Cup-winning squad. Dominating the domestic season, he impressed in the domestic Duleep Trophy, paving the way for a sensational return to Test cricket. Against Bangladesh, he lit up the field with a scorching century.",
      "Shaw, meanwhile, under pressure after a couple of poor IPL seasons, has lurched from one crisis to another.",
      "His indifferent form in IPL 2024 saw him lose his place in the playing XI mid-season. A spate of low scores in the current domestic season saw him lose his place in the Mumbai Ranji Trophy team too. And an outright rejection in the IPL mega auction has brought his career to the precipice of a premature end.",
      "It's been a mighty tumble for the 25-year-old, who not too long ago, was touted as the 'next big thing\u2019 in Indian cricket.",
      "Shaw hit the headlines in November 2013 as a 14-year-old when he smashed 546 runs for Rizvi Springfield in the Harris Shield, a prestigious school cricket tournament. It was the highest score in the world in minor cricket then.",
      "Sachin Tendulkar, India\u2019s most celebrated cricketer, had retired only a week earlier, and Shaw earned an instant comparison with the maestro.",
      "Tendulkar's spectacular rise to eminence following his world record 664-runs partnership with Vinod Kambli in a school game way back in 1987, had inspired quite a few batting prodigies, especially from Mumbai. Shaw was one of them.",
      "A short and stocky opening batsman, Shaw did not have the technical virtuosity Tendulkar had even as a teenager. But he had a gift of timing, and took the attack to the bowlers with such panache that selectors were instantly enamoured.",
      "He was fast-tracked into first-class cricket, like Tendulkar, scoring a century on debut in the domestic Ranji and Duleep Trophy, which hardened comparisons between the two.",
      "In late 2018, he got a Test call-up against the West Indies. Shaw hit 134 off just 154 deliveries, studded with rifle-shot drives, cuts and pulls. He was barely 19. Only Tendulkar among Indians had scored his maiden Test century at a younger age.",
      "Touted as a worthy successor to Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, Shaw had the world at his feet. But he's been on a slippery slope since.",
      "Six years after his sensational debut he played in only four more Tests. Add six ODIs and a solitary T20i, it still makes for a dismal aggregate of international appearances for a batsman whose precocity had promised a long, dazzling career.",
      "An unfortunate foot injury, which saw him being sent back from the tour of Australia in 2020 was the start of Shaw's problems. Later that year, he tested positive for a banned substance and was lucky to get away with a light sentence. Thereafter his batting form started declining steadily, touching excellence agonisingly infrequently to impress selectors.",
      "Meanwhile stories of Shaw getting embroiled in wild parties and brawls started to spread. By the middle of IPL 2024, he was on notice, as it were. After the IPL 2025 mega auction, his career seems engulfed in uncertainty.",
      "Injury, illness, and poor form can derail even the best, but those close to Shaw reveal that misfortune has played only a minor role in his precarious downfall.",
      "Ricky Ponting, who as Delhi Capitals coach worked closely with Shaw, says: \"There's only so much [advice] you can give and only so many times you can try [to sort him out] .\"",
      "Former India batsman Praveen Amre, who was assistant coach with Delhi Capitals was more direct. \"Prithvi\u2019s inability to handle IPL fame and money has been his undoing.

    "published": "Sat, 07 Dec 2024 01:18:02 GMT",
    "summary": "President Yoon Suk-yeol's martial law announcement left many Koreans with one thought: not again.",
    "story": [
      "Koh Jae-hak can still vividly remember when he saw soldiers gunning down a group of young women in cold blood.",
      "It was April 1960. Students had launched protests calling for the resignation of the dictatorial president Syngman Rhee. Mr Koh was working in a government building when he looked out of the window and saw protesters clashing with police.",
      "\"There were demonstrations from various universities, and they all gathered in front\u2026 that's when shots were fired,\" the 87-year-old said. Days later, martial law was declared.",
      "South Korea is widely considered a peaceful beacon of democracy in Asia, but that wasn't always the case. This is a country that saw 16 bouts of martial law during its first four decades ruled largely by dictators.",
      "It is why democracy is now deeply treasured by South Koreans as a hard-won right. It is also why President Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration of martial law this week \u2013 the first to happen in 45 years and during democratic rule - was particularly triggering and prompted such a visceral response.",
      "Almost immediately, lawmakers jumped out of bed and rushed to the national assembly, clambering over fences to reverse martial law.",
      "Hundreds of ordinary citizens gathered to hold back troops who had been ordered to throw out MPs.",
      "Some soldiers, apparently unwilling to carry out their orders, reportedly dragged their feet in clearing the crowd and entering the building.",
      "When Yoon declared martial law on Tuesday night, he said it was necessary to get rid of \"pro-North anti-state\" forces. Initially, it caused confusion with some South Koreans who believed there was a genuine threat from the North.",
      "But as they continued watching Yoon's televised announcement, many grew sceptical. He gave no evidence of such forces at work, nor explained who they were. As Yoon had previously used similar language to describe the opposition that had been stymying his reforms, the public concluded he was actually trying to crush his political foes.",
      "Previous periods of martial law had also been justified by leaders as necessary to stabilise the country, and sometimes stamp out what they alleged were communist subversives planted by North Korea.",
      "They curtailed freedom of press and freedom of movement. Night curfews and arrests were common.",
      "Violent clashes sometimes took place, most indelibly in 1980, when then President Chun Doo-hwan extended martial law to deal with student protesters calling for democracy in the southern city of Gwangju. A brutal military crackdown was launched, and it has since been labelled a massacre \u2013 while the official death toll is 193, some experts believe hundreds more died.",
      "South Korea eventually transitioned to democracy in 1988, when the government held its first free and fair presidential election following mounting public pressure. But the preceding decades had permanently and profoundly shaped the nation's consciousness.",
      "\"Most Koreans have trauma, deep trauma, about martial law,\" said Kelly Kim, 53, an environmental activist. \"We don't want to repeat the same thing over and over.\"",
      "Ms Kim was a young child when martial law was last in place and has little memory of it. Still, she shudders at the thought of it returning.",
      "\"The government would control all the media, our normal activities. I'm working in civil society, so all our activities, like criticising the government, would not be possible under the martial law. So that's really horrible.\"",
      "Fear, fury and triumph: Six hours that shook South Korea",
      "'We had to stop this': Woman who grabbed South Korean soldier's gun speaks to BBC",
      "Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea's scandal-hit president who declared martial law",
      "The freedoms afforded by democracy have not just led to a thriving civil society.",
      "In the more than 35 years since that first democratic election, South Korea's creative industries have flourished, with its dramas, TV shows, music and literature becoming world famous. Those creative industries have turned their own lenses onto the country's past, bringing history to life for those too young to remember.",
      "The country has seen a proliferation of shows about its dictatorship past, immortalising incidents such as the Gwangju uprising in popular culture.",
      "Some were blockbusters featuring South Korea's biggest stars, such as last year's 12.12 The Day, a historical drama starring popular actor Hwang Jung-min. The movie depicts the political chaos that took place in 1979 as martial law was declared following the assassination of then president Park Chung-hee.",
      "\"As soon as I saw the images [of Yoon's declaration of martial law], it reminded me of that movie\u2026 it made me question, are we about to repeat that history now?\" said Marina Kang, a 37-year-old web designer.",
      "\"Korea's got a wealth of visual representational works [of that era] in films and documentaries. Though we only have indirect experience of the horrific past through these works\u2026 that still makes me feel very strongly that such events should not happen again.\"",
      "Among younger citizens, there is a sense of disbelief that it could have returned. Despite never knowing life under martial law, they have been taught by their parents and older relatives to fear it.",
      "\"At first [when I heard Yoon's announcement], I was excited at the thought of getting a day off from school. But that joy was fleeting, and I was overwhelmed by the fear of daily life collapsing. I couldn't sleep,\" said 15-year-old Kwon Hoo.",
      "\"My father was concerned that under martial law, he wouldn't be able to stay out late even though his work required him to\u2026 when he heard the news about the possibility of a curfew being imposed again, he started swearing while watching the news.\"",
      "Not all South Koreans feel this way about their past.",
      "\"The vast majority of Koreans appreciate democracy enormously and regret the authoritarianism of the post-war period,\" said Mason Richey, associate professor of international politics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul.",
      "But, he added, \"the country remains very divided regarding numerous aspects of the authoritarian past, notably how justified certain repressive measures were in order to prevent communist subversion.\"",
      "There is the view among a significant portion of the population, especially among older folk, that martial law was necessary in the past for stability and democracy.",
      "\"Back then, it was a time defined by ideological warfare between democracy and communist socialism,\" said Kang Hyo-san, 83. He was sitting next to his friend Mr Koh in a cafe at Gwanghwamun, Seoul's main square and focal point for the city's protest rallies.",
      "The competing ideologies would lead to clashes and \"when the military intervened, the situation would stabilise\u2026 it was a process to restore order and properly establish free democracy.",
      "\"Given the circumstances, we couldn't help but view it positively,\" he said, adding that he felt each period of martial law left the country in a more \"favourable\" position. Martial law in South Korea \"fundamentally differed\" from other nations, where it \"wasn't about killing people or senseless violence\", he insisted.",
      "But this time, it's different. Both octogenarians felt that Yoon's declaration of martial law was unacceptable. \"Even though we've experienced martial law many times throughout our lives, this time there's no justification for its declaration,\" said Mr Koh.",
      "Like them, Ms Kim, the environmental activist, was glad Yoon did not succeed and democracy prevailed in the end. \"Because we fought so hard to get it, right? We don't want to lose it again.",
      "\"Without democracy and freedom of living, what is life?\"",

    "published": "Sat, 07 Dec 2024 05:02:32 GMT",
    "summary": "Fans of CID, one of India's longest-running TV shows, are thrilled about its much-anticipated comeback.",
    "story": [
      "\"Daya, darwaaza tod do.\" (Daya, break down the door)",
      "Most Indians will instantly recognise this dialogue from the popular detective show CID, which ran from 1998 to 2018, making it one of India's longest-running television shows.",
      "The whodunnit featured three intrepid policemen - ACP Pradyuman, inspector Daya and inspector Abhijeet - solving case after case, as no criminal was ever a match for them. The low-budget episodes had comically simple plots, iffy acting, and all it took for a suspect to confess was a good slap from ACP Pradyuman.",
      "But over the years, the show has achieved cult status, and its characters and dialogues have spawned a wealth of jokes, memes and reels.",
      "CID is set to return later this month, sparking mixed reactions among its fans. Some are eager to see the three policemen back in action but others say that the show's old-world charm might not fit in with the gritty realism of modern-day crime shows.",
      "Over the past few days, the creators of the show have been releasing teasers for upcoming episodes on Instagram, each garnering hundreds of thousands of likes and comments.",
      "Apart from the three main characters, the teasers feature familiar tropes and dialogues. These include Inspector Daya kicking open doors to reveal a suspect's hideout and ACP Pradyuman muttering his iconic line, 'kuch toh gadbad hai, Daya' (something's not right, Daya), signaling to both his team and the audience that a crime has taken place.",
      "Trisha Shah, 35, a content creator from Mumbai and a fan of the show, says that the teasers make her nostalgic.",
      "\"CID was one of the few crime shows on television back then and my parents didn't mind me watching it because of its family-friendly content,\" Ms Shah says.",
      "\"Despite being a crime show, it never showed gruesome violence, sexual crimes, foul language or anything that was not suitable for family viewing.\"",
      "In an interview to Film Companion, an entertainment journalism platform, one of the writers of the show said that they even avoided giving surnames to the characters to avoid hurting anyone's sentiments.",
      "But the show's outlandish plots more than made up for its primness, whether that was ACP Pradyuman coming back from the dead or inspector Daya single-handedly manoeuvring a poison-gas filled plane to safety.",
      "In an interview to Forbes magazine, the producer of the show, BP Singh, described these scenes and plots as \"believable nonsense\".",
      "\"You may later laugh at it [the scene]. But for those five minutes, it is so engrossing that you don't mind it,\" he told the magazine.",
      "In a rather comical fashion, the characters would also explain plots and technologies used to solve crimes through their dialogues, making it easy for even children to grasp what was happening.",
      "\"The bad guys always got caught and that was comforting to watch,\" Ms Shah says. \"I don't think I'll enjoy the show today, but back then, it was a big deal.\"",
      "In the 1990s, TV was a big deal as it was the only form of home entertainment. At the start of the decade, India eased broadcasting rights, making more channels available.",
      "\"Initially, channels like Star began showing reruns of American shows like Baywatch and The Bold and The Beautiful. But new entrants like Zee TV and Sony began producing original shows to cater to the Indian audience,\" says Harsh Taneja, an associate professor of media at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.",
      "Producers often adapted Western shows for Indian audiences by importing format Bibles -  guidelines outlining story structure - and modifying them for local context, he says. So, a show like CID often featured plots that closely resembled those of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, an American crime drama.",
      "The 1990s and 2000s saw television become a staple in households as people's spending power grew. Many homes had not just one but two televisions, leading producers to create content targeting different age groups, says Mr Taneja.",
      "Interestingly, the target audience of CID, when it was released in the 1990s, was children in the age group of six to 14. After CID, several other crime-focussed shows began to populate channels - from Crime Patrol to Savadhan India. But one could say that it was CID that created an appetite for crime shows among viewers.",
      "Priya Ravi, 40, remembers waiting eagerly for each CID episode to air when she was a child. She confesses that it was the show that made her push her parents to get a television set at their home.",
      "\"Episodes used to air twice a week, and initially I used to go to a friend's place to watch them. But then I convinced my parents to get a TV so that I could watch the episodes at home. I was so happy the day the TV arrived,\" Ms Ravi says.",
      "She says that though she won't watch the new CID episodes, she'll definitely encourage her two children, aged seven and nine, to watch them.",
      "\"If the show remains as clean as it was back in the day, I think it's a great way to introduce children to some of the realities of life and make them vigilant about their safety and surroundings,\" she says.",
      "\"I'm looking forward to the heroic trio making a comeback.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 07 Dec 2024 02:48:51 GMT",
    "summary": "Atti\u00e9k\u00e9 has been honoured with a Unesco heritage title, which should see the delicious dish protected.",
    "story": [
      "Ivory Coast's national dish atti\u00e9k\u00e9 has gained UN cultural heritage status, along with Japanese sake, Thai prawn soup and Caribbean cassava bread. But what makes this West African staple so popular? BBC Africa correspondent Mayeni Jones grew up in Ivory Coast and is a self-professed superfan.",
      "One of my earliest childhood memories is hearing vendors sing \"Atti\u00e9k\u00e9 chaud! Atti\u00e9k\u00e9 chaud!\" or \"Hot atti\u00e9k\u00e9!\" as they strolled the streets of my neighbourhood, balancing large baskets of this national delicacy on their heads.",
      "Fast-forward 25 years and women carrying individually wrapped portions of the fermented cassava couscous still walk across Abidjan, Ivory Coast's biggest city, selling this now Unesco-recognised dish.",
      "An alternative to rice, it's hard to find any hospitality venue in the Ivory Coast that doesn't serve atti\u00e9k\u00e9. From the most basic eateries to the fanciest restaurants and even on the beach, it's everywhere.",
      "Atti\u00e9k\u00e9's popularity has spilled over the country's borders, and it is now found across Africa, especially in French-speaking countries.",
      "It's also very popular in neighbouring Ghana and my home country Sierra Leone, where they have some fairly unorthodox serving suggestions.",
      "The distinctive tangy taste of atti\u00e9k\u00e9 comes from the cassava tubers mixed with fermented cassava, which gives it its unique flavour and texture.",
      "The cassava is grated, dried and then steamed before serving.",
      "Filling and versatile, Ivorian chef R\u014dze Traore describes its texture as \"fluffy yet granular, similar to couscous\".",
      "Mr Traore adds that the slight tanginess of atti\u00e9k\u00e9 provides a unique depth to meals, perfectly balancing spicy or savoury sauces.",
      "For Paule-Odile B\u00e9k\u00e9, an Ivorian chef who competed on the UK TV programme Masterchef: The Professionals, \"sour, zingy and sweet\" are the words that come to mind when she describes the taste of atti\u00e9k\u00e9.",
      "Gluten-free and available in different grain sizes, the finest is often the most expensive. Some places even sell red atti\u00e9k\u00e9, which has been soaked in palm oil.",
      "Eaten with a variety of dishes, the most popular version is with chargrilled chicken or fish, a simple, spicy tomato-based sauce and a salsa of chopped tomatoes and onions.",
      "It was one of the first dishes I cooked for my husband when we met 15 years ago. He liked it so much, he suggested we open a restaurant serving just that.",
      "Atti\u00e9k\u00e9 is unpretentious, although traditionally reserved for special occasions like weddings and birthdays, people now eat it every day.",
      "Ms B\u00e9k\u00e9, who comes from a family of atti\u00e9k\u00e9-makers, explained some nuances.",
      "\"Our attieke will be a bit more yellow than some other regions due to the proximity of the sea,\" she said.",
      "A native of Jacqueville, a small coastal town where atti\u00e9k\u00e9 is made, she features it heavily in the menu of her New York supper clubs.",
      "Although I left Ivory Coast at the age of 14 as civil unrest broke out, I have never been able to let go of atti\u00e9k\u00e9.",
      "In London, I'd travel miles to Congolese shops to excavate bags of atti\u00e9k\u00e9 from the permafrost at the bottom of a chest freezer, stockpiling it for dinner guests I could evangelise.",
      "When I moved to Nigeria, I mandated relatives to bring me care packages from Abidjan or Freetown, Sierra Leone's capital.",
      "It was one of the first things I looked for when I moved to Johannesburg in South Africa three months ago.",
      "Where to find it is always one of the first questions I have for any Ivorians I meet outside Ivory Coast.",
      "Obviously it tastes delicious, but it's hard to describe what makes atti\u00e9k\u00e9 so special.",
      "Ivorian chef Charlie Koffi says \"atti\u00e9k\u00e9 is a dish that symbolizes togetherness\".",
      "Like injera, the fermented Ethiopian pancake, or thieboudienne, Senegal's rice-and-fish dish, atti\u00e9k\u00e9 is best enjoyed in a group.",
      "Across Ivory Coast, friends and family will gather around a big plate, eating with their hands and washing it down with a cold beer or soft drink.",
      "For me, it's also a reminder of a childhood which was cut short. I was just 13 years old when on Christmas Eve 1999, as I waited for my friends to come round for a play date, a military coup rocked Ivory Coast.",
      "As soldiers drove through the city shooting in the air and telling people to head indoors, my little sister and I clung to each other in a hallway, the only windowless space in our house.",
      "Our mum was stuck in town, unable to join us.",
      "Six months later, my mum sent us to the UK to live with our grandmother, fearing the rising political tension in the run-up to the 2000 presidential elections would result in further unrest.",
      "Just two years later, the country's first civil war would break out, and it would be another 15 years before I was able to return to my childhood home.",
      "But even when I couldn't return to Babi (Abidjan's nickname), atti\u00e9k\u00e9 was always a way to connect to the place we had left behind.",
      "Even though I'm not Ivorian, like many of the expatriates and economic migrants who moved to the country during the prosperous 1990s, Ivory Coast is home.",
      "We all speak Nouchi, the French slang that peppers Ivorian music and the streets of its cities, and we all eat atti\u00e9k\u00e9.",
      "Ivory Coast has a way of making people feel at home, and atti\u00e9k\u00e9 is part of that.",
      "When I finished university, I returned to Ivory Coast for a year to work for an international NGO.",
      "On our way back from one of our assignments in the west of the country, an Ivorian colleague explained that traditionally, atti\u00e9k\u00e9 was mostly eaten with kedjenou, a rich, smoky stew made with tomatoes, onions, and chillies.",
      "This is slow-cooked with local chicken or game in a clay pot over a wood fire, infusing the dish with a deep, flavourful essence.",
      "He claimed that it was only after the French arrived that Ivorians started serving atti\u00e9k\u00e9 with grilled fish and chicken.",
      "This is not something that I've been able to confirm, but it always rang true.",
      "Ivorians, although fiercely proud of their culture, have always been open to foreign influences in their cuisine and many regional dishes have become local staples.",
      "Now that atti\u00e9k\u00e9 has been added to the list of intangible cultural heritage in need of urgent safeguarding, perhaps more people outside the region will become aware of this delicious treat.",

    "summary": "Dionne Warwick, Smokey Robinson and Melba Moore discuss the history of the Harlem landmark \"where stars are born and legends are made.\"",
    "story": [
      "On Wednesday nights, the Apollo Theater in Harlem is one of the hottest tickets in town. But there's no celebrity headliner. It's Amateur Night! And the audience is there to pick the NEXT breakout star.",
      "\"I know how tough the crowd can be,\" said Kyle Parks, a 23-year-old singer from Yonkers, New York. \"I know that's what makes this place legendary, what goes into it.\"",
      "Parks won the crowd over with his performance of \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" by Sam Cooke. Others ... weren't so lucky. Marion Caffey, longtime producer of the Apollo's iconic Amateur Night, said, \"They're brutally honest. And just sometimes just brutal, not necessarily honest!\"",
      "Caffey says it's the longest-running singing competition in history. \"Well, 'The Voice,' and 'America's Got Talent,' and 'American Idol,' and 'Star Search,' we are the great-grandfather of all of that,\" he said. \"This was the blueprint.\"",
      "The theater's motto is \"Where stars are born and legends are made\"\u2026 and it's launched plenty of them, from James Brown and Ella Fitzgerald, to Stevie Wonder, Lauryn Hill and H.E.R.",
      "And if you're wondering why every performer rubs that tree stump, according to Caffey, \"This stump used to be a full tree. And it stood outside the Lafayette Theater. And they would pull leaves from the tree for good luck. And now everyone comes here and rubs the Tree of Hope for good luck.\"",
      "Does it work? \"Well, I think it's good luck if you win, and it's not such good luck if you lose,\" Caffey said.",
      "But it worked for the award-winning singer Dionne Warwick, whose career skyrocketed since she and her gospel group won Amateur Night back in 1958.",
      "What did winning prove to her? \"Well, that we were good enough, first of all,\" Warwick said. \"And that we won $50!\"",
      "Warwick said going to the 1,500-seat theater was like going to school and getting a crash course in performing: \"The old saying is true, it is so true: 'If you can make it at the Apollo, you can make it anywhere.' They brought out the very best in you. Every single time I played the Apollo, it got better and better and better. And I mean, I felt like I was at home.\"",
      "But it wasn't always welcoming. Before it was the Apollo, it was a whites-only burlesque theater. In 1934, under new ownership and a new name, it opened its doors to everyone. Music historian Guthrie Ramsey said, \"It was one of the first to allow Black and white patrons to enjoy the music together. After all, it's New York City, and the Black community was growing. And so, it was basically a business model decision to allow Black citizens in.\"",
      "Ramsey says the story of the Apollo and the story of America are intertwined. \"It was a representative of anything that was going on in America, you could see the Apollo Theater reflecting that,\" he said. \"It's all of our histories. We all have a stake in it.\"",
      "During the civil rights movement, the Apollo became more than just a performance space. Motown great Smokey Robinson said, \"Sittin' in and marching and doing all this, and going to restaurants and they don't wanna serve us, and all that, we couldn't stay in any hotels \u2013 it was a rough time, you know?\"",
      "But the Apollo was like a beacon. \"It was the beacon,\" Robinson said. \"It was the Black music staple. It was just, you know, where the Black acts came. Couldn't play nowhere else!\"",
      "Robinson says the first time he and The Miracles performed here, he was a nervous wreck. They bombed! \u00a0\"I was frightened to death to be at the Apollo Theater,\" he said. \"Had we not had a record out and supposedly be 'professional' at that point, that the guy with the hook would have came and took us off the stage, because we were terrible!\" he laughed. \"We were just amateurs, we were so terrible, until Mr. Schiffman, the guy who owned the Apollo at that time, called Berry Gordy, who was our manager and stuff at that point, and told him he wanted his money back!\"",
      "In the decades that followed, as more places became integrated, the Apollo struggled financially, and closed its doors more than once. \"We could've lost the Apollo, but we're still here,\" said actress and singer Melba Moore. She says she grew up watching shows at the theater, and then got a chance to perform here \u2013 and later became a guest host on \"It's Showtime at the Apollo,\" the TV version of Amateur Night.",
      "Moore says this theater is something to be treasured.",
      "Tonight, the Apollo Theater is being awarded a prestigious Kennedy Center Honor at a ceremony that we'll see later this month on CBS.",
      "Michelle Ebanks, president and CEO of the theater, says it's the first time an institution (rather than a person) has received such recognition. \"The idea of the Apollo opened up this whole universe, so that everyone could see this is American culture, too,\" Ebanks said. \"This is the magic of art, the power of art.\"",
      "This is also the year the theater begins its 90th season. And to Smokey Robinson, the Apollo is still a force to be reckoned with. \"You know, it's the beginning. It's the proving ground. It's the Apollo!\"",

    "story": [
      "\"Squid Game\" fans know that trumpet wakeup call means someone is going to die. Not our hero, Gi-hun, but one or more of the players hoping to win a fortune competing in childish, but lethal, games. It's at once a thriller and a critique of inequality and greed.",
      "Season 1 was an international blockbuster. With 330 million views, it's Netflix's most-watched series of all time. It won Emmys for its lead actor, Lee Jung-jae, and creator Hwang Dong-hyuk. Both made history as the first Asian winners in their categories.",
      "We first spoke with Hwang in Korea just as he was about to start a global promotional tour for Season 2.",
      "\"So, you are kind of in a sweet spot now?\" I asked.",
      "\"I don't know what you mean by 'sweet spot,'\" Hwang replied.",
      "\"Just that things are going your way?\"",
      "\"But it's not easy. Nothing's easy,\" he said. \"People keep saying to me, 'You are the happiest person in Korea.' But in my mind, I am not that happy. I'm struggling every day and night.\"",
      "That's thanks to a brutal workload: Hwang directed and wrote every episode. Sworn to secrecy, \"Sunday Morning\" was invited to a soundstage outside Seoul where much of Season 2 was shot.",
      "Hwang was at the top of his game, but it wasn't always that way. He was only five when his father died. After that, he says, his family was trapped in poverty. As a struggling filmmaker, and in debt, Hwang said he sought escape in comic books. \"I read a lot in the survival game genre and gambling genre,\" he said. \"And that led me to think, what if I were to combine childhood games with people putting their lives at stake for a huge cash prize? And that was really how the idea was conceived.\"",
      "And a blockbuster was born.",
      "In the show, contestants driven by desperation risk everything for money, exploited by a sinister game master, the powerful Front Man.",
      "Asked if \"Squid Game\" represents how he sees capitalists and capitalism in general - a group of desperate people manipulated by a cruel and wealthy elite - Hwang replied, \"I think fundamentally what continues to drive this system is human selfishness and greed. These days I'm becoming more pessimistic about human nature. I almost think that, for homo sapiens, it's greed that allows them to create a society that they feel most comfortable in.\"",
      "Many of the characters in Season 2 are new (Hwang having killed off so many of them in Season 1), but the guards are back, and so is Gi-hun, now on a doomed mission to stop the game.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Squid Game: Season 2\" click on the video player below:",
      "Hwang said that \"Squid Game\" Seasons 2 and 3 \"will show people the bottom of this world, the bottom of the human being.\"",
      "So, it gets even darker? \"Yeah, it's getting darker, episode by episode,\" Hwang said.",
      "The show is so popular that recently 50,000 people applied for a chance to take part in a real-life (but non-deadly) Squid Game in Paris. The prize: an early look at the new season.",
      "Hwang is amazed, especially by his show's wild success in the U.S., where audiences have not traditionally gone for a subtitled TV series: \"I was always hoping to make something very popular in the States, so I was surprised,\" he said. \"At the same time there was, like, in my dream come true. But that level of success [was] just beyond my expectations.\"",
      "Ironically, this creator of a dystopian parable about desperation and poverty now finds himself a wealthy man \u2013 one of the great winners of capitalism. Has that changed him? \"Not much,\" he said. \"Made my life better, for sure, because I don't have to worry about [making] money anymore. But since then, I don't think I was changed a lot by more success or more money, because it's just a number. It doesn't have any meaning to me at all.\"",
      "What does have meaning is his work. But the success and the pressure of \"Squid Game\" have taken a toll: \"It's more than, like, five years I've been just working on this one project, day and night. I'm so exhausted. I'm so sick of, you know?\" he laughed. \"I need a break, I need a break.\"",
      "A break from non-stop work \u2026 and from his deep dive into the dark depths of human nature.",

    "story": [
      "At the open of a Billie Eilish concert, a giant light box rises in the arena. \"Spoiler alert! I'm in the cube, but you can't see me,\" she said. \"I can literally see everybody so well from inside this box, but they have no idea I can see them. It feels like I'm wearing an invisibility cloak.\"",
      "\"That's a luxury you don't have most of the time,\" I said.",
      "\"That's true!\" she laughed. \"But it also makes me feel a little like I'm not real?\"",
      "Her whole career has been kind of unreal. Eilish, who turns 23 this month, has more than 100 million followers on Spotify, an ardent fan base that filled the United Center in Chicago.",
      "A few hours before showtime, Eilish was scurrying around backstage, introducing us to her backup singers \u2026 her band \u2026 and taking us to a room full of rescue dogs, who offer stress relief. \"Welcome to the puppy room!\" she said. A couple have already been adopted.",
      "She's filled her crew with friends (even the furry kind) because this tour is different. Since Eilish broke out at 14, her older brother, Finneas, has been her producer, songwriting partner and backing band. For the first time, she's on tour without him. \"I've never done a show without my brother in my life,\" she said. \"I mean, I've barely performed and sung without my brother, like, ever.\"",
      "But they agreed it was time for her to go out on her own. Finneas told us, \"I was built into the show for several years in an irreplaceable way. And I always kind of was trying to make myself replaceable.\"",
      "Her mom, Maggie Baird, came to the Chicago show. But Eilish's parents also aren't touring with her anymore. \"It does feel strange, yeah,\" Baird said. \"But it also feels okay. And there's also a lot of jobs I used to do where I'm like, I'm happy I don't have to do that one anymore!\"",
      "\"Honestly, she won't admit it, but I think it's been really nice for her that I've been gone,\" Billie laughed. \"And that then she can come see me and it's not just, like, her whole life. I mean, I've been her whole life for, like, 23 years now.\"",
      "\"Pretty good life, though,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, a lot! But, yeah\u2026\"",
      "Earlier this year, Eilish won her second Oscar for the \"Barbie\" theme, \"What Was I Made For.\" She already has nine Grammys, and now another seven nominations. Among her nominations are record of the year and song of the year, for a song (\"Birds of a Feather\") that she almost didn't put on her album.",

      "I asked, \"When you sing it, do you hear all that you went through to create it?\"",

      "Watch Billie Eilish perform \"Birds of a Feather\":",
      "Eilish admits that, until recently, she didn't think of herself so much as a songwriter. That has changed. \"I did, like, way more writing on this album than anything ever,\" she said. \"But this is the thing I'm trying to say: I've been writing music since I was 11. But because I wasn't as fast at it, or wasn't as good, as my brother, I kind of thought, 'Oh, I'm not a songwriter.'\"",
      "But when they sat down to write Billie's third album, \"Hit Me Hard and Soft,\" Finneas felt uninspired.",
      "\"We'd get in the studio to write and I'd be, like, 'Can we go play pickleball?'\" he said. \"I think I just sort of had a little fatigue there.\"",
      "Billie said they were in \"different places,\" and that she felt alone. In the past, Finneas would help pull a lyric out of his sister. This time, she had to coax the words out of herself. \"And then, in just being given that space, I'd come up with it,\" she said.",
      "On the last chorus of \"Birds of a Feather,\" Eilish reached for a note she wasn't sure she could hit.\u00a0 Her vocal bravery came after she started taking singing lessons.",
      "I asked, \"Have you found some part of yourself you didn't even know was there?\"",
      "\"Yeah! Oh, yeah. I mean, my voice!\" she laughed. \"I can't express how gratifying, and satisfying, and fulfilling it has been to, like, learn these things about my own voice \u2013 that's in my body \u2013 that I didn't even know I was capable of. \u2026 It's so liberating.\"",

      "Daniel Craig was born in the north of England, and at 6 years old saw his first stage production. He was introduced to the theater by his mother: \"We lived in Liverpool in the '70s. There was a theater called the Everyman, it's still there. They had cheap tickets so everybody could go. A lot of my mum's friends were designers and costume designers and worked backstage.

      "His mother's love for theater, it turned out, ran deeper than her son realized. He found out later that, as a young woman, she had been accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, one of the world's great acting schools. \"Yeah, she was, and she hadn't told me,\" Craig said. \"But they couldn't afford to go, so she had to go home, and went to art college instead up North.\"",
      "He was moved once he found out: \"She's always encouraged me. I mean, she sort of gently kicked me out the door, to say, 'Go, get on with it.' All the drama schools are in London, everything that was happening, and she said, 'You gotta go.' I left and went.\"",
      "He was only 16. \"She realized I was failing so badly at school, there was really no other option, I think!\" Craig laughed.",
      "He hasn't just been successful; he's one of the most recognized actors on the planet, whether he likes that or not.",
      "I asked, \"We interview a lot of big name actors on this show, and a lot of them say they don't like being famous. And it's not that I don't believe it, but I need to understand: what does being famous do to your brain?\"",
      "\"Oh God, well, that's the big question,\" Craig replied. \"It can do all sorts of wonderful things, of course, and as an actor, why did I become an actor? Because I like dressing up and showing off and I want people to like me. I mean, it's like, you want to sort of distill it down to its absolute basics. But what does fame do? I think fame can take you off in all sorts of weird and strange and not very healthy directions.\"",
      "\"It's gotta make acting harder in a way, because you can't, for instance, easily go on the subway and just look at the person across from you and kind of observe life around you?\"",
      "\"People watching, yes. Yeah, I did it a lot when I was younger, so I've got a lot in the bank!\"",
      "Daniel Craig has always been known for his intensity. But at 56, his next chapter might not be quite as physically rigorous, being 20 years older than when he was first cast as 007 in \"Casino Royale.\" \"God, remind me, why don't you?\" he laughed. \"Life is pain! And that's why I wanted to stop, one of the reasons I wanted to stop, because I'd throw myself into those movies, each one. From the very beginning I've been wanting to do as many stunts and as many of the action sequences as I possibly can. And I've injured myself. And I don't wanna do that. I don't want to take that risk anymore. I've got kids and I've got a life. And I want to spend the rest of my life upright if I can.\"",
      "\"Upright, sort of conserving your energy for them?\"",
      "\"Well, standing! Yeah, on my own two feet, as opposed to being wheeled around!\"",

    "published": "Sat, 07 Dec 2024 18:39:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Heritage Auctions had estimated the ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in \"The Wizard of Oz\" would fetch $3 million or more.",
    "story": [
      "A pair of iconic ruby slippers that were worn by Judy Garland in \"The Wizard of Oz\" \u2014 and stolen from a museum nearly two decades ago \u2014 fetched $28 million in an auction Saturday.",
      "Robert Wilonsky, a vice president with the Dallas-based auction house, told CBS News in an email that, with the buyer's premium \u2014 a commission that the buyer pays \u2014 the slippers sold for a total of $32.5 million.",
      "Heritage Auctions had estimated that the slippers would fetch $3 million or more. Online bidding opened last month and by Friday had reached $1.55 million, or $1.91 million including the buyer's premium, Wilonsky said. Over 800 people were tracking the slippers, and the company's\u00a0web page for the auction\u00a0had hit nearly 43,000 page views by Thursday, he said.",
      "As Rhys Thomas, author of the book, \"The Ruby Slippers of Oz,\" puts it, the sequined shoes from the beloved 1939 musical have seen \"more twists and turns than the Yellow Brick Road.\"",
      "They were on display at the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids, Minnesota, in 2005 when Terry Jon Martin used a hammer to smash the glass of the museum's door and display case.",
      "Their whereabouts remained a mystery until the FBI recovered them in 2018. Martin, now 77, who lives near Grand Rapids in northern Minnesota, wasn't publicly exposed as the thief until he was indicted in May 2023. He pleaded guilty in October 2023. Martin admitted he used a small sledgehammer to break into the museum. He then used the tool to crack the case the slippers were in and take them. He said he didn't hear any alarm. He took off in his car and kept them in a trailer adjacent to his home.",
      "He was in a wheelchair and on supplementary oxygen when he was sentenced last January to time served because of his poor health.",
      "His attorney, Dane DeKrey, explained ahead of sentencing that Martin, who had a long history of burglary and receiving stolen property, was attempting to pull off \"one last score\" after an old associate with connections to the mob told him the shoes had to be adorned with real jewels to justify their $1 million insured value. But a fence \u2014 a person who buys stolen goods \u2014 later told him the rubies were just glass, DeKrey said. So Martin got rid of the slippers. The attorney didn't specify how.",
      "The alleged fence, Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of the Minneapolis suburb of Crystal, was indicted in March. He was also in a wheelchair and on oxygen when he made his first court appearance. He's scheduled to go on trial in January and hasn't entered a plea, though his attorney has said he's not guilty.",
      "The shoes were returned in February to memorabilia collector Michael Shaw, who had loaned them to the museum. They were one of several pairs that Garland wore during the filming, but only four pairs are known to have survived. In the movie, to return from Oz to Kansas, Dorothy had to click her heels three times and repeat, \"There's no place like home.\"",
      "Among those bidding was the Judy Garland Museum. The city of Grand Rapids raised money for the slippers at its annual Judy Garland festival to supplement the $100,000 set aside this year by Minnesota lawmakers to help the museum purchase the slippers.",
      "\"The Wizard of Oz\" story has gained new attention in recent weeks with the release of the movie \"Wicked,\" an adaptation of the megahit Broadway musical, a prequel of sorts that reimagines the character of the Wicked Witch of the West.",
      "The auction also included other memorabilia from \"The Wizard of Oz,\" including a hat worn by Margaret Hamilton, who played the original Wicked Witch of the West.",

Before he left, he ignited a firestorm when he issued a sweeping pardon for his son, Hunter, who had been convicted on federal drug and gun charges, and pleaded guilty to tax charges. When asked about the pardon earlier this week, the first lady, who attended every day of Hunter Biden's Delaware trial, said \"of course I support the pardon of my son.\"",

      "The White House expects to welcome over 100,000 visitors during the holiday season. The first lady on Tuesday welcomed families of National Guard members to be the first to view the decorations. Upon arrival, visitors will see a Christmas tree dedicated to Gold Star families with six stacked stars representing all six branches of the military. Down the East Colonnade guests will be surrounded by bells \"symbolizing the peaceful sounds of the holiday season.\" In the East Room, a reflective canopy twinkles next to the chandeliers like snowfall as two large Christmas trees guard the main door.",
      "The first known Christmas tree inside the White House was in 1889 during the Benjamin Harrison administration, according to the White House. It was a much smaller affair with only a Christmas tree in the Second Floor Oval Room decorated with candles by President Harrison's grandchildren.",
      "The annual gingerbread White House manages to combine 25 sheets of gingerbread dough, 10 sheets of sugar cookie dough, 65 pounds of pastillage, 45 pounds of chocolate, 50 pounds of royal icing, and 10 pounds of gum paste into the form of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.",
      "Volunteers who bring the decorations to life",
      "Alisa Cooper de Uribe, a first-grade bilingual teacher at the New Mexico International School in Albuquerque and the 2021 New Mexico Teacher of the Year, was one of the volunteers who assembled the thousands of doves. She traveled to Washington, D.C., with her family to be part of the White House decorations team.",
      "\"It's a sisterhood, a brotherhood. It was a very collegial atmosphere,\" Cooper de Uribe told CBS News. \"And that was one of the things that I was really impressed by was how so many people who were gathered together without any knowledge of each other before, how well these people work together.\"",
      "The holiday volunteers are teachers, military families, nurses, and small business owners from across the country who all apply before being selected for decor duty. Bright and early the day after Thanksgiving, the volunteers arrived at the White House to begin full days of glitter and garland before the first lady unveiled all their work. The Office of the First Lady sent out special invitations to State Teachers of the Year winners like de Uribe to join the holiday volunteer tradition. Some volunteers formed text chains and Facebook groups, intending to keep in touch long after the ornaments are taken down.",
      "Centerpiece of the holiday decor",
      "The centerpiece of the holiday decor inside the Blue Room is a 18 \u00bd foot Fraser Fir that traveled from the Cartner Family of Cartner's Christmas Tree Farm in North Carolina. The tree was one of the survivors as thousands of others were devastated when Hurricane Helene hit the Blue Ridge Mountains. The owners named it \"Tremendous\" as a tribute to the resilience of North Carolina communities affected by Hurricane Helene.",
      "In the state dining room, there are ornaments on the Christmas tree that feature self-portraits of students, including four of de Uribe's first graders.",
      "\"It was an opportunity for the students to see themselves reflected in the White House and in this season, and that it's their place, and it's their opportunity to have their individual and unique selves and their culture shine out through their portraits,\" de Uribe said.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 17:05:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Even those enrolled in Medicare have a harder time paying for treatment compared with older adults in other countries.",
    "story": [
      "In the U.S., having health insurance is necessary, but not sufficient to ensure access to affordable medical care.",
      "While the U.S. lacks a universal health care system like those that exist in most other wealthy nations, most Americans over 65 are insured through Medicare. Yet many still struggle to afford care, with high out-of-pocket costs putting necessary medications and doctor visits out of reach, according to\u00a0research from The Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit that works to promote an equitable health care system.",
      "These extra costs, for which Medicare beneficiaries are on the hook, make it harder for older Americans to access affordable care relative to their peers in nine other countries, the group found. Researchers compared coverage for older adults in the U.S. to health care systems in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.",
      "Nearly one in four older adults in the U.S. spent at least $2,000 in out-of-pocket expenses last year, compared to less than 5% of older adults in France and the Netherlands who spent that much, The Commonwealth Fund found. Only in Switzerland did older adults report spending more on health care than those in the U.S.",
      "\"The reason to focus on this population is because in the U.S. nearly every adult over 65 has Medicare,\" Munira Z. Gunja, senior researcher for international health policy and practice innovations at The Commonwealth Fund told CBS MoneyWatch. While the U.S. stands out as \"the only high-income country without a universal health system,\" when it comes to the over-65 population, \"at least, we are on par with other countries,\" she said.",
      "Does Medicare fall short?",
      "But the study suggests that the kind of coverage Medicare plans provide isn't meeting many Americans' needs. Eight percent of older adults in the U.S., more than any other wealthy country except Austria, reported delaying or forgoing medical care because of costs. And there are repercussions to not getting the care one needs: One-third of older U.S. adults who said they faced cost-related barriers to accessing care reported being either in fair or poor health.",
      "\"We find that while nearly every older adult has Medicare coverage, it is still more expensive than what older adults in other nations face, and because of that, older adults in the U.S. are more likely to skip care,\" Gunja said. \"When they need prescription drugs, they are more likely to skip getting those too.\"",
      "Oftentimes, for example, Medicare Advantage members find themselves seeing out-of-network doctors, which exposes them to \"a ton of health care costs,\" according to Gunja.",
      "One exception",
      "There's one area in which Medicare beneficiaries faced few out-of-pocket costs and, as a result, were less likely to skip care \u2014 mental health treatment. Less than 5% of residents in all nations skipped mental health care over affordability concerns. The stat illustrates that when treatment is affordable, patients are more inclined to seek out the care they need, according to Gunja.",
      "\"It's a benefit that's offered on all health plans, and we see what happens when people don't need to spend as much on a service,\" she said.",
      "Solutions?",
      "When older people skip or delay care, their health can worsen, leading to sicker patients, who tend to require more costly care. That in turn drives up federal Medicare spending, according to The Commonwealth Fund.",
      "Gunja suggests that the U.S. can look to other countries for solutions that make health care more affordable for older adults. Some examples include capping out-of-pocket expenses and fully covering hospital and physician services.",
      "\"Across the board, the U.S. generally comes out last for most measures when it comes to affordability measures,\" Gunja said. \"Getting health insurance is absolutely necessary. But it's only the first step. We need to make sure coverage is not just comprehensive, but also affordable.\"",

    "summary": "Anthem will reverse a policy that would have capped insurance coverage for anesthesia after objections from doctors and lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield said Thursday that the health insurance provider is reversing a policy that was set to go into effect in February that would have limited anesthesia coverage during surgeries and other procedures, a change that had prompted an outcry from some physicians and lawmakers.",
      "The policy, which would have covered Anthem's plans in Connecticut, New York and Missouri, was disclosed in recent weeks, with the company's New York unit posting a\u00a0notice on Dec. 1. The policy would have excluded people under 22 years old and maternity care.",
      "According to the original policy statement, Anthem had said it would pay only for anesthesia treatments for the length of time that a procedure or surgery is estimated to require based on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's physician work time values. The insurer noted that claims for anesthesia \"above the established number of minutes will be denied.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News on Thursday, Anthem said it was backing away from the policy, and added there had been \"widespread misinformation about an update to our anesthesia policy.\"",
      "\"As a result, we have decided to not proceed with this policy change,\" an Anthem spokesperson wrote in an email. \"To be clear, it never was and never will be the policy of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to not pay for medically necessary anesthesia services. The proposed update to the policy was only designed to clarify the appropriateness of anesthesia consistent with well-established clinical guidelines.\"",
      "Before the announcement of Anthem's reversal, the plan had drawn criticism from medical professionals as well as Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, who wrote on social media on Wednesday that the plan is \"appalling.\"",
      "\"Saddling patients with thousands of dollars in surprise additional medical debt.   And for what? Just to boost corporate profits?\" Murphy wrote. \"Reverse this decision immediately.\"",
      "Connecticut Comptroller Sean Scanlon told the Hartford Courant Thursday that the policy would not take place in his state after negotiating with the insurer.",
      "\"After hearing from people across the state about this concerning policy, my office reached out to Anthem, and I'm pleased to share this policy will no longer be going into effect here in Connecticut,\" Scanlon told the newspaper.",
      "\"Appalling behavior by commercial health insurers\"",
      "In a statement last month, the American Society of Anesthesiologists also called on Anthem to reverse the policy.",
      "\"With this new policy, Anthem will arbitrarily pre-determine the time allowed for anesthesia care during a surgery or procedure,\" the group said. \"If an anesthesiologist submits a bill where the actual time of care is longer than Anthem's limit, Anthem will deny payment for the anesthesiologist's care.\"",
      "The insurer's new policy could result in denials of coverage to patients who might need more anesthesia because their surgery is difficult or unusual, or if a complication occurs, the group added.",
      "\"This is just the latest in a long line of appalling behavior by commercial health insurers looking to drive their profits up at the expense of patients and physicians providing essential care,\" said Donald E. Arnold, an anesthesiologist and president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. \"This egregious policy breaks the trust between Anthem and its policyholders who expect their health insurer to pay physicians for the entirety of the care they need.\"",

      "Researchers at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus received up to $46 million in a grant to help develop an innovative treatment to cure blindness. The\u00a0Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health\u00a0award will allow researchers to make whole-eye transplantation a reality.",
      "The goal is to restore vision to patients with total blindness, according to researchers. The grant will support the work of the Total Human Eye-allotransplantation Innovation Advancement project team led by CU.",
      "\"Currently, there has never been a successful whole human eye transplant for the restoration of vision,\" said principal investigator and surgeon-scientist Dr. Kia Washington in a statement. \"We believe the great advancements over the last two decades in technology, transplantation surgery, and regenerative medicine now make restoration of vision possible.\"",
      "The CU Anschutz team said it will begin with animal models on optic nerve regenerative strategies, immunosuppression, and post-operative care, with the goal of advancing to human trial studies.",
      "\"One of the most complex parts of the procedure is the successful reattachment of the optic nerve. Think of it as fixing a broken electrical connection so that signals from the eye can be transmitted to the brain,\" Washington said in a statement. \"Monitoring and aftercare are equally important to make sure the brain continues to receive the correct signals and is accepting the new eye.\"",
      "Washington said the techniques and advancements developed in the research could be used to treat blindness while offering new solutions for other neurodegenerative disorders that impact the central nervous system like spinal cord injuries or brain damage.",

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 16:29:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Levels of both the flu and COVID viruses are still low across much of the country, the CDC says.",
    "story": [
      "This year's winter surge of influenza and COVID-19 has yet to arrive for most of the country, data published this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows, with trends so far a fraction of what they were at this time last year.",
      "\"COVID-19 activity remains low and is stable in most areas. Seasonal influenza activity is increasing slightly among children but remains low nationally,\" the CDC said this week, in its weekly report on data about the two viruses.",
      "The agency's updates are usually published every week by Friday, but were delayed until after the weekend because of the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "A return to normal for flu?",
      "By this time last year, data tracking outpatient visits to places like emergency rooms and doctor's offices for the flu had already climbed above the agency's baseline for the season. This year's latest report suggests flu cases are only now starting to cross that threshold.",
      "\"We're maybe slightly later than last year, and maybe quite a bit later than the year before, but those years were unusually early,\" said University of North Carolina epidemiology professor Justin Lessler, a top expert in the CDC-backed network of disease forecasters.",
      "Lessler said this year's figures look \"much closer to about where you'd expect a normal flu season to be\" before the COVID-19 pandemic, when measures to curb the outbreak scrambled seasonal patterns of flu and other respiratory germs.",
      "Compared with last year, rates of weekly flu hospitalizations are around five times lower. Emergency room visits with flu from school-age kids have accelerated, the CDC's data shows, but remain less than a third of what they were at this time last year.",
      "One big factor that could be affecting the figures this year is immunity in the population from the last two waves of influenza, alongside vaccination.",
      "\"We have had two fairly substantial seasons, which could be driving this delay. Of course the question is, does that mean we're having a delay, or a milder season. That's really kind of uncertain at this point,\" said epidemiologist Shaun Truelove, associate scientist at Johns Hopkins University's public health school.",
      "Modeling of this year's flu season gathered from different experts make different assumptions about what the country's flu immunity looks like, as they try to play out different scenarios of how this year's flu season might look like.",
      "Truelove, who also helps lead the CDC-funded disease forecasting network, also thinks that this year could mark a \"return to normal\" for flu.",
      "\"That being said, flu is never consistent. We get early seasons and late seasons. So it's hard to say exactly what that means, and everything's a bit weird post-pandemic, in terms of scale and timing,\" said Truelove.",
      "Watching for another COVID-19 wave",
      "Several COVID-19 trends that the CDC tracks also remain below what was recorded at this time in 2023. This is a contrast with previous summer waves of the virus, which have only dipped slightly into the fall before picking up again during the winter.",
      "COVID-19 emergency room visits are \"low\" or \"minimal\" in nearly all states, after this year's late summer wave of the virus. Levels of the virus in wastewater are \"minimal\" in all regions, compared to \"high\" levels around this time last year.",
      "\"Does that mean that there was enough immunity built up in that summer wave that we're going to not see a winter wave? Does it mean the winter wave is going to come, but be a little bit later and maybe a little smaller,\" said Lessler.",
      "Both Truelove and Lessler said one major \"data gap\" making comparisons to previous seasons challenging has been the lapse in nationwide COVID-19 hospitalization data during the summer surge.",
      "A pandemic-era emergency requirement for health care providers to report COVID-19 hospitalizations lapsed earlier this year, and only recently resumed under a new rule issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Other factors muddying the figures include changes to how people test and seek care for COVID-19 infections.",
      "Another big unknown is the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Most circulating variants right now are a medley of closely related variants like XEC and KP.3.1.1.",
      "\"We don't know, like we do for flu, what the average pace of COVID's evolution away from our immune system will be, when it settles down,\" Lessler said.",
      "Early data released last month by researchers at The Ohio State University found XEC looked to be more infectious compared with the parent variant it shares upstream with KP.3.1.1, but not significantly more than its siblings.",
      "\"I actually have thought it had settled down a bit, after this year. We'll see what I think after the season's done. But right now, I'm a little less sure,\" he said.",
      "Other respiratory germs on the rise",
      "While COVID-19 and flu remain at unusually low levels nationwide, rates of at least other germs that spread through coughs and sneezes remain elevated.",
      "CDC's data on emergency room visits from the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae, sometimes called \"walking pneumonia,\" have increased in recent weeks especially in babies.",
      "Cases in this year's wave of pertussis, or whooping cough, are also continuing to accelerate in several states around the country.",
      "The agency tallied 577 infections of pertussis nationwide for the week ending Nov. 23, around 33% higher than last week's count. That's higher than the peak of 2014's record pertussis wave, which reached 326 weekly infections reported in late December.",
      "Ohio remains the state with the most cases of whooping cough this past week, after 66 infections with pertussis were reported.",
      "The CDC's \"acute respiratory illness\" metric, which lumps together levels of patients showing up in emergency rooms with a broad array of cough and cold illnesses including influenza and whooping cough, tallies 14 states with \"moderate\" levels including Ohio.",

      "Federal investigators found nearly a dozen children to be working dangerous, overnight shifts at Seaboard Triumph Foods' pork processing plant in Sioux City, Iowa, the Department of Labor announced.",
      "Employed by Guymon, Oklahoma-based sanitation contractor Qvest, 11 kids allegedly used corrosive cleaners to sanitize head splitters, jaw pullers, bandsaws, neck clippers and other equipment at the Seaboard Triumph Foods facility from at least September 2019 through September 2023, the DOL stated in a news release\u00a0on Friday.",

      "\"These findings illustrate Seaboard Triumph Foods' history of children working illegally in their Sioux City facility since at least September 2019. Despite changing sanitation contractors, children continued to work in dangerous occupations at this facility,\" Michael Lazzeri, the Midwest regional administrator with the DOL's Wage and Hour division, stated in the release.",

      "Still, children under 18 illegally employed in dangerous jobs in meat and poultry slaughtering and processing operations is not unique in the industry or to the Seaboard Foods plant in Sioux Falls.",
      "Seaboard in September 2023 contracted Fayette Janitorial Services for sanitation work at its facility. After taking over the plant's sanitation services contract, Fayette allegedly rehired some of the children previously employed by Qvest, with the Somerville, Tennessee-based contractor earlier this year found to be employing nine minors at the Sioux City plant, the DOL alleged.",
      "Fayette also allegedly hired 15 children as young as 13 at a Perdue Farms processing plant in Accomac, Virginia, where a 14-year-old was severely injured. Perdue terminated its contract with Fayette before the DOL's court filing, the company said.",
      "Are migrant kids cleaning U.S. slaughterhouses?",
      "The development is part of an ongoing probe into whether migrant kids are cleaning U.S. slaughterhouses.

      "The DOL launched its investigation after a published report detailed migrant kids working overnight for contractors in poultry processing facilities on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. A New York Times Magazine\u00a0story\u00a0last December detailed children cleaning blood, grease and feathers from equipment with acid and pressure hoses.",

    "summary": "Trump wants to impose across-the-board tariffs on imported goods from both allies and adversaries, claiming it's other nations who will pay such taxes to the U.S. Treasury. But it's American consumers who will be opening their wallets.",
    "story": [
      "Incoming President Donald Trump has made his feelings about tariffs very clear: \"The word 'tariff' is the most beautiful word in the dictionary,\" he has said. \"I think it's more beautiful than 'love.' \u2026 I love tariffs! \u2026 Music to my ears!\"",
      "And what exactly is a tariff? It is a tax. According to Dartmouth economics professor Doug Irwin, \"In U.S. history, we're basically only talking about import tariffs, taxes on imported goods coming into the U.S.\"",
      "Irwin says governments have all kinds of reasons for introducing tariffs: \"Sometimes it's to reduce the trade deficit. Sometimes it's to bring back jobs. Sometimes it's to punish other countries for their unfair trade practices. Sometimes it's to raise revenue so that we can cut income taxes.\"",
      "At its most fundamental, a tariff works like this:",
      "Suppose we import a product from China. The price is $50. But before you can buy it, our government adds $25 to the price. That's the tariff. Your final price is $75. China gets its $50; the extra $25 winds up going to the U.S. Treasury.",
      "But who pays these tariffs?",
      "According to Trump, it's the other countries. \"Trillions and trillions of dollars pouring into the United States Treasury,\" is his description of what happens. \"China paid hundreds of billions of dollars during my term.\"",
      "But as Irwin points out, that's NOT the way tariffs work!",
      "\"I think economists would say that's very misleading to say that that's what's going on,\" he said. \"Of course, it's the U.S. consumers that are paying those, not China itself. China's not writing checks to the U.S. government.\"",
      "Rather, it is a transfer of money from consumers to the federal government. A tax.",
      "Tariffs have been part of international trade since our country was founded; the first one was imposed by George Washington! And what we've learned from history is that they often have unintended consequences.",
      "We have a tariff on sugar that has doubled the price of sugar. It has helped out our sugar cane farmers in Louisiana and Florida, but it's also driven 34% of American chocolate and candy manufacturing (and jobs) out of the country.",

      "Candy makers turn sweet on Canada to mitigate costly U.S. sugar tariffs (Financial Post)",
      "More confectionery manufacturers move outside U.S. (Confectionery Production)",
      "Then, there was Trump's 25% tariff on imported steel in 2018. Our steelmakers thrived, but companies that make things out of steel (like Ford, GM and Caterpillar) suffered dearly. Just ask Ford's then-CEO Jim Hackett, who in 2018 told Bloomberg, \"The metals tariffs took about a billion dollars of profit from us. If it goes on longer, there will be more damage.\"",
      "Tariffs against one particular country can backfire. Irwin said, \"With the China tariffs, we're importing a lot more from Vietnam, we're importing a lot more from Malaysia. If the idea with the tariff was to bring jobs back home, instead we're just shifting them from China to Vietnam, in some sense.\"",
      "And P.S.: Tariffs don't just raise prices on the imported stuff; they can affect the price of domestic substitutes as well.",
      "So, if there's a tariff on imported steel, and I'm an American steelmaker, I can opportunistically say, \"Well hey, now I can raise my prices, too!\"?\u00a0 Absolutely! says Irwin: \"Consumers don't have the choice anymore. They can buy the really high-priced steel, or they can buy you.\"",
      "Finally, there's the retaliation problem. \"When we imposed the steel tariffs, the European Union and China got very upset with us,\" Irwin said. \"And what did they do? They raised tariffs on American farm goods. So, all of a sudden, American farmers, who had nothing to do with steel per se, found their sales limited overseas.\"",
      "Even Ronald Reagan could have told you that. In fact, he did! In 1987, Reagan said, \"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. The result is more and more tariffs, higher and higher trade barriers, and less and less competition.\"",
      "So, exactly what tariffs has Trump proposed? During his campaign, he promised as president he would \"phase in a system of universal baseline tariffs.\" Originally, he outlined tariffs across the board -- every product, in every category, from every country in the world. \"We're going to charge them 10 to 20 percent,\" he said.",

      "Retailers tell consumers that Trump tariffs are a reason to shop now",
      "Why is Trump threatening a 100% tariff on the BRICS nations?",
      "Now, every recent president has favored some tariffs. The Biden administration, for example, maintained some of the tariffs from Trump's first term, and imposed its own 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars. But these tariffs have always targeted particular categories of products. \"An across-the-board tariff? That's not targeting a particular commodity or product, that's not targeting a particular country,\" said Irwin. \"It's just saying, 'All imports, all sources get hit with this tax.' That's a very different type of tariff.\"",
      "And wouldn't we then notice prices going up, on everything?\u00a0 \"We would definitely notice,\" Irwin said.",

      "But Trump's transition leader Howard Lutnick predicts that his boss won't tax imported goods for which there are no American-made alternatives. Back in September, Lutnick told CNBC, \"Tariffs are an amazing tool by the president to use. They're an amazing tool. But he understands, don't tariff stuff we don't make. If we don't make it, and you want to buy it, I don't want to put the price up.\"",

      "Can Trump impose tariffs without Congress? It's complicated, according to experts",
      "But maybe Trump has no intention of imposing the tariffs for real? Maybe he's playing a strategic game -- tariffs as negotiating tactics?",
      "\"Tariffs can be used as a threat and a bargaining chip,\" said Irwin. \"And sometimes, if you're really credible, just making the threat of a tariff is enough to bring another country to change its policy in a way that you desire without your actually having to impose the tariff in the end.\"",
      "In the end, when a government wants to achieve some economic or geopolitical goal, it can use all kinds of different tools: subsidies, tax breaks or penalties, trade agreements, regulations, certifications, investment incentives, diversification.",
      "According to Doug Irwin, tariffs are a powerful tool, too. They're just rarely the best one. \"What economists have concluded is that tariffs usually have a lot of unintended consequences, can lead to blowback where other countries retaliate against you, and so are not a really good policy instrument for achieving goals that we all Americans want to achieve,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court upheld a law that will ban TikTok in the U.S. in the coming months if its Chinese parent company doesn't sell its stake in the app, dealing another setback to the widely popular video-sharing service in its battle with the federal government.",
      "A panel of three judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously sided with the Justice Department in declining to review the petition for relief from TikTok and ByteDance, its Chinese parent company, saying the law is constitutional.",
      "\"We conclude the portions of the Act the petitioners have standing to challenge, that is the provisions concerning TikTok and its related entities, survive constitutional scrutiny,\" Senior Judge Douglas Ginsburg wrote in the majority opinion. \"We therefore deny the petitions.\"",
      "Congress approved\u00a0a foreign assistance package in April that included provisions giving TikTok nine months to sever ties with ByteDance or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. President Biden quickly signed the bill into law, and it is set to take effect on Jan. 19, with the possibility of a one-time 90-day delay granted by the president if a sale is in progress by then.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump tried to ban TikTok during his first term in office, but reversed his position during the presidential campaign and vowed to \"save\" the app. He takes office on Jan. 20.",
      "Lawmakers and national security officials have long had suspicions about TikTok's ties to China. Officials from both parties have warned that the Chinese government could use TikTok to spy on and collect data from its roughly 170 million American users or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content. The concern is warranted, they have argued, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering.",
      "The appeals court's decision tees up a fight at the Supreme Court over the law's ultimate fate. The parties asked the judges to make a decision by Friday so there is enough time for the high court to review the case before the law takes effect. The justices could agree to hear the case and pause the law while they consider the legal arguments, or let the appeals court's ruling stand as the final word.",
      "TikTok expects the law will be overturned by the Supreme Court, according to spokesperson Michael Hughes, who argued the law is based on \"inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information.\"",
      "\"The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" Hughes said in a statement.",
      "The Justice Department, meanwhile, applauded the decision.",
      "\"Today's decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to collect sensitive information about millions of Americans, to covertly manipulate the content delivered to American audiences, and to undermine our national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. \"As the D.C. Circuit recognized, this act protects the national security of the United States in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution. The Justice Department is committed to defending Americans' sensitive data from authoritarian regimes that seek to exploit companies under their control.\"",
      "The court's decision",
      "\"The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\" Ginsburg wrote in his opinion. \"Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\"",
      "The appeals court said that it recognized the decision will have \"significant implications\" for TikTok and its users.",
      "\"Consequently, TikTok's millions of users will need to find alternative media of communication,\" Ginsburg said. \"That burden is attributable to the [People's Republic of China's] hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security, not to the U.S. Government, which engaged with TikTok through a multi-year process in an effort to find an alternative solution.\"",
      "The D.C. Circuit found that the government's national-security justifications for banning TikTok \u2014 to counter China's efforts to collect Americans' data and limit its ability to manipulate content covertly on the platform \u2014 are \"wholly consistent\" with the First Amendment.",
      "\"The multi-year efforts of both political branches to investigate the national security risks posed by the TikTok platform, and to consider potential remedies proposed by TikTok, weigh heavily in favor of the Act,\" Ginsburg wrote. \"The government has offered persuasive evidence demonstrating that the act is narrowly tailored to protect national security.\"",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House China committee, praised the decision, calling it \"a loss for the Chinese Community Party,\" while also expressing optimism about the app's future in the U.S.",
      "\"I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,\" Moolenaar said in a statement.",
      "The House China committee spearheaded the bipartisan effort to pass the law.",
      "The legal arguments",
      "TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge in May that called the legislation \"an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power\" based on \"speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation\" that would suppress the speech of millions of Americans.",
      "\"In reality, there is no choice,\" the petition said, adding that a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\"",
      "The Chinese government vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance said \"such a fundamental rearchitecting is not remotely feasible\" under the restrictions within the legislation.",
      "\"The platform consists of millions of lines of software code that have been painstakingly developed by thousands of engineers over multiple years,\" the petition said.",
      "During oral arguments in September, the appeals panel appeared skeptical of TikTok's argument that free expression outweighs national security concerns, but the three judges were also critical of the government's stance.",
      "TikTok's lawyer Andrew Pincus said the law \"is unprecedented and its effect would be staggering.\"",
      "\"This law imposes extraordinary speech prohibition based on indeterminate future risks,\" Pincus said. \"Notwithstanding the obvious less restrictive alternatives, the government has not come anywhere near satisfying strict scrutiny.\"",
      "Judge Sri Srinivasan said, under TikTok's rationale, the U.S. would not be able to ban a foreign country from owning a major media company in the U.S. if the two are at war.",
      "\"Is your submission that Congress can't bar the enemy's ownership of a major media source in the U.S.?\" Srinivasan, an Obama appointee, asked Pincus.",
      "When Pincus noted that news outlets like Politico and Business Insider are owned by foreign entities, Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, quickly chimed in: \"But not foreign adversaries.\"",
      "Rao also pushed back on Pincus' argument that Congress did not include any evidence of its claims that TikTok poses a national security risk in the legislation.",
      "\"I know Congress doesn't legislate all the time, but here they did,\" she said. \"They actually passed a law and many of your arguments want us to treat them as an agency. It's strange. It's a very strange framework for thinking about our first branch of government.\"",
      "Attorney Jeffrey Fisher, who represents TikTok creators, compared the restrictions on TikTok to the U.S. government hypothetically banning bookstores from selling books written by foreign authors in conjunction with a foreign government.",
      "\"We're not talking about banning Tocqueville in the United States,\" Rao countered. \"We're talking about a determination by the political branches that there's a foreign adversary that is potentially exercising covert influence in the United States. Very different.\"",
      "Ginsburg, a Reagan appointee, expressed skepticism over the notion that the law singles out TikTok.",
      "\"It describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity,\" he said, noting that the company and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns. \"That's the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "Justice Department lawyer Daniel Tenny said the data on Americans that could be collected through the app \"would be quite valuable to a foreign adversary if it were trying to approach an American to try to have them be an intelligence asset.\" Tenny also spoke about the risk of content manipulation by China.",
      "\"What is being targeted is a foreign company that controls this recommendation engine and many aspects of the algorithm that's used to determine what content is shown to Americans on the app,\" Tenny said.",
      "But Srinivasan said it's Americans' choice to use the app, despite what content may appear.",
      "\"The fact that that's being denied subjects this to serious First Amendment scrutiny,\" he said.",
      "He later added, \"What gives arguable force to the other side's First Amendment argument is that it's not just that the government is targeting curation that occurs abroad. It's the reason the curation occurring abroad is being targeted, and the reason is a concern about the content consequences of that curation in the U.S.\"",

      "The fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson is surfacing the public's deep frustration with the health insurance industry.",
      "On \"CBS Mornings\" Friday, Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News said the main issue is that health care costs are too high.",
      "\"What we see in this country is that the number one cause of bankruptcy is health-care-related expenses,\" she said.",
      "After groceries, transportation and rent, health care costs are the No. 1 cost of concern to families in this country, according to KFF polling.",
      "\"We've gotten to a point where health care is so inaccessible and unaffordable, people are justified in their frustrations,\" Gounder said.",
      "Can the insurance industry do something about high costs?",
      "There are things that can be done, Gounder said.",
      "Under President Barack Obama, for example, there was the Affordable Care Act, which helped to expand health insurance.",
      "\"You had Medicaid, you had the marketplace, then you also have subsidies to make it more affordable to purchase plans on the marketplace,\" Gounder said. \"Those were made even more generous during the pandemic, and then those more generous subsidies were extended under the Inflation Reduction Act under President Biden.\"",
      "But, there is still the challenge of why health care costs are rising.",
      "\"You have efforts to extend coverage and make more people have health care be available, but prices are going up,\" Gounder said.",
      "What could change in U.S. health care look like?",
      "In the U.S., people are faced with both rising health care costs and insurance premiums.",
      "According to a\u00a0KFF poll\u00a0from earlier this year, a quarter of U.S. adults say they've skipped or postponed getting the care they need simply because of the cost.",
      "Compared with other developed countries, the U.S has a different, \"very piecemeal\" approach, Gounder said.",
      "\"Many other countries have what we call socialized medicine,\" Gounder said. \"By the way, Medicare is socialized medicine, and even that socialized medicine is the most expensive in terms of health care for the elderly in the world.\"",
      "Many different proposals have been made to improve the situation, she said, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to negotiate down the price of drugs.",
      "\"We've already seen one round of price negotiations. The incoming administration wants to eliminate the Inflation Reduction Act, at least many of the provisions of that. So whether that will continue, we don't know,\" she said.",
      "There have also been mergers and acquisitions in the health care industry, which means less competition.",
      "\"Biden administration has really been trying to pursue antitrust suits to block some of these,\" Gounder said. \"The Trump administration, the prior administration, tried to make health care pricing more transparent. That was another way of trying to make things better. It's not enough. These are all sort of chipping away at a bigger problem.\"",
      "What you can do if a claim is denied",
      "In posts to social media, doctors are sharing their experiences with more and more claims being denied \u2014 something Gounder is seeing too.",
      "\"What we're also seeing now is increasing use of AI by the insurance companies to deny claims, and then you have competing AIs being developed by health care systems to fight the health insurance AIs,\" she said. \"Me as a doctor, I have to spend a lot of time on the phone with various different companies to try to explain why my patient is in the hospital.\"",
      "If you are finding your claims to be denied, Gounder suggests following a few steps:",
      "Collect all of the paperwork you can to make your case",
      "Review very carefully the statements that are sent to you and what the issues are",
      "See what your doctor can do to start in terms of filing an appeal",
      "Consider state insurance commissions that regulate insurance that you can also appeal to. Go to naic.com and look up your state.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 17:05:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Even those enrolled in Medicare have a harder time paying for treatment compared with older adults in other countries.",
    "story": [
      "In the U.S., having health insurance is necessary, but not sufficient to ensure access to affordable medical care.",
      "While the U.S. lacks a universal health care system like those that exist in most other wealthy nations, most Americans over 65 are insured through Medicare. Yet many still struggle to afford care, with high out-of-pocket costs putting necessary medications and doctor visits out of reach, according to\u00a0research from The Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit that works to promote an equitable health care system.",
      "These extra costs, for which Medicare beneficiaries are on the hook, make it harder for older Americans to access affordable care relative to their peers in nine other countries, the group found. Researchers compared coverage for older adults in the U.S. to health care systems in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.",
      "Nearly one in four older adults in the U.S. spent at least $2,000 in out-of-pocket expenses last year, compared to less than 5% of older adults in France and the Netherlands who spent that much, The Commonwealth Fund found. Only in Switzerland did older adults report spending more on health care than those in the U.S.",
      "\"The reason to focus on this population is because in the U.S. nearly every adult over 65 has Medicare,\" Munira Z. Gunja, senior researcher for international health policy and practice innovations at The Commonwealth Fund told CBS MoneyWatch. While the U.S. stands out as \"the only high-income country without a universal health system,\" when it comes to the over-65 population, \"at least, we are on par with other countries,\" she said.",
      "Does Medicare fall short?",
      "But the study suggests that the kind of coverage Medicare plans provide isn't meeting many Americans' needs. Eight percent of older adults in the U.S., more than any other wealthy country except Austria, reported delaying or forgoing medical care because of costs. And there are repercussions to not getting the care one needs: One-third of older U.S. adults who said they faced cost-related barriers to accessing care reported being either in fair or poor health.",
      "\"We find that while nearly every older adult has Medicare coverage, it is still more expensive than what older adults in other nations face, and because of that, older adults in the U.S. are more likely to skip care,\" Gunja said. \"When they need prescription drugs, they are more likely to skip getting those too.\"",
      "Oftentimes, for example, Medicare Advantage members find themselves seeing out-of-network doctors, which exposes them to \"a ton of health care costs,\" according to Gunja.",
      "One exception",
      "There's one area in which Medicare beneficiaries faced few out-of-pocket costs and, as a result, were less likely to skip care \u2014 mental health treatment. Less than 5% of residents in all nations skipped mental health care over affordability concerns. The stat illustrates that when treatment is affordable, patients are more inclined to seek out the care they need, according to Gunja.",
      "\"It's a benefit that's offered on all health plans, and we see what happens when people don't need to spend as much on a service,\" she said.",
      "Solutions?",
      "When older people skip or delay care, their health can worsen, leading to sicker patients, who tend to require more costly care. That in turn drives up federal Medicare spending, according to The Commonwealth Fund.",
      "Gunja suggests that the U.S. can look to other countries for solutions that make health care more affordable for older adults. Some examples include capping out-of-pocket expenses and fully covering hospital and physician services.",
      "\"Across the board, the U.S. generally comes out last for most measures when it comes to affordability measures,\" Gunja said. \"Getting health insurance is absolutely necessary. But it's only the first step. We need to make sure coverage is not just comprehensive, but also affordable.\"",

      "In the wake of\u00a0UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson's killing in New York City Wednesday morning, some companies are taking additional precautionary measures to protect their executives while corporate security firms are reporting an uptick in interest in their services.",
      "The shooting of Thompson, who did not appear to have a security detail with him when he was attacked outside a Manhattan hotel, is shining a light on the business of protecting prominent corporate executives, whose security costs can reach millions of dollars per year.",
      "It's common for the top brass at public companies to be protected by guards around the clock, according to security experts. Social media's amplification of everyday individuals' dissatisfaction with a particular person, product or service has only heightened the need for protection, they say. That's particularly true in an industry like health care insurance, when many Americans say they are dissatisfied with the services they receive.",
      "Indeed, in the wake of Thompson's killing, many on social media expressed vitriol for some health insurers' practices.",

Meta, whose businesses include Facebook and Instagram, reported the highest spending on personal security for top executives last year, at more than $24 million, filings culled by research firm Equilar show.",
      "While Thompson had an in-house security detail during his New York City visit, it wasn't with him at the time of the shooting, according to CNN, which cited a source familiar with UnitedHealthcare's security.",

      "Too much information",
      "In the wake of Thompson's death, some companies are taking steps to limit publicly available information about their executives. For example, a page on UnitedHealthcare's website about the company's leadership \u2014 where Thompson and other executives' bios were listed \u2014\u00a0no longer exists, and instead redirects to the company's home page.",
      "Medica, a Minnesota-based nonprofit health care firm, as well as other insurers have taken similar actions, their websites show.",
      "Medica told the Associated Press Friday that it is temporarily closing its six offices for security reasons, in addition to removing executives bios' from its website.",
      "\"Although we have received no specific threats related to our campuses, our office buildings will be temporarily closed out of an abundance of caution,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Experts say these types of moves are wise.",
      "\"I think we share too much. I don't need to know where you live and that you're married and have three wonderful kids,\" Sarnese said. \"We don't need to advertise to the public where the president and CEO are sitting.\"",
      "While executives across all industries should be evaluating their security postures, healthcare industry professionals have received more threats in recent years as a result of divisiveness that arose around safety protocols, including mask mandates, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sarnese said.",
      "\"Every industry has challenges because there is always going to be somebody who is upset with a service or product or philosophy. But COVID changed everything. We never saw the level of threats we saw during COVID toward healthcare workers and leaders, because of some of the mistrust and misinformation that was out there in the community,\" he said.",
      "\"All the ways things can go wrong\"",

    "summary": "Anthem will reverse a policy that would have capped insurance coverage for anesthesia after objections from doctors and lawmakers.",
    "story": [
      "Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield said Thursday that the health insurance provider is reversing a policy that was set to go into effect in February that would have limited anesthesia coverage during surgeries and other procedures, a change that had prompted an outcry from some physicians and lawmakers.",
      "The policy, which would have covered Anthem's plans in Connecticut, New York and Missouri, was disclosed in recent weeks, with the company's New York unit posting a\u00a0notice on Dec. 1. The policy would have excluded people under 22 years old and maternity care.",
      "According to the original policy statement, Anthem had said it would pay only for anesthesia treatments for the length of time that a procedure or surgery is estimated to require based on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's physician work time values. The insurer noted that claims for anesthesia \"above the established number of minutes will be denied.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News on Thursday, Anthem said it was backing away from the policy, and added there had been \"widespread misinformation about an update to our anesthesia policy.\"",
      "\"As a result, we have decided to not proceed with this policy change,\" an Anthem spokesperson wrote in an email. \"To be clear, it never was and never will be the policy of Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield to not pay for medically necessary anesthesia services. The proposed update to the policy was only designed to clarify the appropriateness of anesthesia consistent with well-established clinical guidelines.\"",
      "Before the announcement of Anthem's reversal, the plan had drawn criticism from medical professionals as well as Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, who wrote on social media on Wednesday that the plan is \"appalling.\"",
      "\"Saddling patients with thousands of dollars in surprise additional medical debt.   And for what? Just to boost corporate profits?\" Murphy wrote. \"Reverse this decision immediately.\"",
      "Connecticut Comptroller Sean Scanlon told the Hartford Courant Thursday that the policy would not take place in his state after negotiating with the insurer.",
      "\"After hearing from people across the state about this concerning policy, my office reached out to Anthem, and I'm pleased to share this policy will no longer be going into effect here in Connecticut,\" Scanlon told the newspaper.",
      "\"Appalling behavior by commercial health insurers\"",
      "In a statement last month, the American Society of Anesthesiologists also called on Anthem to reverse the policy.",
      "\"With this new policy, Anthem will arbitrarily pre-determine the time allowed for anesthesia care during a surgery or procedure,\" the group said. \"If an anesthesiologist submits a bill where the actual time of care is longer than Anthem's limit, Anthem will deny payment for the anesthesiologist's care.\"",
      "The insurer's new policy could result in denials of coverage to patients who might need more anesthesia because their surgery is difficult or unusual, or if a complication occurs, the group added.",
      "\"This is just the latest in a long line of appalling behavior by commercial health insurers looking to drive their profits up at the expense of patients and physicians providing essential care,\" said Donald E. Arnold, an anesthesiologist and president of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. \"This egregious policy breaks the trust between Anthem and its policyholders who expect their health insurer to pay physicians for the entirety of the care they need.\"",

      "Three companies have recalled cucumbers grown by Agrotato, S.A. de C.V. in Sonora, Mexico, and sold by importers between October 12 and November 26, according to the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "SunFed Produce, Baloian Farms of Arizona Co. and Russ Davis Wholesale\u00a0have all recalled cucumbers in recent days, with the latter also recalling multiple products containing them, including ready-to-eat salads and wraps, the FDA noted.",
      "The recalls include one announced on December 5 involving vegetable trays and salads sold at Kroger and King Soopers retail stores in Colorado and Texas, with best-by dates running to December 6, as well as\u00a0 a\u00a0recall\u00a0of grab-n-go Yummi Sushi sold at Kroger stores in Texas. A separate but related recall involves Marketside Fresh Cut Cucumber Slices sold at 34 Walmart stores in Texas.",

Although most recover without treatment within a week, some people, especially the young and the old, may experience more severe illnesses that require treatment or hospitalization.",

      "Stellantis is recalling more than 300,000 Ram Heavy Duty pickup trucks because a faulty part could cause certain braking and tracking systems to fail.",
      "The Netherlands-based automaker said the hydraulic control unit on the trucks is prone to failure, which can cause the anti-lock brake, electronic stability control and traction control systems to not work properly. Stellantis said regular braking systems are not affected by the defective part and that it's unaware of any related injuries.",
      "The trucks in question are all model years 2017-18 and include the Ram 2500, 3500, 4500 and 5500. The recall includes a total of 317,630 trucks, including a small number of them in Canada, Mexico and elsewhere.",
      "Stellantis said it will advise customers who may be affected as to when they may obtain service, which will be free of charge.",
      "Customers with additional questions or concerns may call 1-800-853-1403.",
      "Last month, Stellantis announced a recall of about 207,000 Jeep and Dodge SUVs in the U.S. to fix a computer problem that can disable the anti-lock brakes and electronic stability control safety features. In September, Stellantis recalled nearly 1.5 million Ram pickup trucks worldwide to fix a software problem that can disable the electronic stability control system.",
      "Last week Stellantis announced that CEO Carlos Tavares was stepping down after nearly four years in the top spot of the carmaker.",
      "In addition to the recalls, Stellantis has been struggling with falling sales that have led to layoffs and contributed to ballooning inventory on dealer lots. Last quarter, Stellantis reported that net revenues plunged 27% from the same period a year ago.",

      "Employers added\u00a0227,000 jobs in November as the labor market rebounded from anemic growth in the prior month, when hurricanes and labor disputes dampened hiring.",
      "The unemployment rate ticked higher to 4.2% from 4.1% in the prior month. The U.S. had been forecast to add 200,000 jobs last month, according to economists surveyed by financial data firm FactSet. The unemployment rate was expected to hold steady at 4.1%.",
      "While hiring rebounded last month, the job market overall has been weakening in recent months under the strain of the Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy, with the central bank boosting borrowing rates to their highest point in 23 years to combat inflation. It's also taking longer for hundreds of thousands of out-of-work Americans to find new jobs, signaling cracks within a once-hot labor market as employers continue to cope with the impact of higher borrowing costs.",
      "\"After a prior month of hurricanes and worker strikes, we did get a bounce back in the headline payroll numbers plus positive revisions,\" said Bryon Anderson, head of fixed income at Laffer Tengler Investments, in an email. \"Jobs creation may not be as robust as in the past years, but we are not seeing a disaster in the job market. \"",
      "The end of labor disputes in October, including the Boeing machinists' strike, could have boosted job growth by almost 40,000, noted Goldman Sachs analysts in a report released ahead of the jobs report.",
      "October's jobs report was revised upward to 36,000 new jobs last month, versus the original report that employers had added 12,000 hires that month.",

      "The Fed jacked up interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023 to combat the highest inflation in 40 years. Defying predictions, the economy kept growing despite much higher borrowing rates for consumers and businesses, although the job market has been slowing since early this year.",
      "Even so, Americans as a whole have been enjoying unusual job security. This week, the government reported that layoffs fell to just 1.6 million in October, below the lowest levels in the two decades that preceded the pandemic. At the same time, the number of job openings rebounded from a 3 1/2 year low, a sign that businesses are still seeking workers even though hiring has cooled.",
      "The economy grew at a 2.8% annual pace from July through September on healthy spending by consumers. Annual economic growth has topped a decent 2% in eight of the past nine quarters. And inflation has dropped from a 9.1% peak in June 2022 to 2.6% last month.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Dec 2024 00:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump wants former lawmaker and auctioneer Billy Long to replace IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he wants ex-congressman Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri and a former auctioneer, to run the IRS. As a lawmaker, Long co-sponsored legislation that aimed to wipe out much of the tax code.",
      "In making the announcement, Trump praised Long's \"32 years of experience running his own businesses in Real Estate and, as one of the premier Auctioneers in the Country.\" He also noted that since leaving Congress in 2023, Long has worked as a business and tax adviser.",
      "While Trump didn't mention the current IRS Commissioner, Danny Werfel, in his announcement, the decision signals the president-elect is likely to replace him with Long after taking office in January, Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Naming Long as the next IRS chief drew both support from conservatives as well as criticism from the left, with Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia who serves on the House Ways and Means Tax subcommittee calling it a \"terrible mistake,\" while Idaho Republican Senator Mike Crapo issued a statement saying he's looking forward to hearing Long's ideas for the tax agency. The fiscally conservative National Taxpayers Union Foundation praised Trump's choice, saying Long could help reform the IRS.",
      "Long has recently served as a tax adviser to businesses seeking to employ a controversial tax credit, but, unlike prior IRS commissioners, his background is largely outside of the tax industry, experts noted.",
      "\"This guy is an auctioneer \u2014 that's his expertise,\" Owens noted. \"This is an incredibly unserious choice.\"",
      "Werfel, who was appointed by President Biden, stepped into the role in 2023, with his term set to expire in 2027. Typically, presidents allow IRS commissioners to serve out their term, as Mr. Biden allowed Trump's former IRS appointee, Charles Rettig, to do before naming Werfel to the role.",
      "If the Senate approves his appointment to the IRS, Long would oversee an agency with 85,000 employees and an annual budget exceeding $12 billion.",
      "A spokesperson for the Trump campaign declined to comment.",
      "Here's what to know about Long and the IRS.",
      "Who is Billy Long?",
      "Long, who attended the University of Missouri but didn't graduate, described himself on a\u00a0website\u00a0for his congressional run as a \"fourth-generation native of Southwest Missouri.\" He touted his skills as an auctioneer, noting that he had been named the \"best auctioneer in the Ozarks for seven years in a row.\"",
      "Long also worked in real estate and in talk radio, hosting a show on a Missouri AM radio station.",
      "He shuttered his auction firm, Billy Long Auctions, before he was sworn into Congress in 2011, according to a local publication.",
      "What professional experience does Long have with taxes?",
      "As a congressman, Long co-sponsored some tax-related bills, including several efforts to eliminate the estate tax as well as a measure called the Tax Code Termination Act.",
      "That legislation would have wiped out much of the current tax code, replacing it with what the bill called a \"simple and fair system\" that would have applied \"a low rate to all Americans.\" Such flat taxes are considered regressive by many experts because low- and middle-income taxpayers would end up paying a larger share of their incomes than would wealthy Americans.",
      "\"As a business owner, Billy knows first-hand how government regulation and heavy taxes can affect the small businesses that serve as the economic engine of our country,\" his campaign site noted.",
      "While Long isn't an accountant or CPA, he has been involved in tax advising since leaving Congress. In a 2023 podcast, for example, he touted his work helping businesses use the Employee Retention Tax Credit, a credit that the IRS has\u00a0flagged for its high rate of fraud.",
      "In the podcast, Long also said that when he served as a congressman, he helped make the ERTC easier for businesses to claim, noting that the credit was difficult to qualify for during its first iteration.",
      "\"We went from having to say COVID adversely affected your business definitely, to taking that away, and you don't have to prove that you had any downturn,\" he said. \"We're doing recoveries for folks that had their best two years ever during COVID.\"",
      "The IRS says the ERTC is aimed at employers who paid wages to workers between March 12, 2020, and January 1, 2022, and that were either suspended by government order during the pandemic or experienced a \"required decline in gross receipts during 2020 or the first three calendar quarters of 2021.\" The credit is also available to startups that began at the end of 2021 and had less than $1 million in revenue.",
      "How does Long's experience compare with prior IRS commissioners?",
      "Long's lack of tax industry experience sets him apart from other recent IRS commissioners.",
      "Werfel, the current IRS chief, has an undergraduate degree from Cornell University and a master's degree in public policy from Duke University as well as a law degree from the University of North Carolina. He's also held a number of government jobs involved in operations and the IRS, including serving as acting commissioner of the IRS from May to December 2013, according to his biography.",
      "Werfel's predecessor, Charles Rettig, who was appointed by President-elect Trump, also held several degrees, including a master's in taxation. Before joining the IRS, Rettig worked as a tax attorney for more than three decades and served as the chairman of the IRS Advisory Council.",
      "What is happening with the IRS now?",
      "Under Werfel, the IRS has expanded audits of wealthy taxpayers and big corporations, clawing back billions in unpaid taxes, efforts that were funded by the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "The tax agency has also reduced the time it takes consumers to connect with an IRS employee, while also rolling out a free tax filing system called Direct File.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have pushed back against the expanded IRS funding, claiming\u00a0the agency would use the money to hire thousands of new agents to increase audits on middle-class taxpayers.",
      "The Treasury had said that funding could help the IRS add nearly 87,000 full-time workers over 10 years, but the agency didn't specify whether those new workers would be auditors, customer service workers or other types of employees. That figure also represented the total number of employees that could be hired, without calculating the impact of the number of IRS workers who are expected to retire or leave the department over the next several years.",
      "Some Democratic lawmakers are expressing concern that, if appointed, Long could disrupt the progress that the IRS has made under Werfel.",
      "Werfel \"has done an excellent job rebuilding the IRS, boosting customer service and enhancing enforcement aimed at wealthy tax evaders,\" Rep. Beyer said in a statement. \"Removing him will clearly signal Trump's intention to make the agency less responsive to the American people, while giving a green light to wealthy tax cheats to evade their fair share of the tax burden.\"",
      "Still, Republican lawmakers expressed support for the pick, such as Senator Crapo, who highlighted \"privacy and security\" issues at the IRS and \"inefficient use of resources.\" He added, \"I look forward to learning more about Mr. Long's vision for the agency.\"",

      "Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was shot to death Wednesday outside the New York Hilton Midtown in Manhattan, where the company was hosting an investor day.",
      "Thompson, 50, was\u00a0named\u00a0CEO of UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group's insurance arm, in April 2021. He first joined UnitedHealth Group in 2004 and had previously served as CEO of the company's government programs, including Medicare and retiree coverage, and community and state programs providing Medicaid and other types of coverage to millions of individuals.",
      "In his most recent role as CEO of UnitedHealthcare, he was responsible for leading growth across the company's global, employer, individual, specialty and government benefits businesses, according to a 2021 company statement announcing his appointment.",
      "\"Brian's experience, relationships and values make him especially well-suited to help UnitedHealthcare improve how health care works for consumers, physicians, employers, governments and our other partners, leading to continued and sustained long-term growth,\" UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty said at the time.",
      "Thompson held other positions over his 20 years at the company, including chief financial officer for UnitedHealthcare's Employer and Individual, Community and State and Medicare and Retirement businesses. He also served as the financial controller for UnitedHealthcare's Employer and Individual business and was a director in the company's corporate development division.",
      "A low-key CEO",
      "For a top executive at a $562 billion company that affects how millions of Americans get health care, Thompson kept a relatively low profile. At an investor meeting last year, he outlined UnitedHealth's shift to \"value-based care,\" paying doctors and other caregivers to keep patients healthy, rather than focusing on treating them when they get sick.",
      "\"Health care should be easier for people,\" Thompson said at the time. \"We are cognizant of the challenges. But navigating a future through value-based care unlocks a situation where the \u2026 family doesn't have to make the decisions on their own.\"",
      "In 2023, Thompson earned total compensation of $10.2 million, according to a\u00a0disclosure\u00a0by UnitedHealth Group.",
      "Before joining UnitedHealth Group, Thompson worked as a certified public accountant at accounting firm PwC, according to his biography on networking site LinkedIn. Thompson graduated from the University of Iowa in 1997 with a bachelor's degree in business administration and most recently resided in Maple Grove, Minnesota.",
      "Following the shooting, UnitedHealthcare canceled its Wednesday meeting with Wall Street analysts and investors, which Thompson had been scheduled to attend.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened and shocked at the passing of our dear friend and colleague Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare,\" UnitedHealth Group said in a statement. \"Brian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him. We are working closely with the New York Police Department and ask for your patience and understanding during this difficult time. Our hearts go out to Brian's family and all who were close to him.\"",
      "On LinkedIn, former colleagues described Thompson as an \"affable\" and \"popular\" leader.",
      "\"BT was whip-smart and affable \u2014 a guy who could grasp the complexities of health care and explain them in simple, relatable terms true to his Iowa upbringing,\" said Matt Burns, who served as vice president of communications at UnitedHealth Group from 2015 to 2018.",
      "Thompson is survived by his wife, Paulette Thompson, and two sons.",
      "\"We are shattered to hear about the senseless killing of our beloved Brian,\" Thompson's wife said in a statement provided to CBS News by her sister. \"Brian was an incredibly loving, generous, talented man who truly lived life to the fullest and touched so many lives. Most importantly, Brian was an incredibly loving father to our two sons and will be greatly missed. We appreciate your well wishes and request complete privacy as our family moves through this difficult time.\"",
      "Minnesota leaders express shock",
      "Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also weighed in on Thompson's death. \"This is a shocking and devastating loss for our whole community. 'Shocking' is the only word I can find at the moment,\" he said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added in a post on social media that Thompson was \"a great man.\"",

    "summary": "Payments to victims of Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com are the largest yet by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
    "story": [
      "More than 4 million Americans gouged by credit repair companies including Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com will soon collectively receive $1.8 billion in refund checks, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced Thursday.",
      "The payments make up the biggest distribution yet from the CFPB's victims relief fund, financed by civil penalties paid by companies that violate consumer protection laws, the agency said.",
      "Checks will be mailed in coming weeks to 4.3 million consumers who were charged illegal advance fees or subjected to allegedly deceptive bait-and-switch advertising by Lexington Law, CreditRepair.com and their parent companies, according to the federal agency.",
      "The CFPB in August 2023 obtained a legal judgment against the credit repair businesses, with a district court ruling the companies had violated a law that prohibits such companies from collecting fees until at least six months after their promised results.",
      "The companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after the court ruling, shutting about 80% of their business operations, including telemarketing call centers.",
      "\"Exploited vulnerable consumers\"",
      "\"Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com exploited vulnerable consumers who were trying to rebuild their credit, charging them illegal junk fees for results they hadn't delivered,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra stated in a news release. \"This historic distribution of $1.8 billion demonstrates the CFPB's commitment to making consumers whole, even when the companies that harm them shut down or declare bankruptcy.\"",
      "Since its launch in 2011, the CFPB has distributed more than $3.3 billion to consumers harmed by a range of illegal practices, such as student loan and mortgage relief scams and predatory lending. The victims relief fund allows the CFPB to provide financial relief in cases where direction compensation from the violating company is not possible.",
      "The brainchild of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, the CFPB was established after the 2008 financial crisis. Funded by the Federal Reserve, the agency has weathered several legal challenges from opponents. The Supreme Court\u00a0in May upheld\u00a0its funding structure, which had been challenged by the payday lending industry.",
      "Still, the agency's efforts could prove short-lived amid calls from some Republicans to weaken the agency or get rid of it entirely. On Wednesday, billionaire Elon Musk \u2014 among those designated by President-elect Donald Trump to\u00a0front an effort\u00a0to dismantle government bureaucracy, slash regulations and cut government spending \u2014 called for deleting the CFPB, arguing in a\u00a0post\u00a0on social media that there are \"too many duplicative regulatory agencies.\"",
      "When will the refund checks be sent?",
      "Payments will be sent between December and January to eligible consumers harmed by the companies, and those eligible do not need to take any action to receive a check.",
      "Those who think they are eligible but have not received a payment by mid-January can then contact JND Legal Administration at www.cfpb-lexlaw.org. Details about the distribution can be found here.",
      "How big will the payments be?",
      "The CFPB said the payments are based on a pro-rata share of fees paid by consumers to CreditRepair.com and Lexington Law, but that the payments might not cover all the fees they incurred.",
      "If the payments were divided evenly, each person would receive about $419.",
      "\"If funds remain after the distribution is complete, additional checks may be sent to consumers who cashed their initial check. You don't need to take any additional action,\" the agency said.",
      "Can I file a claim?",
      "No, according to the agency. \"There won't be opportunities to file claims for this redress case,\" it said.",
      "Is the refund check taxable?",
      "It's unlikely, because the checks are considered refunds for payments that consumers made to the credit repair companies, rather than taxable income, the CFPB said. \"If you have tax-related questions, however, please contact a tax advisor,\" it added.",

    "story": [
      "The sprawling, windowless warehouses that hold rows of high-speed servers powering almost everything the world does on phones and computers are increasingly becoming fixtures of the American landscape, popping up in towns, cities and suburbs across the United States.",
      "Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and urban and rural governments alike are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies.",
      "But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas, abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents are pushing back against the world's most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.",
      "In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling hills of the area's westernmost counties and butt up against wooded bike trails winding through the suburbs. But one of the latest proposals in the area, Plaza 500, would see a 466,000-square-foot facility and adjacent electrical substation built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds and a community center.",
      "The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials promised jobs and a significant property tax boost. But data center critics say the incentives aren't enough to counteract the consequences of building the facilities so close to homes.",
      "Tyler Ray, a leader in the fight against the Virginia project, worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by 2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help power the data centers' hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere.",
      "Ray and his neighbors tried to stop the development, but their efforts were largely unsuccessful. The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project was exempt.",
      "\"I don't know how a general resident, even someone who has been engaging intently on an issue, has any chance to go up against the data center industry,\" Ray said the night the supervisors voted.",
      "For local governments, attracting data centers to their municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in 2024 that Virginia's current data centers brought in $1 billion in tax revenue.",
      "For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of direct jobs \u2013 often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently that its investment in nearby Loudoun County, which included two data centers, created around 150 direct jobs, a figure that data center opponents say isn't worth the hassle.

Those payments, in addition to $1.7 in charitable donations from the company in 2023, have been instrumental in updating infrastructure and bolstering services. These funds have gone toward a new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer and $5,000 grants for homebuyers so far totaling at least $2.8 million.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 14:39:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Judge Reed O'Connor took issue with both a lack of judicial oversight and certain diversity requirements included in the deal's independent monitoring process.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Texas rejected a proposed plea agreement between the Justice Department and Boeing that would have settled the U.S. government's claims against the company, after crashes of two 737 Max jetliners that killed 346 people, according to a court order issued Thursday.",
      "In his ruling, Judge Reed O'Connor took issue with both a lack of judicial oversight and certain diversity requirements included in the deal's independent monitoring process and ordered the parties to provide the court with a plan for possible ways forward early next month.",
      "The federal government's proposed agreement with airplane manufacturing giant over the deadly crashes included various provisions, including an admission of guilt to one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and a $243.6 million fine \u2014 much less than the billions the families of the victims had requested. The deal would also have required Boeing to spend $455 million on safety programs and to work with an independent monitor who would oversee the company's progress.",
      "Investigators alleged in court records that leading up to the crashes, Boeing deceived federal officials who regulated the planes. In 2021, Boeing and the Justice Department entered into a deferred prosecution agreement, which meant the criminal charge would have been dropped if Boeing had complied with the terms of the deal. But earlier this year, federal prosecutors informed the court that Boeing had not followed through on all of the requirements and intended to move forward with the case.",
      "By July, after weeks of negotiations, Boeing and the Justice Department settled on the proposed plea agreement, prompting an outcry from families of those who died in the crashes. At the time, CBS News reported the deal only covered wrongdoing by Boeing tied to the crashes and did not give the company immunity for other incidents, including a door panel that blew off a Max jetliner during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. According to a Justice Department official, the proposed agreement also did not cover any current or former Boeing officials, only the corporation.",
      "Attorneys for some of the victims' families opposed the deal, arguing the \"rotten\" agreement with the government did not justly remedy the families' claims against Boeing. In court filings, they accused Boeing of more criminality and urged stricter penalties, harsher monitoring and recognition of the lives lost.",
      "In rejecting the plea agreement, the judge took aim at diversity, equity and inclusion considerations that the parties said they would take when hiring an independent monitor. He wrote that he was \"concerned with the Government's shifting and contradictory explanations of how the plea agreement's diversity-and-inclusion provision will practically operate in this case.\"",
      "Judge O'Connor had previously raised this issue and in responsive court filings, the Justice Department defended the language, arguing it predated the Boeing agreement. \"This new language reflected not a change in policy but rather a principle that has always governed the process: that selection of a monitor must be based solely on merit, from the broadest possible pool of qualified candidates,\" they said.",
      "O'Connor ruled Thursday that the language was inappropriate: \"In a case of this magnitude, it is in the utmost interest of justice that the public is confident this monitor selection is done based solely on competency. The parties' DEI efforts only serve to undermine this confidence in the Government and Boeing's ethics and anti-fraud efforts.\"",
      "The judge also wrote that the Justice Department's previous efforts to oversee Boeing's conduct \"failed\" and said the independent monitor provision in the proposed deal did not go far enough to include the court in the process.",
      "\"At this point, the public interest requires the Court to step in. Marginalizing the Court in the selection and monitoring of the independent monitor as the plea agreement does undermines public confidence in Boeing's probation, fails to promote respect for the law, and is therefore not in the public interest,\" O'Connor wrote, \"Accordingly, the Court cannot accept the plea agreement.\"",
      "The Justice Department said it's reviewing the decision. Boeing did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "In a statement, Paul Cassell, an attorney for some of the victims' families, told CBS News, \"Judge O'Connor has recognized that this was a cozy deal between the Government and Boeing that failed to focus on the overriding concerns \u2013 holding Boeing accountable for its deadly crime and ensuring that nothing like this happens again in the future.\"",

    "summary": "A growing number of unemployed workers have been searching for a new job for more than 15 weeks, labor data shows.",
    "story": [
      "The unemployment rate might be near a historic low, but it's taking longer for hundreds of thousands of out-of-work Americans to find new jobs, signaling cracks within a once-hot labor market as employers continue to cope with the impact of higher borrowing costs.",
      "About 40% of the 7 million people who were out of work in October, or roughly 2.84 million people, have been looking for work for more than 15 weeks, an increase of 20% since a year earlier, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. More than half of those job seekers have been on the hunt for new employment for more than 27 weeks, or about half a year.",
      "A drawn-out job search is increasingly common in the labor market today as companies hold off on hiring, especially in some industries such as tech and professional services, ZipRecruiter chief economist Julia Pollak told CBS MoneyWatch. It's a far cry from the heady years of 2021 and 2022, when Americans switched jobs at high rates in search of better pay and more fulfilling work, a trend termed \"The Great Resignation.\"",
      "The job market has since weakened under the strain of the Federal Reserve's restrictive monetary policy, with the central bank boosting borrowing rates to their highest point in 23 years to combat inflation, Pollak noted. While inflation has rapidly cooled in the past two years and the Fed began cutting rates in September, the burden of higher borrowing costs has caused consumers to pull back on buying cars and homes, impacting key sectors of the economy, Pollak said.",
      "The job market today reflects \"low hiring, low firing and low job-switching,\" Pollak noted. \"It's this 'big stay'-type of situation \u2014 it's great if you have a job you like, and it's not great if you don't have a job.\"",
      "Employers in October hired 12,000 workers, a jobs report that marked the slowest month for hiring since December 2020. As the anemic number reflects, businesses were weighed down by Hurricanes Milton and Helene as well as labor disputes such as the Boeing machinists strike.",
      "Leading up to the November 5 election, a majority of American held a\u00a0dim view of the strength of the U.S. economy, a factor partly credited with helping President-elect Donald Trump claim victory. While much of voters' anger was focused on inflation, the job market also played a role in their views, with the unemployment rate inching up from a pandemic low of 3.4%, and with some workers saying their pay\u00a0hasn't yet caught up to inflation.",

      "\"The broader thread in the labor market has been a slow, gradual cooling, and the question is whether after accounting for these quirks if that will still be evident\" in Friday's data, Pollack noted, referring to businesses recovering after the storms and the labor strikes.",
      "Employers cut almost 60,000 jobs last month, an increase of 27% from a year earlier, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The automotive and tech industries had the largest numbers of layoffs last month, the group said.",
      "\"The automotive industry is currently experiencing significant challenges, including potential tariffs affecting U.S. automakers with overseas factories, intensifying competition from Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, and shifts in government subsidies for EVs,\" Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas said in a statement.",
      "The job market and interest rate cuts",
      "The slowing labor market helped sway the Federal Reserve's decision to begin cutting rates in September, which marked the central bank's\u00a0first rate cut in four years. The Fed followed with a second rate cut in November, and a majority of economists are forecasting another reduction at the central bank's December 18 meeting.",
      "According to BNP Parabas analysts, the job market may be in a period of uncertainty partly due to the election.",

      "They added, \"Though we suspect that pre-election uncertainty played a role in restraining hiring of late, this report (due on 6 December) may be too early to reveal a clear unlocking of previously postponed hiring. Uncertainties about tariffs, immigration and fiscal policy remain.\"",
      "Even so, some economists are paring their forecasts for the pace of the Fed's expected rate cuts in 2025, citing President-elect Trump's plans to impose tariffs, cut taxes and deport millions of illegal immigrants, which could, if enacted, reignite inflation.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 16:52:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Jared Isaacman is an entrepreneur and veteran private astronaut with strong ties to Elon Musk and his rocket company SpaceX.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, a veteran private astronaut with strong ties to Elon Musk and his rocket company SpaceX, has been picked to serve as NASA's next administrator, President-elect Donald Trump  announced Wednesday.",
      "If confirmed, Isaacman, 41, would be the fifth NASA administrator with spaceflight experience, replacing former Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, who flew into orbit aboard the space shuttle Columbia in early 1986.",
      "\"I am delighted to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,\" Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social. \"... Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.\"",
      "Isaacman founded the payment processing company later named Shift4 Payments while he was a high school student. He chartered the first purely commercial, all-civilian American \"space tourist\" mission \u2014 Inspiration4 \u2014 in February 2021, paying SpaceX an undisclosed amount to launch him and three other civilian flyers on a two-day, 23-hour flight.",
      "He flew to space again this past September, commanding the first of three planned SpaceX Polaris missions, logging nearly five days in space on a flight that took the crew farther from Earth than any astronauts have gone since the Apollo moon program. Isaacman also became the first private citizen to carry out a spacewalk.",
      "He is scheduled to lead another Polaris mission aboard a SpaceX capsule before leading the first crew to space aboard the California rocket builder's gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "Dates have not been announced for either of those missions, and it's not yet clear what impact Isaacman's selection to lead NASA will have on those flights, whether Isaacman still intends to fly aboard one or both or what sort of influence his friendship with Musk might have on NASA's future direction.",
      "But Isaacman, a skilled pilot who flies his own MiG-29 fighter jet, made it clear in a post following Trump's announcement that NASA can expect him to be a vocal space advocate who will help \"usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilization.\"",
      "\"With the support of President Trump, I can promise you this: We will never again lose our ability to journey to the stars and never settle for second place,\" Isaacman said. \"We will inspire children, yours and mine, to look up and dream of what is possible. Americans will walk on the moon and Mars and in doing so, we will make life better here on Earth.\"",
      "He said it would be the \"honor of a lifetime to serve in this role and to work alongside NASA's extraordinary team to realize our shared dreams of exploration and discovery.\"",
      "Jim Bridenstine, Nelson's predecessor at the helm of NASA, helped kickstart the agency's Artemis moon program during the first Trump administration.",
      "He said in a statement Wednesday that \"Jared's vision for pushing boundaries, paired with his proven track record of success in private industry, positions him as an ideal candidate to lead NASA into a bold new era of exploration and discovery. I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm him.\"",
      "The Isaacman announcement comes as NASA struggles to keep the Artemis program on track amid tight budgets and what the agency's own inspector general calls the \"unsustainable\" costs of NASA's Space Launch System, or SLS, moon rocket.",
      "SpaceX supporters argue the company's more powerful, fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship rocket is the obvious choice for deep space exploration, but the huge rocket is far from operational with just a half-dozen suborbital test flights to its credit.",
      "The SLS, on the other hand, is considered operational in that it completed an initial test flight in November 2022, sending an unpiloted Orion capsule around the moon and back. But unlike the Super Heavy-Starship, the SLS is a throwaway, expendable booster expected to cost some $1.4 billion for each of its first four moon missions.",
      "NASA is currently gearing up to launch three NASA astronauts and a Canadian flyer on an SLS-Orion mission \u2014 Artemis 2 \u2014 late next year. But problems with the first Orion's heat shield and other issues threaten to push the Artemis 2 flight into 2026, years past initial expectations.",
      "It's not yet clear when the Artemis 3 mission, the first to carry astronauts to a landing near the moon's south pole, might be feasible.",
      "But that flight will feature a lunar lander built by SpaceX, a variant of the company's Starship upper stage. SpaceX has carried out six test flights of the fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship to date, but has not yet put the Starship upper stage into orbit or brought it down for an intact landing.",
      "Given the company's rapid-fire test schedule, most observers believe SpaceX will get the Super Heavy-Starship working as planned in the near future, but scores of test flights will be required to demonstrate the safety and reliability required by NASA to put astronauts aboard.",
      "And the moon mission poses unique challenges.",
      "For the initial landing mission, multiple Super Heavy \"tanker\" flights will be required to refuel the moon lander in low-Earth orbit before it can be sent to the moon. Once in lunar orbit, it will await the arrival of the Artemis 3 crew, launched aboard an Orion capsule by an SLS rocket.",
      "After boarding the Starship lander, two astronauts would descend to the surface, carry out the mission's planned exploration, and then head back up to the orbiting Orion for the trip back to Earth.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 14:40:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Amazon allegedly stopped its fastest delivery service to almost 50,000 Prime subscribers in two District of Columbia ZIP codes.",
    "story": [
      "Amazon secretly excluded two ZIP codes from its fastest delivery service while charging nearly 50,000 Prime members who live in the areas its full Prime subscription price, the District of Columbia's attorney general alleges in a lawsuit filed Wednesday.",
      "Amazon violated consumer protection laws by stopping its quickest delivery service to the two historically lower-income neighborhoods, then misled customers about why their packages were arriving later than advertised when they complained, according to the suit filed in D.C. Superior Court.",
      "The world's biggest online retailer's paid subscription service, Amazon Prime, offers two-day delivery for millions of items, as well as next-day or same-day for many other products for $139 a year, or $14.99 a month.",
      "Amazon in June 2022 decided to stop using its fleet of branded trucks to make Prime deliveries to D.C. ZIP codes 20019 and 20020, servicing them instead with third-party delivery services like UPS and the U.S. Postal Service. The company knew the decision would result in significantly slower deliveries for the areas, but did not tell existing or prospective customers, the suit alleges.",
      "Amazon informed the attorney general's office that the change came as the result of safety concerns for its drivers, the attorney general said. Yet the company was legally obligated to disclose the change to customers.",
      "\"Amazon is charging tens of thousands of hard-working Ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide. While Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one ZIP code is worth less than a dollar in another,\" D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb stated in a news\u00a0release.\"We're suing to stop this deceptive conduct and make sure District residents get what they're paying for.\"",
      "Amazon Prime two-day delivery",
      "Last year, the rest of the city's Prime members received packages within two days of checkout 75% of the time, but those in the impacted ZIP codes received their orders within two days just 24% of the time, according to the suit.",
      "Amazon dismissed as \"categorically false\" claims that its business practices are discriminatory or deceptive.",
      "\"We want to be able to deliver as fast as we possibly can to every ZIP code across the country, however, at the same time we must put the safety of delivery drivers first,\" an Amazon spokesperson said in an emailed statement.",
      "The spokesperson added, \"In the ZIP codes in question, there have been specific and targeted acts against drivers delivering Amazon packages. We made the deliberate choice to adjust our operations, including delivery routes and times, for the sole reason of protecting the safety of drivers.\"",
      "The company said it's clear with customers about expected delivery dates. \"And we're always transparent with customers during the shopping journey and checkout process about when, exactly, they can expect their orders to arrive,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Amazon would like to work with the attorney general's office to reduce crime and improve safety in those areas, the spokesperson stated. \"Nevertheless, we will proceed in the process and demonstrate that providing fast and accurate delivery times and prioritizing the same of customers and delivery partners are not mutually exclusive.\"",
      "The lawsuit is not the first time Amazon has been accused of providing discriminatory service.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 10:27:28 -0500",
    "summary": "About 3.7 million people are at immediate risk of losing health coverage should the federal government cut funding for Medicaid expansions, as some allies of President-elect Donald Trump have proposed.",
    "story": [
      "With Donald Trump's return to the White House and Republicans taking full control of Congress in 2025, the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion is back on the chopping block.",
      "More than 3 million adults in nine states would be at immediate risk of losing their health coverage should the GOP reduce the extra federal Medicaid funding that's enabled states to widen eligibility, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, and the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families. That's because the states have trigger laws that would swiftly end their Medicaid expansions if federal funding falls.",
      "The states are Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia.",
      "The 2010 Affordable Care Act encouraged states to expand Medicaid programs to cover more low-income Americans who didn't get health insurance through their jobs. Forty states and the District of Columbia agreed, extending health insurance since 2014 to an estimated 21 million people and helping drive the U.S. uninsured rate to record lows.",
      "In exchange, the federal government pays 90% of the cost to cover the expanded population. That's far higher than the federal match for other Medicaid beneficiaries, which averages about 57% nationwide.",
      "Conservative policy groups, which generally have opposed the ACA, say the program costs too much and covers too many people. Democrats say the Medicaid expansion has saved lives and helped communities by widening coverage to people who could not afford private insurance.",
      "If Congress cuts federal funding, Medicaid expansion would be at risk in all states that have opted into it \u2014 even those without trigger laws \u2014 because state legislatures would be forced to make up the difference, said Renuka Tipirneni, an associate professor at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health.",
      "Decisions to keep or roll back the expansion \"would depend on the politics at the state level,\" Tipirneni said.",
      "For instance, Michigan approved a trigger as part of its Medicaid expansion in 2013, when it was controlled by a Republican governor and legislature. Last year, with the government controlled by Democrats, the state eliminated its funding trigger.",
      "Six of the nine states with trigger laws \u2014 Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Montana, North Carolina and Utah \u2014 went for Trump in the 2024 election.",
      "Most of the nine states' triggers kick in if federal funding falls below the 90% threshold. Arizona's trigger would eliminate its expansion if funding falls below 80%.",
      "Montana's law rolls back expansion below 90% funding but allows it to continue if lawmakers identify additional funding. Under state law, Montana lawmakers must reauthorize its Medicaid expansion in 2025 or the expansion will end.",
      "Across the states with triggers, between 3.1 million and 3.7 million people would swiftly lose their coverage, researchers at KFF and the Georgetown center estimate. The difference depends on how states treat people who were added to Medicaid before the ACA expansion; they may continue to qualify even if the expansion ends.",
      "Three other states \u2014 Iowa, Idaho and New Mexico\u2014 have laws that require their governments to mitigate the financial impact of losing federal Medicaid expansion funding but would not automatically end expansions. With those three states included, about 4.3 million Medicaid expansion enrollees would be at risk of losing coverage, according to KFF.",
      "The ACA allowed Medicaid expansions to adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or about $20,783 for an individual in 2024.",
      "Nearly a quarter of the 81 million people enrolled in Medicaid nationally are in the program due to expansions.",
      "\"With a reduction in the expansion match rate, it is likely that all states would need to evaluate whether to continue expansion coverage because it would require a significant increase in state spending,\" said Robin Rudowitz, vice president and director of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF. \"If states drop coverage, it is likely that there would be an increase in the number of uninsured, and that would limit access to care across red and blue states that have adopted expansion.\"",
      "States rarely cut eligibility for social programs such as Medicaid once it's been granted.",
      "The triggers make it politically easier for state lawmakers to end Medicaid expansion because they would not have to take any new action to cut coverage, said Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families.",
      "To see the impact of trigger laws, consider what happened after the Supreme Court in 2022 struck down Roe v. Wade and, with it, the constitutional right to an abortion. Conservative lawmakers in 13 states had crafted trigger laws that would automatically implement bans in the event a national right to abortion were struck down. Those state laws resulted in restrictions taking effect immediately after the court ruling, or shortly thereafter.",
      "States adopted triggers as part of Medicaid expansion to win over lawmakers skeptical of putting state dollars on the hook for a federal program unpopular with most Republicans.",
      "It's unclear what Trump and congressional Republicans will do with Medicaid after he takes office in January, but one indicator could be a recent recommendation from the Paragon Health Institute, a leading conservative policy organization led by former Trump health adviser Brian Blase.",
      "Paragon has proposed that starting in 2026 the federal government would phase down the 90% federal match for expansion until 2034, when it would reach parity with each state's federal match for its traditional enrollees. Under that plan, states could still get ACA Medicaid expansion funding but restrict coverage to enrollees with incomes up to the federal poverty level. Currently, to receive expansion funding, states must offer coverage to everyone up to 138% of the poverty level.",
      "Daniel Derksen, director of the Center for Rural Health at the University of Arizona, said it's unlikely Arizona would move to eliminate its trigger and make up for lost federal funds. \"It would be a tough sell right now as it would put a big strain on the budget,\" he said.",
      "Medicaid has been in the crosshairs of Republicans in Washington before. Republican congressional leaders in 2017 proposed legislation to cut federal expansion funding, a move that would have shifted billions in costs to states. That plan, part of a strategy to repeal Obamacare, ultimately failed.",

      "According to consultancy Project Blue, China accounted for 98.8% of refined gallium production and 59.2% of refined germanium output this year. Last year, it accounted for 48% of globally mined antimony, which is used in items including nuclear weapons, ammunition and batteries.",
      "\"The move is a considerable escalation of tensions in supply chains where access to raw material units is already tight in the West,\" Project Blue cofounder Jack Bedder told Reuters.",
      "China issued the new ban just two days after the U.S. curbed exports to 140 companies in China's semiconductor industry. The U.S. crackdown \u2014 the third in three years \u2014 was aimed at stymieing China's ability to advance artificial intelligence technologies for military applications.",

This is an Islamic militia that has risen up and has continued and now is successfully toppling the Assad regime. As your report indicated, it's al Qaeda in its origins, but it opposes ISIS. It is Turkish-backed. This is a blow to Iran, a blow to Russia. We're seeing what is likely a disintegration in Syria. The big questions will be, what does this mean for the US? What does it mean for Iran, Russia, the neighbors of Israel and Jordan, which are strong allies of the United States?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you mentioned there, and we showed the picture of Abu Muhammad al-Golani. He is the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, people call HTS. You're going to hear a lot about that in the coming days and weeks, the rebel group that appears to be taking control. But they are working also with the Prime Minister. The United States government has a ten million bounty on the head of Jolani. Do you think the United States still should keep that? Should Americans be concerned that this will mean something in terms of impact for terror threats to the United States?",
      "REP. TURNER: This is a terrorist organization and group, but this is not going to be just a passing of power and authority. It could be. We'll have to, obviously, watch that. You know, one of the things that we do see here, though, is this is a diplomatic failure with respect to the United States and Turkey. You know, the U.S. has troops in Syria. This is on the border of Turkey. Turkey is a NATO ally. The United States is working with the Kurds. This really could have been an opportunity for the United States to work to try to resolve the issue between the Kurds, Turkey and the United States and working with Turkish interests in Syria. Hopefully this could be an opportunity where there could be a diplomatic support there that hopefully could have- help in this transition in Syria.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are 900 US troops in Syria in the South. Donald Trump in 2019 pulled US troops out of northern Syria, abandoning our allies there. Do you believe he will stand by the 900 US troops that remain there? Or should he consider pulling them out when he takes office?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well I think, you know, one of the things that Donald Trump will make clear is, is that any any threat to us, troops will be unbelievably responded to. So everyone should understand, absolutely, the United States troops are to be secure. The second thing is, is he does absolutely support the Kurds and that he's going to look for a diplomatic solution. I think there will be an assessment as to whether or not those troops should remain. But it's, you know, I think here there is an opportunity for the parties, especially now that Iran and Russia's roles are going to be domin- diminished. They have been brutal in their support with Assad, the hundreds of thousands of people, including use of chemical weapons that have been killed, have been under the Russian influence there. Russia still has two bases, a naval and air force base there that are going to be, you know, both at risk for Russia, but also a risk to the population of Syria because they could- they have been used before to attack the Syrian population. We'll have to see what Russia does there. But this is going to be an area that's going to be highly volatile and in transition.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And no idea where Bashar Al Assad might have fled to?",
      "REP. TURNER: No, not at this time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, since we're talking about the incoming administration, Donald Trump has chosen Tulsi Gabbard, the former Congresswoman, a former Democrat, now Republican, to be the Director of National Intelligence, overseeing 18 intelligence agencies. She not only went and met with Assad, she publicly doubted high confidence assessments by U.S. intelligence that he did what we showed you pictures of him doing, using chemical weapons there. Do you trust that she could actually represent the intelligence community, lead it and be trusted to brief the Commander in Chief?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, I obviously differ in a great deal in a number of areas with both her judgment and and her background and experience, but what I do trust is the\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013You're smiling when you're saying this\u2013",
      "REP. TURNER: The Senate is the Senate process, and I think this- the senators are going to put her through a process. She has been nominated. She will go through the process, and I think there will be significant debate and evaluation. I think\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013You don't think she'll be confirmed?--",
      "REP. TURNER: \u2013that Donald Trump has put together in his last term, and I think he will in this term, a great national security team. I think CIA director, Radcliffe, I think Mike Waltz as National Security Director, are both great examples of people who are going to be foundational. I think you're going to see a great national security team.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is a community that you also have oversight of, so you may not vote in the Senate, but it sounds like she doesn't have your confidence. What about Pete Hegseth to run the Pentagon at a time of global instability?",
      "REP. TURNER: Yeah, I think the Chairman of the Armed Services in the Senate made a great statement. He said, we certainly support the process, and he has his support going through the process, and we'll have to see how that goes through. One thing that is absolutely clear is that the Pentagon needs reformed. We are not keeping pace with what Russia and China are doing in advanced weapon systems. At the same time, we're seeing the weapon systems of advanced technology that are being utilized on the battlefield of Ukraine, and our acquisition systems and our accounting systems, our spending systems are not working at the Pentagon\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -That requires experience\u2013",
      "REP TURNER: \u2013We need reform. We need reform. Someone has to be able to lead that, and that's going to be the debate in the Senate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I love when I ask Congresspeople, and they just keep reminding me that they don't sit in the Senate and don't want to comment. I sense some some uncertainty there on your part, but I don't want to put words in your mouth. I want to ask you though about what is ticking down in Congress right now, and that is something there's a scramble at the end of this year to get a bunch of work done. Your Democratic colleague in the Senate, Mark Warner, said \"it is an urgent priority to address cybersecurity gaps in these final weeks.\" Is it a priority for you to do something because of this massive breach by China, of U.S. Telecom?",
      "REP. TURNER: You know, one thing that's- it's very disappointing, and we've seen from this administration, this this malaise of this stasis of where they're unable to move as a result of the president unable to make a decision. Here we have this massive breach, this hack that has occurred from China, but we're hearing nothing from the president himself, no action from this administration as to what their- what consequences that will be. This is not- doesn't need just a technological fix. This needs also a diplomatic fix, a nation to nation, consequences to China\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013What would consequences look like?",
      "REP. TURNER: Now in the Obama administration, in the Obama administration, China hacked the personnel management system of the US government, and there were no consequences, and now we're seeing China hack the entire system of the nation. There needs to be consequences. They can be economic. They can be in a number of ways. But right now we have zero, we have nothing coming out of the administration. What need to be talking about is not technologically how do we fix this? But how do we address, which is what Donald Trump is doing, is coming in and saying China is our most, gravest threat. How do we address the fact that China is aggressively attacking the United States, and they're doing that in our telecom?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Question for the incoming administration to pick that up. Thank you, Chair Turner. \"Face the Nation\" will be back in a minute. Stay with us."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Mouaz Moustafa, executive director for the Syrian Emergency Task Force, and Andrew Boyd, former director of the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 8, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For some analysis on the events unfolding in the Middle East, we're joined now by Andrew Boyd, a CBS News contributor who previously held leadership positions at the CIA and once served in Damascus as a Foreign Service Officer, and Mouaz Moustafa, the Executive Director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force. Welcome back to \"Face the Nation.\" Mouaz, I want to start with you. You've been involved with the Syrian opposition for well over a decade. Help us understand what it means to see the regime fall.",
      "MOUAZ MOUSTAFA, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE SYRIAN EMERGENCY TASK FORCE: It's an indescribable feeling of- of happiness that- that this regime, this dictator who has made the worst crimes of the 21st century, alongside Russia, and Iran, and ISIS, all of these horrible people have been defeated by a coalition of rebel forces that did not need any support from any outside country, not Turkey, not Qatar, not anyone. This time around, Syria was liberated by its people, for its people. And it's truly inspiring. And it's not just good reverberations for Syria, for the Middle East and Europe as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a lot of uncertainty as to what this all means. Andy, you've watched this region very closely for some time. At this hour, none of the officials that I have spoken with in regional governments, in the U.S. government, seem to know where Bashar al-Assad even went. Does it matter where he went?",
      "ANDREW BOYD, FMR. CIA CENTER FOR CYBER INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR: Mouaz may differ on this one. I don't think it does, now that the government has fallen. I do think what unfolds over the next couple of weeks, and- and if the opposition actually treats all of the factions in Syria with dignity and respect and- and ensures their safety, we will have more understanding, because you know, there's a lot of atrocities that were carried out by the Assad regime. Those people are probably still in Syria, and so we'll see how that goes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A fair point, the people who worked within the regime are still there.",
      "BOYD: Syrian military intelligence, the mil- the other intelligence services, Syrian General Intelligence Directorate, I mean, have- have a lot of blood on their hands.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, and I know that you personally, Mouaz, were involved in smuggling out documented evidence of some of the torture, of the mass atrocities, the systematic, institutionalized violence that happened from some of those prisons. You brought it to Congress. You made it public. What do you think we can learn now, as those billing- buildings are being seized by rebels?",
      "MOUSTAFA: Well, the first thing that we are working really hard, and I can tell you all the rebel factions are working really hard to do, is find Austin Tice and hopefully bring him home, God willing, alive, to his family\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: An American journalist who once worked at CBS News for some time, a Marine veteran.",
      "MOUSTAFA: And he's a hero. He went to cover the plight of the Syrian people from what Assad, Iran, and Russia have been doing to them, and God willing, we bring him home alive, but we need to find him and bring him to his mom no- no matter what. And the Syrians owe him a debt forever. Also, other Americans that are undeclared. And freeing Syrians from- from prisons is something that's really important, but the collection of that intelligence as well as the Hezbollah, Iranian, Russian, Assad regime, any officials that have been arrested by the Syrian people, again, without any support of the international community or regional countries, who actually worked to try to save Assad, that is valuable, that's valuable to the United States. That's why we need to engage with this new, emerging government that God willing, is the path to democracy. The only Arab country in the world with the hope of being a democracy is Syria. That's incredible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That- that's a big promise to make.",
      "MOUSTAFA: It's not a promise, it's hope, that's realistic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Hope. Andy- but right now, the person we're seeing emerge\u2014we showed him, in Umayyad Mosque, hugely symbolic place to come and make a speech, in Damascus\u2014is this leader of a terrorist group, designated by the United States as a terrorist, $10 million bounty on his head.",
      "BOYD: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that signify to you?",
      "BOYD: Well, as Congressman Turner said, it's not going to be an easy process to un-designate Abu Muhammad al-Jawlani\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which means the U.S. can't talk to him.",
      "BOYD: The U.S. can't talk to him. I mean, you know, we can accommodate some sort of flexibility there, but he's not going to instantly come off the designation list. So, I mean, we'll see. I mean, you have said that- that he's going to respect all the factions, the Druze, the Christian, even the Shia and Alawi, who were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of 1000s of Syrians\u2014",
      "MOUSTAFA: I'm speaking by his actions, not by his words. Aleppo, et cetera. You could talk to the Bishop of Aleppo, but, yeah, absolutely.",
      "BOYD: Right, but, you know, time will tell. I mean, I'm a born skeptic, as a lot of my colleagues at the agency are. We will see.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead, Mouaz. Tell us who is in this- you talked about it as a coalition, not just HTS. Who are these people who now seem to be in control of Syria?",
      "MOUSTAFA: Sure. First of all, since the whole world is boiling down the whole Syrian revolution to one faction of a coalition, or let's say, even one person within a faction of that coalition, let's discuss that. Why was HTS put on the terrorist list? It was put on a terrorist list over an older version called Jabhat al-Nusra that had a loose affiliation with al-Qaeda, not the transnational or regional terrorist thing, but an inter-Islamist, whatever. I don't agree with any\u2014",
      "BOYD: But- but Mouaz, I think Margaret's talking also as a person Abu Muhammad al-Jawlani. I mean, he was in al-Qaeda in Iraq. He worked for Abu Musab Zarqawi. He spent several years in Bucca prison as a detainee, you know, so, we're also, we're talking HTS, Jabhat al-Nusra, but also him as a person. He's designated\u2014",
      "MOUSTAFA: Sure, let's talk about him as a person. But what's hilarious about this is, right now, as millions of Syrians come back from Europe and are ready to come back home, as people have not been displaced, and there has been zero reports of violations, and I was on the phone with the Bishop of Aleppo. The reason I was on the phone is that President Trump, and people in President Trump's camp were concerned about the Christians in Syria. Of course, there's so much focus on, you know, any time there's something- terrorists, terrorists. And- and what ended up happening is the Bishop of Aleppo said, Sir, first, it's the coalition of groups, including HTS, and we have had electricity more now than we have under the regime, and our only fear is Russian air strikes. So I'm glad that President Trump still- told Russia what it should do: get out of Syria, and it has done so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will be watching to see whether that continues to be the case and what transpires. And what it means for the\u2014",
      "MOUSTAFA: One- one last thing, Margaret, it's really important\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mouaz, I have to go. I'm so sorry.",
      "MOUSTAFA: But al-Qaeda in Syria [UNINTEL], it's the affiliate, and HTS has defeated it and defeated ISIS. The old designation is kind of irrelevant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will be watching this developing story, and we'll be right back."

They were going to work through the night to get it ready. And then you find out afterwards that there was no coordination, there was no team meeting, there was no, well, this is going to be your responsibility to know where you're supposed to be and what time you're supposed to be there.",

When they morphed them into Homeland Security back in 2001, 2 \u2013 whenever it was, they took away their identity and their exclusivity. When you're the best of the best, when you're the elite of the elites\u2026",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: \u2026 if you lose that, then all of a sudden you just become part of a team.",
      "There was a huge mistake back when Homeland came into existence. That's not a criticism, because they did what they had to do back then. But I'm telling you, on July 13, there was a lack of professionalism, there was a lack of concern, there was a lack of coordination.",

      "But there is a systematic problem here. The structure, the personnel, the staffing of the Secret Service, hasn't changed in years, at the same time as we are now asking them to do things that they didn't do a decade ago.",
      "And they are \u2013 they are fulfilling an operational tempo that requires them to be deployed\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 three weeks out of a month, constantly doing events, skipping firearms training, skipping leadership development training. We are not developing their skills and their training. And I think you see the results of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you made three dozen recommendations in this report on what to change, including to reduce the number of protectees.",
      "Right now, Secret Service protects not only presidential leadership, their immediate families, their spouses, their children, candidates, and anyone really the president designates. Should all of that continue?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: We've increased the size of protectees that are out there, including foreign assets that come here and people that bring \u2013 bring their families and things. So that's gotten so big.",
      "But, if you look at Homeland, I think \u2013 I think, when you look at Secret Service, it's about 3 percent of their overall spend. The biggest spend is on FEMA. And, now, we don't want to change anything like that.",
      "But you can't have an exclusive without funding them to the level that they need to be funded, not only in manpower and in training, but in the assets that they have to have available to them.",

So, if you're not actually adequately performing any of those missions to standard, and if you have reached a breaking point, then it's time to assess, what are those missions that need to fall off and to be transitioned elsewhere?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: What drove him to do it? Was he a lone wolf shooter? Did he have associates or affiliates? What was his motivation? How was he radicalized?",
      "We endeavored to get answers to those questions. We submitted numerous requests to the Department of Justice and FBI. Their response is, this is an ongoing criminal investigation, and we can't give that information to Congress.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For both Butler and Mar-a-Lago, that was the answer?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Correct. That's right.",

      "So now that leaves us with two, a ban or a sale. We don't want to see it banned. I would add that President \u2013 president-elect Trump has also said he doesn't want to see it banned. So now let's talk about the sale.",

      "FRANK MCCOURT: \u2026 so it's not shut down.",

      "So, Tik \u2013 U.S. TikTok is a piece of ByteDance. If it's sold, it will be sold without an algorithm. So the value will be far, far less than 200 \u2013 $200 billion. We have circled over $20 billion to be in a position, and we're very serious about raising whatever capital is required to buy the platform.",

      "FRANK MCCOURT: \u2026 we're looking to move the 170 million users over to a new protocol, where the individuals will own and control their identity and their data. We're not looking to replicate the existing version.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, let's talk about that.",
      "As you said, 170 million Americans use TikTok, especially young people. U.S. law prohibits foreign control of mass media, but this social media space is kind of a loophole here. There aren't a lot of governing rules in this space.",
      "Do you think Congress needs to write new rules of the role \u2013 of the road to ban foreign ownership and to put restrictions on even owners like you?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: I think we need to upgrade our regulations and our policies. There's no doubt about that.",
      "But, far more importantly, we need to fix the technology. The Internet is broken, fundamentally broken. We heard your guest earlier Representative Turner talk about the threat from China on our telecom hack, massive hack, massive threat to Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they're still in the telecom system, according to U.S. intelligence.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Absolutely.",
      "And we heard your recent guests, Representatives Kelly and Crow, talk about the deluge of misinformation and disinformation, the fact that it's a very dangerous world right now.",
      "The reason why the Congress moved so quickly with TikTok to pass the legislation is because it is a national security threat to Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: And the reason why the judges upheld it is for that same reason.",
      "So let's turn a problem into a solution by taking advantage of this moment, move the 170 million users over to a new protocol where individuals are respected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have an indication from president-elect Trump that he wants to see an American entity buy this? Because he would also have some influence in the outcome.",

      "Let's make a deal where everybody wins, where China's able to sell the U.S. portion of TikTok, where American citizens are protected, and where there's \u2013 and 170 million users continue to enjoy the platform. So he has said he doesn't want it banned, which means a sale.",
      "And the legislation and the \u2013 the appellate decision require that this platform be \u2013 be owned by Americans. We have built a clean, bottom-up American stack to move this user base over, where there will be no Chinese backdoors and no ability to \u2013 to take advantage of American citizens.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You \u2013 you're indicating you've built out some technology, you think, that will not allow for government surveillance?",

      "FRANK MCCOURT: Yes, well, that's exactly what we don't want to do.",
      "So the reason why we want to move people to a new stack where you can't harvest without permission, so individuals will own and control their identity and their data, permission its use, will actually have an Internet that respects people, as opposed to exploits them.",
      "Imagine empowering people. And, to be clear, Margaret, I'm not looking to be the CEO of TikTok. We call it the people's bid, because we want this to empower people and to stop this nonsense where we're exploiting people by scraping their data and taking advantage of them, and, in the case of TikTok, actually creating a national security threat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Elon Musk, who owns X, formerly known as Twitter, now has raised concerns about content moderation restricting free speech. Do you share that concern, and what restrictions would you put on paid political advertising?",

    "summary": "The task force is wrapping up its work probing security failures surrounding the July 13 and Sept. 15 assassination attempts.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado, the top Democrat on the bipartisan House task force investigating the assassination attempts against President-elect Donald Trump, said he's concerned that \"there's a culture of silence\" at the Secret Service that prevents agents from speaking out when they should.",
      "\"I was struck by the stories in the recount of the specific actions of officers and agents on the ground that day,\" Crow said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"There were some heroic ones, but there were also a lot of examples of people that knew that something was wrong and they didn't say anything.\"",
      "The task force, which the House voted to establish earlier this year, in recent days wrapped up its work probing security failures surrounding the July 13 assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, and the Sept. 15 foiled attempt in West Palm Beach, Florida. In the wake of the initial attack, the Secret Service came under intense scrutiny, leading to the resignation of its director.",
      "Last week, Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe testified before the panel in its final hearing, where he acknowledged the Secret Service's failure to adequately secure the area in Butler, noted \"critical gaps\" within the agency's operations and said \"we did not meet the expectations of the American public, Congress, and our protectees.\" He noted that it has been his \"singular focus to bring much-needed reform to the Secret Service.",
      "He added that the agency is \"operating in a heightened threat environment, with expanding protection requirements.\"",
      "\"The responsibilities of the Secret Service are critical to the national security of the United States,\" Rowe said, adding that \"our agency is not defined by one failure, but by our ability to learn from mistakes.\"",
      "Task force chairman Rep. Mike Kelly, a Pennsylvania Republican whose district includes Butler, said the agency lacks the leadership it needs. And he argued that when the Secret Service was brought under the umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security, \"they took away their identity \u2014 their exclusivity.\"",
      "\"When you're the best of the best, when you're the elite of the elites, if you lose that, then all of a sudden you just become part of a team,\" Kelly said on \"Face the Nation.\" \"That was a huge mistake.\"",
      "On the July 13 attack, Kelly said the Secret Service failed \"at every step of the way.\"",
      "\"They failed from the first thing, from the picking of the site, the preparing the site to the coordination of the site, the ability to communicate,\" Kelly said, adding that there was no team meeting before the event, and local law enforcement wasn't included in the planning.",
      "\"On July 13, there was a lack of professionalism, there was a lack of concern, there was a lack of coordination, and the ability to communicate is the one thing I'll never understand,\" Kelly said. \"You knew you couldn't talk to each other. Why did you go forward?\"",
      "Crow said important questions remain about the shooter in Butler and would-be shooter in West Palm Beach, saying that the task force submitted numerous requests to the Justice Department and FBI about their motivations. Crow claimed that the requests have been denied because the criminal investigations are ongoing, calling it an \"unacceptable position\" and accused the agencies of trying to \"stonewall\" Congress on the issue.",
      "The Colorado Democrat argued that when it comes to the Secret Service, there is a \"systematic problem here.\" He noted that although there are \"plenty of extraordinary agents and officers\" in the Secret Service, there was a \"failure of mission\" in Butler.",
      "\"The structure, the personnel, the staffing of the Secret Service hasn't changed in years, at the same time as we are now asking them to do things that they didn't do a decade ago,\" Crow said, saying the tempo of the job leaves agents without time for adequate training. \"We are not developing their skills and their training, and I think you see the results of that.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Kelly said the task force has been working since Day One to try to help restore trust and confidence in the Secret Service, which he said was likely at \"the lowest ebb\" in its history. And he acknowledged the relentless pressure on the Secret Service.",
      "\"You've got to be ready every single moment for anything that could possibly happen. Is that a difficult task? Yes, is it almost impossible?\" Kelly said. \"But you know what's not impossible, our dedication to the fact that we're going to do the best we can do every single day to ensure that the American people have the faith and trust and confidence they must have in us.\"",

      "Mr. Biden says the administration is \"clear eyed\" about the possibility that ISIS may try to gain control amid a power vacuum, but he said that \"we will not let that happen.\" He noted that the U.S. conducted precision airstrikes within Syria targeting ISIS camps and operatives.",

      "He called on opposition groups to \"seek a role in governing Syria\" and demonstrate their commitment to Syria's people, the rule of law and protection of minorities.",
      "The president credited his administration's work in other foreign conflicts with contributing to the collapse of Assad's government, arguing support for Assad from Iran, Hezbollah and Russia fell apart \"because all three of them are far weaker today than they were when I took office.\"",
      "Mr. Biden said Iran had made a \"historic mistake\" when it \"chose to launch a multi-front war against Israel\" following the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas. He said Hezbollah has been \"badly degraded,\" as has Hamas, while Iran's military capabilities have been \"weakened.\" The dynamics, the president said, made it \"impossible\" for Hezbollah and Iran to continue to prop up the Assad regime.",
      "The president said Russia's support for Assad fell short because Ukraine has been able to inflict \"massive damage\" on Russian forces recently .",
      "\"The upshot for all this is, for the first time ever, neither Russia nor Iran nor Hezbollah could defend this abhorrent regime in Syria,\" Mr. Biden said, calling it a \"direct result\" of Ukraine and Israel's self defense with the \"unflagging support\" of the U.S.",

As Mr. Biden left the room, he ignored questions shouted at him until a reporter asked, \"What does the U.S. know about where Austen Tice might be and if he's safe?\"",
      "\"We believe he's alive, and we think we can get him back, but we have no direct evidence of that yet,\" Mr. Biden said. He told reporters, \"We have to identify where he is.",

      "\"THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!\" the president-elect said.",

So now let's talk about the sale. So we've been working for the last eight months on the assumption that the legislation would be upheld and that there would be a sale. So that's where we are right now, and we're working very, very hard to be in a position to buy the US portion of TikTok so it's not shut down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So what is that worth to you? There are estimates it could be as high as $200 billion in worth.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT:\u00a0 $200 billion would be more more in the range of what the entirety of the platform is worth, not just the US piece. And let's be clear, the Chinese government has said they're not selling the algorithm. They view that as IP of the country. So US Tiktok is a piece of bytedance. If it's sold, it will be sold without an algorithm. So the value will be far, far less than 200- $200 billion. We have circled over $20 billion to be in a position, and we're very serious about raising whatever capital is required to buy the platform and and to be clear, yeah, we're looking to move the 170 million users over to a new protocol where the individuals will own and control their identity and their data. We're not looking to replicate the existing version.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So let's talk about that. As you said, 170 million Americans use TikTok, especially young people. US law prohibits foreign control of mass media, but this social media space is kind of a loophole here. There aren't a lot of governing rules in this space. Do you think Congress needs to write new rules of the role- of the road to ban foreign ownership and to put restrictions on even owners like you?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: I think we need to upgrade our regulations and our policies. There's no doubt about that. But far more importantly, we need to fix the technology. The internet is broken, fundamentally broken. We heard your guest earlier, Representative Turner, talk about the threat from China on our telecom hack, massive hack, massive threat to Americans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they're still in the telecom system.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Absolutely. And we heard your recent guests, Representatives Kelly and Crow, talk about the deluge of misinformation and disinformation, the fact that it's a very dangerous world right now. The reason why the Congress moves so quickly with TikTok to pass the legislation is because it is a national security threat to Americans, and the reason why the judges upheld it is for that same reason. So let's turn a problem into a solution by taking advantage of this moment, move the 100 and 70 million users over to a new protocol where individuals are respected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have an indication from President elect Trump that he wants to see an American entity buy this? Because he would also have some influence in the outcome.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Of course, as president elect he'll have massive influence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you spoken to him?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: But President Trump is a deal maker. We know that. I'm a deal-maker. Okay? I've been doing business deals my entire- my entire life. Let's make a deal where everybody wins, where China's able to sell the US portion of TikTok, where American citizens are protected, and where there's- and 170 million users continue to enjoy the platform. So he has said he doesn't want it banned, which means a sale. And the legislation and the- the appellate decision require that this platform be- be owned by Americans. We have built a clean, bottom-up American stack to move this user base over, where there'll be no Chinese back doors and no ability to to take advantage of American citizens.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're indicating you've built out some technology you think that will not allow for government surveillance.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But can you, if you are- whoever owns this is going to be powerful if you get 170 million Americans on a platform, particularly young people, to consume the information on this. System. So what guarantees do you make? Because Facebook and Twitter, they also harvest information about consumers. Would you?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Yeah, well, that's exactly what we don't want to do. So the reason why we want to move people to a new stack where you can't harvest without permission, so individuals will own and control their identity and their data permission its use, will actually have an internet that respects people as opposed to exploits them. Imagine empowering people. And to be clear, Margaret, I'm not looking to be the CEO of TikTok. We call it the people's bid, because we want this to empower people and to stop this nonsense where we're exploiting people by scraping their data and taking advantage of them, and in the case of Tiktok, actually creating a national security threat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Elon Musk, who owns X, formerly known as Twitter, now has raised concerns about content moderation, restricting free speech. Do you share that concern, and what restrictions would you put on paid political ads?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: I mentioned earlier that we need better policies, for sure, but we need better tech right now. We have a tech stack that's built and these giant apps scrape our data and exploit it. Why not flip the power? Why not actually give people their data back. Our data is our personhood in this age, let us decide how to use it. Let us each decide what moderation we're comfortable with, what censorship we're comfortable with, what privacy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so the Surgeon General says you need a warning label, because this is damaging the mental health of young people in this country. Should people under the age of 16 have access?",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: Under the current tech stack, I agree with the Surgeon General, under a new technology. Listen, I'm a builder. My family has been building for five generations. This is an engineering problem that can be fixed. Let's take this ban of TikTok, this massive national security problem and turn it into a solution for Americans. Let's make it a win, a win, win.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, mid-January, we will see what happens in this case, and we will watch your potential bid here. Thank you for joining us. We'll be back in a moment."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Reps. Mike Kelly, Republican of Pennsylvania, and Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 8, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you both for- for sitting here with us and for doing so in a bipartisan manner. The Secret Service did a pretty self-critical review of what went wrong on July 13 with that near miss on Donald Trump's life. They said a lack of diligence, communications gaps were responsible here. They took the blame, the director resigned. What more did you find that they didn't already fall on their swords for?",
      "REP. KELLY: Well, I guess I could start off because this is my hometown, right? And I thought from the very beginning, it probably wasn't the right size venue, because of- when the president had come to Butler before, he- about 50,000 people showed up. The venue we went to would really hold- they would hold a lot of people, but it's a very difficult venue to get in and get out of. I was more concerned with traffic, and how do I get tied up\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You thought that before?",
      "REP. KELLY: Yeah, when I- when they- when they first said they were coming to Butler, I thought they were going to come to the same place, and they said, no, they were going someplace different. So when you look at that, so to the- in the very start of it, and I didn't realize at the time, but once the campaign team makes a selection, they hand the keys over to Secret Service. And I think looking back on it, Secret Service would have been better at that point to say, you know what, we know you want to be in that town, but there's probably better places for you to be. This is going to be hard for us to secure. And as it turned out- I never imagined, by the way, that it was- the event that took place that day was going to take place, I just thought that Secret Service should have taken more command of it, especially when they're so strained. They- they're- during an election period, there's so many protectees out there, and it kind of marginalizes what they can do and where they can be. So I think the site was a difficult site to secure. On July 13, it was impossible. When they came back on October 5, it was the difference between day and night. They really locked it down, and they did a lot of things they probably should have done in the beginning, but it's always- hindsight's always 20/20. So I think what we- we heard from the very beginning the Secret Service, 'this is the worst day of our lives. We're embarrassed by what happened. We're so sorry.' But the other element was local law enforcement that usually would come in and help out. There was very little preparation for the event on July 13, and I think that's what I would say. The lack of preparation, the lack of coordination, and more than anything, the lack of communication on July 13, were some of the biggest things that we looked at. So how did you guys ever imagine that this would work? There's just nothing that makes sense that happened that day.",
      "REP. CROW: You know, I've learned in my time in Congress that, you know, agencies and departments, when they do after action reviews of things that have gone wrong, that they'll often look at the operational and the tactical level of what happened, but they almost never look at the structural level. You know, they don't critique their structure. They won't critique their- their superiors, the agencies that they're nestled within. They will very often not look at overall resourcing, money because of the politics of making asks like that. And they very rarely ever look at culture, right, because it's just too sensitive for them. So we- we actually took those, those areas really seriously. We looked at the Secret Service. Should it be nestled within DHS? Is it structured right? Does it get the resourcing and training? And then the area that I in particular looked at was the culture of the organization, because I was struck by the stories and the recount of the specific actions of officers and agents on the ground that day, and there were some heroic ones, but there were also a lot of examples of people that knew that something was wrong and they didn't say anything, right? So one example of this is the drone operator. So Secret Service has these drone operators, and they literally bought a drone off the market, a commercially available drone, they showed up with this drone in a box. It didn't work, they didn't know how to make it work, so they just put it aside and they didn't have a drone.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it wasn't that the Secret Service didn't have a drone? They just had a drone that didn't work, or they didn't know how to\u2013",
      "REP. CROW: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Use it.",
      "REP. CROW: Yeah. They- they bought one off the commercial market. The operator that was responsible for operating it was not trained on how to fix it, on how to troubleshoot it, so, you know, spent an hour trying to get it to work, couldn't get it to work, threw up his hands, put it aside and they were without a drone. And a drone could have prevented, potentially, the shooting. But, you know, the- the larger point of that story is not that they couldn't get the drone to work, which is problematic in and of itself, but that nobody said, hey, we don't have aerial coverage. We don't have a central element of our security plan. So let's revise- let's revisit our plan and make changes that are necessary here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But why? Because you- you did hone in on, during the hearing as well, on the issue of culture. Why didn't anyone say anything? Were they unaware of vulnerabilities? Or is there a culture of silence where people speaking up get smacked down for doing so.",
      "REP. CROW: That's- that- that is my concern, is that there's a culture of silence and that individual officers and agents are not empowered to say something is wrong. Now think about it this way. There are examples of this in- in our daily lives, right? When we all get onto an airplane, we get onto a flight to go anywhere, to visit our family, there- there is a standing rule in commercial aviation that anybody in the cockpit, regardless of your position, whether you're the captain or the first officer or the brand new pilot sitting there being trained, anyone at any time can call something out and say, this is unsafe, we're going to stop it, right? And that is designed for safety, and there are plenty of examples in which that actually saves people's lives.",
      "REP. KELLY: Absolutely.",
      "REP. CROW: That same mentality didn't appear to be a part of what happened at Butler, Pennsylvania. So the question is, how do we change- help change overall culture?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a very hard thing to solve for.",
      "REP. CROW: It's very hard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, Congressman Kelly on that point, I mean, some of this sounds like management 101, that this is not specific to the Secret Service. A lot of organizations have problems like what you just highlighted there. Acting Director Rowe testified Thursday. He thinks the Secret Service needs to identify leaders earlier on and promote them based on ability, not just hours logged on the clock.",
      "REP. KELLY: But isn't that true of everything in life? When you look at this, when people talk about, we need better leadership than that, but my question is then, where do you go to get that talent, and when you find that talent, do you let it escalate, or do you- do you tamp it down? I would just say, whenever we got further and further- the day- I was there, from the time they said they were coming to Butler to find- I was on those grounds the night before, they weren't set up at that point, they were going to work through the night to get it ready. And then you find out afterwards that there was no coordination, there was no team meeting, there was no 'this is going to be your responsibility to know where you're supposed to be and what time you're supposed to be there.' You bring local law enforcement in, but you don't- you don't include them in the planning, or when you do the- the interviews afterwards. 'Well, I thought he was going to do it.' 'No, we thought somebody else was going to do it.' When you look at local law enforcement, instead of one command center, there's two command centers, right? And they are not able to communicate with each other. The thing I think that we look at, more than anything else, and I've said this since day one, the day that- that it happened. Why, when you knew there was a suspicious person on the grounds, and this is a common- going back and forth now, this is where they said they weren't communicating with each other. You can't tell me that you didn't know till ten minutes after six, that you couldn't communicate. At 11 minutes after six, the shooter took action. They knew an hour and a half ahead of time. Out of all the thousands of the people walking around on that terr- on that property, there was a suspicious person, and they kept losing sight of him. I would have said, and I have no background in law enforcement, keep the president back until we clear the area. That's the part that doesn't make sense, because they failed, from the first thing- from the picking of the site, preparing the site, to the coordination of the site, to the ability to communicate, at every step of the way, they failed. And the question is, why didn't you just say, hold up, just hold up. Don't let him come out. If that happens, Corey Comperatore is still alive today. The other two gentlemen that were- were wounded are still alive today, and more- and the person we never talk about is the shooter would still be alive today had they captured him ahead of time or pulled him off. That family lost a son that day. The Comperatore family lost their father and a husband that day. The two people that were wounded, were seriously wounded. It all could have been stopped by somebody saying, hold up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, when the acting director says on Thursday of this week, we need to pick better leaders. That would suggest that the agency today does not necessarily have the leaders it needs to fix all the things you just laid out.",
      "REP. KELLY: Oh- yeah and I think by saying what he said, that's what he meant. They don't have the leadership they need, and as Jason was just talking about, when they morphed them into Homeland Security back in 2001, whenever it was, they took away their identity and their exclusivity. When you're the best of the best, when you're the elite of the elites, if you lose that, then all of a sudden you just become part of a team. And there's just something about it in human nature. If you can reach that pinnacle, if you can be the best of the best, that's what you want to strive for all the time. But if all of a sudden, it's like, just come on in, sit down, we'll let you know when we need you. That kind of destroys that whole foundation that you have to have. And I just- I just think it was- there was a huge mistake back when Homeland came into existence. That's not a criticism, because they did what they had to do back then, but I'm telling you, on July 13, there was a lack of professionalism, there was a lack of concern, there was a lack of coordination, and the ability to communicate is the one thing I'll never understand. You knew you couldn't talk to each other. Why did you go forward?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They were text messaging, right?",
      "REP. KELLY: Yeah, yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Not using the radio.",
      "REP. KELLY: Or cell phones.",
      "REP. CROW: Can I comment on that?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, please.",
      "REP. CROW: Here's what I think is happening with leadership development and the status of leadership within Secret Service. And I- I want to be really clear that there are plenty of extraordinary agents and officers in the Secret Service, right? And when we talk about a failure of mission, you know, in Butler or any place else, that doesn't mean that, you know, 80, 90% of the- of the Secret Service agents aren't phenomenal and dedicated professionals. But there is a systematic problem here, and I'm familiar with this problem because it's not that different from what the military has experienced the last 20 years because of the global war on terror. Let me explain what's happening. We were- we were at war for 20 years, and we- we were at war in several different places, and we asked our military to deploy constantly. And I was- I was in the military for around four years, and during that time, I deployed three times, so I was either in deployment, getting back from a deployment, or getting ready for a deployment the entire time I was in active duty military and we weren't doing our regular training cycles. So the military spent two decades doing that, and as a result of that, people missed their leadership development schools. They missed their training cycles. They missed that normal pipeline of how we create leaders. Because I'm somebody that believes that leaders are not born, that they're developed and they're made. And that requires intentional development over time, that requires a plan to develop it, and it requires time and resources to develop it. So you- you apply that to the Secret Service now, you know, the- the structure, the personnel, the staffing of the Secret Service, hasn't changed in years, at the same time as we are now asking them to do things that they didn't do a decade ago. And they are- they are fulfilling an operational tempo that requires them to be deployed three weeks out of a month, constantly doing events, skipping firearms training, skipping leadership development training. We are not developing their skills and their training. And I think you see the results of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The acting director said, you- they are looking to hire 650 special agents, 350 uniformed division officers. You just said building experience takes time, so they're trying to fix this, but it sounds like you could look at that and say they're not ready for the job they have now, in this moment in time.",
      "REP. CROW: There's a- there's a long-term problem and a short-term problem, right? The long-term problem is we actually need to make the commitment, the resourcing commitment, the structural commitment, and this is-this is a congressional responsibility, to set them up\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Funding.",
      "REP. CROW: \u2013for long term success. But in the short term, you're right. You can't mass produce a presidential detail Secret Service agent. It takes, on average, seven years to- from- from recruitment to training to get somebody ready to protect the President of the United States. We're- we're not going to speed that up, nor would anyone want to speed that up. That's not a situation where you want to shortcut that, just like you wouldn't want to speed up medical training for your doctor, right? So we have to look at, in the near term, then, who are those other individuals, those skill sets within Department of Defense, within Homeland Security, who can help cover down? And how can we use technology to actually supplement that, whether that's drones, AI, other things that can take pressure off of some of the agents doing regular jobs that- that can be shifted so we can cover down in the ways we need to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you made three dozen recommendations in this report on what to change, including to reduce the number of protectees. Right now, Secret Service protects not only presidential leadership, their immediate families, their spouses, their children, candidates, and anyone, really, the president designates. Should all of that continue?",
      "REP. KELLY: Well, it depends, you know, as Jason just laid out, it- what is your main purpose? Look, we've increased the size of protectees that are out there, including foreign assets to come here and people to bring- bring their families and things. So that's gotten so big, but if you look at Homeland, I think- I think when you look at Secret Service, it's about 3% of their overall spend, the biggest spend is on FEMA. And we know we don't want to change anything like that. But you can't have an exclusive without funding them to the level that they need to be funded, not only in manpower and in training, but in the assets that they have to have available to them. If you increase the size and scope of what they're supposed to do, but then you keep them housed under a smaller thing, and then try to move back and forth and bring just- not just, but when you bring other people from Homeland in to supplement what you don't have in Secret Service, you're going away, then, from that structure of, these are the people that we have ready to do this job. So I think what- and what- what the Director Rowe said yesterday, if you're looking at a bigger team, you have to get more recruits. And once you get those recruits, you have to make sure that they're ready to get on the field and do the job that they're expected to do. My understanding, it's very difficult now, screening and getting recruits to commit, I think it's a very hard thing to do. And who is it that you're looking for? The best of the best. How hard is it for them to get there? Really hard. So I think from a standpoint of team building, there has to be kind of a different things that- So he's a special ops guy, or paratrooper. And I mean, not everybody can be a paratrooper. It takes a lot of training, because you're not supposed to jump out of a plane unless it's going down right, and you need some help. But it takes a special breed--",
      "REP. CROW:",
      "-- It's a commentary on our mindset, the mentality of paratroopers, more than anything else, we're always a little bit off.",
      "REP. KELLY:",
      "Jump, jump. We were in Normandy this summer together- that's the first time we had met, and he said, I'm going to be jumping out of the airplane tomorrow. I said, why in the world would you do that? He said, because that's what I do. And I said, when was the last time you did it, on the 75th anniversary? I said, so five years ago was the last time you jumped out of a plane. Now go to what we're talking about today. If I talk to a Secret Service guy, says, when was the last time you protected somebody? Well, five years ago. I said, No, no, no, you're not the guy I'm looking for. You want the cream of the crop, right? But in order to get there, you have to develop where that person wants to be there so bad that he or she will do everything that's possible to get there and- and I think that's what we're looking for. We're looking for a really elite group. But then if we're going to ask them to make that commitment to our country, we should make our commitment to make it possible for them to be the best of the best.",
      "REP. CROW: So here's how I look at the issue of the structure of the Secret Service. I actually don't look at it differently than I look at the structure and the missions of any organization, whether it's a business, a community club or organization, a political campaign. You always have to ask yourself, what are your missions and what is the thing that only you can do? Like, what is that no-fail mission? In this case, with the Secret Service, that no fail mission is to protect our highest level candidates and our highest level elected officials. Period. All the other things, investigation of financial crimes, training and support, these are all secondary missions. So if you're not actually adequately performing any of those missions to standard, and if you reached a breaking point, then it's time to assess, what are those missions that need to fall off and to be transitioned elsewhere? That's my view. You can't--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want to cleave off the financial crimes unit?",
      "REP. CROW: -- I don't know how else we can handle it, right? If- if we have a challenge of not being able to mass produce agents, right, if it takes time to do that, and those are longer term muscle movements, as I say- and this is a no-fail mission. It just can't fail, today, tomorrow, the day after. Every single day, you have to show up and be perfect in that job. Then you have to, you just have to make a decision about what you're not going to do so that you can perform that no-fail mission.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Kelly, right after Butler happened, Donald Trump said he thought the Secret Service actually did a good job that day. Do you get the sense that with the passage of time, he's going to support or has any interest in some of the very specific recommendations that you're making?",
      "REP. KELLY: Okay, so I was about 60 feet away from the President when the shots rang out, and I just saw him grab his head and he went down, and I said, Oh my god, somebody just shot him. I will tell you this, within seconds, all these agents that were up on- the on the stage with him, covered him. Now, if I'm Donald Trump and I'm thinking, these guys were there, right there, the problem wasn't the people that were around him. The problem was the people around him weren't being communicated with by- from other people. So they were reacting to, boom, I got to be there. So if I were Donald Trump, I would be very thankful for that, right? But the question wasn't- was it the Secret Service that was around him? It was about the Secret Service and the rest of law enforcement, the rest of the people there to protect him, that outer shell--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- The infrastructure, the management, the support--",
      "REP. KELLY:-- It was the infrastructure that failed. It wasn't the group that was around him. So yes, if I'm him, I'm saying, yeah, thank you. You guys were able to put- you were going to put your life on the line to protect me. And they did it within a second or two. But then when he got back up, and I thought, this is, this is absolutely insane, it was just like, my gosh. I can't believe this happened. And then- I will say one thing, though, because it's- when he broke out of that, and he put his hand up, now, when you keep in mind, there's maybe 25, 30,000 people, and they're all on the ground. When he stands up and goes 'fight,' the rest of these people stand up, and I'm thinking, what in the world? And he- they're- they're chanting USA. I thought, you know what, this is a pretty tough country. You know, they all stand up and they start going, 'USA.' And I thought, oh my gosh. Now for me that day, it was difficult. My wife, three of my grandchildren, my son, were there with me, but they weren't where they were supposed to be because of the lack of coordination. So I had a lot of concerns that day. The first one being, where's my wife? Where's my grandkids? Where's my son? And there was a lady named Mrs. Fogel sitting beside me. Marc Fogel who is a teacher from Butler who is imprisoned in- in Russia right now. They were all there for this event. And you watch how quickly that happened and how- how afterwards, it's the after thought you think about, how in the world did this happen? How did this happen in Butler, Pennsylvania, the home of the Jeep and on farm show grounds and an attempted assassination of a president, it's like, wow, times have changed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And then weeks later, it nearly happened again down in Mar a Lago.",
      "REP. KELLY: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We know very little. And you Congressman Crow seemed very frustrated, based on the report and the hearing--",
      "REP. CROW: -- Do I seem frustrated?--",
      "REP. KELLY: -- No, no, you're very--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- with the fact that you couldn't find out more about the shooter, both in Butler and in- the potential shooter, in Mar a Lago?",
      "REP. CROW: Well, you know, we completed a five-month investigation which was comprehensive, it was thorough, and it tells, you know, the full story about the actions of the Secret Service and state and local law enforcement and what happened and what didn't happen. Right? That we have the definitive story of that, and we have recommendations around that. There is one area, as you point out, that we weren't able to get to. That- that's actually a really important element to the story. And people have rightful questions about it. I have questions about it. And that is, why did the shooter do this? What drove him to do it? Was he a lone wolf shooter? Did he have associates or affiliates? What was his motivation? How was he radicalized?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is Thomas Matthews Crooks?",
      "REP. CROW : That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who took these shots with an AR-15?",
      "REP. CROW: Yeah, these are important questions that America deserves answers to, that Congress deserves answers to. So we endeavored to get answers to those questions. We submitted numerous requests to the Department of Justice and FBI. Their response is, this is an ongoing criminal investigation, and we can't give that information to Congress. That, in my view, is an unacceptable position. And here's why--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- For both Butler and Mar a Lago, that was the answer?",
      "REP. CROW: Correct. That's right. And here's why that's unacceptable. Congress is what we like to say, is the article one branch of the Constitution. The founders made us first. They put us first in the constitution for a reason, because we are supposed to be the preeminent branch with oversight authority over the executive branch, with preeminent oversight authority over the executive branch. So you can't come and tell me that there's whole areas of information that we can't access because of an ongoing criminal investigation. And then to add to that, if they're concerned about the protection of that information, about the dissemination of that information, and compromising an investigation, I understand those concerns, but I sit on the Intelligence Committee, I've sat on the Armed Services Committee, and Congress all the time gets access to our nation's most sensitive secrets. Ongoing operations, intelligence operations, military operations, so you can't tell me that there isn't a way to put us into a secure facility and get us information about an ongoing criminal investigation when I regularly am receiving briefs on what our- our spies and our military special operators are doing regularly around the world. So none of this stands to reason, and we have dedicated ourselves to continue to get those answers. And if the FBI and DOJ thinks that they can wait us out and stonewall us, they are wrong.",
      "REP. KELLY: -- Good luck--",
      "REP. CROW: -- Because members of our task force, even after we sunset in a couple of weeks here, sit on all of these committees, and we will get that information.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why-- you used the term \"slowwalk\" us? You think they're intentionally withholding information?",
      "REP. CROW: I don't know what their intention is. I'm not a mind reader, but, you know, I've been around Congress long enough to know what- what people do--",
      "REP. KELLY: --When you get stonewalled--",
      "REP. CROW: --When you're getting stonewalled. I mean, listen, this is, this is not uncommon when you're dealing with agencies and departments. It's a pretty regular method, and it's something that, you know, we encounter all the time in our oversight responsibilities, so--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you think that is?",
      "REP. KELLY: You know what--\u00a0 in my life, right? And I've done a lot of different things, but most have been in the retail- in the public. It's always bothered me with there's a sense of paranoia with these agencies, and when you ask them a question, they would- they would try to come back to you, why are you asking that question? I said, well, why are you asking me why I'm asking that question? Why don't you just answer it and we can go to the next subject. It's- it's that holding back, that holding back, that holding back. It's like, well, we don't trust you.\u00a0 And that's a well, that's- that's why we're here today because you know what--",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --There is quite--",
      "REP. KELLY: --I'm not so sure the American people--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- a lot of political tension, --",
      "REP. KELLY: -- You know when we started--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN-- between the Congress and the Justice Department--",
      "REP. CROW: -- Well there should be. They're often like, hey,--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --and the FBI.",
      "[END CROSSTALK]",
      "REP. CROW: --you're out to get us. Like, well, we're not out to get you, but we are out to hold you accountable and to get answers. So, I mean, we're not, we're not here to- to, you know, just play nice all the time. We have independent obligations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean the seriousness of the task and what was being looked at you think should have compelled the FBI and the DOJ to share the information about what they know of the, now deceased, alleged shooter in Butler and the attempted shooter in Mar a Lago.",
      "REP. KELLY: Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What is it that you want to know about them? Because the public knows very little about Mr. Crooks, in particular.",
      "REP. KELLY: When you look at him and you try to find out- having four children and 10 grandchildren, parents are usually the best people to go to. You were talking earlier, you have family of your own. I think as a parent, you're more aware of what's going on with your child. What are her good days? What are her bad days? What is it that's bothering her? There's something there that's missing. I don't know what it is and I'm not making a criticism. It's just whenever we were asking questions and told, these are things that we're not done investigating yet, and we're tasked with getting something done in a time period. And at the very beginning of this, do you know our whole- our whole effort was to restore the faith and trust and confidence the American people must have in these institutions. When they stonewall you, when they hold you back, what would you automatically think? What is it they don't want us to know? Listen, I don't know enough about Mr. Crooks or the Crooks family. I just know that a lot of- a lot of things happened that day that didn't have to happen that day. But now, when you do the aftermath of, okay, so what is it we could have done different, and why aren't you telling us certain things that we need to know? Don't stonewall us because when you stonewall us, my feeling is, and I think Jason is the same way, there's something you don't want us to know. Was the failure where, and is it that you don't want to take that? Because as we went through all this stuff and the finger pointing, it wasn't my job, it was his job. And it's like, wait a minute. Just stop. Just stop. We're not here to get rid of you. We're here to make sure this doesn't happen again, to the best of our abilities. So it was frustrating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we don't know, or tell me if perhaps you know answers\u2013",
      "REP. CROW: Yeah we\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was there a foreign nexus? Do we know yes or no?",
      "REP. CROW: Margaret, I will get to that. But I want to, I just want to lay the groundwork a little bit for this issue. You know, we're in an age of incredible disinformation and misinformation. Americans are deluged with misinformation and disinformation that's coming from a variety of sources. Our adversaries, our state adversaries, Russia, China and others, non-state actors. And there's a lot of conspiracy theories out there. And conspiracy theories sometimes take root when there's a lack of information or there's conflicting information. So our job is to try to get information out there, to be transparent, to be accessible, to tell the real story. And that's why this is important. This element of that story is important because there's a lot of conspiracies around\u2013",
      "REP. KELLY: \u2013Absolutely\u2013",
      "REP. CROW: \u2013These shootings, right? And we take that seriously. We want to- we want to, you know, rebuff those. But you know, in this case, and I sit on a lot of other committees with access to information, I have seen no evidence that a state actor and adversary was responsible for either of these attempted assassination attempts. I have seen no evidence. But you know, when you're in a position where you know the government says, \"well, it's not this, but we won't tell you what it is.\" Right? And \"we can't tell you, we can't tell you definitively.\" Well, you know, people respond and have questions about that, and I understand that mentality. So even though we don't have evidence of one thing, people still want to know what else it is. And I still want to know what else it is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did he act alone? Do we know that?",
      "REP. CROW: We don't know that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or Congress doesn't know that.",
      "REP. CROW: Yeah, and you know, it's one thing to say, and I'm going to be really clear about this, because this is very, very sensitive territory, because we want to make sure we're not\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -Right\u2013",
      "REP. CROW: \u2013Getting people spun up unnecessarily. There is no evidence of- from other sources, you know, internal government sources, from our investigation, that others were involved, that he acted with others, and that a foreign state or adversary was involved in this. But that still raises the question of, why did he do this? Was just- was he just a disturbed young man who decided to take action alone? Probably, I mean, that's probably the answer.",
      "REP. KELLY: That's what it looks like now.",
      "REP. CROW: Right. That's what it looks like. But we need to know, right? And let's get the information out there that the government has to make sure that we can settle this. And that's, that's our obligation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And, you know, I asked you specifically about foreign nexus, because, as you know, Congressman Kelly, in the weeks leading up to this, there was more information about a direct threat to the now President-elect Donald Trump from the Iranian regime. It was a heightened threat environment. There was a specific, known actor that they were worried about, and because of that, security was increased. So we're not just talking about day to day Secret Service protection. You're talking about an environment where there were threats, known threats. So in that environment, that doesn't speak to a lot of- I mean, you laid out a lot of concerns you have.",
      "REP. KELLY: Oh, absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is the agency today able to do its job if they weren't able to do it in July?",
      "REP. KELLY: Well, I would sure hope that they understand that there's more oversight. And when you, when you as you speak, as a foreign government getting involved in it. It's part of the testimony. It's a back and forth between, actually, the people that were there saying \"I wonder if this could have been part of what they were referring to with a foreign adversary.\" I wondered why they didn't share more of it. And I think that- now these are the people you have on the ground doing the protection, and they're saying this as- afterwards, \"I wonder if this was what they were talking about, and why didn't we know more about it?\" In fact, some of them knew nothing about it at all. You know, back to what you said in the beginning, this is a preparation for anything that is, is the indication of whether it's going to go well or not. There's so many missing pieces on this one. And I think that we're frustrated. And I think the- the task force, the 30 people that were working on this every single day, were frustrated, too. How could there be so many missing pieces, this, it just doesn't make sense that none of this stuff came together, and on that day, none of it, none of it was coordinated. It was just thrown together. And now we look at it and think, you know what we were tasked with, trying to find out what happened that day, why it happened that day, into- into the best of our ability make sure that the Secret Service, that doesn't happen again to them. We can't guarantee that these things won't happen, because it's a crazy world right now. But there was too much ahead of time that we did know that we didn't share. And I- I know when you talk to them, the key to everything is communication. The lack of communication. I'll never understand when it comes down to that, and I'm not going to repeat it again, because I've said it- my wife said please quit talking that way, but I would never let my child play near a road. And when you do, you put people in jeopardy of that. And you know there's a danger there. Don't let it happen. This doesn't, I don't think it's- you don't have to have a degree and everything to understand protection is protection. The main job of Secret Service on that day was that they have protectees. And if that's, if that's our mission, then we can slow walk and help them out with different assets that maybe they don't have, but it was for me, that day, that was a signal that there's something wrong. And as we went through the task force, the inability to communicate, even with the- the federal agencies are on board, that just sends up a red flag right away. I said, why won't you tell us what we're asking you, and if it comes back, we don't know why we're asking- why you're asking us that. That is because we were tasked to find out. At the end of the day, the American people have to have confidence in you, and at this point, it's hard to have confidence with people who won't share information with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's- there are already proposals out there. One of your Democratic colleagues has proposed cleaving it off from DHS. Others have proposed other visions for what to do to the agency. In the new Congress, where does this rank in terms of priority?",
      "REP. CROW: Well, pretty high for us, right? I mean, as we already talked about, it's a very dangerous world. You know, you have Iran targeting- this is public now, there have been public indictments released by Department of Justice. You have Iran targeting for assassination, current and former administration officials, American elected officials, in the United States. You have, you have, you know, the Wall Street Journal reported not long ago about Chinese hacking of our telecommunication systems, possibly the largest hack and breach in American history. Our adversaries are doing troubling, deeply troubling things right now as we're sitting here speaking about it. So it's a dangerous world\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013and domestic actors. Heightened threat environment.",
      "REP. CROW: \u2013And domestic actors, domestic extreme- extremism too. You're absolutely right. So again, this goes back to this being a no-fail mission, having to make sure that we are both raising the fences around the things we need to protect, but also establishing deterrence with respect to our foreign adversaries. We can't be in a position anymore where our rivals, our adversaries, are doing these things without substantial cost, without substantial response to them. There has to be penalties imposed much harsher penalties imposed for them doing it because right now, clearly deterrence, in several important respects, has not been established. So, we are going to do both to make sure that our people are protected, because we just cannot be in a situation where our highest elected officials are at risk here.",
      "REP. KELLY: Totally agree.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm getting a wrap on time. But is there anything that you feel important to raise that we didn't talk about?",
      "REP. KELLY: Well I think that from the very beginning, we never identified as Republicans and Democrats. We, we defined as a task force to find out what happened that day. And the whole, the whole goal from day one is to restore the faith and trust and confidence that the American people must have in this agency. At this point it's probably at the lowest ebb it's ever been. And the other thing is, I think we realize that threats are 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, you can't take a day off. You can't take a play off. You've got to be ready every single moment for anything that could possibly happen. Is that a difficult task? Yes. Is it almost impossible? Yes, there's a lot of bad actors out there. But you know what's not impossible? Our dedication to the fact that we're going to do the best we can do every single day to ensure that the American people have the faith and trust and confidence they must have in us. We both represent three quarters of a million people. They sent us here to represent them. And so that's the message, I think, from day one, I would just- and this guy's got background in it, I don't. But our task force worked together so well. And I think the best thing is, you know what, there's not an election year which really can take the focus off of these different things that come up from a political standpoint. This isn't political for me. This is strong policy for the American people.",
      "REP. CROW: This is a tough place to work. And there are, frankly, there are some people here that don't belong here, that I think are just here to get attention to get, you know, clicks on social media, that aren't here to legislate. But this has been one of the best experiences of my time in Congress, and I couldn't have asked for a better partner than Mike Kelly. You know, and he's a very conservative Republican and I'm a Democrat. We're both proud of that. We're proud of our politics, and\u2013",
      "REP. KELLY: \u2013We are\u2013",
      "REP. CROW: We represent our districts, right?--",
      "REP. KELLY: \u2013We do, we do\u2013",
      "REP. CROW: That's actually, that's actually the job, right? We represent the culture and the politics and the hopes and dreams of our districts. And that's what's so, so beautiful about this place when it works well. But this process, and I think this is really important for Americans to understand, this process was serious, it was bipartisan, it was- it was deep, and we did the job that we were asked to do. And not a lot of people get exposure to that, you know, they just see these clips of people doing crazy things here. And I would just encourage people to read the report, to look at what we did here, and to know that, you know, important things can still get done.",
      "REP. KELLY: At the very end, the suggestions we have\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're very specific.",
      "REP. KELLY: They're very specific, but there's nothing that most people say, \"why in the world would they think of that?\" And then the answer is, that's the same way you would think, if you were going on a trip or doing anything and taking your children with you, you would- you go through that same checklist. Everything in life revolves around a checklist, and the worst thing you can do is stop using the checklist.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will see what happens in the new Congress with the new president and the choice of a potentially new director. Thank you.",
      "REP. CROW: Thank you.",
      "REP. KELLY: Thanks for having us."

    "summary": "An appeals court judge wrote that the law that would force a sale or ban of TikTok \"survive[s] constitutional scrutiny.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court upheld a law that will ban TikTok in the U.S. in the coming months if its Chinese parent company doesn't sell its stake in the app, dealing another setback to the widely popular video-sharing service in its battle with the federal government.",
      "A panel of three judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously sided with the Justice Department in declining to review the petition for relief from TikTok and ByteDance, its Chinese parent company, saying the law is constitutional.",
      "\"We conclude the portions of the Act the petitioners have standing to challenge, that is the provisions concerning TikTok and its related entities, survive constitutional scrutiny,\" Senior Judge Douglas Ginsburg wrote in the majority opinion. \"We therefore deny the petitions.\"",
      "Congress approved\u00a0a foreign assistance package in April that included provisions giving TikTok nine months to sever ties with ByteDance or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. President Biden quickly signed the bill into law, and it is set to take effect on Jan. 19, with the possibility of a one-time 90-day delay granted by the president if a sale is in progress by then.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump tried to ban TikTok during his first term in office, but reversed his position during the presidential campaign and vowed to \"save\" the app. He takes office on Jan. 20.",
      "Lawmakers and national security officials have long had suspicions about TikTok's ties to China. Officials from both parties have warned that the Chinese government could use TikTok to spy on and collect data from its roughly 170 million American users or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content. The concern is warranted, they have argued, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering.",
      "The appeals court's decision tees up a fight at the Supreme Court over the law's ultimate fate. The parties asked the judges to make a decision by Friday so there is enough time for the high court to review the case before the law takes effect. The justices could agree to hear the case and pause the law while they consider the legal arguments, or let the appeals court's ruling stand as the final word.",
      "TikTok expects the law will be overturned by the Supreme Court, according to spokesperson Michael Hughes, who argued the law is based on \"inaccurate, flawed and hypothetical information.\"",
      "\"The Supreme Court has an established historical record of protecting Americans' right to free speech, and we expect they will do just that on this important constitutional issue,\" Hughes said in a statement.",
      "The Justice Department, meanwhile, applauded the decision.",
      "\"Today's decision is an important step in blocking the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to collect sensitive information about millions of Americans, to covertly manipulate the content delivered to American audiences, and to undermine our national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. \"As the D.C. Circuit recognized, this act protects the national security of the United States in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution. The Justice Department is committed to defending Americans' sensitive data from authoritarian regimes that seek to exploit companies under their control.\"",
      "The court's decision",
      "\"The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States,\" Ginsburg wrote in his opinion. \"Here the Government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\"",
      "The appeals court said that it recognized the decision will have \"significant implications\" for TikTok and its users.",
      "\"Consequently, TikTok's millions of users will need to find alternative media of communication,\" Ginsburg said. \"That burden is attributable to the [People's Republic of China's] hybrid commercial threat to U.S. national security, not to the U.S. Government, which engaged with TikTok through a multi-year process in an effort to find an alternative solution.\"",
      "The D.C. Circuit found that the government's national-security justifications for banning TikTok \u2014 to counter China's efforts to collect Americans' data and limit its ability to manipulate content covertly on the platform \u2014 are \"wholly consistent\" with the First Amendment.",
      "\"The multi-year efforts of both political branches to investigate the national security risks posed by the TikTok platform, and to consider potential remedies proposed by TikTok, weigh heavily in favor of the Act,\" Ginsburg wrote. \"The government has offered persuasive evidence demonstrating that the act is narrowly tailored to protect national security.\"",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House China committee, praised the decision, calling it \"a loss for the Chinese Community Party,\" while also expressing optimism about the app's future in the U.S.",
      "\"I am optimistic that President Trump will facilitate an American takeover of TikTok to allow its continued use in the United States and I look forward to welcoming the app in America under new ownership,\" Moolenaar said in a statement.",
      "The House China committee spearheaded the bipartisan effort to pass the law.",
      "The legal arguments",
      "TikTok and ByteDance filed a legal challenge in May that called the legislation \"an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power\" based on \"speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation\" that would suppress the speech of millions of Americans.",
      "\"In reality, there is no choice,\" the petition said, adding that a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\"",
      "The Chinese government vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance said \"such a fundamental rearchitecting is not remotely feasible\" under the restrictions within the legislation.",
      "\"The platform consists of millions of lines of software code that have been painstakingly developed by thousands of engineers over multiple years,\" the petition said.",
      "During oral arguments in September, the appeals panel appeared skeptical of TikTok's argument that free expression outweighs national security concerns, but the three judges were also critical of the government's stance.",
      "TikTok's lawyer Andrew Pincus said the law \"is unprecedented and its effect would be staggering.\"",
      "\"This law imposes extraordinary speech prohibition based on indeterminate future risks,\" Pincus said. \"Notwithstanding the obvious less restrictive alternatives, the government has not come anywhere near satisfying strict scrutiny.\"",
      "Judge Sri Srinivasan said, under TikTok's rationale, the U.S. would not be able to ban a foreign country from owning a major media company in the U.S. if the two are at war.",
      "\"Is your submission that Congress can't bar the enemy's ownership of a major media source in the U.S.?\" Srinivasan, an Obama appointee, asked Pincus.",
      "When Pincus noted that news outlets like Politico and Business Insider are owned by foreign entities, Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, quickly chimed in: \"But not foreign adversaries.\"",
      "Rao also pushed back on Pincus' argument that Congress did not include any evidence of its claims that TikTok poses a national security risk in the legislation.",
      "\"I know Congress doesn't legislate all the time, but here they did,\" she said. \"They actually passed a law and many of your arguments want us to treat them as an agency. It's strange. It's a very strange framework for thinking about our first branch of government.\"",
      "Attorney Jeffrey Fisher, who represents TikTok creators, compared the restrictions on TikTok to the U.S. government hypothetically banning bookstores from selling books written by foreign authors in conjunction with a foreign government.",
      "\"We're not talking about banning Tocqueville in the United States,\" Rao countered. \"We're talking about a determination by the political branches that there's a foreign adversary that is potentially exercising covert influence in the United States. Very different.\"",
      "Ginsburg, a Reagan appointee, expressed skepticism over the notion that the law singles out TikTok.",
      "\"It describes a category of companies, all of which are owned by or controlled by adversary powers and subjects one company to an immediate necessity,\" he said, noting that the company and the government have been engaged in unsuccessful negotiations for years to try to find a solution to the national security concerns. \"That's the only company that sits in that situation.\"",
      "Justice Department lawyer Daniel Tenny said the data on Americans that could be collected through the app \"would be quite valuable to a foreign adversary if it were trying to approach an American to try to have them be an intelligence asset.\" Tenny also spoke about the risk of content manipulation by China.",
      "\"What is being targeted is a foreign company that controls this recommendation engine and many aspects of the algorithm that's used to determine what content is shown to Americans on the app,\" Tenny said.",
      "But Srinivasan said it's Americans' choice to use the app, despite what content may appear.",
      "\"The fact that that's being denied subjects this to serious First Amendment scrutiny,\" he said.",
      "He later added, \"What gives arguable force to the other side's First Amendment argument is that it's not just that the government is targeting curation that occurs abroad. It's the reason the curation occurring abroad is being targeted, and the reason is a concern about the content consequences of that curation in the U.S.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Biden is considering blanket preemptive pardons for prominent critics of President-elect Donald Trump in both parties to shield them from possible \"retribution\" or legal prosecution by the incoming administration.",
      "Multiple people familiar with the ongoing discussions tell CBS News the president has debated with senior White House aides the possibility of issuing the preemptive pardons, but no specific names have been formally recommended to him. The concept of preemptive pardons, and names of people who could benefit from them, have been more rigorously discussed among administration officials expected to help Mr. Biden make final determinations, a group that includes White House Chief of Staff Jeffrey Zients and White House Counsel Ed Siskel.",
      "Among those who could be eligible for preemptive legal relief include well-known names at the center of many of the most rancorous moments of the first Trump administration, many of whom remain the subject of his public ire.",
      "The list includes Dr. Anthony Fauci, who helped coordinate the nation's COVID-19 response and later served as Mr. Biden's top science adviser; retired Gen. Mark A. Milley, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who has called Trump a \"fascist\" and provided information for several books and news reports detailing the former president's behavior and activities around the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol; California Democratic Senator-elect Adam Schiff, and other Democratic and Republican lawmakers who led the two impeachment cases against Trump or sat on the House committee that reviewed the Jan. 6 attack \u2014   a group that includes former Wyoming Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, who actively campaigned against Trump this past fall.",
      "Fauci and Cheney were not immediately available for comment. Milley declined to comment.\u00a0In an interview with NPR in late November, Schiff said he didn't think a preemptive pardon is a good idea, because \"I think the courts are strong enough to withstand\" threats made by Trump.",
      "\"I think this is frankly so implausible as not to be worthy of much consideration,\" Schiff said. \"I would urge the president not to do that. I think it would seem defensive and unnecessary.\"",
      "News that Mr. Biden was considering preemptive pardons\u00a0was first reported this week by Politico. The White House initially would not engage on the subject this week, but confirmation that the idea is under consideration comes in the wake of the president's sweeping pardon for his son, Hunter Biden, shielding him from all potential criminal activity over 11 years.",
      "The pardon, the first ever issued by any American president for one of his children, came Sunday in the wake of Trump's announced plans to nominate Pam Bondi to serve as attorney general and Kash Patel to lead the FBI. Bondi, Patel and others set for positions in the second Trump administration have spent years discussing plans to seek retribution for Trump's critics or to take steps to stifle news outlets considered critical or hostile to the president-elect.",
      "Rep. Brendan Boyle, Democrat of Pennsylvania, first publicly suggested this week that Mr. Biden should issue preemptive pardons.",
      "\"Trump has made it clear that he is more focused on settling personal scores than on protecting the American people or upholding the rule of law,\" he said in a statement of Trump's plan to nominate Patel to lead the FBI.",
      "In addition to issuing preemptive protection to Trump's political enemies, Mr. Biden is also preparing to grant more traditional \"criminal justice pardons\" in the coming weeks for nonviolent drug offenders or others who've served time for various offensives and are often the beneficiaries of presidential pardons, according to one of the people familiar with his plans.",
      "The White House has been fielding hundreds of requests for such pardons or clemency, including from Rev. Jesse Jackson,\u00a0who this week wrote to the president asking for pardons\u00a0for his son, former Illinois Democratic congressman Jesse Jackson Jr., and his daughter-in-law, former Chicago Alderwoman Sandi Jackson. This week House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, suggested Mr. Biden should pardon \"on a case-by-case basis the working-class Americans in the federal prison system whose lives have been ruined by unjustly aggressive prosecutions for nonviolent offenses.\"",

But filings also showed that Musk was also behind a political action committee using the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's namesake \u2014 \"RBG PAC\" \u2014 in advertisements with misleading claims that Ginsburg held views on abortion that were similar to Trump's.",
      "Ginsburg's granddaughter, Clara Spera, told The New York Times in October that the PAC was an \"affront to her grandmother's legacy,\" and it was \"nothing short of appalling\" that Ginsburg's name was being used to support Trump's reelection campaign. Ginsburg openly supported abortion rights, whereas Trump put three conservative justices on the Supreme Court who were part of the majority opinion in the case striking down the federal right to an abortion.",
      "Musk put $20.5 million into the PAC, the only contribution it received. The group ran advertisements emphasizing Trump's statements that he would veto a national abortion ban if elected, and pointing to Ginsburg's statements that the decision in Roe v. Wade went too far.",

      "Through the America PAC, his main campaign vehicle, Musk and a handful of other donors funded a get-out-the-vote effort through door-knocking, texting, phone calls, mailers and advertisements.",
      "By far, America PAC's biggest expense was a $40.5 million payment to United States of America, Inc, a company registered last month with an address associated with Musk. It's unclear how exactly those funds were used.",
      "In October, Musk also pledged to give away $1 million a day to a registered voter in Pennsylvania who signed his petition. The sweepstakes were challenged in court, but a judge ruled that they could proceed. Musk's lawyers said the winners were not chosen by chance, but instead based on their personal stories, and the funds were part of a contract they signed to become spokespeople for his America PAC. Musk is now facing multiple lawsuits from participants who claim it was falsely billed as a lottery.",
      "He rose as a major political donor rapidly. In March, he posted on X, the social media platform Musk owns, that he would not donate to either presidential candidate. And then on July 3, he made his first contribution of $5 million to America PAC. Ten days later, he publicly announced his endorsement of Trump and quickly became a key figure in the former president's campaign.",

      "Washington \u2014 The family of Austin Tice, the freelance journalist who was kidnapped in Syria more than 12 years ago, said they have been told that he is alive and well, and they're frustrated with the U.S. government's inability to bring him home.",
      "\"We have from a significant source that has already been vetted all over our government, Austin Tice is alive, Austin Tice is treated well. And there is no doubt about that,\" Debra Tice, his mother, said at a news conference on Friday at the National Press Club.",
      "She said her son \"is being cared for and he is well.\"",
      "Tice, a Marine veteran and journalist who worked with several news organizations including CBS News, the Washington Post and McClatchy, disappeared on Aug. 14, 2012, while he was reporting on the Syrian civil war. A short video that appeared weeks later on YouTube and Facebook showed a distressed Tice blindfolded with his apparent captors. It was the last time he was seen.",
      "No one has ever claimed responsibility for his disappearance, but President Biden has said the U.S. knows \"with certainty that he has been held by the Syrian regime.\"",
      "The family said the U.S. government is preventing the release of information about the source of Austin Tice's well-being. But asked whether her son is being held by the Syrian government, Debra Tice said, \"We've always known that.\"",
      "Marc Tice, his father, said the new information \"is very different\" from past leads.",
      "\"We are confident that this information is fresh. It indicates as late as earlier this year that Austin is alive and being cared for,\" he said.",
      "Debra Tice added that the information is credible because \"almost every entity in the United States government regarding security has verified it.\"",
      "The missing journalist's parents and siblings traveled to Washington for meetings with government officials this week as a\u00a0Syrian rebel offensive challenges Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime.

      "They met with the National Security Council, including Mr. Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan, on Friday before their news conference. They met with the State Department on Thursday.",
      "The family said they asked whether the offensive in Syria could be leveraged in the journalist's favor and implored Sullivan for a commitment that Mr. Biden would reach out directly to Assad. But the family did not receive any assurances, they said.",

    "summary": "The group Students for Fair Admissions challenged the U.S. Naval Academy's use of race in its admissions program.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal district court on Friday upheld the U.S. Naval Academy's race-conscious admissions policies, rejecting a challenge brought by the group Students for Fair Admissions following the Supreme Court's landmark decision ending affirmative action in higher education.",
      "U.S. Senior District Judge Richard Bennett wrote in a 179-page decision that the Naval Academy \"established a compelling national security interest in a diverse officer corps\" for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, and tied its use of race in admissions to \"the realization of an officer corps that represents the country it protects and the people it leads.\"",
      "Bennett said the academy's race-conscious admissions policy must receive deference extended to military judgments, which he said are set by the president and not the federal judiciary.",
      "\"The Naval Academy's race-conscious admissions policies are narrowly tailored to further a compelling governmental interest in national security,\" he wrote. \"Defendants have proven that the Naval Academy's limited use of race in admissions has increased the racial diversity of the Navy and Marine Corps, which has enhanced national security by improving the Navy and Marine Corps' unit cohesion and lethality, recruitment and retention, and domestic and international legitimacy.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Naval Academy said it is reviewing the court's decision. Edward Blum, president of Students for Fair Admissions, said the group is \"disappointed\" by the ruling and will appeal.",
      "\"It is our hope that the U.S. military academies ultimately will be compelled to follow the Supreme Court's prohibition of race in college admissions,\" he said in a statement.",
      "The challenge to the Naval Academy's admissions policies was brought by Students for Fair Admissions in October 2023, just three months after the Supreme Court ruled that race-conscious admissions policies used by colleges and universities were unconstitutional. The group was behind the cases that led the high court to reject affirmative action in higher education in June 2023.",
      "Students for Fair Admissions' lawsuit came in response to a footnote in the majority opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, which said the decision did not apply to the nation's service academies. The organization sought to expand the Supreme Court's affirmative action ruling to include the Naval Academy, based in Annapolis, Maryland, and the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York, which it separately sued in September 2023.",
      "Students for Fair Admissions had argued that the Naval Academy's admissions process was unconstitutional because it discriminated based on race. But the service academy argued that a racially diverse officer corps is necessary to execute the Navy's mission and provide national security.",
      "The court held a nine-day trial in September, which included testimony from 18 witnesses.",
      "\"The evidence in this case clearly indicates that the Naval Academy does not employ quotas, admit candidates based solely on their race or ethnicity, or place minority candidates on separate admissions tracks,\" Bennett, who served over 20 years in the U.S. Army Reserve and Maryland National Guard, wrote.",
      "The court found that the Naval Academy's admissions policies mandate that race be taken into consideration only in limited circumstances. In each of those instances, Bennett said, race is \"nondeterminative\" and is one of several factors used to assess an applicant's potential as a midshipman and eventual officer in the Navy or Marine Corps.",
      "Additionally, the court found that the Naval Academy has implemented \"extensive race-neutral factors\" within and outside of its admissions policies in an effort to achieve diversity, such as socioeconomic factors, whether an applicant has faced adversity or if a candidate is a first-generation college student. The court also highlighted the academy's recruiting and outreach efforts, which it said are \"extensive and multifaceted.\"",
      "\"The Naval Academy has established a compelling national security interest in a diverse officer corps in the Navy and Marine Corps. Furthermore, that interest is indeed measurable, and the Academy's admissions program is narrowly tailored to meet that interest,\" Bennett wrote. \"In short, this court defers to the executive branch with respect to military personnel decisions.\"",
      "The Naval Academy typically receives between 14,000 and 16,000 applicants and admits roughly 1,000 midshipmen each year. Those students then enter the Navy or Marine Corps officer corps for a five-year commitment after graduating. The admissions process is rigorous \u2014 in addition to submitting SAT or ACT results, a high school transcript and personal information, prospective students must also participate in an interview and receive a nomination from a member of Congress, the vice president, president or secretary of the Navy. Applicants must also pass a physical exam performed by a Defense Department review board.",

      "ST. PAUL, Minn. \u2014 After losing his bid for vice president on the Democratic ticket this November, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he is not ruling out running for a third term in the state's top office.",
      "\"I've always said the decision to do that is really driven more by the people as they start to see if there's a desire in the direction we're going. If we see the support is there, then I would listen,\" Walz said in an interview Thursday, his first with WCCO since the campaign ended.",
      "Walz, who is halfway through his second term, said the decision about his political future will come sometime next year, but for now he is focused on the legislative session that begins in January. The make-up of the capitol will look different: A tied Minnesota House between Republicans and Democrats will end the DFL trifecta of the last two years, which saw passage of an onslaught of progressive policy wins like paid family leave, gun safety measures, legalized cannabis, abortion rights and more.",
      "That means Minnesota is back to divided government, a defining feature of his first term in office. He pledged to work with Republicans to pass the next budget, which is the big task on the to-do list next year.",
      "And the state faces a bleak financial outlook in future years. State budget prognosticators said that the state is spending more money than revenues it's taking in, which could lead to a $5 billion deficit.",
      "\"I would also make the case that our political climate is not as damaged as the national [climate] yet. I think it's still there. And look, I'm not naive, but we proved it in 2019. We were still able to get some things out,\" Walz said. \"So I think coming back now into a climate that looks like we're going to get a split House gives us an opportunity to kind of prove to the country again that we can get stuff done.\"",
      "Minnesota doesn't have term limits for governor, but If Walz were to run again, it would be notable. Democrat Rudy Perpich is the only Minnesota governor in modern history who has served three terms, though they weren't consecutive. Former Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty\u00a0tried unsuccessfully for a third term in 2018.",
      "Reflecting on the '24 campaign, Walz says he needs to \"learn more about America\"",
      "Walz's track record as governor is part of the reason Vice President Kamala Harris chose the former school teacher-turned-politician\u00a0to be her running mate. In reflecting on his time as the vice presidential nominee, Walz said he was proud of the campaign and that it was a privilege to travel across the country to make the case to voters.",
      "But he fell short.",
      "\"I think what we have to understand is the mood where people are at and understanding where they're at. I think economic issues did impact them,\" Walz told WCCO. \"I think we're going to have to understand \u2014 what type of leadership do they want? We were pledging to be inclusive. We were pledging to bring people in. Donald Trump has said that that isn't what he wants, and so if that's what America is leaning towards, I guess for me, it's to understand and learn more about America because I thought that they were going to probably move towards a more positive message.\"",
      "The Democratic Party is having a reckoning in the wake of defeat\u00a0\u2014 not only for the White House but also in Congress, where Republicans will control both chambers. Walz said his biggest lesson in losing was to listen more and for Democrats to think about how they are communicating their message.",
      "Support among working-class people propelled President-elect Donald Trump to victory. He acknowledged those trends.",
      "\"I think we're gonna have to figure out, are we communicating \u2014 I think we're communicating the right way, but are we communicating in the right spaces? Are we communicating to where people are at and where they're listening to?\" Walz said. \"To have Donald Trump seen as a champion of the middle class, I fully don't see how that would happen, but I recognize that's where people voted. So I think we have to both decide, is the message the right one?\"",
      "California is \"Trump-proofing\" its policies. Will Minnesota do the same?",
      "Democrats in California \u2014 with supermajorities in the state legislature and control of the governor's office \u2014 are in a special session to fund the attorney general's office so it's prepared to \"Trump-proof\" the state.",
      "Minnesota's political balance in St. Paul is vastly different and it's highly unlikely Republicans who will share power in the House will agree to do something similar to California. But Walz said he is contemplating what it would look like if Trump acts on some of his promises, like eliminating the Department of Education\u00a0and\u00a0clawing back money unspent for climate initiatives.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump wants former lawmaker and auctioneer Billy Long to replace IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he wants ex-congressman Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri and a former auctioneer, to run the IRS. As a lawmaker, Long co-sponsored legislation that aimed to wipe out much of the tax code.",
      "In making the announcement, Trump praised Long's \"32 years of experience running his own businesses in Real Estate and, as one of the premier Auctioneers in the Country.\" He also noted that since leaving Congress in 2023, Long has worked as a business and tax adviser.",
      "While Trump didn't mention the current IRS Commissioner, Danny Werfel, in his announcement, the decision signals the president-elect is likely to replace him with Long after taking office in January, Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Naming Long as the next IRS chief drew both support from conservatives as well as criticism from the left, with Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia who serves on the House Ways and Means Tax subcommittee calling it a \"terrible mistake,\" while Idaho Republican Senator Mike Crapo issued a statement saying he's looking forward to hearing Long's ideas for the tax agency. The fiscally conservative National Taxpayers Union Foundation praised Trump's choice, saying Long could help reform the IRS.",
      "Long has recently served as a tax adviser to businesses seeking to employ a controversial tax credit, but, unlike prior IRS commissioners, his background is largely outside of the tax industry, experts noted.",
      "\"This guy is an auctioneer \u2014 that's his expertise,\" Owens noted. \"This is an incredibly unserious choice.\"",
      "Werfel, who was appointed by President Biden, stepped into the role in 2023, with his term set to expire in 2027. Typically, presidents allow IRS commissioners to serve out their term, as Mr. Biden allowed Trump's former IRS appointee, Charles Rettig, to do before naming Werfel to the role.",
      "If the Senate approves his appointment to the IRS, Long would oversee an agency with 85,000 employees and an annual budget exceeding $12 billion.",
      "A spokesperson for the Trump campaign declined to comment.",
      "Here's what to know about Long and the IRS.",
      "Who is Billy Long?",
      "Long, who attended the University of Missouri but didn't graduate, described himself on a\u00a0website\u00a0for his congressional run as a \"fourth-generation native of Southwest Missouri.\" He touted his skills as an auctioneer, noting that he had been named the \"best auctioneer in the Ozarks for seven years in a row.\"",
      "Long also worked in real estate and in talk radio, hosting a show on a Missouri AM radio station.",
      "He shuttered his auction firm, Billy Long Auctions, before he was sworn into Congress in 2011, according to a local publication.",
      "What professional experience does Long have with taxes?",
      "As a congressman, Long co-sponsored some tax-related bills, including several efforts to eliminate the estate tax as well as a measure called the Tax Code Termination Act.",
      "That legislation would have wiped out much of the current tax code, replacing it with what the bill called a \"simple and fair system\" that would have applied \"a low rate to all Americans.\" Such flat taxes are considered regressive by many experts because low- and middle-income taxpayers would end up paying a larger share of their incomes than would wealthy Americans.",
      "\"As a business owner, Billy knows first-hand how government regulation and heavy taxes can affect the small businesses that serve as the economic engine of our country,\" his campaign site noted.",
      "While Long isn't an accountant or CPA, he has been involved in tax advising since leaving Congress. In a 2023 podcast, for example, he touted his work helping businesses use the Employee Retention Tax Credit, a credit that the IRS has\u00a0flagged for its high rate of fraud.",
      "In the podcast, Long also said that when he served as a congressman, he helped make the ERTC easier for businesses to claim, noting that the credit was difficult to qualify for during its first iteration.",
      "\"We went from having to say COVID adversely affected your business definitely, to taking that away, and you don't have to prove that you had any downturn,\" he said. \"We're doing recoveries for folks that had their best two years ever during COVID.\"",
      "The IRS says the ERTC is aimed at employers who paid wages to workers between March 12, 2020, and January 1, 2022, and that were either suspended by government order during the pandemic or experienced a \"required decline in gross receipts during 2020 or the first three calendar quarters of 2021.\" The credit is also available to startups that began at the end of 2021 and had less than $1 million in revenue.",
      "How does Long's experience compare with prior IRS commissioners?",
      "Long's lack of tax industry experience sets him apart from other recent IRS commissioners.",
      "Werfel, the current IRS chief, has an undergraduate degree from Cornell University and a master's degree in public policy from Duke University as well as a law degree from the University of North Carolina. He's also held a number of government jobs involved in operations and the IRS, including serving as acting commissioner of the IRS from May to December 2013, according to his biography.",
      "Werfel's predecessor, Charles Rettig, who was appointed by President-elect Trump, also held several degrees, including a master's in taxation. Before joining the IRS, Rettig worked as a tax attorney for more than three decades and served as the chairman of the IRS Advisory Council.",
      "What is happening with the IRS now?",
      "Under Werfel, the IRS has expanded audits of wealthy taxpayers and big corporations, clawing back billions in unpaid taxes, efforts that were funded by the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "The tax agency has also reduced the time it takes consumers to connect with an IRS employee, while also rolling out a free tax filing system called Direct File.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have pushed back against the expanded IRS funding, claiming\u00a0the agency would use the money to hire thousands of new agents to increase audits on middle-class taxpayers.",
      "The Treasury had said that funding could help the IRS add nearly 87,000 full-time workers over 10 years, but the agency didn't specify whether those new workers would be auditors, customer service workers or other types of employees. That figure also represented the total number of employees that could be hired, without calculating the impact of the number of IRS workers who are expected to retire or leave the department over the next several years.",

      "The shower will peak from Friday Dec. 13 into early Saturday Dec. 14 \u2014 when the moon is nearly full, according to NASA. Illumination from the moon could make spotting the cosmic show a challenge during the peak, but bright meteors can be spotted the week before the peak.",
      "Here's what you should know about the Geminids meteor shower, including how to watch:",
      "Where you can see the Geminids",
      "Meteors from the Geminids will be visible throughout the sky and across the globe, according to NASA. They're best viewed in an area far away from city and street lights.",
      "Viewers \u2014 who should prepare for frigid temperatures \u2014 should lie flat on their backs with their feet facing south. Give your eyes a half hour to adjust to the dark.",

      "EarthSky, an astronomy website published by experts in the field, suggests finding a way to block out the moon when watching for the Geminids.",
      "\"So with moonlit skies in 2024, you might only catch the brightest meteors,\" according to EarthSky. \"Luckily, many of the Geminids are bright meteors. Try blocking out the moon when watching for meteors.\"",
      "Are any nights this year good for Geminid viewing?",
      "Casual observers won't be able to pick up any noticeable activity from the Geminids until the night of Dec. 11, according to Bill Cooke, lead of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. More than half of the moon's surface will already be illuminated by the sun at that point of the month, so it will still cause some problems with meteor viewing.",
      "Astronomy fans determined to see the Geminids without interference from the moon's light may have some luck if they're willing to get up after moon-set around 3:30 a.m. local time, Cooke said. Even then though, it will be a challenge to spot many Geminids an hour.",

At the time, there were 10 to 20 meteors an hour, but the shower has grown bigger and meteors are now visible at a rate of 120 meteors an hour under perfect conditions.",
      "While most meteors appear to be colorless or white, NASA scientists say the Geminids are bright, fast and usually yellow in color. They streak through the sky at a speed of 22 miles per second.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 21:07:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Heat shield damage seen during the first Artemis test flight is now understood, NASA says, but more time is needed to implement fixes.",
    "story": [
      "Less than a year after announcing major delays for the next two Artemis moon missions, NASA managers said Thursday the projected flight dates are slipping once again, with the first piloted voyage around the moon now expected in the April 2026 timeframe, and the first lunar landing in mid 2027.",
      "NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said the delays are needed to revise the Orion crew capsule's re-entry trajectory to reduce stress and prevent the sort of unexpected heat shield damage seen after an unpiloted 2022 test flight \u2014 and to complete extensive testing of the capsule's environmental control and life support systems.",
      "\"Based on the data, we have decided, unanimously, to move forward with the current Artemis 2/Orion capsule and heat shield with a modified entry trajectory...to lessen the heat coming back into the Earth's atmosphere,\" Nelson said.",
      "\"Additionally, we need to complete our updates to the Orion environmental controls and the life support systems that were identified earlier this year.\"",
      "Future heat shields for the Artemis 3 moon landing mission and subsequent flights will use essentially the same materials but with modifications to improve their performance during re-entry.",
      "In the meantime, Nelson said, \"We are planning for Artemis 2 to launch in April of '26 and we're going to do all in our power, with our commercial partners, to launch earlier.\"",
      "The Artemis program aims to send astronauts to the moon's south polar region where ice deposits may allow crews to one day extract oxygen and hydrogen to produce air, water and rocket propellants that would not have to be carried up, at great expense, from Earth.",
      "Following the launch of Artemis 2, Nelson said NASA is going \"to make (any) adjustments that are necessary, and we plan to launch Artemis 3, the first landing on the moon in over a half century. Assuming the SpaceX lander is ready, we plan to launch Artemis 3 in mid-2027. That will be well ahead of the Chinese government's announced intention (of sending taikonauts to the moon in) 2030...We need to get this Artemis 2 test flight right to ensure the success of our return to the moon.\"",
      "NASA launched the Artemis program's first test flight, Artemis 1, in November 2022, using the agency's new Space Launch System, or SLS, rocket to send an unpiloted Lockheed Martin-built Orion capsule on a looping flight around the moon and back.",
      "NASA had planned to launch the Artemis 2 mission at the end of this year to carry a three-man one-woman crew around the moon to thoroughly test the spacecraft's life support, propulsion and other systems.",
      "But after the Artemis 1 flight, engineers discovered the Orion capsule's 16-foot-wide heat shield suffered unexpected damage during it's high-speed return from the moon using a technique called a \"skip entry.\"",
      "In a skip entry, the capsule dips into the atmosphere, slows and rises back up before dropping back into the atmosphere for the final descent. The idea is similar to how a flat rock can skip across a still pond. Skip entries provide a number of benefits, including a wider range of splashdown targets.",
      "The Orion heat shield is designed to ablate, or char, during re-entry when the spacecraft enters Earth's atmosphere at more than 25,000 mph. But the charred material is intended to stay in place, providing a layer of insulation. During the Artemis 1 re-entry, more charred material separated from the heat shield than computer models predicted.",
      "While the unexpected \"liberation\" had no impact on the spacecraft \u2014 NASA said astronauts would not have even noticed had any been on board \u2014 engineers wanted to make sure they understood the underlying cause so they could update computer models to accurately predict re-entry effects across multiple trajectories.",
      "After hundreds of tests and an exhaustive engineering analysis, NASA has \"since determined that while the capsule was dipping in and out of the atmosphere as part of that planned skip entry, heat accumulated inside the heat shield's outer layer,\" said Pam Melroy, a former shuttle commander and now deputy administrator of NASA.",
      "That heat build up led to \"gases forming and becoming trapped inside the heat shield,\" she said. \"This caused internal pressure to build up and led to cracking and uneven shedding of that outer layer.\"",
      "While the same type of heat shield will be used for the Artemis 2 mission in April 2026, the crew will use a modified re-entry trajectory to reduce the sort of heating that damaged the Artemis 1 heat shield.",
      "As for the Artemis 3 lunar landing flight, the new mid-2027 target launch date assumes SpaceX's lunar lander, a variant of the upper stage used by the company's new Super Heavy-Starship rocket, completes multiple test flights in Earth orbit, along with at least one unpiloted lunar landing.",
      "On Wednesday, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he was selecting billionaire Jared Isaacman, a space veteran with strong ties to SpaceX founder Elon Musk, to serve as NASA's next administrator.",
      "During the news conference Thursday, Nelson was asked whether he was concerned that the next administration might make major changes to the Artemis program given SpaceX's development of the new Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "\"First of all, there is one human-rated spacecraft that is flying and that has already flown beyond the moon, and that's the SLS (Space Launch System) combined with Orion,\" Nelson said. \"Secondly, this is a partnership. It's a commercial partnership. It's an international partnership.",
      "\"I think what is going to happen over time is you're going to have a number of years that we're going to have the partners flying with NASA, and then whatever the technologies that are developed later on will dictate what is going to be the system that's flying.\"",
      "He concluded by saying, \"I don't see the concern that your question raises, although it's a legitimate question, that you're suddenly going to have Starship take over everything.\"",

      "\"I am delighted to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,\" Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social. \"... Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.\"",
      "Isaacman founded the payment processing company later named Shift4 Payments while he was a high school student. He chartered the first purely commercial, all-civilian American \"space tourist\" mission \u2014 Inspiration4 \u2014 in February 2021, paying SpaceX an undisclosed amount to launch him and three other civilian flyers on a two-day, 23-hour flight.",
      "He flew to space again this past September, commanding the first of three planned SpaceX Polaris missions, logging nearly five days in space on a flight that took the crew farther from Earth than any astronauts have gone since the Apollo moon program. Isaacman also became the first private citizen to carry out a spacewalk.",
      "He is scheduled to lead another Polaris mission aboard a SpaceX capsule before leading the first crew to space aboard the California rocket builder's gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "Dates have not been announced for either of those missions, and it's not yet clear what impact Isaacman's selection to lead NASA will have on those flights, whether Isaacman still intends to fly aboard one or both or what sort of influence his friendship with Musk might have on NASA's future direction.",
      "But Isaacman, a skilled pilot who flies his own MiG-29 fighter jet, made it clear in a post following Trump's announcement that NASA can expect him to be a vocal space advocate who will help \"usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilization.\"",
      "\"With the support of President Trump, I can promise you this: We will never again lose our ability to journey to the stars and never settle for second place,\" Isaacman said. \"We will inspire children, yours and mine, to look up and dream of what is possible. Americans will walk on the moon and Mars and in doing so, we will make life better here on Earth.\"",
      "He said it would be the \"honor of a lifetime to serve in this role and to work alongside NASA's extraordinary team to realize our shared dreams of exploration and discovery.\"",
      "Jim Bridenstine, Nelson's predecessor at the helm of NASA, helped kickstart the agency's Artemis moon program during the first Trump administration.",
      "He said in a statement Wednesday that \"Jared's vision for pushing boundaries, paired with his proven track record of success in private industry, positions him as an ideal candidate to lead NASA into a bold new era of exploration and discovery. I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm him.\"",
      "The Isaacman announcement comes as NASA struggles to keep the Artemis program on track amid tight budgets and what the agency's own inspector general calls the \"unsustainable\" costs of NASA's Space Launch System, or SLS, moon rocket.",
      "SpaceX supporters argue the company's more powerful, fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship rocket is the obvious choice for deep space exploration, but the huge rocket is far from operational with just a half-dozen suborbital test flights to its credit.",
      "The SLS, on the other hand, is considered operational in that it completed an initial test flight in November 2022, sending an unpiloted Orion capsule around the moon and back. But unlike the Super Heavy-Starship, the SLS is a throwaway, expendable booster expected to cost some $1.4 billion for each of its first four moon missions.",
      "NASA is currently gearing up to launch three NASA astronauts and a Canadian flyer on an SLS-Orion mission \u2014 Artemis 2 \u2014 late next year. But problems with the first Orion's heat shield and other issues threaten to push the Artemis 2 flight into 2026, years past initial expectations.",
      "It's not yet clear when the Artemis 3 mission, the first to carry astronauts to a landing near the moon's south pole, might be feasible.",
      "But that flight will feature a lunar lander built by SpaceX, a variant of the company's Starship upper stage. SpaceX has carried out six test flights of the fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship to date, but has not yet put the Starship upper stage into orbit or brought it down for an intact landing.",
      "Given the company's rapid-fire test schedule, most observers believe SpaceX will get the Super Heavy-Starship working as planned in the near future, but scores of test flights will be required to demonstrate the safety and reliability required by NASA to put astronauts aboard.",
      "And the moon mission poses unique challenges.",
      "For the initial landing mission, multiple Super Heavy \"tanker\" flights will be required to refuel the moon lander in low-Earth orbit before it can be sent to the moon. Once in lunar orbit, it will await the arrival of the Artemis 3 crew, launched aboard an Orion capsule by an SLS rocket.",

      "But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas, abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents are pushing back against the world's most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.",
      "In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling hills of the area's westernmost counties and butt up against wooded bike trails winding through the suburbs. But one of the latest proposals in the area, Plaza 500, would see a 466,000-square-foot facility and adjacent electrical substation built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds and a community center.",
      "The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials promised jobs and a significant property tax boost. But data center critics say the incentives aren't enough to counteract the consequences of building the facilities so close to homes.",
      "Tyler Ray, a leader in the fight against the Virginia project, worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by 2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help power the data centers' hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere.",
      "Ray and his neighbors tried to stop the development, but their efforts were largely unsuccessful. The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project was exempt.",
      "\"I don't know how a general resident, even someone who has been engaging intently on an issue, has any chance to go up against the data center industry,\" Ray said the night the supervisors voted.",
      "For local governments, attracting data centers to their municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in 2024 that Virginia's current data centers brought in $1 billion in tax revenue.",
      "For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of direct jobs \u2013 often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently that its investment in nearby Loudoun County, which included two data centers, created around 150 direct jobs, a figure that data center opponents say isn't worth the hassle. But data center advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction, technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730 indirect jobs.",
      "Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax County should reap the benefits.",
      "\"I have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the big picture,\" Smith said. \"Data centers are not going away.\"",
      "On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the 4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia river.",
      "Last year, AWS paid roughly $34 million in property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a $66 million tax break. Those payments, in addition to $1.7 in charitable donations from the company in 2023, have been instrumental in updating infrastructure and bolstering services. These funds have gone toward a new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer and $5,000 grants for homebuyers so far totaling at least $2.8 million.",
      "\"This road right here? Wouldn't happen if it wasn't for AWS,\" said Boardman Mayor Paul Keefer, riding in the passenger seat of Police Chief Rick Stokoe's cruiser, pointing out the window at construction workers shifting dirt and laying pavement.",
      "AWS has cultivated relationships with local officials including Keefer and Stokoe, who have both been in positions to vote on whether to authorize tax breaks with the company. Some former county commissioners and residents worry that those relationships are too cozy.",
      "Kevin Miller, AWS's vice president of global data centers, said in an interview with the Associated Press that \"our interest is in being a model corporate citizen, to really be partners with those communities.\"",
      "Skepticism of the deals started years ago, when three formerly elected officials allegedly helped approve data center deals while also owning a stake in a company that contracted with AWS to provide fiber optic cables for the data centers. In June, they each paid $2,000 to settle an ethics complaint.",
      "Those officials are no longer in office. But the latest data center deal struck between Morrow County officials and AWS, which gives the company an estimated $1 billion in tax breaks spread over the 15 years to build five new data centers, again raised eyebrows.",
      "Two former Morrow County Commissioners, Jim Doherty and Melissa Lindsay, pushed unsuccessfully in 2022 for AWS to pay more in taxes in new data center negotiations.",
      "\"We didn't want to blow it up. We didn't want to run them off,\" said Lindsay. \"But there were better deals to be made.\"",

    "title": "Boeing whistleblower sounds alarm over safety at satellite factory",
    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 19:28:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Craig Garriott has built satellites for Boeing for nearly three decades.",
    "story": [
      "Whether it's providing internet to storm-ravaged communities or supporting American troops at war, Craig Garriott has long believed the satellites he builds for Boeing helped protect lives.",
      "Now, Garriott, 53, says, it's the lives of hundreds of technicians at the Boeing facility where he has worked for nearly three decades that need protecting from company management.",
      "\"They've taken the focus off quality, the focus off the people on the floor, and they've put it completely on profit and going fast,\" Garriott said in an exclusive interview with CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave. \"I'm afraid with Boeing in the hands that it's in now down here, they're not gonna listen to me until somebody dies.\"",
      "He said efforts by Boeing executives to boost production at the company's Los Angeles-area military and commercial satellite plant have led to a \"toxic culture\" that has put workers there in danger. Garriott recalled how a four-ton satellite estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars crashed to the factory floor after it wasn't properly secured \u2014 an incident so catastrophic he compared it to \"a plane falling out of the sky.\"",
      "\"One person was underneath that satellite and they barely got out,\" said Garriott, who also represents 600 hourly workers as the head of the local carpenters union. \"It's the worst thing that can possibly happen on a site.\"",
      "A Boeing spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about the incident. In a statement to CBS News, the spokesperson said, \"Boeing is dedicated to the safety of its employees, and all employees are empowered and encouraged to report any safety concerns.\"",
      "Garriott's allegations echo concerns raised by multiple whistleblowers who have worked on Boeing's commercial airliners, including the troubled 737 MAX. And they add to struggles already facing Boeing's space division.",
      "The most high-profile Boeing space failure occurred in September, when the company's Starliner spacecraft experienced a cascade of technical troubles on a manned test flight to the International Space Station. NASA considered the return flight too risky, and sent it back to Earth without the two astronauts it had planned to shuttle home. Those astronauts will instead travel back next year in a capsule built by rival SpaceX and its CEO Elon Musk.",
      "Tapped by President-elect Trump to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, Musk is set to potentially wield enormous influence over lucrative space and defense contracts, which could put Boeing at a further disadvantage.",
      "Boeing, the company that helped put a man on the moon, is now exploring a new course \u2014 indicating it may sell off parts of its space business, according to a recent report in the Wall Street Journal. During Boeing's October earnings call, new CEO Kelly Ortberg suggested he was reevaluating the company's portfolio.",
      "\"We're better off doing less and doing it well than doing more and not doing it well,\" Ortberg said.",
      "The Boeing spokesperson did not respond to questions about how the company views competition from SpaceX or about steps it is taking to prepare for the incoming administration.",
      "Garriott estimates he's raised 300-400 safety violations over past year",
      "Acquired by Boeing in 2000, the satellite manufacturing facility has long been considered one of Boeing's more stable business units. It relies in part on a union workforce that Garriott said is responsible for constructing and testing satellites and their component parts.",
      "\"This is perhaps the most technical group of hourly people that you'll probably find on this planet,\" said Garriott, who estimated he's raised between 300 and 400 safety violations over the past year. Those complaints, he said, range from obstructed fire extinguishers and fire alarms to concerns over heavy machinery blocking exits and trapping workers in certain parts of the factory.",
      "In October, union workers filed a complaint with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration that, according to Garriott, highlighted unsafe conditions on the factory floor.",
      "Another technician at the facility, who spoke to CBS News on the condition he remain anonymous to protect his job, said safety had become \"an afterthought\" and quality had \"degraded\" over the past five to six years.",
      "\"You speak up now, you're a troublemaker\"",
      "Garriott sued Boeing in April alleging company management retaliated against him for raising safety issues. He said he's been harassed by leadership at the facility and has been the target of dozens of corporate investigations that he says turned up nothing and were only meant to intimidate him.",
      "\"When I first started at Boeing, the guys that spoke up and said, 'Hey, this doesn't feel right,' those guys were revered,\" Garriott said. \"You speak up now, you're a troublemaker.\"",
      "In a statement, Boeing said it investigated Garriott's claims and disputed the allegations he made in his lawsuit.",
      "'We have strict policies prohibiting retaliation toward employees who raise concerns, and Boeing did not retaliate against Mr. Garriott,\" the Boeing spokesperson said.",
      "Garriott is the latest whistleblower claiming the company retaliated against him after raising safety concerns. John Barnett, a former quality manager at the company's 787 Dreamliner factory, died by suicide in March while in Charleston, South Carolina, giving testimony in his whistleblower retaliation case.",
      "Barnett's mother, Vicky Stokes, told CBS News in April she holds the aircraft manufacturing giant responsible for the grinding treatment that ultimately left her son despondent.",
      "\"If this hadn't gone on so long, I'd still have my son, and my sons would have their brother and we wouldn't be sitting here. So in that respect, I do,\" Stokes said when asked if she places some of the blame for her son's death on Boeing.",
      "In June, former Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told lawmakers on the Senate investigations subcommittee that Boeing's culture is \"far from perfect,\" but said the company is \"committed to making sure every employee feels empowered to speak up if there is a problem.\" He also said Boeing is working on improving \"transparency and accountability, while elevating employee engagement.\"",
      "Garriott said although his family fears he will endure further reprisals from Boeing, he's now speaking out publicly in an effort to improve conditions for workers he said he took an oath as union head to protect.",
      "\"I'm not gonna stop till I know that Boeing understands that these people mean something, they matter,\" Garriott said, urging company executives to open up a dialogue with workers on the factory floor. \"Make 'em feel like they matter. Make 'em feel like their safety matters.\"",

      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: That's \u2013 that is my concern, is that there's a culture of silence and that individual officers and agents are not empowered to say something is wrong.",

They were going to work through the night to get it ready. And then you find out afterwards that there was no coordination, there was no team meeting, there was no, well, this is going to be your responsibility to know where you're supposed to be and what time you're supposed to be there.",

      "When you knew there was a suspicious person on the grounds \u2013 and this is a common \u2013 going back and forth now. This is where they said they weren't communicating with each other. You can't tell me that you didn't know until 10 minutes after 6:00 that you couldn't communicate. At 11 minutes after 6:00, the shooter took action.",

      "And I think, by saying what he said, that's what he meant. They don't have the leadership they need. When they morphed them into Homeland Security back in 2001, 2 \u2013 whenever it was, they took away their identity and their exclusivity. When you're the best of the best, when you're the elite of the elites\u2026",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: \u2026 if you lose that, then all of a sudden you just become part of a team.",
      "There was a huge mistake back when Homeland came into existence. That's not a criticism, because they did what they had to do back then. But I'm telling you, on July 13, there was a lack of professionalism, there was a lack of concern, there was a lack of coordination.",
      "And the ability to communicate is the one thing I will never understand. You knew you couldn't talk to each other. Why did you go forward?",

      "But there is a systematic problem here. The structure, the personnel, the staffing of the Secret Service, hasn't changed in years, at the same time as we are now asking them to do things that they didn't do a decade ago.",
      "And they are \u2013 they are fulfilling an operational tempo that requires them to be deployed\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: \u2026 three weeks out of a month, constantly doing events, skipping firearms training, skipping leadership development training. We are not developing their skills and their training. And I think you see the results of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you made three dozen recommendations in this report on what to change, including to reduce the number of protectees.",
      "Right now, Secret Service protects not only presidential leadership, their immediate families, their spouses, their children, candidates, and anyone really the president designates. Should all of that continue?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE KELLY: We've increased the size of protectees that are out there, including foreign assets that come here and people that bring \u2013 bring their families and things. So that's gotten so big.",
      "But, if you look at Homeland, I think \u2013 I think, when you look at Secret Service, it's about 3 percent of their overall spend. The biggest spend is on FEMA. And, now, we don't want to change anything like that.",
      "But you can't have an exclusive without funding them to the level that they need to be funded, not only in manpower and in training, but in the assets that they have to have available to them.",

So, if you're not actually adequately performing any of those missions to standard, and if you have reached a breaking point, then it's time to assess, what are those missions that need to fall off and to be transitioned elsewhere?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: What drove him to do it? Was he a lone wolf shooter? Did he have associates or affiliates? What was his motivation? How was he radicalized?",
      "We endeavored to get answers to those questions. We submitted numerous requests to the Department of Justice and FBI. Their response is, this is an ongoing criminal investigation, and we can't give that information to Congress.",
      "That, in my view, is an unacceptable position. And here's why.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For both Butler and Mar-a-Lago, that was the answer?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JASON CROW: Correct. That's right.",

      "So now that leaves us with two, a ban or a sale. We don't want to see it banned. I would add that President \u2013 president-elect Trump has also said he doesn't want to see it banned. So now let's talk about the sale.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "FRANK MCCOURT: And the reason why the judges upheld it is for that same reason.",
      "So let's turn a problem into a solution by taking advantage of this moment, move the 170 million users over to a new protocol where individuals are respected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have an indication from president-elect Trump that he wants to see an American entity buy this? Because he would also have some influence in the outcome.",

      "Let's make a deal where everybody wins, where China's able to sell the U.S. portion of TikTok, where American citizens are protected, and where there's \u2013 and 170 million users continue to enjoy the platform. So he has said he doesn't want it banned, which means a sale.",
      "And the legislation and the \u2013 the appellate decision require that this platform be \u2013 be owned by Americans. We have built a clean, bottom-up American stack to move this user base over, where there will be no Chinese backdoors and no ability to \u2013 to take advantage of American citizens.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado, the top Democrat on the bipartisan House task force investigating the assassination attempts against President-elect Donald Trump, said he's concerned that \"there's a culture of silence\" at the Secret Service that prevents agents from speaking out when they should.",
      "\"I was struck by the stories in the recount of the specific actions of officers and agents on the ground that day,\" Crow said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"There were some heroic ones, but there were also a lot of examples of people that knew that something was wrong and they didn't say anything.\"",
      "The task force, which the House voted to establish earlier this year, in recent days wrapped up its work probing security failures surrounding the July 13 assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, and the Sept. 15 foiled attempt in West Palm Beach, Florida. In the wake of the initial attack, the Secret Service came under intense scrutiny, leading to the resignation of its director.",
      "Last week, Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe testified before the panel in its final hearing, where he acknowledged the Secret Service's failure to adequately secure the area in Butler, noted \"critical gaps\" within the agency's operations and said \"we did not meet the expectations of the American public, Congress, and our protectees.\" He noted that it has been his \"singular focus to bring much-needed reform to the Secret Service.",
      "He added that the agency is \"operating in a heightened threat environment, with expanding protection requirements.\"",
      "\"The responsibilities of the Secret Service are critical to the national security of the United States,\" Rowe said, adding that \"our agency is not defined by one failure, but by our ability to learn from mistakes.\"",
      "Task force chairman Rep. Mike Kelly, a Pennsylvania Republican whose district includes Butler, said the agency lacks the leadership it needs. And he argued that when the Secret Service was brought under the umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security, \"they took away their identity \u2014 their exclusivity.\"",
      "\"When you're the best of the best, when you're the elite of the elites, if you lose that, then all of a sudden you just become part of a team,\" Kelly said on \"Face the Nation.\" \"That was a huge mistake.\"",
      "On the July 13 attack, Kelly said the Secret Service failed \"at every step of the way.\"",
      "\"They failed from the first thing, from the picking of the site, the preparing the site to the coordination of the site, the ability to communicate,\" Kelly said, adding that there was no team meeting before the event, and local law enforcement wasn't included in the planning.",
      "\"On July 13, there was a lack of professionalism, there was a lack of concern, there was a lack of coordination, and the ability to communicate is the one thing I'll never understand,\" Kelly said. \"You knew you couldn't talk to each other. Why did you go forward?\"",
      "Crow said important questions remain about the shooter in Butler and would-be shooter in West Palm Beach, saying that the task force submitted numerous requests to the Justice Department and FBI about their motivations. Crow claimed that the requests have been denied because the criminal investigations are ongoing, calling it an \"unacceptable position\" and accused the agencies of trying to \"stonewall\" Congress on the issue.",
      "The Colorado Democrat argued that when it comes to the Secret Service, there is a \"systematic problem here.\" He noted that although there are \"plenty of extraordinary agents and officers\" in the Secret Service, there was a \"failure of mission\" in Butler.",
      "\"The structure, the personnel, the staffing of the Secret Service hasn't changed in years, at the same time as we are now asking them to do things that they didn't do a decade ago,\" Crow said, saying the tempo of the job leaves agents without time for adequate training. \"We are not developing their skills and their training, and I think you see the results of that.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Kelly said the task force has been working since Day One to try to help restore trust and confidence in the Secret Service, which he said was likely at \"the lowest ebb\" in its history. And he acknowledged the relentless pressure on the Secret Service.",
      "\"You've got to be ready every single moment for anything that could possibly happen. Is that a difficult task? Yes, is it almost impossible?\" Kelly said. \"But you know what's not impossible, our dedication to the fact that we're going to do the best we can do every single day to ensure that the American people have the faith and trust and confidence they must have in us.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 09:26:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump wants to impose across-the-board tariffs on imported goods from both allies and adversaries, claiming it's other nations who will pay such taxes to the U.S. Treasury. But it's American consumers who will be opening their wallets.",
    "story": [
      "Incoming President Donald Trump has made his feelings about tariffs very clear: \"The word 'tariff' is the most beautiful word in the dictionary,\" he has said. \"I think it's more beautiful than 'love.' \u2026 I love tariffs! \u2026 Music to my ears!\"",
      "And what exactly is a tariff? It is a tax. According to Dartmouth economics professor Doug Irwin, \"In U.S. history, we're basically only talking about import tariffs, taxes on imported goods coming into the U.S.\"",
      "Irwin says governments have all kinds of reasons for introducing tariffs: \"Sometimes it's to reduce the trade deficit. Sometimes it's to bring back jobs. Sometimes it's to punish other countries for their unfair trade practices. Sometimes it's to raise revenue so that we can cut income taxes.\"",
      "At its most fundamental, a tariff works like this:",
      "Suppose we import a product from China. The price is $50. But before you can buy it, our government adds $25 to the price. That's the tariff. Your final price is $75. China gets its $50; the extra $25 winds up going to the U.S. Treasury.",
      "But who pays these tariffs?",
      "According to Trump, it's the other countries. \"Trillions and trillions of dollars pouring into the United States Treasury,\" is his description of what happens. \"China paid hundreds of billions of dollars during my term.\"",
      "But as Irwin points out, that's NOT the way tariffs work!",
      "\"I think economists would say that's very misleading to say that that's what's going on,\" he said. \"Of course, it's the U.S. consumers that are paying those, not China itself. China's not writing checks to the U.S. government.\"",
      "Rather, it is a transfer of money from consumers to the federal government. A tax.",
      "Tariffs have been part of international trade since our country was founded; the first one was imposed by George Washington! And what we've learned from history is that they often have unintended consequences.",
      "We have a tariff on sugar that has doubled the price of sugar. It has helped out our sugar cane farmers in Louisiana and Florida, but it's also driven 34% of American chocolate and candy manufacturing (and jobs) out of the country.",
      "Candy makers turn sweet on Canada to mitigate costly U.S. sugar tariffs (Financial Post)More confectionery manufacturers move outside U.S. (Confectionery Production)",
      "Candy makers turn sweet on Canada to mitigate costly U.S. sugar tariffs (Financial Post)",
      "More confectionery manufacturers move outside U.S. (Confectionery Production)",
      "Then, there was Trump's 25% tariff on imported steel in 2018. Our steelmakers thrived, but companies that make things out of steel (like Ford, GM and Caterpillar) suffered dearly. Just ask Ford's then-CEO Jim Hackett, who in 2018 told Bloomberg, \"The metals tariffs took about a billion dollars of profit from us. If it goes on longer, there will be more damage.\"",
      "Tariffs against one particular country can backfire. Irwin said, \"With the China tariffs, we're importing a lot more from Vietnam, we're importing a lot more from Malaysia. If the idea with the tariff was to bring jobs back home, instead we're just shifting them from China to Vietnam, in some sense.\"",
      "And P.S.: Tariffs don't just raise prices on the imported stuff; they can affect the price of domestic substitutes as well.",
      "So, if there's a tariff on imported steel, and I'm an American steelmaker, I can opportunistically say, \"Well hey, now I can raise my prices, too!\"?\u00a0 Absolutely! says Irwin: \"Consumers don't have the choice anymore. They can buy the really high-priced steel, or they can buy you.\"",
      "Finally, there's the retaliation problem. \"When we imposed the steel tariffs, the European Union and China got very upset with us,\" Irwin said. \"And what did they do? They raised tariffs on American farm goods. So, all of a sudden, American farmers, who had nothing to do with steel per se, found their sales limited overseas.\"",
      "Even Ronald Reagan could have told you that. In fact, he did! In 1987, Reagan said, \"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. The result is more and more tariffs, higher and higher trade barriers, and less and less competition.\"",
      "So, exactly what tariffs has Trump proposed? During his campaign, he promised as president he would \"phase in a system of universal baseline tariffs.\" Originally, he outlined tariffs across the board -- every product, in every category, from every country in the world. \"We're going to charge them 10 to 20 percent,\" he said.",

      "Retailers tell consumers that Trump tariffs are a reason to shop now",
      "Why is Trump threatening a 100% tariff on the BRICS nations?",
      "Now, every recent president has favored some tariffs. The Biden administration, for example, maintained some of the tariffs from Trump's first term, and imposed its own 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars. But these tariffs have always targeted particular categories of products. \"An across-the-board tariff? That's not targeting a particular commodity or product, that's not targeting a particular country,\" said Irwin. \"It's just saying, 'All imports, all sources get hit with this tax.' That's a very different type of tariff.\"",
      "And wouldn't we then notice prices going up, on everything?\u00a0 \"We would definitely notice,\" Irwin said.",
      "More recently, Trump has proposed double-digit tariffs on everything imported from Mexico, Canada and China. They would raise the price we pay for things like fruit, lumber, electronics, oil, medicine, metal and beef.",

      "But Trump's transition leader Howard Lutnick predicts that his boss won't tax imported goods for which there are no American-made alternatives. Back in September, Lutnick told CNBC, \"Tariffs are an amazing tool by the president to use. They're an amazing tool. But he understands, don't tariff stuff we don't make. If we don't make it, and you want to buy it, I don't want to put the price up.\"",
      "Can Trump impose tariffs without Congress? It's complicated, according to experts",
      "Can Trump impose tariffs without Congress? It's complicated, according to experts",
      "But maybe Trump has no intention of imposing the tariffs for real? Maybe he's playing a strategic game -- tariffs as negotiating tactics?",
      "\"Tariffs can be used as a threat and a bargaining chip,\" said Irwin. \"And sometimes, if you're really credible, just making the threat of a tariff is enough to bring another country to change its policy in a way that you desire without your actually having to impose the tariff in the end.\"",
      "In the end, when a government wants to achieve some economic or geopolitical goal, it can use all kinds of different tools: subsidies, tax breaks or penalties, trade agreements, regulations, certifications, investment incentives, diversification.",
      "According to Doug Irwin, tariffs are a powerful tool, too. They're just rarely the best one. \"What economists have concluded is that tariffs usually have a lot of unintended consequences, can lead to blowback where other countries retaliate against you, and so are not a really good policy instrument for achieving goals that we all Americans want to achieve,\" he said.",

Martin, now 77, who lives near Grand Rapids in northern Minnesota, wasn't publicly exposed as the thief until he was indicted in May 2023. He pleaded guilty in October 2023. Martin admitted he used a small sledgehammer to break into the museum. He then used the tool to crack the case the slippers were in and take them. He said he didn't hear any alarm. He took off in his car and kept them in a trailer adjacent to his home.",

But a fence \u2014 a person who buys stolen goods \u2014 later told him the rubies were just glass, DeKrey said. So Martin got rid of the slippers. The attorney didn't specify how.",
      "The alleged fence, Jerry Hal Saliterman, 77, of the Minneapolis suburb of Crystal, was indicted in March. He was also in a wheelchair and on oxygen when he made his first court appearance. He's scheduled to go on trial in January and hasn't entered a plea, though his attorney has said he's not guilty.",
      "The shoes were returned in February to memorabilia collector Michael Shaw, who had loaned them to the museum. They were one of several pairs that Garland wore during the filming, but only four pairs are known to have survived. In the movie, to return from Oz to Kansas, Dorothy had to click her heels three times and repeat, \"There's no place like home.\"",

      "MIAMI \u2013 American Airlines is no longer resuming its daily service out of Miami into Port-au-Prince's Toussaint Louverture International Airport. American had initially suspended flights through February 12. The suspension is now indefinite.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S.-based carrier said that it will evaluate a possible resumption in late 2025 of the only daily service out of Miami International Airport into Haiti by a major U.S. airline.",
      "This comes after The Federal Aviation Administration prohibited U.S. airlines from flying to Haiti for 30 days after gangs shot three planes. Further, the United Nations temporarily suspended flights to Port-au-Prince on Tuesday, limiting humanitarian aid coming into the country.",
      "The American Airlines statement read in part: \"American has made the difficult decision to suspend daily service between Miami (MIA) and Port-au-Prince, Haiti (PAP),\" the spokesperson said. \"We are proud of our more than 50-year-commitment to Haiti and we will continue to monitor the situation, assessing safety, security, and customer demand, in evaluating a return of service. We will proactively reach out to impacted customers to offer a full refund of their travel itinerary.\"",

      "Neither Spirit nor JetBlue has said if and when they will resume Haiti flights.",
      "JetBlue Airways operates flights both out of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport into Port-au-Prince.",

      "No passengers were injured.",
      "What does this mean for Haitians in the U.S. and Haiti?",
      "The ban on commercial and cargo flights has created severe problems for Haitians. The roads in and out of the capital are controlled by armed gangs, and mudslides last week buried two major roads connecting Cap-Ha\u00eftien and the capital.",
      "Those making it out of the capital have either had to beg for a ride on a government-leased helicopter meant for the purpose of moving security forces to hot zones or pay $2,500 for a ride on a privately leased helicopter with a 20-pound weight limit.",
      "The FAA initially placed all of Haiti under the flight ban. It later amended its decision to exclude airports outside of the capital.",
      "The only other airport that can receive commercial international flights, Hugo Chavez International Airport, is in the northern city of Cap-Ha\u00eftien.",
      "Today, the small airport serves as the only air bridge in and out of the country. The airspace between Haiti and the Dominican Republic is still closed. The Bahamas suspended flights into the country. The only direct service to the U.S. currently is via Haiti-owned Sunrise Airways.",
      "Despite that, it has not stopped the United States from deporting Haitians back to the country. Last week, the Department of Homeland Security flew 70 deportees into Cap-Ha\u00eftien despite days of heavy rains that had left the city flooded and all access out of the city to other parts of Haiti blocked.",

      "Mr. Biden pledged to work alongside partners and stakeholders in Syria to \"help them seize an opportunity to manage the risk.\" The president also said he'll send senior officials to the region, help to ensure stability and protect U.S. personnel and will engage with Syrian groups to \"establish a transition away from the Assad regime\" and toward an independent and sovereign Syria.",
      "Mr. Biden says the administration is \"clear eyed\" about the possibility that ISIS may try to gain control amid a power vacuum, but he said that \"we will not let that happen.\" He noted that the U.S. conducted precision airstrikes within Syria targeting ISIS camps and operatives.",

      "He called on opposition groups to \"seek a role in governing Syria\" and demonstrate their commitment to Syria's people, the rule of law and protection of minorities.",
      "The president credited his administration's work in other foreign conflicts with contributing to the collapse of Assad's government, arguing support for Assad from Iran, Hezbollah and Russia fell apart \"because all three of them are far weaker today than they were when I took office.\"",
      "Mr. Biden said Iran had made a \"historic mistake\" when it \"chose to launch a multi-front war against Israel\" following the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas. He said Hezbollah has been \"badly degraded,\" as has Hamas, while Iran's military capabilities have been \"weakened.\" The dynamics, the president said, made it \"impossible\" for Hezbollah and Iran to continue to prop up the Assad regime.",
      "The president said Russia's support for Assad fell short because Ukraine has been able to inflict \"massive damage\" on Russian forces recently .",
      "\"The upshot for all this is, for the first time ever, neither Russia nor Iran nor Hezbollah could defend this abhorrent regime in Syria,\" Mr. Biden said, calling it a \"direct result\" of Ukraine and Israel's self defense with the \"unflagging support\" of the U.S.",

As Mr. Biden left the room, he ignored questions shouted at him until a reporter asked, \"What does the U.S. know about where Austen Tice might be and if he's safe?\"",

    "summary": "Notre Dame Cathedral hosted its first Mass since a catastrophic 2019 fire devastated the historic structure.",
    "story": [
      "Notre Dame Cathedral, its air thick with the smell of incense, on Sunday, hosted its first Mass since the catastrophic fire of 2019, a moment that transcends religious significance to become a powerful symbol of Paris' resilience.",
      "Beneath the glow of traditional chandeliers and modern spotlights, which illuminated its intricately carved stonework, the cathedral emerged reborn to the faithful, its grandeur restored after more than five years of reconstruction.",
      "For Catholics, it marks the revival of the city's spiritual heart, a place where faith has been nurtured for centuries. For the world, it signals the rebirth of one of global heritage's most famous landmarks.",
      "The event was both solemn and historic. Archbishop Laurent Ulrich presided over the morning Mass, including consecrating a new bronze altar.",
      "The liturgy, attended by French President Emmanuel Macron, clergy, dignitaries, and guests totaling around 2,500 people, was closed to the general public. Nearly 170 bishops from France and around the world took part in the celebration, along with one priest from each of the parishes in the Paris diocese and one priest from each of the seven Eastern-rite Catholic churches, accompanied by worshippers from these communities.",
      "Macron, in line with France's secular division of state and religion, did not take communion.",
      "It is a milestone in Notre Dame's journey from ruin to resurrection \u2014 a process defined by extraordinary craftsmanship, nearly $1 billion in global donations and an unyielding determination to rebuild what seemed lost.",
      "The 860-year-old cathedral reopened more than five years after a fire devastated the iconic landmark. But a massive effort by dedicated artisans to restore the structure brought it back from the brink.\u00a0\"60 Minutes\" took an early look at the repairs one week ahead of Notre Dame's formal reopening and spoke to some of the people who made it possible.",
      "Despite concerns in the wake of the fire that the craftsmanship required to build the cathedral in the Middle Ages no longer existed in modern times, those who helmed the restoration said the project shone a new light on traditional ways of working in construction.",
      "\"What's great about Notre Dame is its like a school, where we pass skills from generation to generation,\" Philippe Villeneuve, the lead architect on the Notre Dame repairs, told \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "Hank Silver, a traditional carpenter who also worked on the restoration, said the project opened new doors for people in his profession.",
      "\"It's maybe a bit of a controversial point to say, but in many ways, this fire has been a great gift. Not just to me personally, but young people who really otherwise would never know that they could have a career as a traditional carpenter, a stone cutter, mason,\" Silver said. \"These trades are in the public eye again.\"",
      "Later on Sunday, an evening Mass will welcome members of the public who secured reservations last week. The Associated Press learned that tickets for this service were claimed within 25 minutes, underscoring Notre Dame's enduring ability to inspire awe, devotion, and curiosity.",
      "What's more extraordinary is that this is taking place in a country with a strong emphasis on secularism and a low rate of church attendance.",
      "Public viewing areas along the Seine on Sunday morning drew hundreds of people who wished to witness the historic moment from afar, although their numbers were likely subdued by rainy and miserably cold weather conditions.",
      "Retired engineer Claude Lancrenon, watching from a viewing area, expressed both awe and disappointment.",
      "\"There is so much security,\" he said, gesturing toward the barriers. \"Yesterday, that seemed appropriate. But today, I had hoped it would be more open so we could approach the cathedral. I still hope we'll be able to get closer.\"",
      "Tight security \u2014 akin to that of the Paris Olympic Games \u2014 reflected the importance of the occasion, ensuring the safety of dignitaries and the public alike as the cathedral re-entered its role as a global symbol of unity and resilience.",
      "Nathalie Martino, a retired event organizer visiting Paris to see family, recalled the anguish of watching the cathedral burn.",
      "\"I cried so much that day,\" she said. \"And now, here I am. I had to come. It was something I needed to do.\"",
      "Sunday's Masses follow Saturday evening's ceremonial reopening in which Ulrich symbolically reopened the cathedral's massive wooden doors by striking them three times with a crosier crafted from charred beams salvaged from the fire. As the doors swung open, choirs filled the cathedral with song and the cathedral's great organ \u2014 silent since the fire \u2014 resounded with majestic melodies.",
      "Inside, the restoration reveals a cathedral transformed with now-gleaming limestone walls cleaned of centuries of grime. The restored stained-glass windows project dazzling patterns of color across the nave.",
      "\"No one alive has seen the cathedral like this,\" said the Rev. Olivier Ribadeau Dumas, Notre Dame's rector. \"It is more than restored \u2014 it is reborn.\"",
      "Sunday morning's liturgy consecrated the new altar, a pivotal moment in Notre Dame's return to full liturgical life.",
      "The altar houses relics of five saints tied to Paris, including St. Catherine Labour\u00e9 and St. Charles de Foucauld, continuing a centuries-old tradition of embedding sacred artifacts at the heart of worship spaces. The consecration, involving holy water, chrism oil, incense and prayer, transforms the altar into a sacred centerpiece of the cathedral.",
      "The reopening of Notre Dame is more than a religious milestone, it is a moment of cultural and national unity. Macron, who vowed to restore the cathedral within five years after the fire, attended Saturday's ceremonies and called the project \"a jolt of hope\" for France, a nation often divided by political crises.",
      "The Sunday Masses underscore Notre Dame's dual role as a place of worship and a symbol of communal resilience. They also ensure that members of the broader Catholic community can partake in the cathedral's spiritual revival.",
      "\"This was not just about restoring a building. It was about restoring the heart of the nation,\" Dumas said.",
      "The path to restoration has been fraught with challenges. Lead contamination forced work to pause, and the COVID-19 pandemic added delays. Yet the project, overseen by architect Philippe Villeneuve, has been hailed as a triumph of human ingenuity and collective resolve. Cutting-edge fire prevention systems, including thermal cameras and a misting system, have been installed to safeguard the cathedral's future.",
      "Villeneuve described the effort as \"restoring not just a building but the soul of a nation,\" emphasizing the personal and national significance of the work.",
      "With its spire once again piercing the Parisian sky, Notre Dame is poised to reclaim its role as a global beacon of faith and art. The cathedral, which previously welcomed 12 million annual visitors, is expected to draw 15 million in its new chapter.",
      "This monumental revival is not confined to a single day. Ulrich has announced an \"octave\" of celebrations\u2014eight days of special religious services, each with its own theme, running through Dec. 15. These daily liturgies, open to diverse groups from local parishioners to international pilgrims, emphasize Notre Dame's role as a unifying spiritual hub.",

    "published": "Sun, 08 Dec 2024 08:59:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Insurgents control the capital Damascus, President Bashar Assad has fled into hiding, and for the first time after 50 years of his family's iron hand, it is an open question how Syria will be governed.",
    "story": [
      "Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the militant leader whose stunning insurgency\u00a0toppled Syria's President Bashar Assad,\u00a0has spent years working to remake his public image, renouncing longtime ties to al-Qaida and depicting himself as a champion of pluralism and tolerance. In recent days, the insurgency even dropped his nom de guerre and began referring to him by his real name, Ahmad al-Sharaa.",
      "The extent of that transformation from jihadi extremist to would-be state builder is now put to the test.",
      "Insurgents control the capital Damascus,\u00a0Assad has fled into hiding,\u00a0and for the first time after 50 years of his family's iron hand, it is an open question how Syria will be governed.",
      "Syria is home to multiple ethnic and religious communities, often pitted against each other by Assad's state and years of war. Many of them fear the possibility Sunni Islamist extremists will take over. The country is also fragmented among disparate armed factions, and foreign powers from Russia and Iran to the United States, Turkey and Israel all have their hands in the mix.",
      "The 42-year-old al-Golani -- labeled a terrorist by the United States -- has not appeared publicly since Damascus fell early Sunday. But he and his insurgent force, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS \u2013 many of whose fighters are jihadis -- stand to be a major player.",
      "For years, al-Golani worked to consolidate power, while bottled up in the province of Idlib in Syria's northwest corner as Assad's Iranian- and Russian-backed rule over much of the country appeared solid.",
      "He maneuvered among extremist organizations while eliminating competitors and former allies. He sought to polish the image of his de-facto \"salvation government\" that has been running Idlib to win over international governments and reassure Syria's religious and ethnic minorities. And he built ties with various tribes and other groups.",
      "Along the way, al-Golani shed his garb as a hard-line Islamist guerrilla and put on suits for press interviews, talking of building state institutions and decentralizing power to reflect Syria's diversity.",
      "\"Syria deserves a governing system that is institutional, no one where a single ruler makes arbitrary decisions,\" he said in an interview with CNN last week, offering the possibility HTS would eventually be dissolved after Assad falls.",
      "\"Don't judge by words, but by actions,\" he said.",
      "Al-Golani's beginnings in Iraq",
      "Al-Golani's ties to al-Qaida stretch back to 2003, when he joined extremists battling U.S. troops in Iraq. The Syrian native was detained by the U.S. military but remained in Iraq. During that time, al-Qaida usurped like-minded groups and formed the extremist Islamic State of Iraq, led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.",
      "In 2011, a popular uprising against Syria's Assad triggered a brutal government crackdown and led to all-out war. Al-Golani's prominence grew when al-Baghdadi sent him to Syria to establish a branch of al-Qaida called the Nusra Front. The United States labeled the new group as a terrorist organization. That designation still remains in place and the U.S. government has put a $10 million bounty on him.",
      "The Nusra Front and the Syrian conflict",
      "As Syria's civil war intensified in 2013, so did al-Golani's ambitions. He defied al-Baghdadi's calls to dissolve the Nusra Front and merge it with al-Qaida's operation in Iraq, to form the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS.",
      "Al-Golani nonetheless pledged his allegiance to al-Qaida, which later disassociated itself from ISIS. The Nusra Front battled ISIS and eliminated much of its competition among the Syrian armed opposition to Assad.",
      "In his first interview in 2014, al-Golani kept his face covered, telling a reporter for Qatari network Al-Jazeera that he rejected political talks in Geneva to end the conflict. He said his goal was to see Syria ruled under Islamic law and made clear that there was no room for the country's Alawite, Shiite, Druze and Christian minorities.",
      "Consolidating power and rebranding",
      "In 2016, al-Golani revealed his face to the public for the first time in a video message that announced his group was renaming itself Jabhat Fateh al-Sham -\u2013 the Syria Conquest Front -- and cutting its ties to al-Qaida.",
      "\"This new organization has no affiliation to any external entity,\" he said in the video, filmed wearing military garb and a turban.",
      "The move paved the way for al-Golani to assert full control over fracturing militant groups. A year later, his alliance rebranded again as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham -\u2013 meaning Organization for Liberating Syria -- as the groups merged, consolidating al-Golani's power in northwest Syria's Idlib province.",
      "HTS later clashed with independent Islamist militants who opposed the merger, further emboldening al-Golani and his group as the leading power in northwestern Syria, able to rule with an iron fist.",
      "With his power consolidated, al-Golani set in motion a transformation that few could have imagined. Replacing his military garb with shirt and trousers, he began calling for religious tolerance and pluralism.",
      "He appealed to the Druze community in Idlib, which the Nusra Front had previously targeted, and visited the families of Kurds who were killed by Turkish-backed militias.",
      "In 2021, al-Golani had his first interview with an American journalist on PBS. Wearing a blazer, with his short hair gelled back, the now more soft-spoken HTS leader said that his group posed no threat to the West and that sanctions imposed against it were unjust.",
      "\"Yes, we have criticized Western policies,\" he said. \"But to wage a war against the United States or Europe from Syria, that's not true. We didn't say we wanted to fight.\"",

      "\"I am in my house and I have not left, and this is because of my belonging to this country,\" Jalili said in a video statement. He said he would go to his office to continue work in the morning and called on Syrian citizens not to deface public property.",
      "He did not address reports that Assad had fled.",
      "The pro-government Sham FM radio reported that Damascus airport was evacuated and all flights halted.",
      "The insurgents also announced they had entered the notorious Saydnaya military prison north of the capital and \"liberated our prisoners\" there.",
      "Damascus was expected to fall, three U.S. officials had previously told CBS News, after Syrian insurgents surrounded the capital in a swiftly moving offensive that first began Nov. 27. Syrian insurgents also claimed early Sunday to have captured the key central city of Homs.",
      "Iranian forces who'd been defending Assad had \"pretty much\" evacuated from Syria, the U.S. officials said earlier Saturday.",
      "Syrian insurgents reached Damascus on Saturday as part of a rapidly moving offensive that has seen them take over some of Syria's largest cities. It was the first time opposition forces had reached Damascus since 2018, when Syrian troops recaptured areas on the outskirts of the capital following a yearslong siege.",
      "The advances in the past week were among the largest in recent years by opposition factions, led by a group that has its origins in al-Qaida and is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the United Nations. In their push to overthrow Assad's government, the insurgents have met little resistance from the Syrian army.",
      "The fighters are led by the most powerful insurgent group in Syria, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, along with an umbrella group of Turkish-backed Syrian militias called the Syrian National Army. Both have been entrenched in the northwest.",
      "Abdurrahman had earlier reported that insurgents were active in the Damascus suburbs of Maadamiyah, Jaramana and Daraya. He added that opposition fighters on Saturday were also marching from eastern Syria toward the Damascus suburb of Harasta.",
      "A commander with the insurgents, Hassan Abdul-Ghani, posted on the Telegram messaging app that opposition forces have started carrying out the \"final stage\" of their offensive by encircling Damascus. He added that insurgents were headed from southern Syria toward Damascus.",
      "Ghani said early Sunday local time that insurgent forces had \"fully liberated\" Homs, Syria's third-largest city, Reuters reported, as government forces had supposedly abandoned the city. If they have indeed captured Homs, they would cut the link between Damascus, Assad's seat of power, and the northern coastal region where the president enjoys wide support.",
      "His chief international backer, Russia, is busy with its war in Ukraine, and Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah, which at one point sent thousands of fighters to shore up his forces, has been weakened by a yearlong conflict with Israel. Iran, meanwhile, has seen its proxies across the region degraded by Israeli regular airstrikes. The Israel Defense Forces said on Saturday that after armed individuals carried out an attack at a U.N. post in the Hader area, their troops were currently assisting U.N. forces in repelling the attack.",
      "On Saturday, President-elect Donald Trump commented on the situation on Truth Social, saying, \"THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!\"",
      "Three U.S. officials told CBS News that the al-Assad family's reign that started in 1971 appears to be ending.",
      "\"The United States is not going to...militarily dive into the middle of a Syrian civil war,\" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told an audience at the Reagan National Defense Forum, an annual gathering of national security officials, defense firms and lawmakers at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. \"What we are going to do is focus on the American national security priorities and interests.\"",
      "He said the U.S. would keep acting as necessary to keep the Islamic State \u2014 a violently anti-Western extremist group not known to be involved in the offensive but with sleeper cells in Syria's deserts \u2014 from exploiting openings presented by the fighting.",
      "How the conflict reignited",
      "Thousands of people were fleeing from the area amid the dramatic escalation in the civil war, which had simmered without major advances by either side for years until the\u00a0rebels mounted a shock offensive\u00a0about two weeks ago.",
      "The capture of Homs was a major victory for the rebels, who have already seized the northern cities of Aleppo and Hama, as well as large parts of the south, in a lightning offensive. Analysts said rebel control of Homs would be a game-changer. Aleppo is Syria's second-largest city.",
      "HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani told CNN in an exclusive interview Thursday from Syria that the aim of the offensive is to overthrow Assad's government.",
      "The Syrian army withdrew from much of southern Syria on Saturday, leaving more areas of the country, including two provincial capitals, under the control of opposition fighters, the military and an opposition war monitor said. The redeployment away from the southern provinces of Daraa and Sweida came as Syria's military sent large numbers of reinforcements to defend Homs.",
      "The Syrian army said in a statement earlier Saturday that it had carried out redeployment and repositioning in Sweida and Daraa after its checkpoints came under attack by \"terrorists.\" The army said it is setting up a \"strong and coherent defensive and security belt in the area,\" apparently to defend Damascus from the south.",
      "Since Syria's conflict broke out in March 2011, the Syrian government has been referring to opposition gunmen as terrorists.",
      "In the gas-rich nation of Qatar, the foreign ministers of Iran, Russia and Turkey were scheduled to meet to discuss the situation in Syria. Turkey is a main backer of the rebels seeking to overthrow Assad.",
      "Qatar's top diplomat, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, criticized Assad for failing to take advantage of the lull in fighting in recent years to address the country's underlying problems. \"Assad didn't seize this opportunity to start engaging and restoring his relationship with his people,\" he said.",
      "Sheikh Mohammed said he was surprised by how quickly the rebels have advanced and said there is a real threat to Syria's \"territorial integrity.\" He said the war could \"damage and destroy what is left if there is no sense of urgency\" to start a political process.",
      "After the fall of the cities of Daraa and Sweida early Saturday, Syrian government forces remain in control of five provincial capitals \u2014 Damascus, Homs and Quneitra, as well as Latakia and Tartus on the Mediterranean coast.",
      "Tartus is home to the only Russian naval base outside the former Soviet Union while Latakia is home to a major Russian air base.",
      "On Friday, U.S.-backed fighters of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) captured wide parts of the eastern province of Deir el-Zour that borders Iraq as well as the provincial capital that carries the same name. The capture of areas in Deir el-Zour is a blow to Iran's influence in the region as the area is the gateway to the corridor linking the Mediterranean to Iran, a supply line for Iran-backed fighters, including Lebanon's Hezbollah.",

    "story": [
      "South Korean prosecutors on Sunday detained a former defense minister who allegedly recommended last week's brief but stunning martial law imposition to President Yoon Suk Yeol, making him the first figure detained over the case, news reports said.",
      "The reported development came a day after Yoon avoided an opposition-led bid to impeach him in parliament, with most ruling party lawmakers boycotting a floor vote to prevent the two-thirds majority needed to suspend his presidential powers. The main liberal opposition Democratic Party said it will prepare a new impeachment motion against Yoon.",
      "However, according to Agence France-Presse, Yoon's ruling People Power Party said in a statement Sunday that it had \"effectively obtained (Yoon's) promise to step down.\"",
      "\"Until the president steps down, the president will be effectively excluded from his duties,\" it said in the statement, per AFP.",

      "Other South Korean media carried similar reports, saying Kim was moved to a Seoul detention center. The reports said police were searching Kim's former office and residence on Sunday.",
      "Repeated calls to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office and the Supreme Prosecutors' Office were unanswered. An official at the detention facility in eastern Seoul hung up the phone when The Associated Press called.",
      "Yoon accepted Kim's resignation offer on Thursday after opposition parties submitted a separate impeachment motion against him.",
      "Kim is a central figure in Yoon's martial law enforcement, which led to special forces troops encircling the National Assembly building and army helicopters hovering over it. The military withdrew after the parliament unanimously voted to overturn Yoon's decree, forcing his Cabinet to lift it before daybreak Wednesday.",
      "In Kim's impeachment motion document, the Democratic Party and other opposition parties accused him of proposing martial law to Yoon. Ruling party leader Han Dong-hun made a similar comment on Kim's role. Vice Defense Minister Kim Seon Ho told parliament that Kim Yong Hyun ordered the deployment of troops to the National Assembly.",
      "The Democratic Party called Yoon's martial law imposition \"unconstitutional, illegal rebellion or a coup.\" It has filed complaints with police against at least nine people, including Yoon and Kim, over the alleged rebellion.",
      "In a statement distributed by the Defense Ministry on Wednesday, Kim said that \"all troops who performed duties related to martial law were acting on my instructions, and all responsibility lies with me.\"",
      "Prosecutor General Shim Woo Jung told reporters on Thursday the prosecution plans to investigate the rebellion charges against Yoon following complaints filed by the opposition.",
      "While the president mostly has immunity from prosecution while in office, that does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. It wasn't immediately clear how the prosecution plans to proceed with an investigation into Yoon.",
      "The Defense Ministry said it has suspended three top military commanders over their alleged involvement in the martial law imposition. They were among those facing the opposition-raised rebellion allegations.",
      "On Saturday, Yoon issued an apology over the martial law decree, saying he won't shirk legal or political responsibility for the declaration and promising not to make another attempt to impose it. He said would leave it to his party to chart a course through the country's political turmoil, \"including matters related to my term in office.\"",
      "Since taking office in 2022, Yoon has struggled to push his agenda through an opposition-controlled parliament and grappled with low approval ratings amid scandals involving himself and his wife. In his martial law announcement on Tuesday night, Yoon called parliament a \"den of criminals\" bogging down state affairs and vowed to eliminate \"shameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces.\"",
      "The declaration of martial law was the first of its kind in more than 40 years in South Korea. The turmoil has paralyzed South Korean politics and sparked alarm among key diplomatic partners like the U.S. and Japan.",
      "The scrapping of Yoon's impeachment motion is expected to intensify protests calling for his ouster and deepen political chaos in South Korea, with a survey suggesting a majority of South Koreans support the president's impeachment.",
      "Yoon's martial law declaration drew criticism from his own ruling conservative People Power Party, but it is determined to oppose Yoon's impeachment apparently because it fears losing the presidency to liberals.",

      "\"The decision to rebuild Notre Dame was about our capacity to save, restore, sometimes reinvent what we are by preserving where we come from,\"\u00a0Macron told 60 Minutes. \"This is a message of achievement.\"",
      "Macron, who has had an up-and-down relationship with Trump, has made a point of cultivating a relationship with the president-elect since he defeated Vice President Kamala Harris last month. But his office nonetheless played down the significance of the invitation, saying that other politicians who do not currently hold office had been invited as well.",

      "Paris was abuzz with excitement after the beloved Notre Dame Cathedral\u00a0reopened after a devastating fire.",
      "The April 2019 blaze broke out in the church's roof space, destroying its iconic spire and damaging the cathedral's roof and upper walls. Restoration work has been underway on the 860-year-old building ever since.",
      "While there is still more work to be done to ensure the restored medieval cathedral can dominate the Paris skyline for centuries to come, the church opened its doors to the public Saturday. Demand for access was huge, with people coming from near and far to line the streets of Paris and wait to see the cathedral reopen.",
      "What happened when Notre Dame Cathedral reopened?",
      "The doors of Notre Dame Cathedral were opened by Laurent Ulrich, the Archbishop of Paris, in a traditional ceremony. He knocked on the heavy front doors of the medieval church with a crozier, or staff. The staff was made of wood salvaged from the cathedral's charred roof, according to the Associated Press.",
      "A psalm was sung from within the cathedral. The cathedral's 8,000-pipe organ was also used to respond to the archbishop's invocation, as four organists performed, the AP reported. After the psalm was sung three times, the doors opened.",
      "Guests entered through the cathedral's western facade for a ceremony \"steeped in history,\" the AP reported. It was followed by a star-studded prerecorded concert, featuring artists including cellist Yo-Yo Ma, according to the Associated Press. The performances focused on a message of harmony that celebrated the cathedral's resurrection and role as a sanctuary.",
      "Ulrich and other clergy members wore vibrant liturgical garments designed by renowned French fashion designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac. Castelbajac combined modern elements with medieval touches on colorful pieces for more than 700 celebrants, the AP reported.",
      "Speaking inside the cathedral, French President Emmanuel Macron expressed \"gratitude\" Saturday to those who saved, helped, and rebuilt Notre Dame, his voice reverberating through the nave.",
      "\"I stand before you ... to express the gratitude of the French nation,\" he said.",
      "\"Tonight, the bells of Notre Dame are ringing again. And in a moment, the organ will awaken,\" sending the \"music of hope\" cascading through the luminous interior to Parisians, France, and the world beyond, he said, according to the AP.",
      "On Sunday, Ulrich will lead an inaugural Mass in the cathedral. He will consecrate Notre Dame's new contemporary alter, which replaces the one crushed by the spire in the 2019 blaze.",
      "Restoring Notre Dame Cathedral inspires a new generation",
      "As the flames engulfed Notre Dame on that spring 2019 day, many feared that even if the cathedral survived the blaze, the skills needed to restore it were long lost. But it turned out there were still many traditional craftsmen and women quietly at work in France, and soon an army of artisans was drafted to restore the historic monument. It was an assignment of a lifetime, according to decorative painter Camille Schmoeker.",
      "\"Every day my coworkers and I were pinching ourselves, like, 'We are here,'\" said Schmoeker, who described her job as applying makeup touch-ups over the work of stonemasons. \"It's gratifying to know that I have helped create something better than what it was, and it will outlast my lifetime.\"",
      "Chief architect Philippe Villeneuve said the restoration shone a new light on traditional ways of working in construction and restoration. American carpenter Hank Silver, who worked on rebuilding the cathedral's timber roof, said the fire had a surprising effect on him and other workers.",
      "\"It's maybe a bit of a maybe a controversial point to say, but in many ways, this fire has been a great gift, not just to me personally, but (to) young people who really otherwise would never know that they could have a career as a traditional carpenter, stone cutter, mason. These trades are in the public eye again,\" Silver said. \"I think there's nothing better you can do with your life, really.\"",
      "For the artisans who have dedicated the past half-decade of their lives to rebuilding the historic site, the reopening is a bittersweet moment.",
      "\"I never thought I would get to do something like that,\" said apprentice roofer Mael Testas.",
      "\"I feel like it's in a way my little baby, and now it's all grown up,\" Silver said. \"Now it's going to be everyone's to visit.\"",
      "World leaders, including Trump, gather at Notre Dame Cathedral",
      "Many world leaders will be among the 1,500 guests attending the reopening celebration at Notre Dame Cathedral. President Biden will not be in attendance, but first lady Jill Biden will appear. President-elect Donald Trump will also be present. They, as well as leaders and dignitaries including England's Prince William and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, will be greeted by French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "Macron, who has faced political turmoil in recent days, was behind the ambitious decision to complete the cathedral's restoration in just five years. Donations from across the world helped speed the reconstruction process along. Americans were the most generous donors, with 45,000 United States citizens donating a total of $75 million. The reconstruction cost about 700 million euros, or $737 million.",
      "The reopening marks Trump's first international trip since he was reelected in November. He is set to meet with Macron and Prince William during his time in Paris. It was not immediately clear if Trump would meet with Zelenskyy The French president and other European leaders are trying to persuade Trump to continue to support Ukraine's defense against Russia.",

      "Bob Fernandez thought he'd go dancing and see the world when he joined the U.S. Navy as a 17-year-old high school student in August 1941.",
      "Four months later, he found himself shaking from explosions and passing ammunition to artillery crews so his ship's guns could return fire on Japanese planes bombing Pearl Harbor, a Navy base in Hawaii.",
      "\"When those things go off like that, we didn't know what's what,\" said Fernandez, who is now 100. \"We didn't even know we were in a war.\"",
      "Two survivors of the bombing \u2014 each 100 or older \u2014 are planning to return to Pearl Harbor on Saturday to observe 83 years since the attack that thrust the U.S. into World War II. They will join active-duty troops, veterans and members of the public for a remembrance ceremony hosted by the Navy and the National Park Service.",
      "Fernandez was initially planning to join them, but had to cancel because of health issues.",
      "The bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank during the battle. The remains of more than 900 Arizona crew members are still entombed on the submerged vessel.",
      "A moment of silence will be held at 7:54 a.m., the same time the attack began eight decades ago. Aircraft in missing man formation are due to fly overhead to break the silence.",
      "Dozens of survivors once joined the annual remembrance but attendance has declined as survivors have aged. Today there are only 16 still living, according to a list maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. Military historian J. Michael Wenger has estimated there were some 87,000 military personnel on Oahu on the day of the attack.",
      "Many laud Pearl Harbor survivors as heroes, but Fernandez doesn't view himself that way.",
      "\"I'm not a hero. I'm just nothing but an ammunition passer,\" he told The Associated Press in a phone interview from California, where he now lives with his nephew in Lodi.",
      "Fernandez was working as a mess cook on his ship, the USS Curtiss, the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, and planned to go dancing that night at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel in Waikiki.",
      "He brought sailors coffee and food as he waited tables during breakfast. Then they heard an alarm sound. Through a porthole, Fernandez saw a plane with the red ball insignia painted on Japanese aircraft fly by.",
      "Fernandez rushed down three decks to a magazine room where he and other sailors waited for someone to unlock a door storing 5-inch (12.7-centimeter), 38-caliber shells so they could begin passing them to the ship's guns.",
      "He has told interviewers over the years that some of his fellow sailors were praying and crying as they heard gunfire up above.",
      "\"I felt kind of scared because I didn't know what the hell was going on,\" Fernandez said.",
      "The ship's guns hit a Japanese plane that crashed into one of its cranes. Shortly after, its guns hit a dive bomber which then slammed into the ship and exploded below deck, setting the hangar and main decks on fire, according to the Navy History and Heritage Command.",
      "Fernandez's ship, the Curtiss, lost 21 men and nearly 60 of its sailors were injured.",
      "\"We lost a lot of good people, you know. They didn't do nothing,\" Fernandez said. \"But we never know what's going to happen in a war.\"",
      "After the attack, Fernandez had to sweep up debris. That night, he stood guard with a rifle to make sure no one tried to come aboard. When it came time to rest, he fell asleep next to where the ship's dead were lying. He only realized that when a fellow sailor woke him up and told him.",
      "After the war, Fernandez worked as a forklift driver at a cannery in San Leandro, California. His wife of 65 years, Mary Fernandez, died in 2014. His oldest son is now 82 and lives in Arizona. Two other sons and a stepdaughter have died.",
      "He has traveled to Hawaii three times to participate in the Pearl Harbor remembrance. This year would have been his fourth trip.",
      "Fernandez still enjoys music and goes dancing at a nearby restaurant once a week if he can. His favorite tune is Frank Sinatra's rendition of \"All of Me,\" a song his nephew Joe Guthrie said he still knows by heart.",

    "summary": "Pope Francis will have created 110 of the 140 cardinals under 80, thus eligible to vote in a conclave.",
    "story": [
      "Pope Francis on Saturday installed 21 new cardinals, many of whom are key figures in his reform agenda: A Dominican preacher who acted as the spiritual father for Francis' recent gathering of bishops, a Neapolitan \"street priest\" like himself, and a Peruvian bishop who has strongly backed his crackdown on abuse.",
      "Francis' 10th consistory to create new princes of the church is also the biggest infusion of voting-age cardinals in his 11-year pontificate, further cementing his imprint on the group of men who will one day elect his successor. With Saturday's additions, Francis will have created 110 of the 140 cardinals under 80, thus eligible to vote in a conclave.",
      "Francis appeared at the ceremony in St. Peter's Basilica with a significant bruise on his chin but presided over the ritual without apparent problems.",
      "A Vatican spokesman said later Saturday that the bruise was caused by a contusion Friday morning when Francis hit his nightstand with his chin. The pontiff, who turns 88 later this month, appeared slightly fatigued on Saturday but carried on as normal with the scheduled ceremony.",
      "Francis has suffered several health problems in recent years and now uses a wheelchair due to knee and back pain. In 2017, while on a trip to Colombia, Francis sported a black eye after he hit his head on a support bar when his popemobile stopped suddenly.",
      "An expanded consistory",
      "His consistory brings the number of voting-age cardinals well over the 120-man limit set by St. John Paul II. But 13 existing cardinals will turn 80 next year, bringing the numbers back down.",
      "This consistory is notable too because the 21 men being elevated aren't the same ones Francis named Oct. 6 when he announced an unusual December consistory.",
      "One of Francis' original picks, Indonesian Bishop Paskalis Bruno Syukur, the bishop of Bogor, asked not to be made a cardinal \"because of his desire to grow more in his life as a priest,\" the Vatican said. Francis quickly substituted him with the Naples archbishop, Domenico Battaglia, known for his pastoral work in the slums and rough parts of Naples.",
      "Battaglia is one of five Italians getting the red hat, keeping the once-dominant Italian presence in the College of Cardinals strong. Turin is getting a cardinal in its archbishop, Roberto Repole, as is Rome: Baldassare Reina, who on the same day Francis announced he was becoming a cardinal also learned that Francis had promoted him to be his top administrator for the diocese of Rome.",
      "Francis, who is technically bishop of Rome, has been conducting a years-long reorganization of the Rome diocese and its pontifical universities. Reina \u2013 who is also grand chancellor of the pre-eminent Pontifical Lateran University \u2013 will be expected to execute the reform.",
      "Another Italian is the oldest cardinal: Angelo Acerbi, a 99-year-old retired Vatican diplomat. He is the only one among the 21 new cardinals to be older than 80 and thus ineligible to vote in a conclave. Francis' picks on Saturday also include the youngest cardinal: the 44-year-old head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in Melbourne, Australia, Mykola Bychok.",
      "\"I think that there is a special sign which was made by the Pope to nominate me as the youngest cardinal in the world,\" Bychok said. \"Ukraine has been fighting for three years, officially and maybe unofficially from 2014, after the occupation of the Crimean Peninsula and two regions, Donetsk and Lugansk. \u2026 Maybe my weak voice will help to stop this war not only in Ukraine but as well in other countries around the world.\"",
      "Yet another Italian is one of two Vatican priests who do jobs in the Holy See that don't usually carry the red hat: Fabio Baggio is undersecretary in the Vatican development office. Francis also decided to make a cardinal out of George Jacob Koovakad, the priest who organizes the pope's foreign travels.",
      "High-profile roles in Francis' reforms are picked",
      "Other picks have high-profile roles in Francis' reforms.",
      "The archbishop of Lima, Peru, Carlos Gustavo Castillo Mattasoglio, made headlines recently because of an extraordinary essay he penned for El Pais newspaper in which he called for the suppression of an influential Peruvian Catholic movement, the Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, which also has a presence in the U.S.",
      "Castillo called the group a \"failed experiment\" of the church in Latin America, one of several conservative, right-wing movements that cropped up in the 1970s and 1980s as a counterweight to the more left-leaning liberation theology.",
      "\"My hypothesis is that the Sodalitium obeys a political project,\" Castillo wrote. \"It is the resurrection of fascism in Latin America, artfully using the church by means of sectarian methods.\"",
      "Francis has recently expelled the Sodalitium's founder and several top members following a Vatican investigation.",
      "Castillo is one of five new Latin American cardinals named by history's first Latin American pope. They include the archbishop of Santiago del Estero, Argentina, Vicente Bokalic Iglic; the archbishop of Porto Alegre, Brazil, Jaime Spengler; the archbishop of Santiago, Chile, Fernando Natalio Chomali Garib and the archbishop of Guayaquil, Ecuador, Luis Gerardo Cabrera Herrera.",
      "Francis has long sought to broaden the geographic diversity of the College of Cardinals to show the universality of the church, particularly where it is growing. Asia got two new cardinals: Tarcisio Isao Kikuchi, the archbishop of Tokyo; and Pablo Virgilio Sinogco David, the bishop of Kalookan, Philippines. Africa also got two new cardinals: the archbishop of Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Ignace Bessi Dogbo, and the bishop of Algiers, Algeria, Jean-Paul Vesco.",
      "\"There hasn't been an African pope, but it's a possibility in the church,\" Dogbo said in an interview on the eve of his installation. \"And I think that this eventuality - which is not necessarily a demand - if this eventuality were to arise, the universal church would have to be ready to take it on.\"",
      "Francis also tapped the archbishop of Tehran, Iran, Dominique Joseph Mathieu, the bishop of Belgrade, Serbia, Ladislav Nemet, while the lone North American cardinal named is the archbishop of Toronto, Frank Leo.",
      "A more inclusive church",
      "The Lithuanian-born cardinal-elect, Rolandas Makrickas, has a special job in this pontificate: As the archpriest of the St. Mary Major basilica, he hosts Francis every time the pope returns from a foreign trip, since the pope likes to pray before an icon of the Madonna in the church. Additionally, Makrickas oversaw a recent financial reform of the basilica and would have been involved in identifying the future final resting place for Francis, since the Argentine pope has said he will be buried there.",
      "Perhaps the most familiar new cardinal to anyone who has been following Francis' reform agenda is the Dominican Timothy Radcliff, the spiritual father of the just-concluded synod, or gathering of bishops. The years-long process aimed to make the church more inclusive and responsive to the needs of rank-and-file Catholics, especially women.",
      "A British theologian, the white-robed Radcliffe often provided clarifying, if not humorous interventions during the weeks-long debate and retreats. At one point he set off a mini-firestorm by suggesting that external financial pressures influenced African bishops to reject Francis' permission to allow blessings for gay couples. He later said he just meant that the African Catholic Church is under pressure from other well-financed faiths.",
      "As the synod was winding down, he offered some valuable perspective.",
      "\"Often we can have no idea as to how God's providence is at work in our lives. We do what we believe to be right and the rest is in the hands of the Lord,\" he told the gathering. \"This is just one synod. There will be others. We do not have to do everything, just try to take the next step.\"",

      "1. Check all of your cable connections",
      "While it might sound obvious, the first step to troubleshooting a computer that constantly crashes is ensuring everything is firmly plugged in. It's often the most overlooked step, so if you're using a desktop, you'll want to look behind your PC and ensure everything is plugged in. It would be best to try using a different electrical outlet to first rule out any electrical issues in your home.",
      "If you feel comfortable opening up your desktop PC, you can also go inside the case and ensure all your PCI connections are firmly plugged in. You'll want to ensure all your cables going to the power supply are firmly connected, and the same is true with the PCI power cables that supply electricity to the GPU and CPU.",

      "Computer overheating is a common cause of intermittent shutdowns and crashes. If your CPU (central processing unit), essentially the brain of your computer, or graphics card gets too hot, your computer might shut down to ensure the components aren't damaged. If you notice that your laptop or desktop is giving off a lot of heat, or in the case of a laptop, it is hot to the touch, or if you notice your fans running louder than usual, these are all signs of overheating.",
      "If your computer is overheating, the first step is to clean it thoroughly. I recommend blowing dust out of the interior fans with compressed air and keeping your PC in an area where it can receive proper airflow. If you have a desktop PC, try not to keep it under your desk. Keeping a PC under a desk can cause issues with dust build-up and lack of airflow. It's best to keep your desktop in a part of your home or office where it can receive a decent amount of airflow.",

      "Have you ever found yourself needing to constantly turn the volume up on your TV because it sounds like the actors onscreen are speaking in whispers, but then whenever action is onscreen, your TV feels deafening? It's not just you.",
      "This is one of the most common issues people have with their TV audio, but, fortunately, you can change a few settings on your TV to make the dialogue sound clearer.",

      "A viewer adjusting TV audio settings with a remote control. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Most modern TVs feature preset audio settings that you can adjust on the fly to make things sound better, depending on whether you're gaming, watching a live concert or watching a slow-burn drama. Too much bass will often obscure spoken dialogue in TV shows and movies, and I suggest going through your TV's preset audio settings to see if you can make the audio clearer. Most TVs feature a movie, music and standard mode for TV audio. You can find your TV's audio presets by navigating to the settings from your remote and selecting \"sound.\"",
      "Some TVs will also feature audio presets explicitly designed for dialogue. Check to see if you have a setting for \"Dialogue,\" \"News,\" \"Speech\" or even \"Speech Boost\" in your TV audio settings. Any three of these should help your TV dialogue come through more clearly. You might also want to consider disabling settings for surround sound or bass boost, as these can cover up the sound of dialogue by increasing the bass too much.",
      "Increasing the treble might be worth it if you have access to EQ settings on your TV and are struggling to hear TV dialogue. It's an easy fix that can improve audio quality without taking too much away from non-dialogue sound in a movie or TV show.",

      "2. Adjust dynamic range compression",
      "A floor-standing speaker. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Dynamic range compression, or \"volume leveling,\" is useful for tailoring audio sound to personal needs. Volume leveling reduces the gulf between the loudest and quietest sounds onscreen, making it easier to hear and understand onscreen dialogue, especially in action movies, where the dialogue is often much quieter than the preceding action sequence. You'll find the settings for volume leveling or dynamic range compression in your TV audio settings, which, on most TVs, you can access directly from the remote.",
      "My TV features volume leveling, and I love to use it when I watch TV late at night at a low volume. It helps me to understand everything easily without having the speakers loud enough to wake anyone else up. It's also a great way to keep the audio level when commercials come on if you watch cable.",

While a few high-level TVs come with a built-in soundbar, you'll still have the best experience with your own independent speakers or a soundbar. If you followed the two tips above but are still having trouble hearing movie or TV dialogue, it might be time to look into and invest in a set of speakers or, if you want a single unit,\u00a0a soundbar.",
      "I prefer using a soundbar with a TV over speakers for a cleaner setup because they often come with built-in subwoofers that enhance the bass, making action scenes and music sound more immersive. Additionally, modern soundbars are sleek and can easily blend with your home decor. Many of them also support advanced audio technologies like Dolby Atmos, which provides a surround sound experience without the need for multiple speakers scattered around the room.",

      "What is scambaiting?",
      "Scambaiting is when someone interacts with a scammer to waste their time and resources. Some of these online experiences are entertaining and even hilarious to watch. Instead of falling for their sneaky tricks, scambaiters play along, knowing it's a scam, and take on the role of a potential victim to keep the scammers busy. But get this \u2014 there's now some new technology to do the scambaiting for you.",

      "TOP 10 ROBOCALL HOTSPOTS IN AMERICA",
      "Why scambaiting matters",
      "So, why should we care about scambaiting? This creative strategy offers several compelling benefits. First and foremost, it effectively wastes scammers' time. Every minute they spend on the phone with Daisy is a minute they can't use to target real victims. By keeping them occupied, we can potentially prevent them from scamming someone else.",
      "In addition to wasting time, scambaiting raises awareness about common scams. It serves as an educational tool, helping others recognize and avoid falling prey to similar tactics. The more people understand how these scams operate, the less likely they are to become victims. Moreover, watching scammers get flustered sheds light on the lengths these criminals will go to and highlights the importance of staying vigilant against their schemes.",

      "That's Daisy, an artificial intelligence-powered grandma developed by Virgin Media O2 to interact with scammers. When a scam call comes in, Daisy automatically answers and engages the caller in conversation, wasting their time. With her friendly personality and quick thinking, she keeps them on the line while gathering useful information about their tactics.\u00a0Daisy combines various AI models that work together to listen and respond to fraudulent calls instantaneously. She's so lifelike that she has successfully kept numerous fraudsters on calls for 40 minutes at a time. By tricking the criminals into thinking they were defrauding a real person and playing on scammers' biases about older people, Daisy has prevented them from targeting real victims.",
      "Now, before you get too excited, Daisy is currently only available for customers of Virgin Media O2 in the U.K., but other companies in the U.S. are beginning to offer similar AI-driven solutions. For instance,\u00a0Apate.ai has developed AI.Callee, which engages scammers in real-time conversations across various channels. Another U.S. company,\u00a0Scamnetic, has launched an AI-based scam-detection solution that can be integrated into enterprise platforms to protect consumers from various types of scams.",

      "Protecting yourself from robocall scams",
      "While scambaiting can be a fun way to fight back against scams, the best defense is simply not picking up and answering scam calls in the first place. One effective strategy is to consider investing in personal data removal services that wipe your information from public databases on the internet. By reducing your digital footprint, you can make it more difficult for scammers to contact you in the first place. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "The introduction of AI-powered scambaiters like Daisy marks a new era in the fight against fraud. While it's entertaining to imagine scammers being outwitted by a chatty AI grandma, it's important to remember that the ultimate goal is to protect vulnerable individuals from falling victim to these schemes. As technology evolves, so do the tactics of scammers, making it crucial for everyone to stay informed and vigilant.

      "This email claims to be from UPS, but it is actually a scam. It uses the UPS logo and colors to look authentic and is designed to trick you into clicking on malicious links.

      "Fake Rachel Ray Cookware Set scam disguised as Kohl\u2019s email",
      "One of the phishing scams we encountered recently is an email claiming that you've won a Rachel Ray Cucina Cookware Set. This email is particularly deceptive because it appears to come from a reputable retailer, Kohl's, but there are several red flags to watch out for. The email falsely claims to be from \"Kohl's Department\" instead of the official \"Kohl's.\" This slight alteration is a common tactic used by scammers to trick recipients into believing the email is legitimate.",
      "The email's reply-to address is tech@student.lvusd.org, which is clearly unrelated to Kohl's. Official emails from Kohl's would not use a student email address. The message includes phrases like \"You have won a Rachel Ray Cucina Cookware Set\" to create a sense of urgency and excitement, prompting you to click on the provided link without proper verification.",
      "Fake Kohl\u2019s email. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Additional red flags to spot phishing emails",
      "As you can see, phishing emails can be hard to distinguish from genuine ones, especially during the busy holiday season when you may receive many emails from various sources. However, there are some additional red flags beyond the ones we've already mentioned that can help you identify a fake email. Here are some of them:",
      "Check the sender\u2019s address and domain name. Fake emails often use spoofed or similar-looking addresses and domain names to deceive you. For example, an email from support@amaz0n.com or info@fedex.delivery.com is likely a phishing attempt. You'll notice in the Apple phishing email below the email address has just a bunch of letters and numbers. Always verify the sender\u2019s address and domain name before opening or responding to an email.",
      "Check the spelling and grammar. Phishing emails often contain spelling and grammar errors or use poor or unnatural language. For example, an email that says, \"Dear Customer, Your order has been shipped. Please confirm your delivery address by clicking here.\" It is suspicious because it does not address you by name, uses a generic greeting and asks you to click on a link. Always read the email carefully and look for any mistakes or inconsistencies.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Check the links and attachments. Fake emails often contain links and attachments that lead to malicious websites or download malware to your device. For example, an email that says, \"You have won a $100 gift card from Walmart. Click here to claim your prize.\" It is likely a scam. On a laptop or desktop, always carefully hover your mouse over the links and check the URL before clicking on them, and never open or download any attachments from unknown or suspicious sources.",
      "How to handle spam emails",
      "Use strong antivirus software: The first and most crucial step to protect yourself from accidentally clicking on fake links in spam emails is to have strong antivirus software installed on your device. This software can detect and block malicious emails and links, providing an extra layer of security.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "Do not open or reply to spam emails.\u00a0This can confirm your email address to the sender and encourage them to send you more spam. It can also expose you to malicious links or attachments that can harm your device or data.",
      "Mark spam email as junk or spam. Most email providers have a\u00a0feature that allows you to flag spam emails and move them to a separate folder. This can help you filter out spam emails from your inbox and also improve the spam detection of your email provider.",
      "Do not share your email address publicly or with unknown sources.\u00a0This can reduce the chances of your email address being collected by spammers. You can also use a disposable or\u00a0email alias for signing up for online services that you do not trust or need.",
      "Use a personal data removal service: Scammers can obtain your information from various online sources, including data brokers, people search sites and public records. Using a data removal service can help reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to access your personal information. This proactive step can be crucial in preventing identity theft and minimizing the chances of falling victim to scams during the busy holiday season.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "YOUR EMAIL DIDN'T EXPIRE, IT'S JUST ANOTHER SNEAKY SCAM",
      "What to do if you accidentally click on a link or open an attachment from a fake email",
      "If you realize that you have clicked on a link or opened an attachment from a fake email, don\u2019t panic. Here are some steps that you can take to minimize the damage and protect yourself:",
      "1. Disconnect your device from the internet.\u00a0This will prevent any further communication or data transfer between your device and the malicious website or\u00a0malware. You can do this by turning off your Wi-Fi or unplugging your ethernet cable.",
      "2. Scan your device for malware. Use a reputable\u00a0antivirus software to scan your device and remove any potential threats. Having good antivirus software actively running on your devices will alert you of any malware in your system, warn you against clicking on any malicious links in phishing emails, and ultimately protect you from being hacked.\u00a0 Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "3. Change your passwords. If you have entered or provided any passwords or personal information on the malicious website, you should change them as soon as possible. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. You should also\u00a0enable\u00a0two-factor authentication for your online accounts, which adds an extra layer of security by requiring a code or a device confirmation in addition to your password.",
      "5. Monitor your accounts and credit reports.\u00a0If you have entered or provided any financial information on the malicious website or link you clicked on, you should monitor your bank accounts, credit cards and credit reports for any suspicious or unauthorized activity.",
      "6. You should also\u00a0contact your bank or credit card company and inform them of the incident. You may need to cancel or freeze your cards or accounts to prevent any further fraud.",
      "7. Report the phishing email.\u00a0You should also report the phishing email to the sender\u2019s legitimate organization, such as your bank, retailer or delivery service, and to the authorities, such as the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or the\u00a0Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG). This will help them to take action and prevent others from falling for the same scam.",
      "8. Use identity theft protection services\u00a0if you entered your personal information on any links you clicked on or websites that you were directed to. Identity theft protection companies can monitor your personal information (home title, Social Security number, phone number, email address) and alert you in the event they become breached. It can also alert you if any of these are being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Unfortunately, as the holiday season unfolds, cybercriminals are also getting into the \"holiday spirit\" by increasing their efforts to exploit your trust and distractions. By staying alert and applying the tips we\u2019ve discussed, you can enjoy the season without falling victim to their schemes. Remember, phishing emails are designed to play on your emotions \u2014 whether it's excitement, urgency or curiosity. Always take a moment to verify the authenticity of any message before clicking on links or sharing personal information. When in doubt, reach out directly to the company or service in question through its official website or app.",

      "What is SpyLoan malware?",
      "SpyLoan is malware often hidden in apps that promise instant loans. These apps reel people in with offers of quick, hassle-free loans, boasting low rates and hardly any requirements. While they might look legit at first glance, their real goal is to gather as much personal info as they can.",
      "Once they have it, they use it to harass or pressure users into paying ridiculous interest rates. They also use shady tactics like countdown timers or \"limited-time\" offers to create a fake sense of urgency, pushing people to act fast without thinking it through. Instead of helping with finances, these apps trap users in a cycle of debt and invade their privacy.",
      "McAfee's mobile research team has\u00a0uncovered 15 apps on the Google Play Store packed with SpyLoan malware. These apps use the same code and systems, targeting users worldwide to steal data and send it to command-and-control (C2) servers. Many of them hide behind fake names and logos that mimic legitimate financial institutions, making them look trustworthy at first glance. You can find the names of these apps in the screenshot added below.",

      "McAfee, an App Defense Alliance partner tasked with helping keep the Play Store safe, reported the apps to Google. Google took action, and the malicious versions of the apps are no longer available on Google Play.",
      "We reached out to Google, and a rep confirmed that Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by Google Play Protect. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android devices.",
      "ANDROID BANKING TROJAN EVOLVES TO EVADE DETECTION AND STRIKE GLOBALLY",
      "How do these predatory apps work?",
      "The goal of these malicious apps is to gather as much data as possible from infected devices, which they then use to extort users. Victims are often coerced into repaying loans at sky-high interest rates, with some even being threatened for delays. In extreme cases, the app operators have harassed victims' families and sent death threats, using stolen personal photos as leverage.",
      "These apps request intrusive permissions, giving them access to system data, cameras, call logs, contacts, location, and SMS messages. They justify this data collection by claiming it's necessary for user verification and anti-fraud measures.",
      "Users signing up for these services are verified through a one-time password (OTP) to confirm their phone number is from the target region. They are also pressured to share additional details like ID documents, bank accounts, and employment information.",

      "4 ways to protect yourself from SpyLoan malware",
      "1. Have strong antivirus software: Android has its own built-in malware protection called Play Protect, but the SpyLoan malware proves it\u2019s not enough. Historically, Play Protect hasn\u2019t been 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android phones. The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you of any\u00a0phishing emails or\u00a0ransomware scams.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Download apps from reliable sources: It\u2019s important to download apps only from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. You might say I am contradicting myself, but the Play Store is still safer than other options out there. They have strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software.\u00a0However, even with the security measures provided by Google Play, downloading apps from the store does not guarantee 100% protection against malware or harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they can pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Never trust download links that you get through SMS.",
      "3. Be cautious with app permissions: Always review the permissions requested by apps before installation. If an app requests access to features that seem unnecessary for its function, it could be a sign of malicious intent. Do not give any app Accessibility permissions unless you really need to. Avoid granting permissions that could compromise your personal data.",
      "4. Take loans from legit institutions:\u00a0Always take loans from legitimate financial institutions like banks or well-known lenders. Avoid sketchy apps or services promising instant cash with minimal requirements. They\u2019re often too good to be true. Legit lenders are transparent about their terms, interest rates, and fees, and they won\u2019t demand access to your personal data or pressure you with scare tactics. If you\u2019re unsure about a lender, check reviews, verify their credentials, or consult a financial advisor before committing.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It can be tempting to use apps that promise instant loans, especially when you need the money. But they're often just trying to scam you and push you into a never-ending debt cycle. If you need a loan, go to a trusted bank or lender. Protecting yourself from malicious apps like those infected with SpyLoan malware starts with staying informed and cautious. Always scrutinize the apps you download, stick to trusted platforms, and think twice before sharing sensitive information.",

There are several antivirus programs that continue to support Windows 7.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

Well, get ready to have your mind blown! Scientists at the Technical University of Munich have cooked up something that might just change the game for anyone who's ever wished walking was a little easier.",
      "They call it the WalkON system, a pair of high-tech shorts that's not your average gym wear. These bad boys can cut down the energy you need for a stroll or jog by up to 18%! Whether you're a spring chicken or in your golden years, these shorts could be a game-changer, especially if stairs have become your nemesis or long walks leave you winded.",

      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the robotic shorts work",
      "The WalkON system combines sensors, artificial tendons and smart motors to enhance your natural walking motion. It starts with advanced sensors embedded in the shorts that continuously monitor the stress on your tendons. These sensors are incredibly precise, picking up on subtle changes in your movement, including how fast you\u2019re walking and the angle of your hips.",
      "Connected to these sensors are two thin artificial tendons that extend from your thighs to a specially designed waist belt. These tendons play a crucial role in how the system assists you. When you start to walk, the shorts analyze your gait pattern and can even detect the moment you transition from standing to walking. As each leg enters the \"swing phase,\" the system knows exactly when to kick in.",
      "At just the right moment, small but powerful motors activate and gently pull on the artificial tendons. This action helps lift your thigh, reducing the effort needed by your hip flexor muscles, making it feel much easier to move. What\u2019s really impressive is how adaptable WalkON is; whether you prefer a slow stroll or a brisk jog, the system adjusts its level of assistance based on your speed and leg weight. All of this happens seamlessly, so you experience a natural enhancement to your movement rather than feeling like you\u2019re being pushed or pulled by a machine.",

This reduction in energy expenditure is equivalent to the feeling of instantly losing 22 pounds or 13 pounds, respectively. The system allows you to walk slowly or jog, providing versatility in movement. Participants in tests reported high satisfaction with the device, giving it a mean rating of 6 out of 7 for its ability to assist while maintaining a sense of control.",

      "COULD THESE EXOSKELETON 'POWER PANTS' MAKE OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES EASIER IN THE FUTURE?",
      "Target demographics",
      "The WalkON system can benefit anyone seeking to increase their mobility; however, it shows particular promise for older adults who may experience declining physical capabilities. Additionally, individuals weakened by illness can find significant advantages in using WalkON to enhance their mobility and independence. Furthermore, the device is designed for those looking to maintain an active and healthy lifestyle, making it a versatile solution for a wide range of users.",
      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WEARABLE EXOSKELETON CAN TURN YOU INTO A SUPERHUMAN ATHLETE",
      "Comparison to other exoskeletons",
      "Unlike traditional rigid exoskeletons, WalkON's soft, flexible design offers several advantages over its more cumbersome counterparts. Conventional exoskeletons often feature rigid frames that can be difficult and time-consuming to put on, limiting their practicality for daily use.",
      "In contrast, WalkON's soft robotic shorts can be put on quickly and easily, similar to regular clothing, and are more than a mechanical device. Professor Lorenzia Masia, the lead researcher, aptly compares WalkON to an electric bike for walking. This analogy highlights the system's ability to enhance natural movement without overpowering it, making mobility more accessible and appealing to a wider range of users. The lightweight, tendon-driven design of WalkON allows for a more natural range of motion, adapting to the user's movements rather than constraining them.",
      "Furthermore, WalkON's compact and unobtrusive nature addresses a common concern with exoskeletons: social acceptance. Its design allows it to be worn discreetly under regular clothing, potentially increasing user comfort in social situations. This feature, combined with its efficiency in reducing metabolic cost, positions WalkON as a more practical solution for everyday use compared to bulkier exoskeleton systems.",
      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Availability and cost",
      "Given the current stage of development and testing, it's likely that WalkON could be available to you within the next three to five years, pending further research and regulatory approvals.",
      "While no exact price point is yet available, we can compare it to other assistive technologies. Current exoskeletons can cost anywhere from $40,000 to $100,000-plus. However, given WalkON's simpler design and intended widespread use, it's possible that it could be priced more affordably, perhaps in the range of $5,000 to $15,000 when it first hits the market. As with many technologies, the price could decrease over time as production scales up.",
      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The WalkON system's potential to enhance mobility for people of all ages, particularly older adults and those with health challenges, is immense. By making movement easier and more efficient, WalkON could encourage more active lifestyles, potentially improving overall health and quality of life for many individuals. While questions about availability and cost remain, the development of WalkON is a promising sign that we're moving towards more accessible and user-friendly mobility assistance solutions.",

      "One such migrant shelter in Marlborough, Massachusetts, was managed by\u00a0Jon Fetherston\u00a0from November 2023 to July 2024, who\u00a0painted a chaotic picture of his time there with violence, wasteful spending and rape.",
      "\"There was a lot of violence,\" Fetherston told The Daily Wire of the crowded 550-person shelter at Holiday Inn at 265 Lakeside Ave. \"Unfortunately there was a gentleman in the hotel that impregnated his own daughter and got very violent when the state removed her from the shelter.\"",
      "A Maine Wire report from June appears to corroborate the claim, reporting that illegal immigrant Ronald Joseph allegedly raped his 14-year-old daughter numerous times on the journey to the U.S. \u2014 both before and after crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.",

      "That shelter is also paid for by taxpayers and residents receive the full slate of benefits while staying there, according to The Maine Wire, which reports that the official report did not recommend that any criminal charges should be brought against Joseph.",
      "In another disturbing incident, Fetherston says that a 16-year-old female student says she was raped multiple times by a 29-year-old man.",

      "\"If you were receiving benefits and you were receiving those, then we were going to start scaling back on providing diapers, formula and wipes,\" Fetherston said. \"That did not go over well with the migrants. They thought that they were being attacked. A gentleman then drove his car into my office.\"",
      "Fetherston told the Daily Wire that his daily tasks included assisting migrants with enrolling in social services like food stamps and government health insurance. The migrants were given three meals a day from catering companies, and he purchased essential items such as toiletries, diapers, strollers and baby wipes for them.",
      "He also coordinated state-paid, same-day dry cleaning for the migrants and arranged Uber rides to work when needed. He added he was given an Amazon budget and other accounts to buy necessities for the migrants with no spending cap.",

Of those: one was forced to resign and flee the country, two were deposed in military coups, and one was assassinated by his close friend, who was also the head of South Korea's equivalent of the CIA.",
      "Out of the eight democratically elected presidents (which includes Yoon), all have been implicated in scandals. Even Kim Dae-jung, the late dissident-turned-president who won a Nobel Peace Prize, is now viewed less favorably after it emerged that he essentially bribed North Korea into holding an unprecedented inter-Korean summit meeting.",

      "So far, four elected Korean heads of state have served time in prison, two were impeached with one convicted and removed from office, one ex-president jumped off a 150-foot-high mountain cliff, dying by suicide in 2009 after his aides, relatives and even wife and son were investigated for bribery and other corruption charges. Since the country's founding, another two presidents have been sentenced to death but later pardoned.",
      "One would be forgiven for assuming the above were a script for a Korean TV drama series. Korea is a democratic, highly educated, extremely technologically advanced, conservative and deeply religious society.

      "Trump made the comments, his most sweeping since he won the election, in an exclusive interview with NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker.

Of those, at least 645 defendants have been sentenced to incarceration ranging from a few days to 22 years in federal lockup. About 250 people are in custody, most of them serving sentences after having been convicted. A handful are being held in pretrial custody at the order of a federal judge.",

Welker noted in a back-and-forth that studies have shown childhood vaccines prevent about 4 million deaths worldwide every year, have found no connection between vaccines and autism, and that rises in autism diagnoses are attributable to increased screening and awareness. \u201cIf you go back 25 years ago,\u201d Trump claimed, \u201cyou had very little autism. Now you have it.\u201d",

His research was found to be critically flawed and was subsequently retracted. Hundreds of studies have found childhood vaccines to be safe.",
      "Autism diagnoses have risen from about 1 in 150 children in 2000 to 1 in 36 today, though researchers have pointed to increased screening and changing definitions of the condition as the basis for that rise. Scientists have found a strong genetic link to the complex disorder, with many risk factors occurring before birth or during delivery.",
      "Trump, too, has for years suggested a link between autism and vaccines.",

If somebody told me, \u2018Get rid of the polio vaccine,\u2019 they\u2019re going to have to work real hard to convince me. I think vaccines are \u2014 certain vaccines \u2014 are incredible, but maybe some aren\u2019t. And if they aren\u2019t, we have to find out. But when you talk about autism, because it was brought up, and you look at the amount we have today versus 20 or 25 years ago, it\u2019s pretty scary.\u201d",

      "Trump swiped at Powell again in March 2020, at the start of the pandemic, telling reporters that he had the \u201cright to remove\u201d Powell from the post and criticizing what he said were \u201ca lot of bad decisions, in my opinion.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Jay-Z, the star rapper and entrepreneur whose real name is Shawn Carter, was accused in a lawsuit Sunday of raping a 13-year-old girl in 2000 allegedly along with Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs.",
      "The anonymous accuser, identified only as \u201cJane Doe,\u201d said the assault happened after she was driven to an MTV Video Music Awards after-party.",
      "The federal lawsuit was originally filed in October in the Southern District of New York, listing Combs as a defendant. It was refiled Sunday to include Carter.",
      "Texas-based attorney Tony Buzbee, who filed the suit, did not comment.",
      "\"These allegations are so heinous in nature that I implore you to file a criminal complaint, not a civil one!!\u00a0Whomever would commit such a crime against a minor should be locked away, would you not agree?\" Carter said in a statement to NBC News.",
      "\"These alleged victims would deserve real justice if that were the case.\"",
      "Buzbee has filed several lawsuits in recent months \u2014 all have withheld their complainants\u2019 names \u2014 accusing Combs of assault and rape. This is the first suit in which he has named another high-profile defendant.",
      "Combs\u2019 representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Combs has repeatedly denied all the accusations against him. Federal prosecutors in New York criminally charged him in September with racketeering, sex trafficking and other offenses, and he is behind bars at Brooklyn\u2019s Metropolitan Detention Center after he was denied bail for a third time last month. His trial scheduled for May 5.",
      "Prosecutors said in a court hearing last month that they are in the process of potentially bringing more charges against Combs in a superseding indictment.",
      "Before Sunday's lawsuit was refiled, \"Carter received a letter from Plaintiff\u2019s counsel requesting a mediation to resolve this matter,\" Buzbee wrote in the suit. NBC News has seen that letter.\u00a0In response to the letter, Buzbee wrote in the suit, Carter filed his own lawsuit against the accuser's attorneys.",
      "Carter addressed that letter in his statement.",
      "\"My lawyer received a blackmail attempt, called a demand letter, from a \u201clawyer\u201d named Tony Buzbee. What he had calculated was the nature of these allegations and the public scrutiny would make me want to settle.",
      "\"No sir, it had the opposite effect! It made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion. So no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!!\" the statement read.",
      "The lawsuit claims that in 2000, when Doe was 13, Combs and Carter raped her at a house party after the MTV Video Music Awards in New York.",
      "The lawsuit says a friend dropped her off at the VMAs at Radio City Music Hall. She did not have a ticket, and she approached various limousine drivers to try to gain access to the show or an after-party.",
      "One driver, the lawsuit says, told her that he worked for Combs and that she \u201cfit what Diddy was looking for.\u201d He invited her to a party after the show and told her to return to his car later in the evening after he transported Carter and Combs, the suit says.",
      "Later, the driver picked her up, the suit says, and after 20 minutes they arrived at a white house with a U-shaped driveway, the suit says. She had to sign a document she believed was a nondisclosure agreement on arrival \u2014 and did not receive a copy \u2014 to enter the party, which the suit says was filled with celebrities and people doing marijuana and cocaine.",
      "She was offered a drink that made her feel \u201cwoozy, lightheaded and felt [like] she needed to lie down,\u201d the suit says, and she went into a room to rest.",
      "Shortly afterward, the suit says, Combs and Carter entered the room with Combs saying, \u201cYou are ready to party!\u201d",
      "That\u2019s when, she alleges, Carter removed her clothes, held her down and raped her while Combs and an unnamed female celebrity watched. She says Combs also raped her as Carter and the woman looked on.",
      "The suit says that she was able to resist being forced to perform oral sex on Combs by hitting him in the neck and that he \u201cstopped.\u201d",
      "After the alleged assault, the suit says, she \u201cgrabbed her clothes\u201d and left. She made her way to a gas station, where she called her father.",
      "The accuser is seeking unspecified damages. The lawsuit is filed under New York\u2019s Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection Act.",
      "\"My only heartbreak is for my family,\" Carter said in the statement. \"My wife and I will have to sit our children down, one of whom is at the age where her friends will surely see the press and ask questions about the nature of these claims, and explain the cruelty and greed of people. I mourn yet another loss of innocence.\""

      "VANCOUVER, British Columbia \u2014\u00a0As Taylor Swift sings in her famed fan anthem \u201cLong Live,\u201d \u201cRemember this moment.\u201d",
      "For her loyal fans, there have been many of those moments since the Eras Tour kicked off in March 2023.",
      "Sunday night\u2019s show will be the last of that marathon tour, which has spanned nearly two years, five continents, 50 cities and a remarkable 149 shows \u2014 each of which has featured Swift singing, dancing and glittering for more than three hours.",
      "Swift said in June that the tour, which at the time seemed to be everlasting, would conclude in Vancouver in December.",
      "The tour, which featured songs from Swift\u2019s 11 albums, or \u201ceras,\u201d was marked by\u00a0friendship bracelets, a\u00a0revolt against Ticketmaster, a\u00a0record-setting concert film\u00a0and\u00a0booming economies\u00a0in nearly every city she touched.",
      "It also featured a\u00a0blossoming romance\u00a0with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, who appeared onstage in London and was mentioned in Swift\u2019s \u201cKarma\u201d multiple times on the tour.",
      "Over the 20-plus months of shows, Swift somehow had time to offer her fans three new releases, including two \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d rerecordings to add to the collection and a fresh album this year.",
      "When the tour kicked off in Glendale, Arizona, on March 17, 2023, the show included nine of Swift\u2019s then 10 eras, opening with the \u201cLover\u201d album \u2014 which had not yet been toured, because of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2014\u00a0and closing out with \u201cMidnights,\u201d Swift\u2019s latest release before the tour began.",
      "Fans were sad to learn her debut album, \u201cTaylor Swift,\u201d would not be a mainstay in the setlist, but plenty of its songs were performed multiple times in the acoustic set of the show.",
      "In the first major surprise of the tour, Swift announced the release date for \u201cSpeak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d at a show in Nashville, Tennessee, in May 2023 on her first of two U.S. legs.",
      "She closed out that leg by announcing the release date for \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d at the final show, held in Inglewood, California \u2014 appropriately on Aug. 9, 2023 (or 8/9).",
      "Swift then turned the show on its head this May as she embarked on the European leg of the tour, dropping songs from certain eras to make room for a new one: \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d which she released in April.",
      "Those releases have prompted loyal fans to search high and low for Swift\u2019s famous \u201cEaster eggs,\u201d hoping they might hint at the release of one of her last two albums yet to be rerecorded: \u201cReputation (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d and \u201cTaylor Swift (Taylor\u2019s Version).\u201d",
      "So far, no luck for the Swifties on that front, but that did not deter them from showing up in droves to each show, often in sparkly handmade costumes that alluded to her eras and lyrics, and even some Swiftie inside jokes.",
      "One fan, Hope Pinc, dressed up as Swift\u2019s cat, Benjamin Button, for the final weekend of shows.",
      "Pinc and friends Melissa Peirce and Elizabeth Sanders traveled from San Diego to Vancouver, where they had tickets to all three final shows. Peirce referred to Swift as one of her \u201cgreat friends\u201d who \u201cjust doesn\u2019t know yet.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like going to one of her shows and the endorphins and the love,\u201d Pinc said.",
      "Sisters Amanda and Sarah Cowley, both University of Victoria students, described the show as \u201cunreal\u201d and \u201cincredible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s insane the amount of tourism this brings, \u2019cause this is our home city. ... I\u2019ve never seen anything like this in my life,\u201d Sarah Cowley said.",
      "Amanda Cowley said it\u2019s \u201ccrazy\u201d to be at the show as \u201cboth a fan and just to witness this.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be historic one day to say that I went to the Eras Tour,\u201d she said.",
      "Sean Stear, an Idaho fire captain and paramedic sporting a bejeweled \u201cTS\u201d and \u201c13\u201d on his bald head, said Swift\u2019s music has brought him closer to his 11-year-old daughter.",
      "He picked up overtime shifts to afford the $3,000 resale tickets for the Friday show, and when the first leg of their flight to Vancouver was canceled, the family drove to meet the second, he said.",
      "\u201cI just think she appreciates everything that she does. She found that connection,\u201d Stear said. \u201cAnd I kind of see it as like this is her Super Bowl-type thing. I\u2019m big into football. She\u2019s big into Taylor Swift, so we have that passion, so it\u2019s awesome.\u201d",
      "Holden Williams said the Eras Tour brought fans a \u201ccommunity,\u201d and she had a message for Swift.",
      "\u201cThank you so much for everything you\u2019ve done for me,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd thank you for creating all of this for the Eras Tour.\u201d",

      "The 12-team College Football Playoff that will eventually crown a national champion was unveiled Sunday, with top-seeded Oregon, Georgia, Boise State and Arizona State earning the top four seeds and first-round byes in the bracket.",
      "As part of the playoff\u2019s expansion from four teams to 12 this season, its 13-member selection committee selected the five highest-ranked conference champions, plus seven at-large teams. Only the four highest-ranked conference champions were eligible to earn top four seeds and the reward of byes into the quarterfinals. The rule meant the committee\u2019s final top 25 rankings differed from its seedings.",
      "The 12-team bracket, by seedings:",
      "1. Oregon (13-0)",

      "12. Clemson (10-3)",
      "Little movement between the committee\u2019s penultimate top 25 ranking, which was released Tuesday, was expected, and Sunday\u2019s finale because the committee chair, Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel, had said teams not participating in conference championship games this weekend were essentially frozen in order.",
      "The 48 hours before the bracket reveal went mostly to expectations, as many favorites won their conference championship games; however, an exception was when Clemson upset SMU on a last-second field goal to win Saturday\u2019s ACC championship game. SMU, which was projected for a possible top four seed as a conference champion just one week ago, suddenly had its r\u00e9sum\u00e9 thrown into a debate with other at-large candidates such as Alabama, which had more losses but more top 25 victories, for the last at-large spot.",
      "Ultimately, SMU became one of the bracket\u2019s biggest winners when the committee included the Mustangs despite its title-game loss, leaving out perennial powerhouse Alabama.",
      "Manuel said the committee strongly debated the merits of SMU and Alabama.",
      "\u201cThe way SMU played in that game, losing on a last-second field goal, we felt like in this case SMU had the nod above Alabama,\u201d Manuel said, \"but it\u2019s no disrespect to Alabama\u2019s strength of schedule.\"",
      "Former Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban suggested on ESPN that teams would need to stiffen their scheduling in the future.",

    "summary": "When the Michigan Wolverines hired Jim Harbaugh as their head coach in December 2014, the task was obvious: Beat Ohio State and return the school to national relevance.",
    "story": [
      "When the Michigan Wolverines hired Jim Harbaugh as their head coach in December 2014, the task was obvious: Beat Ohio State and return the school to national relevance.",
      "From 1997 until Harbaugh\u2019s hiring, the Wolverines had fallen behind their bitter rival, as the Buckeyes won two national championships and played for two others. Michigan, on the other hand, had no championship appearances. And from 2001 to 2019, the Wolverines had only two wins in 19 tries against Ohio State.",
      "Harbaugh would eventually get Michigan over the hump, beating the Buckeyes in each of his last three tries before winning a national championship after the 2023 season.",
      "Less than three weeks after winning his final game with the Wolverines, Harbaugh accepted the head coaching job with the Los Angeles Chargers. And now, his task is eerily the same: Beat the Kansas City Chiefs and return the Chargers to national relevance.",
      "While Los Angeles versus Kansas City isn\u2019t quite Ohio State versus Michigan, the Chiefs are the team standing in everybody\u2019s way in the NFL, but particularly their divisional opponents.",
      "For a stretch in the aughts, the Chargers were the elite of the AFC West. From 2004-09, they won the division in five out of six seasons. In the next three, they finished no worse than third.",
      "Since 2016, however, Kansas City has won the division every season. In that time, the Chiefs are also 12-3 against the Chargers, including five straight wins. (And for good measure, they\u2019ve also won three Super Bowls in five years.)",
      "Harbaugh, known for turning teams around dating back to his time as head coach at Stanford to his first NFL stint with the San Francisco 49ers, can\u2019t be expected to knock off Kansas City overnight. The whole league, after all, is searching for answers against quarterback Patrick Mahomes. But Sunday will be an interesting test to see how close Los Angeles is to its current chief rival.",
      "The Chiefs enter Sunday 11-1 and in first place in the AFC. At the same time, there are reasons to believe they are more vulnerable than in previous years.",
      "Only two of Kansas City\u2019s 11 wins have been by double digits. The team\u2019s last five wins have come by an average of 4 points. Even though they are tied for the NFL lead in wins, the Chiefs are only 11th in point differential \u2014 behind multiple five-loss teams.",
      "Mahomes, meanwhile, is averaging only 7.0 yards per attempt (tied with last season for a career low) and is on pace to throw the most interceptions he\u2019s ever had in a single season. His passer rating of 92.2 is also a career worst.",
      "Nobody is foolish enough to suggest Kansas City isn\u2019t actually good. But there\u2019s an argument to be made the Chiefs are more beatable than they have been in the last two seasons, both of which resulted in championships.",
      "After the Chargers finished last year 5-12, Harbaugh has the team on an 11-win pace this season. He has put less on the plate of phenom quarterback Justin Herbert \u2014 whose passing yards per game are at a career low \u2014 and instead leaned more on a physical rushing attack.",
      "The formula has worked so far, as Los Angeles is 8-4. It still needs to be proven against the best opponents, though, because the Chargers have only one win against a team currently over .500. And in the teams\u2019 first matchup earlier this season, Kansas City beat Los Angeles 17-10.",
      "Harbaugh is no stranger to big moments. He knocked off No. 1 USC as a 41-point underdog when he was coaching Stanford, beat Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers in the playoffs with San Francisco, and then finally found his way around Ohio State.",
      "Though not as quite high stakes as some of his previous wins, Sunday\u2019s game is the reason why Harbaugh will be on the Chargers\u2019 sideline."

      "Svetlana Dali, 57, appeared Friday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Joseph A. Marutollo in Brooklyn federal court in New York, where he ruled that she must submit to GPS monitoring and a curfew and banned her from all airports pending trial.",
      "Marutollo ordered Dali to turn over travel documents and undergo a mental health evaluation and treatment. Dali, who is a U.S. permanent resident, is also restricted to the city of Philadelphia, where she will live with an acquaintance from church, and the Eastern District of New York, where she faces one count of being a stowaway on a vessel or aircraft without consent.",
      "If she is convicted, she could face up to five years in prison, a fine or both. She has yet to enter a plea.",
      "Marutollo said he was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about releasing Dali, citing her risk of flight, lack of connection to the community and inability to secure a third-party custodian who would be legally responsible for her compliance with the release conditions.",
      "Dali, who sat between her attorney and a Russian translator, appeared to scowl at Marutollo from time to time as he raised his concerns.",
      "Dali\u2019s attorney, Brooklyn federal defender Michael Schneider, told the court that her family and her fianc\u00e9 are in Europe and that she had no way of securing a third-party custodian.",
      "Schneider said Dali didn\u2019t have a criminal record and wasn\u2019t a danger to the community, adding that she wasn\u2019t a \u201cserious\u201d risk of flight and that her offense was similar to jumping a subway turnstile.",
      "Assistant U.S. Attorney Brooke Theodora echoed Marutollo\u2019s unease, saying the government believed Dali was a flight risk, pointing to several incidents in which Dali previously tried to sneak on flights at domestic and international airports.",
      "Theodora said Dali tried to travel for free as recently as February at Miami International Airport, where she tried to get through a secure area to reach departures.",
      "Dali\u2019s actions raised\u00a0\u201cvery significant national security concerns and very significant public security risks,\u201d said Theodora, who insisted the bail conditions needed to ensure that Dali would attend future court hearings.",
      "According to the FBI\u2019s criminal complaint, Dali boarded a Delta flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport to Charles de Gaulle Airport on Nov. 26. The complaint said agents were busy helping other passengers board and \u201cdid not stop her or ask her to present a boarding pass.\u201d",
      "Dali bypassed two security and ticketing checkpoints before she boarded the plane without a ticket, a spokesperson for the Transportation Security Administration said.",
      "French authorities detained Dali when she landed in Paris, the complaint said. Dali returned to the U.S. last week and was taken into custody in New York, a senior law enforcement source said.",
      "According to the FBI complaint, agents interviewed Dali at JFK, where she admitted that she took the flight without a boarding pass and that she knew her conduct was illegal."

      "Twelve of the 15 Salisbury University students accused of attacking and beating a man in Maryland because of his sexual orientation had their hate crime and first-degree assault charges dismissed, court records show.",
      "All 15 students were arrested last month for allegedly punching, kicking, spitting on and calling a man derogatory names after luring him into an off-campus apartment on Oct. 15 under false pretenses, according to Salisbury police.",
      "The students, ages 18 to 21,\u00a0originally faced several charges including first-degree assault, reckless endangerment, false imprisonment and associated hate crime charges, police said.",
      "As of Sunday, court records show that 12 of the accused students are only facing a charge of false imprisonment and had their felony first-degree assault charge downgraded to a misdemeanor second-degree assault.",
      "They are: Riley Brister, 20; Bennan Aird, 18; Ryder Baker, 20; Cruz Cespedes, 19; Dylan Earp, 20; Cameron Guy, 18; Jacob Howard, 19; Eric Sinclair, 21; Patrick Gutierrez, 19; Dylan Pietuszka, 20; Sean Antone, 19; and Benjamin Brandenburg, 18.",
      "The remaining charges accusing them of reckless endangerment and committing hate crimes were dropped following preliminary hearings last week.",
      "\u201cWe have charged as appropriate\u201d based on reviews of the evidence gathered so far during the course of the investigation, the Wicomico County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office in Maryland said in a statement Sunday. \u201cAs this is a pending criminal prosecution, we are unable to comment further at this time.\u201d",
      "Steve Rakow, an attorney for Brister, one of the students, said in an email, \u201cWhile still serious charges, this never was a hate crime and certainly was never a felony first-degree assault.\u201d",
      "Rakow continued: \u201cAs of now, my client maintains his innocence. Should the state make a plea offer in this case, we\u2019ll evaluate that and make a decision on whether to accept the plea or go to trial.\u201d",
      "A trial for Brister and nine of the other students was scheduled for Jan. 29 at the Wicomico County District Court. Trials for Antone and Pietuszka were set for Jan. 23 and 24, respectively, in the same court.",
      "Attorneys for Aird and Earp declined to comment. NBC News has called and emailed the attorneys of the remaining nine students whose hate crime and felony assault charges were dismissed but did not receive immediate responses.",
      "Two other students had their cases moved to the Wicomico County Circuit Court. These are Zachary Leinemann, 18, and Elijah Johnson, 19. While both of them had their reckless endangerment charges dropped and their assault charge downgraded, they continue to face false imprisonment and hate crime charges, court records show.",
      "Both Leinemann and Johnson have their initial court appearances scheduled for Jan. 3.",
      "Logan Clark, 19, is still facing two counts of first-degree assault and another count of second-degree assault, as well as charges of reckless endangerment, false imprisonment and hate crime, according to court records. His preliminary hearing is scheduled for Thursday.",
      "Court records did not list attorneys for Leinemann, Johnson and Clark.",
      "\u201cAt this time, the students facing charges in the alleged incident remain on interim suspension,\u201d a spokesperson for Salisbury University said in a statement Sunday.",
      "\u201cSalisbury University continues to monitor these cases as the due process of the law takes its course,\u201d the statement continues. \u201cWe remain committed to maintaining safe and welcoming spaces for our students, our employees and the greater community.\u201d",
      "Salisbury police said last month they were contacted by the university\u2019s campus police on Oct. 31 about an alleged assault at an off-campus apartment complex for college-age students.",
      "Detectives who met with witnesses saw cellphone footage that allegedly showed \u201can adult male victim being assaulted by several college-aged men,\u201d police said in a Nov. 7\u00a0news release.",
      "Detectives also met with the victim and learned that on Oct. 15 a group of men used a social media account to invite the victim to a residence \u201cunder false pretenses,\u201d the release stated. When the victim showed up, \u201cnumerous college-aged men surrounded the victim and forced him to sit in a chair isolated in the middle of the living room,\u201d according to police.",
      "The victim was \u201cforcefully seated,\u201d he was allegedly \u201ckicked, punched and spit on while the men called the victim derogatory names,\u201d police said. The victim told detectives that he tried to leave multiple times but the group threw him to the floor.",
      "Police said the assault lasted for several minutes before he was allowed to leave. The victim said he sought medical attention and had bruises as well as a broken rib.",
      "Investigators have said they believe the man was targeted over his sexual orientation."

      "According to Talbert\u2019s office, Pree was convicted on federal wire fraud and aggravated identity theft charges in 2012. He was sentenced to a year and five months.",
      "Pree had been serving his sentence at U.S. Penitentiary Atwater until Jan. 29, 2017, when he was discovered missing from the facility.",

      "At the time of his arrest, authorities said Pree had several cellphones and identification cards, as well as debit and credit cards in different people\u2019s names. He also had multiple driver\u2019s licenses and a fake Harvard University student ID.",
      "Pree is back in federal custody to serve the remainder of his original sentence as he faces an additional charge for his alleged prison escape. The maximum statutory penalty for this crime is five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.",
      "But Pree\u2019s final sentence \u201cwill be determined at the discretion of the court after consideration of any applicable statutory factors and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which takes into account a number of variables,\u201d according to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office.",
      "Assistant U.S. Attorney Cody S. Chapple is expected to prosecute the case, which is the product of an investigation by the Department of State and the U.S. Marshals Service."

    "story": [
      "Rampant FBI misconduct, election fraud, the deep state. Such were the weekly topics on \u201cKash\u2019s Corner,\u201d the eponymous online show hosted by President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the FBI.",
      "From 2021 to 2023, Kash Patel made content for The Epoch Times, a news organization known for its far-right conspiracy theories, its association with a Chinese dissident religious group, and, since June, a sprawling multimillion-dollar money laundering scheme allegedly perpetrated by one of its top executives.",
      "NBC News reviewed 79 episodes totaling over 45 hours of content featuring Patel and his co-host, Epoch Times senior editor Jan Jekielek, neither of whom is accused in the federal case. Together, they spun detailed but unfounded claims of conspiracies involving government officials, law enforcement agencies, the media and tech companies, among others, all aiming to rig elections, silence conservative voices and undermine Trump\u2019s presidency and re-election.",
      "Billed as a show where the former deputy director of national intelligence would \u201cbreak down the biggest issues of our day, from the origins of Covid-19 to the politicization of the intelligence community,\u201d \u201cKash\u2019s Corner\u201d offered commentary on the news, often with a conspiratorial flourish.",
      "The show, available only to Epoch Times subscribers, could receive fresh scrutiny as Patel faces Senate confirmation hearings. His lack of experience, his promotion of politically motivated conspiracy theories in a book vilifying the FBI, and his public remarks promising to \u201ccome after\u201d judges, lawyers and the media involved in Trump\u2019s many legal investigations are also likely subjects.",
      "It wasn\u2019t just his namesake show. Patel was a constant contributor across Epoch Times properties, appearing on other shows, on the sister television network NTDTV, and in the outlet\u2019s Jan. 6 documentary. The last \u201cKash\u2019s Corner\u201d dropped in August 2023 with an announcement that Patel would be appearing on other shows and that the \u201cCorner\u201d would be back after the election.",
      "The details of Patel\u2019s contract with The Epoch Times aren\u2019t known. (Financial disclosure forms filed by talk radio and Epoch Times host Larry Elder during a failed presidential run showed the company paid between $1 million and $5 million for a similar show.) A representative for Patel declined to comment.",
      "Jekielek and The Epoch Times did not respond to requests for comment. In a June statement on the money laundering allegations, The Epoch Times said it \u201cintends to and will fully cooperate with any investigation dealing with the allegations,\u201d and noted that its chief financial officer, Bill Guan, had been suspended \u201cuntil this matter is resolved.\u201d",
      "Turning the 'Corner'",
      "\u201cKash\u2019s Corner\u201d debuted in the summer of 2021, when after years of increasingly powerful roles within Trump\u2019s national security agencies, the former federal prosecutor was out of a full-time job following his boss\u2019 election loss.",
      "That January, he began consulting for Trump\u2019s Save America PAC, which devoted most of its spending to the ex-president\u2019s legal bills. (Patel ultimately earned $325,000 for the job.) In April, he started \u201cfundraising consulting\u201d for the campaign committee Friends of Matt Gaetz, pulling in $145,000 that year, following news that the far-right congressman was the subject of an underage sex-trafficking investigation (Gaetz has denied the allegations and no charges were brought). Patel also set up a website, Fight for Kash, where he solicited donations for undefined legal efforts that promised to \u201cstrike a major blow to the far-Left media and Big Tech!\u201d",
      "It was a consequential moment for The Epoch Times, too. After years of struggling, the once-fringe newspaper powered by Falun Gong, a religious group persecuted in China, had finally found a foothold in conservative media. The company had spent a small fortune on pro-Trump ads in the run-up to 2020 and was amassing a windfall in the wake of Trump\u2019s loss, increasing revenue by a staggering 685% over two years, to $122 million in 2021 \u2014 revenue that would later come under federal scrutiny. Executives and editors credited its success to subscriptions driven by their editorial vision, which they said offered a counterbalance to mainstream media, with reports downplaying the Jan. 6 Capitol riots, denying climate change and fearmongering about vaccines.",
      "Patel, a major force behind an effort to undercut the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, made sense for The Epoch Times, an outlet that had grown its audience in part by exposing what it dubbed \u201cSpygate,\u201d a disproven conspiracy theory alleging President Barack Obama had spied on Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign as part of an intricate plot to meddle with the election and tar the incoming president with scandal. In one episode of \u201cKash\u2019s Corner,\u201d Patel called The Epoch Times\u2019 intricate chart laying out the conspiracy theory, including red strings, \u201cthe best one ever created in history.\u201d",
      "In March 2021, Jekielek first interviewed Patel for an \u201cInside Story of How Spygate Was Uncovered\u201d edition of his show, \u201cAmerican Thought Leaders.\u201d By April, Patel had a show of his own.",
      "A.J. Bauer, an assistant professor of journalism at the University of Alabama who studies conservative media, said Patel brought a shared worldview and White House credentials that lent an air of authority to claims that are usually only found on the fringes.",
      "\u201cI think it was circumstance and dovetailing ideology around conspiracism and the notion of a deep state out to get Trump\u201d that landed Patel at The Epoch Times, Bauer said. \u201cAnd I imagine that Kash \u2014 sorry for the bad pun \u2014 brought cache.\u201d",
      "Fraud allegations",
      "Patel joined The Epoch Times as it appeared to be among the most successful media upstarts in the U.S., surging at a time while many other outlets were struggling to build an audience or turn a profit.",
      "The company said it was making money through subscriptions and donations, claims that federal prosecutors now say were false.",
      "According to an indictment unsealed in June, Guan, The Epoch Times\u2019 chief financial officer, oversaw a group within the company\u2019s Vietnam office called the \u201cMake Money Online\u201d team. Allegedly, the team used cryptocurrency to buy stolen funds, including debit cards loaded with fraudulent unemployment benefits, at a discount, and then funneled the laundered money into Guan\u2019s and The Epoch Times\u2019 bank accounts. Guan has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial.",
      "Prosecutors claim the alleged money laundering scheme netted the group some $67 million.",
      "There\u2019s no reason to believe that Patel, Jekielek or anyone else in the newsroom was aware of any alleged fraud.",
      "It\u2019s unclear if or how the FBI was involved in the investigation, whether and how it would be in the future, and how having a former Epoch Times content creator as director of the agency might affect any investigation going forward.",
      "The initial press release noted the charges against Guan were the result of a joint investigation between the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Inspector General and the State Department\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service, along with \u201claw enforcement partners.\u201d The prosecution is part of an operation by the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces focused on \u201cdismantling high-level criminal organizations.\u201d The FBI is a member agency.",
      "A spokesperson for the FBI referred questions about the investigation to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York. Public affairs chief Nicholas Biase declined to comment.",
      "'Just the beginning'",
      "If Patel offered legitimacy to The Epoch Times\u2019 short-on-substance claims and connections to Trump that culminated in a 2022 Mar-a-Lago interview with the former president, he also brought a firebrand persona who was comfortable courting fringe audiences.",
      "Patel became a frequent guest on Steve Bannon\u2019s \u201cReal America\u2019s Voice\u201d show, where he promoted his books and Trump-themed merch, and made his most controversial statements, including an appearance last year where he imagined what he might do with federal power: \u201cWe\u2019re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,\u201d he said. He qualified those remarks last year, telling NBC News that he only intended to pursue those who had broken the law.",
      "Things were slower over at \u201cKash\u2019s Corner,\u201d less self-promotional and more cerebral, where he had more than half an hour to lay out his version of the world. Most shows ran between 30 and 40 minutes.",
      "On the FBI, Patel said it needed \u201ca huge overhaul,\u201d charged its leadership with \u201cgoing after political targets\u201d and putting \u201cthe law second,\u201d and praised three FBI agents who had been stripped of their security clearances and been put on leave for either being at the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6 or sharing conspiracy theories about the attack afterward. (Patel\u2019s foundation also provided \u201cgrants\u201d of unknown size to those ex-agents.)",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve proven the illegitimacy of the FBI and its actions,\u201d he said in December 2022, falsely citing \u201cRussiagate\u201d and Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop as evidence the FBI has been \u201ccompletely politicized.\u201d",
      "Later that month, he suggested the FBI was part of a Big Tech conspiracy to censor Americans and promoted a debunked theory that the FBI paid Twitter to censor conservatives as part of \u201cthe largest disinformation campaign to rig a presidential election.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is just the beginning, and if anyone thinks that it was a one-off, they are completely wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat, is the FBI going to come around and say, \u2018Now, oh, we were just spending government dollars to help safeguard a nation\u2019? I mean, that\u2019s going to be the epithet they come back with, but we now know the true nature of their corrupt ways.\u201d",
      "Patel often invoked what he labeled a \u201ctwo-tiered\u201d justice system. \u201cThe FBI and DOJ [are] politicizing targets and manufacturing crimes. They\u2019re basically saying, show me the man and I\u2019ll show you the crime,\u201d he said on a 2022 show.",
      "In another 2022 episode, Patel voiced his concerns about what he termed the FBI\u2019s \u201cconfidential human source corruption cover-up network.\u201d He claimed the agency used confidential sources during the Jan. 6 riots for political purposes, asking whether rioters had been goaded by agents to commit crimes and questioning the related convictions. Did \u201cthose confidential human sources engage people who are not going to conduct criminal activity and convince them to do so? That is the definition of entrapment, which is illegal, and you can\u2019t charge someone who\u2019s been entrapped.\u201d",
      "The belief that confidential FBI sources contributed to the violence on Jan. 6 or that the agency set up rioters is an unfounded, yet persistent one. \u201cAny suggestion that the violence at the U.S. Capitol on January 6 was orchestrated by the FBI is categorically false,\u201d the FBI said in a statement to Politifact this year.",
      "Patel suggested a specific solution: for Congress to use the power of subpoena to uncover crimes and conspiracies via \u201ca Church Commission,\u201d similar to the 1975 congressional investigation into federal intelligence agencies.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see how Americans can have any faith in this FBI anymore,\u201d he said in December 2022. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a major overhaul from these guys in Congress when the gavels flipped to conduct some rigorous oversight, but also to retool the FBI and DOJ, so it actually has credibility again. But that\u2019s going to be a multiyear lift.\u201d",
      "As for who should be investigated first, Patel suggested in January that it be Dr. Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a physician and immunologist who has become a major target of Covid-era conspiracy theories.",
      "\u201cFauci, I guess, is the one-word name that you can say is deserving of an entire investigation,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump\u2019s legal woes were a popular subject, too. In multiple episodes last year, Patel repeatedly framed multiple civil and criminal cases against Trump as politically motivated and without merit, including the Stormy Daniels hush money case (\u201cThat\u2019s not a crime\u201d), the classified documents case (\u201cWhen you\u2019re president and you leave, you can take whatever you want\u201d), the E. Jean Carroll case (\u201cBasically, a jury disregards the facts and the law and bases a decision on emotion alone.\u201d) and the federal indictment accusing Trump of conspiring to overturn the election (\u201cThe criminalization of thought and free speech.\u201d).",
      "Complicit in nearly every scheme, according to Patel, was the media.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot of people out there just thinking, \u2018What can I believe?\u2019\u201d Jekielek said in a 2022 show. \u201cIt\u2019s hard,\u201d Patel replied. \u201cWhat they should believe is Epoch Times, but I\u2019m biased.\u201d"

    "summary": "Trump has moved quickly to identify top officials for his next administration, but it hasn't all gone smoothly.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump is building his second administration at a breakneck speed, announcing his choices for nearly all of the roughly two dozen top-tier nominations, including Cabinet posts, earlier than he did when starting his first term. It\u2019s a sign not only that Trump\u2019s team has more experience than it did in 2016, but also that it has a much more defined sense of what it wants: loyalty.",
      "The expedited pace, however, has not come without setbacks and intrigue. Trump has long skipped the careful vetting of the backgrounds and financial records of potential picks that most incoming administrations undertake. This approach has led to surprise controversies and unexpected bumps for some of his more contentious choices.",
      "Trump has \u201cbotched up the nomination process pretty bad,\u201d a Republican senator said, adding, \u201cThey clearly aren\u2019t vetting these people.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s also extensive jockeying between influential voices like Trump\u2019s sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, and other transition staffers, including chief of staff Susie Wiles.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 over there. I think Don Jr. has been trying to do things at times. It\u2019s like Susie will have a meeting and then Don Jr. will say something else,\" a transition source said, who said they were not implying there's any tension between the two, just that there are big personalities on the team. \"Some of it has been kind of weird.\u201d",
      "Trump Jr.\u2019s most overt influence to date was felt in his negative feedback of former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for another administration role. Pompeo is now disliked by much of the MAGA base and faced direct pushback from Trump\u2019s eldest child.",
      "This account of the Trump transition effort is based on interviews with a dozen people familiar with or involved in the process. Many were granted anonymity to speak candidly or because they were not authorized to speak on the record.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump was re-elected by a resounding mandate from the American people to change the status quo in Washington. That\u2019s why he has chosen brilliant and highly-respected outsiders to serve in his Administration, and he will continue to stand behind them as they fight against all those who seek to derail the MAGA Agenda,\u201d Trump transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \u201cAlongside his highly-qualified nominees, President Trump will shatter the Deep State and restore government that is controlled by the people.\u201d",
      "Though many of Trump\u2019s nominees appear poised for relatively easy confirmation, some of his highest-profile picks have become bogged down in controversy; two have already withdrawn their names from consideration, and others \u2014 most notably Pete Hegseth, Trump\u2019s pick for defense secretary \u2014 may not have the votes to be confirmed. Trump also changed his mind and announced a new pick for White House counsel.",
      "For his first administration, Trump lost just one nominee. And even those who are moving forward this time have been the subject of, at times, internal fights among longtime Trump loyalists, family members and the newest \u2014 perhaps biggest \u2014 influence: tech billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "\u201cI think he is around Musk more than anyone else,\u201d a Trump ally familiar with the transition said. \u201cThere are several of the traditional sort of transition tensions and fighting over picks, but Musk casts a huge shadow.\u201d",
      "Musk, who poured more than $250 million into helping Trump get elected, is not only co-chairing the new Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE \u2014 a nongovernmental entity that has promised to make $2 trillion in cuts to the federal budget \u2014 but he has also been a prominent voice on key picks, most notably Kash Patel, Trump\u2019s pick to be FBI director. Patel is a vocal backer who has spread baseless \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy theories, calling for the purge of perceived Trump enemies from within the FBI and to \u201cshut down\u201d the bureau\u2019s Washington headquarters on his first day in office.",
      "\u201cElon was the principal guy behind Patel,\u201d the Trump ally said. \u201cHe is a big reason he ultimately got picked.\u201d",
      "During Trump\u2019s first transition process, there was a tug of war between his MAGA movement and those seen as more traditional Republicans. This time, that\u2019s less the case. Not only are the voices in the president-elect\u2019s ear all generally philosophically aligned, but also Trump himself is taking a much more hands-on approach.",
      "\u201cNow he is coming in with a much clearer vision,\u201d the Trump ally said. \u201cHe has been in the job, so he knows exactly what the job is. And you know the No. 1 thing he wants is loyalty and competence.\u201d",
      "Another Trump ally, who notoriously views fighting among staff and decision-makers as a positive rather than a negative, said the president-elect is getting involved in more than just top-tier appointments.",

      "Pete Hegseth's drinking worried colleagues at Fox News, sources tell NBC News",
      "Part of the strategy has been to avoid \u201cunforced errors or distractions\u201d by keeping potential nominees largely offline and away from television interviews.",
      "\u201cI think you\u2019re seeing the campaign discipline translate to the transition,\u201d a transition source said.",
      "Among the most heated Cabinet fights is the one over Hegseth. The former Fox News host and Army National Guard veteran has been meeting with Republican senators over the past week in an attempt to alleviate concerns over allegations of drinking and his treatment of women.",
      "For many Trump supporters, the Hegseth nomination has become a litmus test for how loyal Republicans, specifically those in the Senate who would have to vote to confirm him, are to the president-elect\u2019s pledge to install people who will fundamentally remake key swaths of the federal government.",
      "Trump and his allies have already promised primary challengers for senators who do not vote to confirm Hegseth, including skeptics like Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who is a member of the Armed Services Committee and a veteran. MAGA adherents have turned their wrath on Ernst, believing that she wants the job for herself \u2014 even though she has not indicated so publicly.",
      "\u201cPeople in Iowa have a well-funded primary challenger ready against her,\u201d Charlie Kirk, founder of the influential conservative group Turning Point USA, wrote on social media. \u201cHer political career is in serious jeopardy.\u201d",
      "Hegseth has been defiant and pledged to keep fighting, and Trump has continued to back him, posting as recently as Friday morning that he \u201cis doing very well.\u201d",
      "But the Hegseth drama has spun off its own political intrigue, as a shortlist of potential replacements has been publicly discussed, including Ernst, Tennessee Sen. Bill Hagerty, former Trump administration Pentagon official Elbridge Colby, Texas Rep. Wesley Hunt and most surprisingly, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
      "The DeSantis chatter has caught particular attention because he had an intense political rivalry with Trump during the 2024 Republican presidential primary and has a history of bad blood with several Trump staffers, including Wiles, who ran his 2018 gubernatorial campaign before the two had a falling out.",
      "\u201cWe have all advised him on the pros and cons here, and I think given him good advice,\u201d a Trump official said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, if he can get over it, why can\u2019t we.\u201d",
      "The emergence of DeSantis\u2019 name has also stirred up potential considerations for the 2028 presidential race. DeSantis is likely to once again consider a run for the White House, which many anticipate would put him on a collision course with Vice President-elect JD Vance, who is also expected to consider a run and would likely try to tap into the same pool of Trump voters DeSantis would need.",
      "Trump\u2019s transition team brushed off any concerns that potentially nominating DeSantis as defense secretary could elevate his presidential prospects.",
      "\u201cRon is not a full [Trump] convert, but he has a little star power, and that\u2019s something the president likes. There is media value there,\u201d a person involved in the transition said. \u201cAnd if we pull him in and hug him tight, he\u2019s part of our administration. He could not run against our administration.\u201d",
      "\u201cThen it becomes a personality test,\u201d the person added. \u201cJD wins that 100% of the time.\u201d",
      "The highest-profile defeat to date for Trump was around former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to be attorney general. Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration after it became clear an investigation into allegations of sex trafficking and sex with a minor would prevent him from getting enough votes to be confirmed. Gaetz was never charged and has denied the allegations.",
      "Six hours after Gaetz withdrew late last month, Trump nominated former two-term Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a longtime ally, as his replacement. Bondi\u2019s pick prompted some pushback over her past comments about prosecuting prosecutors who came after Trump, but she is widely considered to be a pick who will be able to secure Senate confirmation.",
      "Bondi did play an influential role in suggesting the other Trump pick who has withdrawn his name \u2014 Tampa-area Sheriff Chad Chronister, who was the president-elect\u2019s choice to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration, according to two sources familiar with the decision.",
      "Last week, Chronister posted on social media that he was pulling his name \u201cas the gravity of this very important responsibility set in,\u201d a claim quickly undercut by Trump himself. In his own post, Trump pointed to how Chronister handled the coronavirus pandemic, including a 2020 decision to arrest a Tampa-area pastor who flouted pandemic-era lockdown orders.",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t pull out,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI pulled him out, because I did not like what he said to my pastors and other supporters.\u201d",
      "Even some nominations that have received relatively little attention have been the subject of internal jockeying.",
      "Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is not expected to have a formal role in a\u00a0second administration, advocated for private equity executive Marc Rowan to be nominated for treasury secretary, four sources told NBC News, but Trump instead chose hedge fund executive Scott Bessent.",
      "But the speed at which things are moving and, at times, complicating some of Trump\u2019s nominations is part of an aggressive strategy that is by design.",
      "\u201cTrump is in a pretty aggressive mode of trying to shove the system as hard and as fast as he can,\u201d said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a staunch ally. \u201cIf 5% do not make it, he would regard that as a reasonable price for being as daring as he is and he will get 95%.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe is being Trump!\u201d Gingrich continued. \u201cThat is the guy that got to be president despite everything.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "For the past four years, Texas has made itself an adversary of the White House on immigration.",
      "Under Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, the state has flexed its law enforcement power at the U.S.-Mexico border, added miles of razor wire barriers to deter crossings and bused more than 100,000 migrants to sanctuary cities in Democratic states, all in defiance of the Biden administration.",
      "But as President-elect Donald Trump heads back to the White House next month, touting a plan to carry out the largest deportation of immigrants in U.S. history, Texas is preparing to take on a new role in Washington: ally.",
      "Already the state has offered up a 1,402-acre ranch on the Rio Grande as a potential site for detention facilities, and it is ready to share its playbook for muscling through immigration policy changes, such as its executive order requiring hospitals to ask about a patient\u2019s immigration status and a measure that would allow police officers to arrest migrants and empower state judges to order deportations.",
      "Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham last week announced an initiative to identify land within the 13 million acres owned by the agency that the Trump administration could use for deportation operations, including the recently acquired ranch along the Rio Grande.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re actively looking at the properties we have around the state and seeing if it works for the Trump administration,\u201d Buckingham told NBC News. \u201cWe\u2019ve identified several properties in the El Paso area that we think are also a good, natural fit,\u201d as well as in some urban areas.",
      "Buckingham also said that Texas would look to help guide the incoming administration\u2019s policies on border security.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve come up with a lot of ingenious ways to take these criminals to task, and we are happy to help anybody who is looking for advice or policies that seem to be helpful,\u201d she said.",
      "The Trump administration is listening.",
      "\u201cYou cannot have strong national security if you do not have border security,\u201d Tom Homan, Trump's former acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement director and incoming \"border czar,\" said at an event with Abbott last week. \u201cThere is unprecedented success in Texas. This is the model we can take across the country.\u201d",
      "Abbott, at the same event, said that his state was \u201cgoing to be doing more and faster than anything that\u2019s ever been done to, first of all, regain control of our border, restore order in our communities, and also identify, locate and deport criminals in the United States of America who have come across the border.\u201d",
      "Texas\u2019 rise as a prominent ally to the incoming Trump administration follows years of challenging and undermining President Joe Biden\u2019s efforts on immigration.",
      "\u201cTexas is a natural leader because of everything they\u2019ve accomplished in the last four years with little public or political pushback,\u201d said Andrea Flores, the vice president of immigration policy and campaigns at FWD.us, which describes itself as a bipartisan organization that advocates for immigration reform.",
      "One of the most visible forms of opposition was the busing of more than 100,000 migrants from the border to sanctuary cities like New York, Chicago and Denver \u2014 a move that overwhelmed those Democratic communities, strained their resources and led to growing anti-immigrant sentiment around the country that seeped into the presidential campaign.",
      "The strategy led to \u201ca governor sowing intentional chaos against other states with no one stepping in to try and stop it,\u201d said Flores, an immigration policy advisor to the Biden and Obama administrations, who criticized the lack of federal intervention. \u201cThe cities\u2019 crisis eclipsed the border crisis, and it led to tremendous backlash.\u201d",
      "Other Texas efforts under Biden could serve as a model for what\u2019s to come under Trump, some experts said.",
      "\u201cTo the extent that there\u2019s coordination, or even cooperation, between the federal government and a state like Texas, it\u2019s possible that the sky\u2019s the limit,\u201d said Rick Su, a law professor at the\u00a0 University of North Carolina. \u201cThis may be the missing piece in what I think, at least for the Trump administration, what they intend to do.\u201d",
      "In 2021, Abbott declared a disaster at the border, opening the door to launch his Operation Lone Star to pay for the busing and provide $11 billion to deploy thousands of members in the Texas National Guard and Texas Department of Public Safety to the southern border and create new barriers, including 100 miles of razor wire and buoys in the Rio Grande.",
      "Earlier this year, Abbott signed an executive order requiring hospitals to ask about a patient\u2019s immigration status and track the amount of costs from treating undocumented immigrants.",
      "\u201cIt has been four years of advancing an agenda that we are very likely to see multiple states do the same under the Trump administration,\u201d Flores said. \u201cTexas has given us a preview of what was to come.\u201d",
      "The state also passed a law that challenged federal immigration authority and is \u201carguably one of the most unprecedented sort of modern laws with regard to immigration,\u201d Su said. The law, known as S.B. 4, would allow police officers to arrest migrants and impose criminal penalties. It would also empower state judges to order the deportation of people to Mexico. The measure\u2019s implementation has been on hold while it is challenged in court.",
      "But legal experts, including Su, are watching to see if Trump\u2019s Department of Justice backs off from that and other legal challenges on Texas\u2019 immigration policies that were undertaken by the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cIn some ways, that is just the beginning,\u201d Su said."

      "Jay-Z, the star rapper and entrepreneur whose real name is Shawn Carter, was accused in a lawsuit Sunday of raping a 13-year-old girl in 2000 allegedly along with Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs.",
      "The anonymous accuser, identified only as \u201cJane Doe,\u201d said the assault happened after she was driven to an MTV Video Music Awards after-party.",
      "The federal lawsuit was originally filed in October in the Southern District of New York, listing Combs as a defendant. It was refiled Sunday to include Carter.",
      "Texas-based attorney Tony Buzbee, who filed the suit, did not comment.",
      "\"These allegations are so heinous in nature that I implore you to file a criminal complaint, not a civil one!!\u00a0Whomever would commit such a crime against a minor should be locked away, would you not agree?\" Carter said in a statement to NBC News.",
      "\"These alleged victims would deserve real justice if that were the case.\"",
      "Buzbee has filed several lawsuits in recent months \u2014 all have withheld their complainants\u2019 names \u2014 accusing Combs of assault and rape. This is the first suit in which he has named another high-profile defendant.",
      "Combs\u2019 representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Combs has repeatedly denied all the accusations against him. Federal prosecutors in New York criminally charged him in September with racketeering, sex trafficking and other offenses, and he is behind bars at Brooklyn\u2019s Metropolitan Detention Center after he was denied bail for a third time last month. His trial scheduled for May 5.",
      "Prosecutors said in a court hearing last month that they are in the process of potentially bringing more charges against Combs in a superseding indictment.",
      "Before Sunday's lawsuit was refiled, \"Carter received a letter from Plaintiff\u2019s counsel requesting a mediation to resolve this matter,\" Buzbee wrote in the suit. NBC News has seen that letter.\u00a0In response to the letter, Buzbee wrote in the suit, Carter filed his own lawsuit against the accuser's attorneys.",
      "Carter addressed that letter in his statement.",
      "\"My lawyer received a blackmail attempt, called a demand letter, from a \u201clawyer\u201d named Tony Buzbee. What he had calculated was the nature of these allegations and the public scrutiny would make me want to settle.",
      "\"No sir, it had the opposite effect! It made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion. So no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!!\" the statement read.",
      "The lawsuit claims that in 2000, when Doe was 13, Combs and Carter raped her at a house party after the MTV Video Music Awards in New York.",
      "The lawsuit says a friend dropped her off at the VMAs at Radio City Music Hall. She did not have a ticket, and she approached various limousine drivers to try to gain access to the show or an after-party.",
      "One driver, the lawsuit says, told her that he worked for Combs and that she \u201cfit what Diddy was looking for.\u201d He invited her to a party after the show and told her to return to his car later in the evening after he transported Carter and Combs, the suit says.",
      "Later, the driver picked her up, the suit says, and after 20 minutes they arrived at a white house with a U-shaped driveway, the suit says. She had to sign a document she believed was a nondisclosure agreement on arrival \u2014 and did not receive a copy \u2014 to enter the party, which the suit says was filled with celebrities and people doing marijuana and cocaine.",
      "She was offered a drink that made her feel \u201cwoozy, lightheaded and felt [like] she needed to lie down,\u201d the suit says, and she went into a room to rest.",
      "Shortly afterward, the suit says, Combs and Carter entered the room with Combs saying, \u201cYou are ready to party!\u201d",
      "That\u2019s when, she alleges, Carter removed her clothes, held her down and raped her while Combs and an unnamed female celebrity watched. She says Combs also raped her as Carter and the woman looked on.",
      "The suit says that she was able to resist being forced to perform oral sex on Combs by hitting him in the neck and that he \u201cstopped.\u201d",
      "After the alleged assault, the suit says, she \u201cgrabbed her clothes\u201d and left. She made her way to a gas station, where she called her father.",
      "The accuser is seeking unspecified damages. The lawsuit is filed under New York\u2019s Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection Act.",
      "\"My only heartbreak is for my family,\" Carter said in the statement. \"My wife and I will have to sit our children down, one of whom is at the age where her friends will surely see the press and ask questions about the nature of these claims, and explain the cruelty and greed of people. I mourn yet another loss of innocence.\""

      "For her loyal fans, there have been many of those moments since the Eras Tour kicked off in March 2023.",
      "Sunday night\u2019s show will be the last of that marathon tour, which has spanned nearly two years, five continents, 50 cities and a remarkable 149 shows \u2014 each of which has featured Swift singing, dancing and glittering for more than three hours.",
      "Swift said in June that the tour, which at the time seemed to be everlasting, would conclude in Vancouver in December.",
      "The tour, which featured songs from Swift\u2019s 11 albums, or \u201ceras,\u201d was marked by\u00a0friendship bracelets, a\u00a0revolt against Ticketmaster, a\u00a0record-setting concert film\u00a0and\u00a0booming economies\u00a0in nearly every city she touched.",
      "It also featured a\u00a0blossoming romance\u00a0with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, who appeared onstage in London and was mentioned in Swift\u2019s \u201cKarma\u201d multiple times on the tour.",
      "Over the 20-plus months of shows, Swift somehow had time to offer her fans three new releases, including two \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d rerecordings to add to the collection and a fresh album this year.",
      "When the tour kicked off in Glendale, Arizona, on March 17, 2023, the show included nine of Swift\u2019s then 10 eras, opening with the \u201cLover\u201d album \u2014 which had not yet been toured, because of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2014\u00a0and closing out with \u201cMidnights,\u201d Swift\u2019s latest release before the tour began.",
      "Fans were sad to learn her debut album, \u201cTaylor Swift,\u201d would not be a mainstay in the setlist, but plenty of its songs were performed multiple times in the acoustic set of the show.",
      "In the first major surprise of the tour, Swift announced the release date for \u201cSpeak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d at a show in Nashville, Tennessee, in May 2023 on her first of two U.S. legs.",
      "She closed out that leg by announcing the release date for \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d at the final show, held in Inglewood, California \u2014 appropriately on Aug. 9, 2023 (or 8/9).",
      "Swift then turned the show on its head this May as she embarked on the European leg of the tour, dropping songs from certain eras to make room for a new one: \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d which she released in April.",
      "Those releases have prompted loyal fans to search high and low for Swift\u2019s famous \u201cEaster eggs,\u201d hoping they might hint at the release of one of her last two albums yet to be rerecorded: \u201cReputation (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d and \u201cTaylor Swift (Taylor\u2019s Version).\u201d",
      "So far, no luck for the Swifties on that front, but that did not deter them from showing up in droves to each show, often in sparkly handmade costumes that alluded to her eras and lyrics, and even some Swiftie inside jokes.",
      "One fan, Hope Pinc, dressed up as Swift\u2019s cat, Benjamin Button, for the final weekend of shows.",
      "Pinc and friends Melissa Peirce and Elizabeth Sanders traveled from San Diego to Vancouver, where they had tickets to all three final shows. Peirce referred to Swift as one of her \u201cgreat friends\u201d who \u201cjust doesn\u2019t know yet.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like going to one of her shows and the endorphins and the love,\u201d Pinc said.",
      "Sisters Amanda and Sarah Cowley, both University of Victoria students, described the show as \u201cunreal\u201d and \u201cincredible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s insane the amount of tourism this brings, \u2019cause this is our home city. ... I\u2019ve never seen anything like this in my life,\u201d Sarah Cowley said.",
      "Amanda Cowley said it\u2019s \u201ccrazy\u201d to be at the show as \u201cboth a fan and just to witness this.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be historic one day to say that I went to the Eras Tour,\u201d she said.",
      "Sean Stear, an Idaho fire captain and paramedic sporting a bejeweled \u201cTS\u201d and \u201c13\u201d on his bald head, said Swift\u2019s music has brought him closer to his 11-year-old daughter.",
      "He picked up overtime shifts to afford the $3,000 resale tickets for the Friday show, and when the first leg of their flight to Vancouver was canceled, the family drove to meet the second, he said.",
      "\u201cI just think she appreciates everything that she does. She found that connection,\u201d Stear said. \u201cAnd I kind of see it as like this is her Super Bowl-type thing. I\u2019m big into football. She\u2019s big into Taylor Swift, so we have that passion, so it\u2019s awesome.\u201d",
      "Holden Williams said the Eras Tour brought fans a \u201ccommunity,\u201d and she had a message for Swift.",
      "\u201cThank you so much for everything you\u2019ve done for me,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd thank you for creating all of this for the Eras Tour.\u201d",

      "Dali\u2019s attorney, Brooklyn federal defender Michael Schneider, told the court that her family and her fianc\u00e9 are in Europe and that she had no way of securing a third-party custodian.",
      "Schneider said Dali didn\u2019t have a criminal record and wasn\u2019t a danger to the community, adding that she wasn\u2019t a \u201cserious\u201d risk of flight and that her offense was similar to jumping a subway turnstile.",
      "Assistant U.S. Attorney Brooke Theodora echoed Marutollo\u2019s unease, saying the government believed Dali was a flight risk, pointing to several incidents in which Dali previously tried to sneak on flights at domestic and international airports.",
      "Theodora said Dali tried to travel for free as recently as February at Miami International Airport, where she tried to get through a secure area to reach departures.",
      "Dali\u2019s actions raised\u00a0\u201cvery significant national security concerns and very significant public security risks,\u201d said Theodora, who insisted the bail conditions needed to ensure that Dali would attend future court hearings.",
      "According to the FBI\u2019s criminal complaint, Dali boarded a Delta flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport to Charles de Gaulle Airport on Nov. 26. The complaint said agents were busy helping other passengers board and \u201cdid not stop her or ask her to present a boarding pass.\u201d",
      "Dali bypassed two security and ticketing checkpoints before she boarded the plane without a ticket, a spokesperson for the Transportation Security Administration said.",
      "French authorities detained Dali when she landed in Paris, the complaint said. Dali returned to the U.S. last week and was taken into custody in New York, a senior law enforcement source said.",
      "According to the FBI complaint, agents interviewed Dali at JFK, where she admitted that she took the flight without a boarding pass and that she knew her conduct was illegal."

That\u2019s up from a return rate of about 15% of total U.S. retail sales, or\u00a0$743 billion in returned goods, in 2023.",
      "Even though returns happen throughout the year, they are much more prevalent during the holiday season, the NRF also found. As shopping reaches\u00a0a peak\u00a0in the weeks ahead, retailers expect their return rate for the holidays to be 17% higher, on average, than the annual rate.",
      "\u201cIdeally, I hope there is a world in which you can reduce the percent of returns,\u201d said Amena Ali, CEO of returns solution company\u00a0Optoro, but \u201cthe problem is not going to abate any time soon.\u201d",
      "More from CNBC:",

      "The best ways to save money this holiday season",
      "Holiday shoppers plan to spend more",
      "Why returns are a big problem",
      "With the explosion of online shopping during and since the\u00a0pandemic, customers got increasingly comfortable with their buying and returning habits and more shoppers began ordering products they never intended to keep.",
      "Nearly\u00a0two-thirds of consumers\u00a0now buy multiple sizes or colors, some of which they then send back, a practice known as \u201cbracketing,\u201d according to Happy Returns.",
      "Even more \u2014 69% \u2014 of shoppers admit to \u201cwardrobing,\u201d or buying an item for a specific event and returning it afterward, a separate report by Optoro found. That\u2019s a 39% increase from 2023.",
      "Largely because of these types of behaviors, 46% of consumers said they are returning goods multiple times a month \u2014 a 29% jump from last year, according to Optoro.",
      "All of that back-and-forth comes at a hefty price.",
      "\u201cWith behaviors like bracketing and rising return rates putting strain on traditional systems, retailers need to rethink reverse logistics,\u201d David Sobie, Happy Returns\u2019 co-founder and CEO, said in a statement.",
      "What happens to your returns",
      "Processing a return costs retailers an average of 30% of an item\u2019s original price,\u00a0Optoro\u00a0found. But returns aren\u2019t just a problem for retailers\u2019 bottom line.",
      "Often returns do not end up back on the shelf, and that also causes issues for retailers struggling to\u00a0enhance sustainability, according to Spencer Kieboom, founder and CEO of\u00a0Pollen Returns, a return management company.",
      "Sending products\u00a0back\u00a0to be repackaged, restocked and resold \u2014 sometimes overseas \u2014 generates even more\u00a0carbon emissions, assuming they can be put back in circulation.",
      "In some cases, returned goods are sent straight to landfills, and only\u00a054% of all packaging was recycled\u00a0in 2018, the most recent data available, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "Returns in 2023 created\u00a08.4 billion pounds of landfill waste, according to\u00a0Optoro.",
      "That presents a major challenge for retailers, not only in terms of the lost revenue, but also in terms of the environmental impact of managing those returns, said Rachel\u00a0Delacour, co-founder and CEO of Sweep, a sustainability data management firm. \u201cAt the end of the day, being sustainable is a business strategy.\u201d",
      "To that end, companies are doing what they can to keep returns in check.",
      "In 2023,\u00a081% of U.S. retailers\u00a0rolled out stricter return policies, including shortening the return window and charging a return or restocking fee, according to another report from Happy Returns.",
      "While restocking fees and shipping charges may help curb the amount of inventory that is sent back, retailers also said that improving the returns experience was a key goal for 2025.",
      "Now\u00a033% of retailers, including\u00a0Amazon\u00a0and\u00a0Target, are allowing their customers to simply \u201ckeep it,\u201d offering a refund without taking the product back.",
      "Some are trying buyback programs to keep goods in circulation. In 2017,\u00a0Patagonia\u00a0launched its online Worn Wear resale program. Many have since followed that lead, including\u00a0J.Crew,\u00a0Neiman Marcus,\u00a0Coach\u00a0and\u00a0Levi Strauss & Co.",
      "Some Ikea locations even\u00a0buy back used Ikea furniture\u00a0for resale at Ikea stores.\u00a0There\u2019s also\u00a0Walmart Restored\u00a0and\u00a0Amazon Renewed.",
      "Other retailers\u00a0sell returns\u00a0to businesses such as\u00a0Once Upon a Child,\u00a0Plato\u2019s Closet\u00a0and\u00a0Play It Again Sports, where they are marked down and sold as secondhand.",
      "\u201cYou need an all-of-the-above solution,\u201d said Optoro\u2019s Ali.",
      "How return policies shape shopping habits",
      "Increasingly, return policies and expectations are an important predictor of consumer behavior, according to Happy Returns\u2019 Sobie, particularly for Generation Z and\u00a0millennials.",
      "\u201cReturn policies are no longer just a post-purchase consideration\u00a0\u2014 they\u2019re shaping how younger generations shop from the start,\u201d Sobie said.",
      "Three-quarters, or 76%, of shoppers consider free returns a key factor in deciding where to spend their money, and 67% say a negative return experience would discourage them from shopping with a retailer again, the NRF found.",
      "A survey of 1,500 adults by\u00a0GoDaddy\u00a0found that\u00a077% of shoppers check the return policy before making a purchase."

      "College enrollment falls 5% for 18-year-old freshmen",
      "While it can be difficult to exactly pinpoint how the housing market is going to play out in 2025, several economists lay out predictions of what\u2019s likely to happen next year in a\u00a0new\u00a0report by Redfin, an online real estate brokerage firm.",
      "\u201cIf the housing market were going to crash, it would have already crashed by now,\u201d said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin. \u201cThe housing market has been so resilient to interest rates going up as high as they have.\u201d",
      "Here are five housing market predictions for 2025, according to Fairweather and other economists.",
      "Home price growth will return to pre-pandemic levels",
      "The median asking price for a home in the U.S. will likely rise 4% over the course\u00a0of 2025, a pace similar to that of the second half of this year, according to Redfin.",
      "The 4% annual pace is a \u201cnormalization\u201d compared to the accelerated growth last seen in 2020, said Fairweather.",
      "Earlier in 2024, the rate at which home prices grew slowed down to\u00a0pre-pandemic levels. In other words, while prices were still rising, the speed of price growth was not as fast as it was in previous years.",
      "Despite predictions of growth slowing, there may still be some volatility in prices.",
      "In fact, home price appreciation might stay flat, or less than 1%, going into the 2025 spring home buying season, said Selma Hepp, economist at CoreLogic.",
      "But the possibility of President-elect Donald Trump enacting some of his economic policies could\u00a0drive home prices much higher, said Jacob Channel, senior economist at LendingTree.",
      "\u201cWe kind of have some mixed signals right now in terms of what may or may not happen to home prices,\u201d he said.",
      "General tariffs\u00a0on foreign\u00a0goods and materials\u00a0as well as\u00a0mass deportations\u00a0could result in higher construction costs and slower home-building activity. If fewer homes are built in a supply-constrained market, prices might grow much higher, said Channel.",
      "Flattening rents, with more room to negotiate",
      "At a national level, the median asking rent price in the U.S. will likely stay flat over the course of a year in 2025, as\u00a0new rental inventory\u00a0becomes available, according to Redfin.",
      "\u201cIf rents are flat, and people\u2019s wages continue to grow, that means people have more money to spend,\u201d Redfin\u2019s Fairweather said, as well as\u00a0increase their savings.",
      "More than\u00a021 million renter households\u00a0are \u201ccost-burdened,\u201d meaning they spent more than 30% of their income on housing costs, according to 2023 U.S. Census data.",
      "A stable rental market will also give renters more strength to negotiate with landlords. In some areas, property managers are already offering concessions like one month rent free, a free parking space or waiving fees, experts say.",
      "However, \u201cit\u2019s December,\u201d Channel said. \u201cRent prices typically decline in the colder months of the year,\u201d as fewer people are apartment hunting in the late fall and winter seasons.",
      "If would-be buyers continue to be priced out of the for-sale market next year through high home prices and mortgage rates, competition in the rental market may ensue, he said.",
      "Also keep in mind that the typical rent price you see will depend on what\u2019s going on in your local market, Hepp explained.",
      "For instance: Austin, Texas was the \u201cepicenter of multi-family construction,\u201d she said, meaning a lot of new supply was added into the city\u2019s rental market, bringing rental costs down. The metro area\u2019s rent prices fell by 2.9% from a year ago, CoreLogic\u00a0found.",
      "In contrast, supply-constrained metropolitan areas like Seattle, Washington, D.C., and New York City, are experiencing high rent growth of 5% annually.",
      "A \u2018bumpy\u2019 and \u2018volatile\u2019 year for mortgage rates",
      "Redfin forecasts mortgage rates will average 6.8% in 2025, and hover around the low-6% range if the economy continues to slow.",
      "Yet experts expect 2025 will be a\u00a0\u201cbumpy\u201d and \u201cvolatile\u201d\u00a0year for mortgage rates.",
      "Borrowing costs for home loans could spike if policies like tax cuts and tariffs are enacted, putting upward pressure on inflation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sort of in uncharted territory. It\u2019s really tough to say exactly what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said LendingTree\u2019s Channel.",
      "Mortgage rates declined\u00a0this fall in anticipation of the\u00a0first interest rate\u00a0cut since March 2020. But then\u00a0borrowing costs jumped\u00a0again in November as the bond market\u00a0reacted\u00a0to Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0election win. Since then, mortgage rates have somewhat stabilized \u2014 for now.",
      "\u201cOur expectation is that rates are going to be in the 6% range as we move into 2025,\u201d Jessica Lautz, deputy chief economist and vice president of research at the National Association of Realtors,\u00a0recently\u00a0told CNBC.",
      "More home sales than in 2024",
      "Pent-up demand from buyers and sellers on the sidelines may drive home transactions next year.",
      "\u201cPeople have waited long enough,\u201d Fairweather said.",
      "About 4 million homes are expected to be sold by the end of 2025, an annual increase between 2% and 9% from 2024, according to Redfin.",
      "The market is piling on with \u201cpeople who need to move on with their lives,\u201d like buyers who are getting new jobs and need homes suitable for life changes, and sellers who have delayed moving plans, Fairweather said.",
      "While more buyers are expected to hit the market next year, the level of competition may not be as aggressive as in recent years, when\u00a0bidding wars\u00a0were the norm.",
      "Other affordability factors may come into play, like rising insurance costs and property taxes, in turn slowing down competition, said CoreLogic\u2019s Hepp.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll definitely see more buyers out there,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see the competition heating up to the levels that it has over the last few years.\u201d",
      "Climate risks will bake into homes prices",
      "The risk of extreme weather and natural disasters may anchor down home prices or slow down price growth in areas like coastal Florida, California and parts of Texas, which are at high risk of hurricanes, wildfires or other disasters, Redfin expects.",
      "If palatable price tags have you eyeing homes in a high-risk market, be aware of potential complications.",
      "For instance,\u00a0home insurance policies\u00a0in some of these markets are harder to come by, and tend to carry high price tags. The financial impact of natural disasters may also be felt in rising home maintenance and repair costs, said Redfin\u2019s Fairweather.",
      "What\u2019s more challenging, \u201cevery part of the country is vulnerable\u201d because the weather patterns are changing, she said. \u201cLately, there have been these atmospheric rivers in California that have caused days of heavy flooding, and those homes aren\u2019t built for that.\u201d",
      "While there\u2019s a lot of focus on Florida for hurricane risks, the state is more prepared for this natural disaster, unlike areas like Asheville, North Carolina, a mountainous city battered by the hurricane Milton earlier this year.",
      "\u201cWe will probably see insurance increase pretty broadly because that mismatch between what homes were built for and the climate that they are going to be facing in the coming years,\u201d she said."

Stay tuned \u2014 the best has yet to come!\u201d",

      "\u201cOne day, I met a guy who said, \u2018Anything you draw I can have made,\u2019 so we started making things from my ideas,\u201d she told the Urban Outfitters blog. \u201cI also represented other people and sold their artwork, and then we realized that I was the one with the commercial sense, because if I said \u2018Make a teddy bear or a unicorn,\u2019 that was what sold.\u201d",
      "One of her earliest businesses was a brand called Sticky Fingers, which Frank described as \u201cjewelry all made up of plastic that I glued together with glue gun.\u201d",
      "Eventually, she rebranded Sticky Fingers using her own name, and Lisa Frank, Inc. (LFI) was born. The company was established in 1979, according to public records.",
      "The company boomed, bringing in more than $1 billion in retail sales between 1990 and 2005, the\u00a0Tucson Citizen reported in 2005.",
      "In 1994, Frank married James Green, an in-house illustrator hired in 1982 who later became the company\u2019s president and CEO in 1992,\u00a0per court documents, and gifted him 49% of LFI\u2019s shares, according to the same\u00a0court documents.",
      "Green, in the documentary and on his social media pages, has taken credit for \u201cestablishing the look and feel\u201d of Lisa Frank\u2019s signature art, which persists to this day. \u201cI am not the head artist. I am\u00a0the\u00a0artist,\u201d he said in an Instagram video posted after the\u00a0documentary aired.",
      "TODAY.com\u00a0has reached out to Green for comment and has not heard back at the time of publication.",
      "Frank and Green have two sons, Hunter and Forrest. Their names were inspired by two characters from the Lisa Frank universe: Hunter the leopard and Forrest the tiger cub.",
      "\u201cWe had created both characters before the boys were born, and then when they were born, we thought, \u2018Oh my gosh, they really do fit their personalities!\u2019\u201d Frank told Urban Outfitters in 2012.",
      "Frank filed for divorce against Green in 2005, marking the beginning of a years-long legal saga involving the former couple and other Lisa Frank associates, including former executive vice president Rhonda Rowlette.",
      "Frank sued Green in 2005 to remove him as director, president and chief operating officer of LFI, and buy back his shares. The case went to trial in 2007 and ruled in favor of LFI, terminating\u00a0Green as director, per a 2009 appeal.",
      "\u201cI lost my titles, I lost my business, I lost my building, I lost everything else ... She owns everything. She owns my life\u2019s work,\u201d Green said in the documentary.",
      "Meanwhile, Frank fired Rowlette, who in turn sued her in 2006 for $2 million plus damages, saying that Frank had promised her that amount in the event that her job was terminated. LFI denied making any such promises and the claim was settled, per a\u00a0court filing.",
      "The docuseries also includes interviews with several former employees about their experiences at LFI. Many share anecdotes about times both Frank and Green allegedly treated them harshly.",
      "\u201cThey definitely felt like they were trying to break my spirit,\u201d Tony De Luz, an illustrator at LFI from 1996 to 2000, said in the documentary. \u201cI think that was the way they operated, was that they wanted people who took whatever s--- they piled on them.\u201d",

      "Why is Lisa Frank not in the \u2018Glitter & Greed\u2019 documentary?",
      "Frank is notoriously private. There are few photos available of her publicly, she seldom gives interviews and when she agreed to speak to Urban Outfitters on camera in 2012 in conjunction with LFI\u2019s former collaboration with the brand, she asked for her face to be obscured.",
      "She doesn\u2019t appear in \u201cGlitter and Greed: The Lisa Frank Story,\u201d which explores the inner workings of Lisa Frank, Inc and suggests that the behind-the-scenes reality of the company was anything but rainbows and unicorns.",
      "Director Arianna La Penne says they reached out to Frank multiple times, but she declined to be interviewed.",
      "\u201cI thought about Lisa Frank every day that I was making this ... I really wanted her to participate,\u201d La Penne says, but added she has \u201cno judgment\u201d about the media-shy Frank declining to take part.",
      "La Penne says if she did have a chance to speak to Frank, the first question she would ask her would be, \u201cWas it all worth it?\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the sense of, is she happy now with where she landed?\u201d La Penne says. \u201cBecause in this company\u2019s life, the personal and the professional were completely intertwined, so it\u2019s all connected and related. And I really would love to know what it\u2019s like in her head.\u201d",
      "Where is Lisa Frank now?",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re baaaack!\u201d reads the caption.",
      "\u201cWhen we casually make a major comeback,\u201d the brand captioned a similar TikTok post in April.",
      "One key figure in Lisa Frank\u2019s new chapter is her son, Forrest Green, who has served as Head of Brand and Chairman of LFI since 2018, according to his LinkedIn profile.",
      "Forrest Green has worked closely with his mother from a young age, according to a 2021 Bustle profile. Frank was not interviewed for the article, but Forrest Green, then 21, said on the record he was behind the brand's recently revitalized Instagram.",
      "Forrest Green said his mother used to pull him out of elementary school to sit in at meetings at LFI.",
      "\u201cOne time when I was probably 8 or 9, I closed the meeting like, \u2018All right, guys, this was awesome; what are the next steps?\u2019\u201d he told Bustle. \u201cThe licensing agent at the time looked at me and said, \u2018Well, I guess Forrest closed the meeting!\u2019\u201d",
      "In recent years, Forrest Green has worked to build the brand\u2019s social media following. He has said one of his goals is to tap into \u201890s nostalgia while redefining the Lisa Frank brand for the 21st century.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just so much possibility. More than just people saying, \u2018Make some folders again, make some stickers again,\u2019\u201d he told Bustle. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely part of the plan, but it\u2019s like people don\u2019t even know who we are at this point. Lisa Frank is a lifestyle and it needs to be treated as such.\u201d",
      "The story of Lisa Frank is no doubt complex but for Robertson, working on the documentary ultimately increased her appreciation for the brand.",
      "\"I love the Lisa Frank work now more than ever after having spent several years deep, deep, deep in the story, and after having become aware of a really complicated reality that existed behind the scenes at the company,\" she tells TODAY.com.",
      "After interviewing several former Lisa Frank employees, Robertson says when she thinks of Lisa Frank, she sees the \"passions of all these people who left a part of themselves in it. And they want us to love that work. They want it to endure through the ages.\"",
      "As for the brand's future, Robertson says she has witnessed first-hand the ability of Lisa Frank designs to captivate a new generation.",
      "\"I think they have timeless appeal,\" she says. \"I remember as a girl, the attachment and attraction that I felt towards these objects and designs. And now I have a 6-year-old daughter, and she goes absolutely nuts for them.\""

      "\u201cIt\u2019s blowing my mind,\u201d Christopher Scott, the film\u2019s choreographer, tells TODAY.com.",
      "Now, Scott is helping viewers with their dancing skills. He recently posted a tutorial on how to perform the breakdown from the song's outro, recognized by the repeated refrain of \"loathing.\"",
      "The musical sequence, and perhaps one of the most widely circulating clips online, sees Glinda (Ariana Grande) and Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) express the depths of their disdain for each other during their early days at Shiz University.",
      "In the dance flooding TikTok, Glinda \u2014\u00a0then known as Galinda \u2014 marches with her school pals flanked behind her.",
      "Scott says it was one of the first group scenes filmed, as the movie was primarily choreographed in sequential order. When he initially showed the moves to his team of dancers, they loved it. Grande gave her blessing, too, he says.",
      "\u201cShe was like, \u2018Oh, my God!\u2019 That was one of the first things she\u2019s seeing of the work \u2014 which was pressure on me, because I want her to feel taken care of in this film,\" he says. \"So if she thinks the choreography is not strong, and she\u2019s a part of it, it can mess with people. So it\u2019s important to deliver for them.\"",
      "The dance is meant to physically invoke feelings of frustration, he says. The 25 seconds of viral choreography comes at the very end of the song, as Glinda and Elphaba's \"loathing\" reaches a fever pitch.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re slapping on the books. The way that they twist their body, because they\u2019re irritated by this woman. The thought of Elphaba is making them cringe,\u201d Scott says of the sharp, staccato dance moves.",
      "\"Wicked\" is filled with memorable dance sequences, including the tear-jerking Ozdust Ballroom duet, in which Glinda and Elphaba finally move from enemies to friends.",
      "So why did this section go so viral?",
      "\u201cI think a big part of it is because it came from a place of being connected to the music,\u201d Scott says. \u201cI do think that tapping on the books gave a rhythm for people to become kind of musicians. And I think that level of fun is all part of it.",
      "\"When you're watching it, it\u2019s like, 'I want to play in that space. I want to be one of those people in Glinda\u2019s crew. And I want to become a part of the movie,'\" he adds.",
      "One of Scott\u2019s favorite interpretations that he\u2019s seen so far has fittingly been from the Broadway cast of \"Wicked.\" The stage musical that inspired the 2024 and 2025 films has been running at the Gershwin Theatre since 2003 and currently stars Mary Kate Morrissey as Elphaba and Alexandra Socha as Glinda.",
      "\u201cWatching them re-create the choreography from the film that was a re-creation of what they created made me feel like I\u2019m part of the family of \u2018Wicked\u2019 and not just the outsider that got to do the film,\u201d Scott says.",
      "Scott started working with \"Wicked\" director Jon M. Chu 15 years ago, including most recently on 2021's \"In the Heights,\" based on Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical of the same name.",
      "Scott choreographed the show-stopping number \u201c96,000,\u201d which featured dancers performing styles of dance inspired by Busby Berkeley, ballet, bone-breaking and more \u2014 all in a swimming pool.",
      "Scott recalls the memorable way Chu asked him to be a part of \"Wicked.\" In March 2022, Chu surprised Scott with a hat from the Broadway musical and said, \u201cYou ready to choreograph 'Wicked'?\u201d",
      "Then it was time to get to work on the monumental task at hand, Scott says.",
      "Here's how he pulled off some of the film's most memorable dance sequences.",
      "'Dancing Through Life'",
      "Scott says he leaned into each actors\u2019 strengths. For instance, once he learned Jonathan Bailey, who plays Fiyero, did gymnastics as a kid, Scott incorporated the actor's exceptional front walkover into the introduction of \u201cDancing Through Life.\u201d",
      "That number, set in a library at Shiz University, features a physical wheel, known as a tornado wheel, that the actors dance on, slide off, climb up and more throughout the song.",
      "\u201cThere was actually a question on whether or not they were going to let the actors in the space, because for insurance purposes,\" Scott says.",
      "For Ethan Slater\u2019s role as Boq, Scott used the actor's existing climbing skills from starring in Broadway's \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" in the \"Dancing Through Life\" choreography.",
      "\"If (Slater) auditioned as a performer going into the tornado wheel, he would have booked the job,\" he says. \"It\u2019s very rare you have an actor that can do all of that stuff, to music and the timing.\"",
      "Ozdust Ballroom duet",
      "\"Dancing Through Life\" smoothly transitions into a party scene set off-campus at the \"scandalocious\" Ozdust Ballroom. While Glinda and Fiyero dance the night away, Elphaba arrives wearing a pointy black hat that Glinda had encouraged her to wear, becoming the laughingstock of the party.",
      "Putting on a false confidence, Elphaba starts to dance alone in the middle of the room, before Glinda hesitantly joins her, learning the moves as they go. And with the popular girl's buy-in, the rest of the attendees start dancing, too.",
      "The secret sauce for the scene was to not teach the dancers the choreography that Elphaba and Glinda do in the center of the dance floor to make the moment feel organic.",
      "\u201cI want to make it believable. I hate when a movie in five seconds, someone does a move and everyone knows the move,\u201d he says.",
      "Erivo had been practicing the choreography for days. Grande, however, was introduced to it briefly.",
      "\u201cWe taught her a very little bit of the movement. Then we just follow along. And she just went with it,\u201d Scott says.",
      "'A Sentimental Man'",
      "For those wondering, yes, it is indeed Jeff Goldblum tap dancing before his song \u201cA Sentimental Man.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe knows how to tap. He\u2019s a jazz musician. He\u2019s a mover. That man is musically brilliant. I have video. It\u2019s one of my favorite things I own, and I am going to keep it in my little vault,\u201d Scott says.",
      "To first learn just how Goldblum could move, Scott put on a Frank Sinatra track and freestyled with Goldblum in the room.",

      "\"We got to set the record straight. And that\u2019s him behind the curtain,\u201d Scott adds. \u201cThat is 100% Mr. Goldblum, national treasure at its finest, dancing his face off.\u201d"

      "The couple, who have yet to show their daughter's face on social media, didn't include Aiunii in the music video \u2014 but they already have an idea of when they might.",

      "\u201cMy parents would always make us believe in El Ni\u00f1o Jes\u00fas and Santa, that they would come at 12 and deliver the gifts,\u201d Zambrano says. \u201cI always thought that was so much fun. When I found out that it wasn\u2019t real, I was really sad because I feel like I kind of lost a little bit of that magic of Christmas. But now I get to live it all over again with my baby, and have a couple of years of making magic for her every year.\u201d",

We are always adapting to every change that comes our way.\u201d",
      "Zambrano adds, \u201cWe are more of a team now that we have the baby, because we have to work together in order to get everything running. Right now, we\u2019re doing a bunch of things, but since we\u2019re doing it together, it\u2019s a bit easier. I feel like it has helped us grow as a couple, as a team, and I just think she makes us stronger.\u201d",
      "Fans can expect more music from the twosome, as they teased something in the works.",
      "\u201cWe love making music together,\u201d Zambrano says. \u201cWe have a couple of songs already recorded, but we have something else in the works for that, maybe another project later on. But for now, I hope everyone enjoys this one that we did with so much love.\u201d"

    "summary": "Ariana Grande spoke candidly about the body-shaming she has felt during her career.",
    "story": [
      "Ariana Grande has a message for anyone who will listen: Stop commenting on each other's bodies.",
      "During the London leg of the \"Wicked\" press tour, Grande reflected on the criticism surrounding her body over the course of her career. The conversation took place with French journalist Salima Jeanne Poumbga, known professionally as Sally, in an interview with Grande's co-star Cynthia Erivo.",
      "\"How do you cope with beauty standards to critics?\" Sally asked. \"Because this is something that is so overwhelming for women to always look perfect. How do you deal with that?\"",
      "The question visibly struck an emotional chord with Grande. \"My goodness,\" she replied before taking a pause to collect herself. \"I'm not gonna...\"",
      "The moment set the tone for an intimate discussion on the weight of societal beauty ideals as Grande reflected on her own life.",
      "\"I've been kind of doing this in front of the public and kind of been, you know, a specimen in a petri dish, really, since I was 16 or 17,\" Grande explained, adding that commentary about her appearance has been a constant presence in her life. \"I've heard every version of it, of what's wrong with me, and then you fix it, and then it's wrong for different reasons.\"",
      "This isn't the first time Grande has spoken on this topic. In April 2023, she addressed the mounting speculation she faced about her health and body with a post on TikTok.",
      "\u201cI just wanted to address your concerns about my body and talk a little bit about what it means to a person with a body and to be seen \u2026 to be paid this close attention to,\u201d she explained.\u00a0 \u201cI think we should be gentler and less comfortable commenting on people\u2019s bodies, no matter what.\u201d",
      "In her interview with Sally, Grande acknowledged that the experience of such criticism isn't isolated to just celebrities.",
      "\"Even just the simplest thing, your appearance, you know, you're young, and you're hearing all kinds of things, it's hard to protect yourself from that noise,\" she said. \"Even if you go to Thanksgiving dinner and someone's granny says, 'Oh, my God, you look skinnier, what happened?' or 'You look heavier, what happened?' It's like, that is something that is uncomfortable and horrible no matter where it's happening, no matter the scale it's happening on.\"",
      "The Grammy winner underlined the dangers of this tendency to take it upon ourselves to comment on others' appearances.",
      "\u201cIn today\u2019s society, there\u2019s a comfortability that we shouldn\u2019t have at all, commenting on others\u2019 looks, appearance, what they think is going on behind the scenes, or health, or how they present themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a comfortability that people have commenting on that that I think is really dangerous.\u201d",
      "She went on to\u00a0credit her personal support system for keeping her grounded and confident.",
      "\"I'm really lucky to have the support system that I have and to just know and trust that I'm beautiful,\" she said. \"I know what the pressure of that noise feels like. It's been a resident in my life since I was 17, and I just don't invite it in anymore. It's not welcome.\"",
      "The singer also took some credit for herself, noting that she's learned how to focus on what matters to her most when the pressure becomes too loud.",
      "\"I have work to do. I have a life to live. I have friends to love on. I have so much love, and it's not invited, so I don't leave space for it anymore,\"\u00a0she said before encouraging others to do the same for themselves. \"You keep yourself safe, because no one has the right to say shit.\""

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear an unusual case in which Congress intervened to help victims of terrorism sue Palestinian entities.",
      "At issue is whether the 2019 law, called the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act, unconstitutionally violates the due process rights of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Palestinian Authority (PA).",
      "Congress, which rarely gets involved in specific cases, stepped in twice after the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said U.S. courts did not have jurisdiction to hear the claims.",
      "The underlying lawsuits are brought under a law called the Anti-Terrorism Act by various victims, including the family of Ari Fuld, an American citizen who was killed by a Palestinian terrorist at a West Bank shopping mall in 2018. Other plaintiffs involved in the litigation had previously won a $655 million judgment that the lower court threw out.",
      "The legal question is a technical one on whether the defendants \"consented\" to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts. Congress forced their hand in the 2019 by saying it was assumed they had consented if two conditions were met.",
      "One condition is that the defendants paid a terrorist convicted of or killed while committing a terrorist attack. The other is that the organization in question conducted any activity within the U.S. within 15 days after the law was enacted.",
      "The PLO represents the Palestinian people internationally, while the PA exercises domestic government authority.",
      "At the heart of the PLO and PA arguments is that Congress inappropriately forced them to consent to be sued, thereby violating their due process rights, and that the law is therefore unconstitutional.",
      "The Biden administration asked the Supreme Court to hear the case, with Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar writing in court papers that the lower court rulings undermine Congress' conclusion that the 2019 law was \"an important measure to further U.S. interests and protect and compensate U.S. nationals.\" The victims of terrorist attacks filed a separate petition.",
      "Lawyers for the PLO and PA said in response that both defendants \"have consistently objected\" to being hauled before U.S. courts for more than a decade."

      "While Israel says it has achieved its military goals of weakening Hezbollah, the ceasefire that went into effect Nov. 27 did not resolve, from its perspective, a major systemic issue: how to make sure Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s most powerful proxy group, does not threaten Israel with an incursion like Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were kidnapped.",

      "For her loyal fans, there have been many of those moments since the Eras Tour kicked off in March 2023.",
      "Sunday night\u2019s show will be the last of that marathon tour, which has spanned nearly two years, five continents, 50 cities and a remarkable 149 shows \u2014 each of which has featured Swift singing, dancing and glittering for more than three hours.",
      "Swift said in June that the tour, which at the time seemed to be everlasting, would conclude in Vancouver in December.",
      "The tour, which featured songs from Swift\u2019s 11 albums, or \u201ceras,\u201d was marked by\u00a0friendship bracelets, a\u00a0revolt against Ticketmaster, a\u00a0record-setting concert film\u00a0and\u00a0booming economies\u00a0in nearly every city she touched.",
      "It also featured a\u00a0blossoming romance\u00a0with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, who appeared onstage in London and was mentioned in Swift\u2019s \u201cKarma\u201d multiple times on the tour.",
      "Over the 20-plus months of shows, Swift somehow had time to offer her fans three new releases, including two \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d rerecordings to add to the collection and a fresh album this year.",
      "When the tour kicked off in Glendale, Arizona, on March 17, 2023, the show included nine of Swift\u2019s then 10 eras, opening with the \u201cLover\u201d album \u2014 which had not yet been toured, because of the Covid-19 pandemic \u2014\u00a0and closing out with \u201cMidnights,\u201d Swift\u2019s latest release before the tour began.",
      "Fans were sad to learn her debut album, \u201cTaylor Swift,\u201d would not be a mainstay in the setlist, but plenty of its songs were performed multiple times in the acoustic set of the show.",
      "In the first major surprise of the tour, Swift announced the release date for \u201cSpeak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d at a show in Nashville, Tennessee, in May 2023 on her first of two U.S. legs.",
      "She closed out that leg by announcing the release date for \u201c1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d at the final show, held in Inglewood, California \u2014 appropriately on Aug. 9, 2023 (or 8/9).",
      "Swift then turned the show on its head this May as she embarked on the European leg of the tour, dropping songs from certain eras to make room for a new one: \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d which she released in April.",
      "Those releases have prompted loyal fans to search high and low for Swift\u2019s famous \u201cEaster eggs,\u201d hoping they might hint at the release of one of her last two albums yet to be rerecorded: \u201cReputation (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d and \u201cTaylor Swift (Taylor\u2019s Version).\u201d",
      "So far, no luck for the Swifties on that front, but that did not deter them from showing up in droves to each show, often in sparkly handmade costumes that alluded to her eras and lyrics, and even some Swiftie inside jokes.",
      "One fan, Hope Pinc, dressed up as Swift\u2019s cat, Benjamin Button, for the final weekend of shows.",
      "Pinc and friends Melissa Peirce and Elizabeth Sanders traveled from San Diego to Vancouver, where they had tickets to all three final shows. Peirce referred to Swift as one of her \u201cgreat friends\u201d who \u201cjust doesn\u2019t know yet.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like going to one of her shows and the endorphins and the love,\u201d Pinc said.",
      "Sisters Amanda and Sarah Cowley, both University of Victoria students, described the show as \u201cunreal\u201d and \u201cincredible.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s insane the amount of tourism this brings, \u2019cause this is our home city. ... I\u2019ve never seen anything like this in my life,\u201d Sarah Cowley said.",
      "Amanda Cowley said it\u2019s \u201ccrazy\u201d to be at the show as \u201cboth a fan and just to witness this.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be historic one day to say that I went to the Eras Tour,\u201d she said.",
      "Sean Stear, an Idaho fire captain and paramedic sporting a bejeweled \u201cTS\u201d and \u201c13\u201d on his bald head, said Swift\u2019s music has brought him closer to his 11-year-old daughter.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 A plan to impeach South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived declaration of martial law has failed after members of his governing party left parliament on Saturday ahead of the planned vote.",
      "Lawmakers from the People Power Party (PPP) were shouted and cursed at as they left en masse after voting on a separate motion, leaving the 192 opposition lawmakers eight votes short of the two-thirds majority needed for the impeachment motion to succeed.",
      "Opposition lawmakers had said that if the impeachment motion didn't pass they would come back to it on Wednesday, amid simmering public anger over Yoon\u2019s bewildering order, which plunged the East Asian democracy and key U.S. ally into chaos.",
      "Earlier Saturday, Yoon apologized for his actions in a brief nationally televised address, saying they \u201cstemmed from the urgency\u201d\u00a0he felt as president but \u201ccaused anxiety and inconvenience to the public.\u201d",
      "\u201cI deeply regret this and sincerely apologize to the citizens who were alarmed,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI will not evade the legal and political responsibility regarding this declaration of martial law,\u201d Yoon continued, speaking for a total of just over two minutes before deeply bowing his head before cameras.",
      "He said he would not declare martial law a second time, a concern that had been expressed by some opposition lawmakers, and that his party would decide how long he should stay in office and how state affairs would be managed.",
      "Han Dong-hoon, the leader of the PPP, urged Yoon to step down, telling reporters after the address that it had become \u201cimpossible\u201d for him to carry out his normal presidential duties.",

      "\u201cPresident Yoon\u2019s statement was completely out of touch with the public\u2019s expectations and further fueled a sense of betrayal,\u201d Lee said.",

      "Biden administration officials said they were not notified in advance that Yoon would declare martial law. But they have repeatedly reaffirmed the \u201cironclad\u201d nature of the U.S. alliance with South Korea, which it views as an important bulwark against North Korea, China and Russia, and which hosts almost 30,000 American troops.",
      "The U.S. relationship with South Korea \u201ctranscends any particular president or government on both sides of the Pacific Ocean,\u201d State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said Thursday.",
      "Before his address on Saturday, Yoon, 63, a former chief prosecutor who took office in 2022, had not made any public appearances since lifting the martial law order early Wednesday after lawmakers defied a security cordon to enter the National Assembly building and voted unanimously to reject it.",
      "Since then, he has accepted the resignation of his defense minister Kim Yong-hyun, who said he took full responsibility for what happened. Many other officials, including Yoon\u2019s chief of staff and all senior presidential secretaries, have also tendered their resignations.",
      "South Korean police and prosecutors are investigating claims of insurrection and treason against Yoon, Kim and Interior Minister Lee Sang-min. The Ministry of National Defense has also suspended three top commanders from duty and requested overseas travel bans for them, Kim and seven other active-duty military officers.",
      "Military officers and government officials described a chaotic six hours from the time Yoon declared martial law around 10:30 p.m. Tuesday to the time he lifted the order around 4:30 a.m. Wednesday. Many of them said they learned about the martial law order, South Korea\u2019s first since 1980, from Yoon\u2019s surprise TV address or from news reports.",
      "In his address, Yoon accused the opposition-controlled parliament of paralyzing the government by seeking the impeachment of multiple government officials and slashing critical funding from next year\u2019s national budget. He also accused his opponents of sympathizing with nuclear-armed North Korea, its reclusive communist neighbor that the South technically remains at war with.",
      "A martial law proclamation issued after Yoon\u2019s address banned all political activity, including demonstrations, and censored the news media. It also ordered\u00a0the country\u2019s striking doctors\u00a0to return to work within 48 hours.",
      "Officials said Friday that Yoon had ordered the arrest of prominent politicians including Lee, the leader of the Democratic Party, and Han, the leader of Yoon\u2019s own party, along with other opposition lawmakers, a journalist, a former Supreme Court justice and a former Supreme Court chief justice.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 When South Koreans came out to defend democracy this week in the face of a surprise martial law declaration by their president, history was weighing heavily on their minds.",
      "South Korea, a key U.S. ally, is the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy and a vibrant Asian democracy in a region where authoritarianism is on the rise. But the country of 50 million people spent decades under military-authoritarian rule, with martial law frequently declared and those who resisted it sometimes killed.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of people were concerned about what soldiers on duty who were being deployed to implement martial law were going to do,\u201d said Eun A Jo, a postdoctoral fellow at the\u00a0Dickey Center for International Understanding\u00a0at Dartmouth College. \u201cAnd thankfully, this time around, we didn\u2019t see any bloodshed.\u201d",
      "President Yoon Suk Yeol shocked the country Tuesday when he declared emergency martial law in a late-night television address. Lawmakers and members of the public rushed to the National Assembly in the center of the capital, Seoul, where troops were already massing.",
      "\u201cThe division that was deployed were the folks who are trained to basically implement some of the hardest tasks vis-a-vis North Korea,\u201d which South Korea technically remains at war with, Jo said. \u201cSo I think when they were deployed, they were under the impression that this had something to do with that. But then they ended up at the National Assembly.\u201d",
      "Their job was to prevent lawmakers from entering, since the legislature\u2019s operations had been banned under the martial law proclamation.",
      "\u201cI think many of them felt confused by the order,\u201d Jo said. \u201cSome said they were embarrassed.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers were able to make their way in and quickly voted unanimously to nullify Yoon\u2019s order, which he lifted early Wednesday.",
      "As the initial shock of the events has worn off, South Koreans have called for Yoon to resign or be impeached, with tens of thousands of people expected to rally in Seoul on Saturday. A vote to impeach him failed on Saturday after lawmakers from Yoon\u2019s governing People Power Party left parliament en masse.",
      "A long road to democracy",
      "South Korea, which was founded in 1948 after the division of the Korean Peninsula into the Soviet-occupied north and the U.S.-occupied south, experienced martial law multiple times under its first president, Syngman Rhee, who used it to suppress communists.",
      "Anti-corruption protests forced Rhee to step down in 1960. His successor, Yun Bo-seon, was ousted the following year by South Korean army officer Park Chung-hee, who was also fond of using martial law to crack down on dissent.",
      "Park was assassinated in 1979. His successor, Choi Kyu-hah, was ousted in a military coup by Chun Doo-hwan, who ruled for eight years.",
      "The last time martial law was declared in South Korea was by Chun in 1980. In response, a pro-democracy uprising led by students and civilians broke out in the southern city of Gwangju.",
      "Hundreds of people are estimated to have been killed in the military crackdown that followed.",
      "The uprising was a pivotal moment in South Korean history, Jo said, that marked the country\u2019s last attempt at democratization before it was achieved in 1987.",
      "\u201cThe history of Gwangju is something that we grow up with,\u201d she said.",
      "The difference between the soldiers who were deployed to enforce martial law in the 1960s, \u201970s and \u201980s and the ones deployed this week, Jo said, \u201cis that these soldiers are of a different generation, and they know the history of South Korean dictatorship far better.\u201d",
      "Yoon may have taken a different lesson from South Korean history, said Rob York, director for regional affairs at\u00a0Pacific Forum, a foreign policy research institute in Honolulu.",
      "During South Korea\u2019s period of military dictatorship, \u201cthere were a couple of coups that took place that were designed to break gridlock, I guess you could say, and take decisive action to shore up the country\u2019s future,\u201d York said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what Yoon was trying to replicate.\u201d",
      "But unlike the architects of past coups, Yoon \u201cdid not really understand that he didn\u2019t have the kind of hold on the military,\u201d York said, \u201cand didn\u2019t even have a hold on his own party in that regard.\u201d",
      "Yoon, who accused opposition lawmakers of obstructing the government and sympathizing with North Korea, appeared to expect that the South Korean military and the country\u2019s anti-communist elements \u201cwould coalesce around him the way that they did for Chun Doo-hwan and Park Chung-hee before him,\u201d York said.",
      "Instead, protesters rushed to the National Assembly, with viral videos showing people confronting soldiers over their actions.",
      "\u201cI think it came as a surprise to Yoon and his supporters how quickly the Korean public turned against their decision and fought back,\u201d York said. \u201cThat, I would say, demonstrates the determination of the Korean public not to go back to that period in history.\u201d",
      "The U.S. role in military rule",
      "Among those caught off guard this week was the Biden administration, which said it was not notified about Yoon\u2019s plans in advance.",
      "Throughout the week, U.S. officials have repeatedly reaffirmed the \u201cironclad\u201d nature of the U.S. alliance with South Korea, which it views as an important bulwark against North Korea, China and Russia, and which hosts almost 30,000 American troops.",
      "The U.S. military has had an almost continuous presence in South Korea since the end of World War II, even ruling the country from 1945 to 1948. The American troops there today serve as a deterrent against aggression from nuclear-armed North Korea.",
