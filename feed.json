      "Five bodies that appeared to be members of a Mexican regional music group who had gone missing have been found in the northern city of Reynosa along the Texas border",
      "CIUDAD VICTORIA, Mexico -- Five bodies that appeared to be members of a Mexican regional music group who had gone missing were found in the northern city of Reynosa, along the Texas border, authorities said on Thursday.",
      "The musicians from the band Grupo Fugitivo, which played at parties and local dances in the region, had been reported missing since Sunday.",
      "The genre they played \u2013 Mexican regional music, which encapsulates a wide range of styles including corridos and cumbia \u2013 has in recent years gained a spotlight as it's entered a sort of international musical renaissance. Young artists have mixed the classic genre with trap and sometimes pay homage to leaders of drug cartels, often portrayed as Robin Hood-type figures.",
      "While it was not immediately clear if the group played such songs, other artists have faced death threats by cartels, while others have had their visas stripped by the United States under accusations by the Trump administration that they were glorifying criminal violence.",
      "Few details were released about where the bodies were found and in what conditions, but Tamaulipas state prosecutors had been investigating the case, according to a statement by state security officials. The last time they had communicated with their families was Sunday night, when they said they were going to a venue where they were hired to play.",
      "After that, nothing else was heard of them. Officials said the bodies shared characteristics of artists, though did not provide further detail.",
      "Their disappearance caused an uproar in Tamaulipas, a state long eclipsed by cartel warfare. Their families reported the disappearances, called on the public for support and people took to the streets in protest.",
      "On Wednesday, protesters blocked the international bridge connecting Reynosa and Pharr, Texas, later going to a local cathedral to pray and make offerings to the disappeared.",
      "As of midday Thursday, the state prosecutor\u2019s office had not released further details on the case.",
      "Reynosa is a Mexican border city adjacent to the United States and has been plagued by escalating violence since 2017 due to internal disputes among groups vying for control of drug trafficking, human smuggling and fuel theft.",
      "This case follows another that occurred in 2018, when armed men kidnapped two members of the musical group \u201cLos Norte\u00f1os de R\u00edo Bravo,\u201d whose bodies were later found on the federal highway connecting Reynosa to R\u00edo Bravo, Tamaulipas.",

      "A man charged with stalking Jennifer Aniston and crashing his car through the front gate of her home has been found mentally incompetent to stand trial",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A judge declared Thursday that a man is mentally incompetent to stand trial on charges of stalking Jennifer Aniston and crashing his car through her front gate.",
      "The move in a Los Angeles County mental health court came after a second psychiatrist examined the defendant, Jimmy Wayne Carwyle, and reached the same conclusion as the first: that his mental health would not allow him to answer to felony charges of vandalism and stalking of the \u201cFriends\u201d star.",
      "\u201cThe court finds the defendant is not currently competent to stand trial,\u201d Judge Maria Cavalluzzi said. \u201cCriminal proceedings will remain suspended.\u201d",
      "Carwyle, 48, of Mississippi, has pleaded not guilty. He appeared behind glass in a custody area of the courtroom and did not speak. He looked vastly different than his previous two court hearings. His scraggly gray hair and beard had been shorn, and he was wearing bright yellow county jail clothing after previously appearing with bare shoulders, wrapped in a blanket-like smock meant for suicide prevention.",
      "Carwyle had argued that he is competent, and exercised his right to a second opinion after an initial incompetence finding last week.",
      "\u201cIt's not the outcome my client would have preferred,\" Deputy Public Defender Robert Krauss told the judge.",
      "A conviction on the charges, along with an aggravating circumstance of the threat of great bodily harm, could bring up to three years in prison for Carwyle. The incompetence finding has no set end date but it is temporary, and the standard criminal process could resume later.",
      "Cavalluzzi ordered more comprehensive mental evaluations to help determine where and how he'll be held, and what his treatment will be. The judge will get a report on the results at a June 26 hearing, where Aniston or her attorney will be allowed to share her perspective on the case.",
      "Aniston's lawyer, Blair Berk, was in the courtroom observing Thursday, but did not speak. Berk and the deputy district attorney handling the case declined comment outside court.",
      "Prosecutors allege Carwyle had been harassing Aniston with a flood of voicemail, email and social media messages for two years before driving his Chrysler PT Cruiser through the gate of her home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles on May 5, causing major damage. A security guard stopped him in her driveway until police arrived. Authorities said Aniston was home at the time, but did not come into contact, and no one was injured.",
      "Aniston became one of television's biggest stars in her 10 years on NBC's \u201cFriends,\u201d from 1994 until 2004. She won an Emmy Award for best lead actress in a comedy for the role, and she has been nominated for nine more. She currently stars in \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d on Apple TV+.",

      "It didn't occur to Ben Wang right away that in taking on \u201c Karate Kid: Legends,\u201d he'd be the franchise's first Asian American \u201cKid.\u201d And that gives him a lot of optimism.",
      "\u201cAt first I didn't even think about that,\u201d Wang told The Associated Press. \u201cThat feels like a very cool and actually privileged position that I get to be in.\"",
      "His casting happened, he said, in \"a world where that's normal enough.\"",
      "\u201cKarate Kid: Legends,\u201d which opens Friday, unites OG Ralph Macchio's Daniel and Jackie Chan's Mr. Han from the 2010 movie to help Wang's Li Fong win a New York City karate competition.",
      "In the original \u201cKarate Kid\u201d movie, which came out more than 40 years ago, Pat Morita was the only main Asian American cast member even though it takes place in California's San Fernando Valley. His beloved Mr. Miyagi helped underdog Daniel wax on and wax off against white karate bullies. That arc has been replicated and flipped in sequels and offshoots ever since. The overall lack of Asian and Asian American representation all these years has been a lingering point of contention for some.",
      "Jeff Yang, author of \u201cThe Golden Screen: The Movies That Made Asian America,\u201d said he knows plenty of Asian Americans who find most of the Miyagi-verse entertaining. At the same time, even the recent Netflix \u201cCobra Kai\u201d series hardly had any young Asian American main characters. That lost opportunity felt like a \u201cloose, nagging tooth,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always been a situation where the ancient or legendary martial arts master is transferring his skills not just to another generation, but into another community,\u201d Jeff Yang said. \u201cIn a way, that feels like for me as an Asian American, it turns it into a guilty pleasure.\"",
      "The Asians who were there were \u201ceither sidekicks or villains,\" he added.",
      "In Asia, there's a long cinematic history of elite martial artists-turned-actors ranging from icon Bruce Lee to Chan and Jet Li. But in Hollywood, Asian characters who did perform karate or kung-fu often weren't written three-dimensionally. Most of the stars who could shine for acting and on-screen fighting weren't Asian.",
      "\u201cIn a way that\u2019s understandable,\u201d Yang said. \u201cMartial arts is one of the things that was brought to the United States by soldiers who had been stationed in Asia, learned the practice, embraced the lifestyle and the discipline.\u201d",
      "By the 1970s and '80s, karate dojos were becoming popular all over the U.S. in cities and suburbs. So \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d debuted at just the right time.",
      "Ken Nagayama, a martial arts grand master who runs a school in the Valley, was an instructor at a North Hollywood dojo used for scenes in the original film. He recalls meeting Pat Morita. But, he wasn't thinking about casting. He was impressed by how much interest in karate shot up because of one movie.",
      "\u201cWhen that came out, so many people were interested in taking class, especially younger kids,\u201d said Nagayama, who plans to watch \u201cLegends\u201d with some of his students. He had \u201ca whole mix\u201d of students of all races signing up.",
      "Steven Ho, a stunt coordinator and martial artist who lives in Los Angeles and has appeared multiple times on Conan O'Brien's talk shows, remembers Morita, Macchio and William Zabka watching tournaments he competed in to prepare for the first movie. He was such a fan of Morita that he never thought about how there were no other Asian actors.",
      "\u201cPat Morita, to me, he was the lead,\u201d Ho said. \u201cAlso, if that were the only martial arts film out there, then yeah, it would be odd and I would be disappointed. But you gotta remember the \u201880s and \u201990s we were living in the golden age of Jet Li, Jackie Chan, films that featured ... more authentic martial artists.\"",
      "It's a full-circle moment that Chan is one of the mentors in this new flick. Wang is still in disbelief he got to do combat choreography with the superstar.",
      "\u201cHe's the guy you think he is,\u201d Wang said with a grin. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t turn it off when he\u2019s not on set.\u201d",
      "Ho happily points out that \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d is reinforcing how his 12-year-old twin sons are growing up without negative Asian stereotypes like he did. He\u2019d rather a story have no Asians if the characters are going to be the butt of the joke. That history of stereotyping of Asian men is why he initially declined appearing on O\u2019Brien\u2019s show.",
      "\u201cI thought \u201dOh, he\u2019s a tall guy. I\u2019m a short, Asian guy. They\u2019re just going to goof on me. They\u2019re going to go off on me,' so I said, \u2018You know, I\u2019m gonna be out of town,\u2019\u201d Ho said.",
      "Luckily, the segments, which have earned millions of YouTube views, were crafted so Ho was the straight-man to O\u2019Brien\u2019s buffoonery.",
      "Twins Jonny and Ollie, in fact, are real-life karate kids. The boys, known as the \u201cTwinjas,\" know karate, mixed martial arts and other disciplines. They count Bruce Lee's daughter, Shannon, as a friend. They've appeared on \u201cAmerica's Got Talent,\u201d \u201cObi-Wan Kenobi\" and taught Kevin Hart and Snoop Dogg moves. They love \u201cCobra Kai\u201d for the drama and want to see \u201cLegends\u201d for Chan. They have since been introduced to the movie that started it all.",
      "For Ollie, Miyagi was his favorite character.",
      "\u201cI think that in the first Karate Kids, how the teacher was Asian, I think being a teacher is better than being a student,\u201d he said.",
      "Jonny says not every show or movie in this genre has to have an Asian lead, but when there is one, he takes note.",
      "\u201cI think that there\u2019s definitely a lot of other movies and shows that have Asian leads, like Simu Liu, the first Asian superhero,\u201d Jonny said, referring to Marvel's \u201c Shang-Chi.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very significant.\"",
      "The Twinjas, who are working on a children's fiction book that's part mystery and part action, are not shy about voicing their own desire for \u201cany opportunities that come our way, we\u2019d love to take, especially for acting and using our martial arts skills,\u201d Ollie said.",
      "Perhaps they'll get some inspiration from seeing Wang in \u201cLegends.\u201d Wang considers it a \"point of pride\u201d if young Asian American children view him as a benchmark so they can see themselves as the hero.",
      "\u201cThe word I keep going back to is it's a privilege,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWhat I love about this series is ... there's this idea anyone can be the \u2018Karate Kid.\u2019\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Reality TV stars Julie and Todd Chrisley, who were in prison after being convicted on federal charges of bank fraud and tax evasion, were pardoned by President Donald Trump and walked free Wednesday.",
      "The couple is best known for the long-running TV series \u201cChrisley Knows Best,\u201d which followed their family and luxurious lifestyle \u2014 which prosecutors said was boosted by bank fraud and hiding earnings from tax authorities.",
      "The Chrisleys were convicted in 2022 of conspiring to defraud banks in the Atlanta area out of more than $30 million in loans by submitting false documents.",
      "The pardons signed Wednesday are the latest example of Trump, himself a former reality TV star, pardoning high-profile friends, supporters, donors and former staffers.",
      "Here are some things to know about the Chrisleys:",
      "\u201cChrisley Knows Best,\u201d which ran from 2014 to 2023, chronicled the extravagant exploits of the boisterous, tightly knit family of the couple and their five children, from high-end cars to luxury vacations to stunning mansions. It was recorded in the Atlanta area at first and then in Nashville.",
      "In 2019 the show spawned the spinoff \u201cGrowing Up Chrisley,\u201d which featured the couple's children Chase and Savannah living in Los Angeles.",
      "The couple\u2019s 2022 trial started just after E! announced that it was moving forward with a new dating series, \u201cLove Limo,\u201d hosted by Todd Chrisley. It also came soon after USA announced the renwal of \u201cChrisley Knows Best\u201d for a 10th season, while its spinoff was renewed by E! for a fourth season.",
      "The Chrisleys were found guilty in 2022 in Atlanta on the fraud and tax charges. Until this Wednesday they still had years left on their sentences: Julie Chrisley was expected to be released in 2028, and Todd Chrisley in 2032.",
      "At trial prosecutors detailed a laundry list of offenses that started before they became famous.",
      "The Chrisleys and a former business partner submitted false documents to banks to obtain fraudulent loans and then used new loans to pay off the old ones, prosecutors said. The couple was accused of spending lavishly on cars, designer clothes, real estate and travel.",
      "Todd Chrisley filed for bankruptcy, walking away from more than $20 million in unpaid loans, according to prosecutors. Meanwhile Julie Chrisley created false financial documents to rent a home in Los Angeles, they said, but then the couple did not pay rent on it.",
      "Once they were starring in the reality show, they operated a company that collected their income from the series and other ventures and kept the corporate bank accounts in Julie Chrisley\u2019s name to avoid collection of half a million dollars in back taxes that Todd Chrisley owed, prosecutors said.",
      "When the IRS asked for information on the accounts, they transferred ownership to Todd Chrisley\u2019s mother to try to hide his income further, according to authorities.",
      "Prosecutors also accused the couple of not filing or paying taxes for several years",
      "The Chrisleys\u2019 lawyers argued that an IRS officer gave false testimony at trial and that prosecutors lacked evidence to support convictions.",
      "A panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld their convictions last year.",
      "Savannah Chrisley has been a staunch Trump supporter and endorsed his candidacy while also speaking about her parents in a speech at the Republican National Convention last summer.",
      "\u201cMy family was persecuted by rogue prosecutors and Fulton County due to our public profile ... and conservative beliefs,\u201d she said at the time.",
      "She has called the case against her parents politically motivated, though they were indicted in 2019 under a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney, Byung J. \u201cBJay\u201d Pak.",
      "In a social media post Wednesday, she praised U.S. Pardon Attorney Ed Martin, the Justice Department lawyer assigned to advise Trump on pardons and commutations.",
      "\u201cYour leadership is already changing countless lives \u2014 including mine,\u201d she said on the social platform X. \u201cThank you for standing boldly for truth, for justice, and for reuniting families like mine.\u201d",
      "Todd Chrisley was released from a minimum security prison camp in Pensacola, Florida, in the evening, according to Shannen Sharpe, a spokesperson for his attorney, and Julie Chrisley left a facility in Lexington, Kentucky, Sharpe said.",
      "As Savannah Chrisley waited to meet her father at his prison, she said the family was planning to do a lot of catching up.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to celebrate anniversaries, birthdays, Christmases, all the things,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause we\u2019re going to make up for the lost time.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Wes Anderson has always been Wes Anderson, but with \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d he somehow seems more Wes Anderson than ever before",
      "\u201cThey say you murdered my mother,\u201d the young would-be nun tells the shady tycoon. \u201cI feel the need to address this.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s something about the deadpan delivery and the clear-eyed manner that makes you sit up and take notice of Liesl, and even more of Mia Threapleton, who plays her in \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme.\u201d (And there\u2019s another thing, too obvious to ignore: Boy, does she ever resemble her mom, Kate Winslet.)",
      "A vivid presence despite her dry-as-dust tone, Threapleton makes a splendid Andersonian debut here as half the father-daughter duo, along with Benicio Del Toro, that drives the director's latest creation. Their emerging relationship is what stands out amid the familiar Andersonian details: the picture-book aesthetic. The meticulous production design (down to those fascinating closing credits). The chapter cards. The \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d of Hollywood cameos. And most of all the intricate \u2014 nay, elaborate; nay, labyrinthine \u2014 plot.",
      "Indeed, Anderson seems to be leaning into some of these characteristics here, giving the impression of becoming even more, well, Wes Anderson than before. He will likely delight his most ardent fans but perhaps lose a few others with the plot, which becomes a bit exhausting to follow as we reach the midpoint of this tale.",
      "But what is the Phoenician scheme, anyway?",
      "It's a sweeping, ambitious, somewhat corrupt dream of one Anatole \u201cZsa-zsa\u201d Korda (Del Toro), one of the richest industrialists in Europe, to exploit a vast region of the world. We begin in 1950, with yet another assassination attempt on Korda\u2019s life \u2014 his sixth plane crash, to be exact, which occurs as he sits smoking a cigar and reading about botany.",
      "Suddenly, in a hugely entertaining pre-credits sequence, Korda\u2019s in the cockpit, ejecting his useless pilot and directing his own rescue, asking ground control whether he should crash into a corn or soybean field. The media mourns his passing \u2014 and then he turns up, one eye mangled, biting into a husk of corn. As usual, reports of his death have been \u2026 you know.",
      "Recovering at his estate, with some truly fabulous, tiled bathroom floors, Korda summons Liesl from the convent where he sent her at age 5. He wants her to be his sole heir \u2014 and avenger, should his plentiful enemies get him.",
      "His plans are contained in a series of shoeboxes. But Liesl isn't very interested in the Korda Land and Sea Phoenician Infrastructure Scheme. What she wants to know is who killed her mother. She also mentions they haven\u2019t seen each other in six years. (\u201cI apologize,\u201d he says.) And she wonders why none of his nine sons, young boys he keeps in a dormitory, will be heirs. But Korda wants her.",
      "They agree to a trial period. We do get the creeping feeling Liesl will never make it back to the convent \u2014 maybe it\u2019s the red lipstick, or the affinity she\u2019s developing for jewels? But we digress.",
      "We should have mentioned by now the tutor and insect expert, Bj\u00f8rn. In his first Anderson film but likely not the last, Michael Cera inhabits this character with just the right mix of commitment and self-awareness. \u201cI could eat a horse,\u201d he muses in a silly quasi-Norwegian accent before lunch, \u201cand easily a pigeon!\u201d",
      "Now it's on the road they go, to secure investments in the scheme. We won\u2019t get into the financial niceties \u2014 we writers have word-length limits, and you readers have patience limits. But the voyage involves \u2014 obviously! \u2014 a long line of characters only Anderson could bring to life.",
      "Among them: the Sacramento consortium, aka Tom Hanks and Bryan Cranston, two American guys who hinge their financial commitment on the outcome of a game of HORSE.",
      "Next it\u2019s to Marseille Bob (Mathieu Amalric), and then to Marty (Jeffrey Wright), leader of the Newark Syndicate (we\u2019re not talking Jersey here, but Upper Eastern Independent Phoenicia), who offers a blood transfusion to Korda because, oh yes, he was shot by terrorists at the previous meeting. (Don't worry, the guy's indestructible.)",
      "Then there\u2019s Cousin Hilda (Scarlett Johansson, continuing the cameo parade), whom Korda seeks to marry to get her participation in the investment.",
      "And then back on the plane, the group is strafed by a fighter jet. Soon, it'll be revealed that one of them is a mole. We won\u2019t tell you who, although it\u2019s hard to tell if anything is really a spoiler here \u2014 like the part when Benedict Cumberbatch appears with a very fake beard as Uncle Nubar, who may be someone\u2019s father or may have killed someone, and engages in a slapstick fight with Korda, complete with vase-smashing.",
      "We also shouldn\u2019t tell you what happens with the big ol\u2019 scheme \u2014 it was all about the journey, anyway. And about Korda and Liesl, who by the end have discovered things about each other but, even more, about themselves.",
      "As for Liesl, at the end, she's clad stylishly in black and white \u2014 but definitely not in a habit. As someone famously said about Maria in \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d \u201csomewhere out there is a lady who I think will never be a nun.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d a Focus Features release, has been rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association \u201cfor violent content, bloody images, some sexual material, nude images, and smoking throughout.\u201d Running time: 101 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

    "story": [
      "Sally Hawkins plays a foster mother with a secret in the new horror movie \u201cBring Her Back.\u201d",
      "Beware the quirky foster mother who introduces herself as a bit of a weirdo. That\u2019s how Laura (Sally Hawkins) cheerily greets the newly orphaned teenage siblings Andy and Piper in the new horror \u201cBring Her Back,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday.",
      "The comment, more telling than the kids realize at the time, comes after Laura excitedly introduces Piper, who is non-sighted, to her dog. She thinks it\u2019s a good joke to not explain first that the animal is not alive.",
      "The taxidermy is in fact the least weird thing about Laura. Australian filmmakers Michael and Danny Philippou, also behind the teen chiller debut \u201cTalk to Me,\u201d have dreamed up a new nightmare of trauma, grief, resurrection and the deep failures of Australia\u2019s child protective services. That last part is not actually a prominent throughline in the film, but after witnessing what these kids endure in the brisk 99-minute runtime, you too might have some questions about that department\u2019s standard practices.",
      "Many horror movies and stories have utilized non-seeing characters to enhance the suspense. \u201cBring Her Back\u201d strives to make Piper (newcomer Sora Wong) more than a gimmick but a young woman trying to assert her independence \u2014 she refuses to use her cane, which she thinks makes everyone baby her.",
      "Piper\u2019s main protector is her sweet and attentive older brother Andy (Billy Barratt). The film gives the audience a morsel of normality with these two before plunging us into the horror, first with the sudden death of their father, and then with the strange goings on at Laura\u2019s secluded home.",
      "They\u2019re surprised when they arrive to find there\u2019s another child there as well: Olly (Jonah Wren Phillips), who is mute, deeply strange and, when not locked in his room, getting into bloody messes of his own making. If you\u2019re squeamish about gaping wounds and the full surround sound experience of their squishing and oozing, this might not be the movie for you. For those who delight in the crafts behind it all, the makeup and sound work here is truly top notch.",
      "Like many of \u201cBring Her Back\u2019s\u201d genre peers, the occult, nude older men and grainy VHS tapes also co-star in the proceedings. Laura, whose non-seeing daughter drowned recently, is particularly fixated on Piper and equally as dismissive of poor Andy.",
      "While you can probably guess her endgame, the way it comes together is more of the point, and the Philippou twins certainly infuse the film with a fair amount of foreboding before anything truly deranged starts happening. It\u2019s a fun mystery to watch Laura\u2019s strange behavior, which one eventful day includes encouraging Andy to kiss his dead father on the lips (\"it's custom\"), getting the kids drunk and peeing in a measuring cup.",
      "Andy, three months shy of 18, was not originally supposed to accompany his sister to the foster home. But he convinces the social worker to give him a chance until he can apply for legal guardianship. Unfortunately, Laura seems intent on driving him away. He already has lingering trauma from finding his dead father (and other things that will be revealed in time), and now there\u2019s this chipper, tiny woman ready to gaslight him into insanity. Barratt, who won acclaim for his portrayal of a 12-year-old accused of killing his mother\u2019s boyfriend in the British television film \u201cResponsible Child,\u201d is excellent in a difficult role.",
      "Hawkins, meanwhile, gets to be bigger and wilder with Laura, shedding the nurturing mothers of \u201cPaddington\u201d and \u201cWonka\u201d for something defiantly disturbed. She\u2019s also got a few delightfully chilling lines that I won\u2019t spoil. And yet somehow Hawkins is also able to stay clear of campiness and make Laura, unhinged though she may be, the teeniest bit empathetic.",
      "The film doesn\u2019t quite earn the emotional catharsis it seems to be striving for. It\u2019s a little too insane and also underdeveloped, especially Piper\u2019s character, to let the audience in on that level. But if you\u2019ve come for unexpected scares and creativity, \u201cBring Her Back\u201d will not disappoint.",
      "\u201cBring Her Back,\u201d an A24 release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csome grisly images, language, graphic nudity, strong violent content, underage drinking). Running time: 99 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "A former WWE executive who had been fighting sexual abuse allegations in a lawsuit by an ex-employee has agreed to a confidential settlement and will now help the accuser as she continues suing the company and former leader Vince McMahon, representatives and lawyers said Wednesday.",
      "John Laurinaitis, WWE's former head of talent relations \u2014 who once wrestled under the name Johnny Ace \u2014 will aid Janel Grant in her lawsuit against McMahon and the worldwide wrestling entertainment conglomerate. Representatives for Grant and Laurinaitis lawyer Edward Brennan confirmed the settlement-cooperation deal and said Laurinaitis has \u201cevidence\u201d against McMahon and the company, but wouldn't say what it was.",
      "\u201cHis agreement to a confidential settlement is a pivotal next step toward holding McMahon and WWE accountable and bringing justice to Ms. Grant after years of sexual abuse and trafficking,\u201d representatives for Grant and Laurinaitis said in a joint statement. \"Mr. Laurinaitis looks forward to moving on with his life. We cannot provide any additional details at this time.\u201d",
      "A court document filed Wednesday says Grant and Laurinaitis agreed to a dismissal of the lawsuit's claims against Laurinaitis, but allegations against the WWE and McMahon remain.",
      "McMahon's lawyer, Jessica Rosenberg, issued a statement in response.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s dismissal of John Laurinaitis as a defendant doesn\u2019t alter the facts of this case in any way. Vince McMahon never mistreated Janel Grant,\" Rosenberg said. \u201cNo matter how many press releases her team issues, the truth remains unchanged.\u201d",
      "Rosenberg added that a lawyer for Laurinaitis previously said the lawsuit's allegations were unfounded.",
      "Representatives for the WWE did not immediately return emails seeking comment Wednesday.",
      "Grant sued the WWE, McMahon and Laurinaitis last year in federal court in Connecticut, where the WWE is based in Stamford. In graphic detail, she alleges McMahon coerced her into sex acts with him, Laurinaitis and others, and she claims both men sexually assaulted her. She says she was made to do humiliating acts during the encounters. The lawsuit also includes photos of sexual texts it says McMahon sent Grant.",
      "McMahon, former CEO and chairman of WWE, has denied Grant\u2019s allegations. He has previously said the lawsuit is \u201creplete with lies, obscene made-up instances that never occurred, and is a vindictive distortion of the truth. I intend to vigorously defend myself against these baseless accusations, and look forward to clearing my name.\u201d His lawyers said in court documents that he had a consensual relationship with Grant and never mistreated her.",
      "Grant first started working for the WWE in 2019 as an entry-level employee in its legal department, a job arranged by McMahon, and later transferred to the talent relations department, where Laurinaitis was her boss.",
      "Grant has said she was eventually pressured into leaving her job with the WWE and signing a $3 million nondisclosure agreement. The lawsuit also seeks to have the agreement declared invalid, saying McMahon breached the deal by giving her $1 million and failing to pay the rest.",
      "Currently pending in the lawsuit are motions by McMahon, the WWE and Laurinaitis to move all the claims to arbitration. They said the lawsuit should not be allowed because Grant agreed to settle any disputes in arbitration as part of her nondisclosure agreement.",
      "McMahon resigned from WWE\u2019s parent company in January 2024 after Grant filed her lawsuit. At the time, McMahon stepped down from his position as executive chair of the board of directors at WWE\u2019s parent company, TKO Group Holdings.",
      "McMahon also resigned as WWE\u2019s CEO in 2022 amid a company investigation into allegations that match those in Grant's lawsuit.",
      "McMahon bought what was then the World Wrestling Federation in 1982 and transformed it from a regional wrestling company into a worldwide phenomenon. Besides running the company with his wife, Linda, who is now the U.S. education secretary, he also performed at WWE events as himself.",

A mix that echoes the Shangri-Las,Patti Smith and Evanescence helps to leaven the occasional overripe lyric, such as, \u201cThere is no future that can\u2019t be designed/With imagination and a beautiful mind,\" in the title track.",
      "Most of the material is less New Age-y, and there\u2019s a fascinating desperation in Manson\u2019s positivity. \u201cChinese Fire Horse,\u201d for example, becomes a punky, Gen X, age-defying fist-pumper.",

      "Then comes the closer, \u201cThe Day That I Met God,\u201d a weird and whimsical benedictory mix of horns, strings, faith, pain management and more. Hope and uplift can sound good loud.",

      "The decision to restart the series was a no-brainer. According to Disney internal streaming data, the show has been streamed some 650 million hours on Disney+ globally to date. According to Nielsen, \u201cPhineas and Ferb\u201d is among the top 10 most-watched animated kids series on streaming platforms despite not offering new episodes in 10 years.",
      "The show \u2014 which had four seasons between 2007 and 2015 \u2014 centers on the titular stepbrothers \u2014 the triangular- headed Phineas and the quiet Ferb \u2014 who stave off boredom by turning their backyard into things like ski resorts, surfing beaches or monster truck rallies.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that the whole family can enjoy together,\u201d says Marsh. \u201cWe made a commitment never to cut anything just because somebody said it was too smart. We just believed kids are smarter than you think.\u201d",
      "The idiosyncratic show had a hard birth, created in 1993 but not airing until 2007. Povenmire and Marsh, both veterans of shows like \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and \u201cFamily Guy,\u201d hit it off and stuck with their vision.",

      "The creators insisted on using no double entendres, took out mean humor and refused to make the moms and dads idiots. Even the so-called villains \u2014 Candace and Doofenshmirtz \u2014 are good, deep down.",

      "The show has been a magnet for celebrity cameos and the upcoming season is no different, with Michael Bubl\u00e9, John Stamos, \u201cTed Lasso\u201d stars Brendan Hunt and Cristo Fern\u00e1ndez, Alan Cumming, Leslie Jones, Anna Faris, Megan Rapinoe, Meghan Trainor and Ruth Negga all making guest spots.",

      "His second solo album, \u201cGet Sunk,\u201d doesn't diverge much from the alt-rock band he's fronted for more than a quarter-century. And why should it?",
      "The National's sad-dad brand exists in the bittersweet spot between Berninger's complex lyrics and a melodic versatility. And \"Get Sunk\u201d sounds more like an extension of the band's catalog than a self-serving experiment for a restless songwriter.",
      "It works on both levels \u2014 with the album's familiar, upbeat electric guitar-escapes.",
      "But when compared to his band's repertoire, \u201cGet Sunk\u201d runs out of steam. Even with his consistently clever lyrics, a couple of lethargic songs can drag down a 10-track lineup.",
      "The record arrives a few years after a struggle with pandemic-driven depression, as he detailed in an interview with David Letterman. Berninger was hit by a bad case of writer\u2019s block after his first solo record, \u201cSerpentine Prison,\u201d came out in 2020.",
      "The National\u2019s release of two new albums five months apart in 2023, after a four-year hiatus, helped thaw some of Berninger's frozen creativity. His family moved from California to Connecticut that year, too, further aiding his reset; he began reading and painting in the fresh air.",
      "On \u201cGet Sunk,\" the third track, \u201cBonnet of Pins,\u201d brings a hard edge, evoking the band's \u201cThe System Only Dreams in Total Darkness\u201d record from 2017. \u201cGet Sunk\u201d producer Sean O'Brien cranks on the guitar. Drummer Sterling Laws does his best impression of The National stalwart Bryan Devendorf. Julia Laws, whose indie rock band Ronboy has been touring with Berninger, sings backup on this smoky, stressful encounter with an ex-lover.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a cup trick shell game, it\u2019s a puff of smoke/And it gets me every time, it\u2019s a pretty good joke,\u201d Berninger sings. \u201cI know that you miss me, I know that you miss me/This stuff takes a lifetime.\u201d",
      "With the infectious opener \u201cInland Ocean\u201d bursting with a reverbed guitar that pulsates throughout the song, \u201cGet Sunk\u201d gets revved up right away. Even on the downbeat \u201cNowhere Special,\" Berninger is at his songwriting best ambling through a rant about an on-again, off-again relationship: \u201cA bat can haul our recording equipment into the woods/I know we shouldn\u2019t but I feel like we should.\u201d The closer, \u201cTimes of Difficulty,\u201d is tailor-made for a live-show singalong with the chant \u201cGet drunk! Get sunk! Forget! Get wet!\u201d that marks Berninger's search for clarity and creativity.",
      "Much like The National's 2019 album \u201cI Am Easy to Find,\u201d which brought in several women to pair vocals with his gravelly baritone, \u201cGet Sunk\u201d follows suit. Laws sings on eight of the 10 tracks, and Meg Duffy of the band Hand Habits joins Berninger on the sentimental \u201cFrozen Oranges.\"",
      "The sleepiness of \u201cFrozen Oranges\u201d is also the first warning there's just not enough energy to cover a whole album, not quite enough strength for \u201cGet Sunk\u201d to swim on its own. Berninger will be forever intertwined with The National, a connection there's no need to undo.",

      "When Michael Cera was announced as joining the cast of a Wes Anderson movie for the first time, the prevailing response was: Hadn\u2019t he already been in a Wes Anderson movie",
      "CANNES, France -- When Michael Cera was announced as joining the cast of a Wes Anderson movie for the first time, the prevailing response was: Hadn\u2019t he already been in a Wes Anderson movie?",
      "So seemingly aligned in sensibility and style are Cera and Anderson that you could easily imagine a whole fake filmography. It is, for a slightly more corduroyed corner of the movie world, an actor-director pairing as destined as Scorsese and De Niro \u2014 even if \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d is (checks notes one last time) their first movie together.",
      "\u201cI would remember,\u201d Cera deadpans. \u201cI would never have passed up the opportunity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d which Focus Features releases Friday in theaters, stars Benicio Del Toro as the international tycoon Zsa-zsa Korda, who after a lifetime of swindling and exploiting has decided to make his daughter, a novitiate named Liesl (Mia Threapleton), the heir to his estate.",
      "Cera plays Liesl\u2019s Norwegian tutor Bj\u00f8rn Lund. And because of the strong leading performances, you couldn\u2019t quite say Cera steals the show, he\u2019s certainly one of the very best things about \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\" \u2014 and that's something for a movie that includes Tom Hanks and Bryan Cranston playing a game of HORSE. Bj\u00f8rn is an entomologist, which means Cera spends a sizable portion of the movie in a bow tie with an insect gently poised on his finger.",
      "\u201cHe is sort of a bug, himself,\u201d Cera, speaking in an interview at the Cannes Film Festival shortly before the premiere of \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d says with a wry smile. \u201cAnd he sheds his skin and becomes his truth self.\u201d",
      "If Cera\u2019s role in \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d feels like a long time coming, it is. He and Anderson first met more than 15 years ago. Cera, 36, was then coming off his early breakthroughs in \u201cArrested Development,\u201d \u201cSuperbad\u201d and \u201cJuno.\u201d A comic wunderkind from Ontario who stood out even among the \u201cArrested Development\u201d cast as a teenager, Cera had caught Anderson\u2019s attention.",
      "\u201cIt was something arranged by an agent in New York and we went to a kind of cocktail party,\u201d Anderson recalls by phone. \u201cWe were with Harvey Keitel, too. So it was me and Harvey and Michael Cera \u2014 a totally unexpected combination. But I loved him. For years I\u2019ve kind of felt like: Why haven\u2019t we already done something together?\u201d",
      "For Cera, the meeting was even more memorable.",
      "\u201cI remember being very excited to meet him,\" Cera says. \"I remember him being very disarming. Obviously, he was like a luminary inspiration. He has had a huge impact on my general sense of taste. I discovered his movies when I was a teenager and watched them over and over.\u201d",
      "They nearly did come together on a movie before \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme.\u201d Anderson had a small role for Cera in \u201cAsteroid City,\u201d but when its production schedule got pushed, Cera had to drop out because of the coming due date for his first son with his wife Nadine.",
      "\u201cI was kind of worried that I blew it,\" says Cera, \u201cthat I missed the chance to sneak in.\u201d",
      "But even though Anderson and Cera didn\u2019t work together until \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d they developed a relationship. Cera, who aspires to write and direct his own films, would send Anderson scripts for feedback. \u201cWe became friends,\u201d says Cera.",
      "\u201cIn the case of this movie, it was everything short of written for him,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cAs soon as we had the idea of the character, he was the guy who (cowriter Roman Coppola) and I started talking about. I think we talked to him about it before there was a script or anything.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt seemed like it had already happened,\u201d adds Anderson. \u201cAnd it was a very good fit, a natural thing.\u201d",
      "Cera quickly adapted to Anderson\u2019s unique style of moviemaking, in which the cast collectively stay at a hotel, begin the morning in makeup together and remain on set without trailers to retreat to. \u201cAt first, you\u2019re kind of exhausted,\u201d says Cera. \u201cAt the end of the first day, you go: OK, I need to eat a bigger breakfast.\u201d As the production went along, Cera often sat right next to Anderson to watch him work.",
      "One very notable characteristic of Bj\u00f8rn is a Norwegian accent. If there\u2019s anything more fitting than Michael Cera being a Wes Anderson movie, it might be Michael Cera doing a Norwegian accent in a Wes Anderson movie. It\u2019s also a bit that, in \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d has a touch of spoiler to it. Cera calls it \u201csort of a jaunty, playful representation of an accent, not purporting to be a home run.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I brought up the accent to Wes, I said, \u2018How should we go about this accent?\u2019\u201d Cera say. \u201cHe was kind of caught of guard. I think he hears the movie in his head and maybe hadn\u2019t figured that in. It was something Wes had to compute.\u201d",
      "As Anderson describes it, Cera was determined. \u201cI, at a certain point, was a little reluctant, like, I don\u2019t know if we need it,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cHe was like: \u2018No, let me show you what I\u2019m going to do.\u2019\u201d",
      "A determination in absurdism has long marked Cera's best performances. Though a private person who has resisted all urges to get a smartphone, Cera is remarkably fearless when it comes to the most awkward moments. It\u2019s a seriousness of purpose that, whether singing \u201cThese Eyes\u201d in \u201cSuperbad\u201d or waving hello as Allen in \u201cBarbie,\u201d that's made Cera a favorite of successive generations. Even in a billion-dollar blockbuster, Cera can be unassumingly hilarious.",
      "\u201cI feel like most people don\u2019t know I\u2019m in that movie. I mean, not a in a bad way. It was great for my personal disposition to get to be part of it,\u201d Cera says. \u201cI can say I\u2019m in it, but I can walk around. I\u2019m nowhere near the center of the movie. I\u2019m not on the poster, put it that way. (Laughs) My nephew went and saw the movie with my sister. Afterwards he was like, \u2018I thought Uncle Michael was going to be in this movie.\u2019 It was a nice lane for me.\u201d",
      "Just before the premiere of \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d in Cannes, it was announced that Cera, after writing a handful of scripts including an adaptation of Charles Portis\u2019 \u201cMasters of Atlantis,\u201d will make his directorial debut with \u201cLove Is Not the Answer,\u201d a film he wrote that has a cast including Pamela Anderson and Steve Coogan.",
      "\u201cYou have a little more control over your destiny if you try to create something, even though it\u2019s hard to get it off the ground,\u201d Cera says. \u201cBut it\u2019s better than sitting around. You\u2019re like a hired contractor as an actor, and it\u2019s a great thing about it. But I think a lot of actors end up becoming frustrated directors because of how many opinions you have about the proceedings.\u201d",
      "It may have taken many years for Cera and Anderson to finally team up, but it could have come at the right time, just as Cera is \u2014 ahem \u2014 shedding a skin. In any case, theirs remains an ongoing collaboration. Anderson tapped Cera for an ad they recently shot for Mont Blanc. Does that mean he's officially part of the troupe?",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s up to him,\" says Cera. \u201cI would never say no.\u201d",

      "Dolly Parton says her faith has carried her through her fluctuating grief following the death of her husband, Carl Dean",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Dolly Parton\u2019s angelic voice floated throughout her first gospel album in 1971 with songs like \u201cI Believe,\u201d \u201cLord Hold My Hand\u201d and the album\u2019s title track, \u201cGolden Streets of Glory.\u201d The entertainment icon says the same steadfast faith that inspired those hymns have anchored her throughout her grief following the death her husband, Carl Dean.",
      "\u201cI am a person of faith, and I truly believe that I\u2019m going to see him again someday. And I see him every day in my memories and in my heart, and in all the things that we used to do and all the things that we\u2019ve built together,\u201d said Parton. \u201cYou just kind of have to learn to kind of make new plans \u2014 but that\u2019s the hardest part.\u201d",
      "The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame honoree reflected on her marriage of nearly 60 years while promoting her new single-serve Southern-inspired frozen meals, following her popular Duncan Hines baking mixes via a collaboration with US-based Conagra Brands. Dean, who avoided the spotlight and inspired her timeless hit \u201cJolene,\u201d as well as her 2023 \u201cRockstar\u201d album, died in March at 82.",
      "\u201cI really feel his presence,\u201d said the 10-time Grammy winner. \u201cI just try to go on, because I know I have to. And he was ill for quite a while, and part of me was at peace that he was at peace and not suffering anymore. But that still doesn\u2019t make up for the loss and the loneliness of it.\u201d",
      "The 79-year-old recording artist spoke with The Associated Press about her perspective on life without her husband, her entrepreneurial spirit and on why she\u2019s never embraced the title \u201csuperstar.\u201d The conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity.",
      "PARTON: No, I just think that I\u2019ve always had dreams and I\u2019m always working. My husband understood that. Carl knew that better than anybody and he was all about it. He was very proud of me. \u2026 So when I did lose him, I just thought, well, I\u2019m going to take all of that energy, and I'm just going to put that back into other things, and I\u2019ll keep him ever-present in everything that I do.",
      "PARTON: I just think that if you\u2019re successful, if you are lucky enough to see your dreams come true, you need to make new dreams out of your other dreams. Because it\u2019s like a tree with lots of limbs and leaves, so every dream, you can kind of branch off \u2014 if you\u2019ll pardon the expression \u2014 and do other things. And I like the business end of things. I like seeing things happen, and I love making things happen. So, my mind just naturally works that way.",
      "PARTON: I have a new book coming out ... this one is called \u2018Star of the Show,\u2019 which is actually a song I wrote years ago. But it\u2019s about my life on the road and my life on stage \u2014 all the behind the scenes and all the people that I\u2019ve met, and all of the things that happen when you\u2019re traveling like that as I have for all of these years. So, that, and then I have my life story as a musical. It\u2019s called \u2018Dolly: An Original Musical.\u2019 And I\u2019ve written a lot of original songs for it. Of course, it\u2019ll have the big hits that are woven into the story. And it\u2019s just about my life, from the time I was little until up through now.",
      "It\u2019s going to be at the Fisher Center of Performing Arts at Belmont University (in Nashville). Then, once that has its run through the end of August, then we take it to New York to open on Broadway next year.",
      "PARTON: One of the things they did for the 40th anniversary was put a big sign up on the hill there above Dollywood that says \u201cDollywood\u201d like the Hollywood sign. \u2026 Years ago, when I thought, \u2018Well, someday I\u2019m going to have my own theme park and I\u2019m gonna change that H to a D and have Dollywood.' So, they finally, after 40 years, put that sign up, even though I\u2019ve talked about it for years. So, we\u2019ve got a lot of wonderful things planned for the whole season that\u2019s celebrating the 40th anniversary. It seems just like a few years back, but it\u2019s like everything else: I was with Carl for 60 years, and Dollywood\u2019s 40 years old. And that\u2019s just hard to believe because I\u2019m only 27. (laughs)",
      "PARTON: I don\u2019t think about my life in terms of \u2018superstar.\u2019 I\u2019m just a workin\u2019 girl. I always say \u2014 and it\u2019s the truth \u2014 that I am a workhorse that looks like a show horse. But I gotta keep it all up and I enjoy all of it. \u2026 My husband always said, \u2018If anybody was ever born to be a star, it\u2019s you.\u2019 Because he sees me loving to do all the things and playing and stuff \u2014 it\u2019s play time for me. But I take it very serious.",

      "Mr. Miyagi was known for waxing poetic",
      "Mr. Miyagi was known for waxing poetic. So the fact that \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d has nothing to say is all the more disappointing.",
      "One of the most interesting aspects of the original \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d and its early sequels is Mr. Miyagi\u2019s radical proclivity for mercy, often mistaken for cowardice by those around him. He doesn\u2019t just teach Daniel (Ralph Macchio) how to fight. He teaches him a subversive way of living, and, in doing so, becomes a kind of father figure to the fatherless boy.",
      "As is often the case, it seems the spirit of the franchise was lost somewhere in the creation of an entire universe \u2014 including six films and six seasons of \u201cCobra Kai.\u201d Although \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d does eventually allude to this philosophy of compassion, it lacks both the heart and grit of those earlier films. It\u2019s neither entertaining, nor thought-provoking, which makes one wonder whether this was solely a means of capitalizing on the renewed audience the franchise boasts thanks to \u201cCobra Kai.\u201d",
      "In some ways, the film follows the playbook of its predecessors. Li Fong (Ben Wang) moves to New York from Beijing with his mother and deals with the clashing of cultures and the struggles of being an outsider. And while Li does eventually, like in previous films, fight the jealous ex-boyfriend of his new romantic interest, their rivalry is hardly the focal point of the story.",
      "Instead, Li\u2019s main struggle is internal, as he deals with the grief of witnessing his brother get fatally stabbed by a disgruntled opponent after a kung fu match back home. But even that internal struggle is buried under other subplots and is hardly dealt with in the end.",
      "You might be wondering how Macchio and Jackie Chan fit into this story. They are, after all, on the movie poster. But neither is meaningfully in the film until about an hour into it, when they decide they need to help Li prepare for his karate match. Chan starred as a kung fu master in the 2010 remake, and the impressively choreographed fight scenes in this movie are more akin to his previous film \u2014 the convergence between Macchio's karate and Chan's kung fu is never really fleshed out.",
      "\u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d is the first project in the franchise to connect Chan and Macchio, and does so in a way that feels forced. Once Chan and Macchio are finally on screen, there are a few endearing moments between the pair. But not enough to save the film. The attempt to tell a different story, while laudable, turns the film into a convoluted one, with no real character development or stakes.",
      "Part of the problem is that the movie takes itself so seriously, making some of the irreverent humor of \u201cCobra Kai\u201d unattainable. (One of the best moments of the film is William Zabka\u2019s cameo as Johnny Lawrence in a light-hearted coda.) For the most part, the film struggles tonally, thanks in part to the upbeat music set against a backdrop of violence and trauma.",
      "That\u2019s not to say the previous films haven\u2019t always suffered from trying to do too many things. But there were moments of poignancy in the earlier movies that are absent in this latest installment of the franchise.",
      "Despite its sprawling universe, there's no need to have kept up with it to understand most of what's going on. But rewatching the first wouldn't hurt, even if it will make you nostalgic for what's missing in \u201cKarate Kid: Legends.\u201d",
      "\u201cKarate Kid: Legends,\u201d a Sony Pictures release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for martial arts violence and some language. Running time: 94 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Rio de Janeiro's mayor on Tuesday loosened new restrictions on live music on the city's beaches after many people warned of a threat to the dynamic cultural scene.",
      "Mayor Eduardo Paes earlier this month introduced the measures and reinforced existing ones, citing the need to protect public safety and the environment and promote peaceful relations between tourists and residents.",

      "\u201cMusic will return to the beaches,\u201d said Julio Trindade, who works as a DJ in the kiosks and campaigned against the measure. \u201c Rio\u2019s beaches are known worldwide and they deserve a soundtrack.\u201d",

      "\u201cAnyone who doesn\u2019t respect the rules will face a fine of 1,000 reais (around $180) for the first infraction, a fine of 2,000 reais for the second. And on the third, we\u2019ll cancel the license and change the owner of the kiosk,\u201d the mayor said.",
      "The United Street Vendors\u2019 Movement, which protested Tuesday in the municipal assembly, later said it met with assembly president Carlos Caiado.",
      "\u201cWe secured a crucial step forward: the creation of a working group with the participation of street vendor representatives to discuss safety, sanitary regulations and most importantly, the legalization of our category,\u201d the movement said.",

      "Alabama\u2019s Ryan Williams and Ohio State\u2019s Jeremiah Smith are the cover athletes for EA Sports College Football 26",
      "Alabama's Ryan Williams and Ohio State's Jeremiah Smith are the cover athletes for EA Sports College Football 26, the video-game developer announced Tuesday.",
      "The electric sophomore wide receivers were picked for the second edition of the franchise's reboot. Last year's game was the first in 11 years and was among the best-selling video games in 2024.",
      "Williams and Smith are posed together on the standard cover, while the deluxe edition also includes other players, coaches, mascots and former cover stars Reggie Bush, Tim Tebow and Denard Robinson.",
      "The \u201826 edition will test if the franchise still has the same staying power it had when it was released annually in the early 2000s.",
      "For the players who are featured in the game, it will certainly remain popular. Williams said in a statement released by EA Sports that the cover was \u201ca dream come true,\u201d and Smith called it \u201ca tremendous privilege.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m proud to represent Ohio State alongside Coach (Ryan) Day while carrying the Buckeye legacy forward, celebrating the passion of our fans and the tradition of this incredible program,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Williams and Smith broke onto the national scene in 2024 with their miraculous catches on the biggest stages.",
      "Williams' spinning TD grab to help beat then-No. 2 Georgia looked like it belonged in a video game. It was one of many wowing plays from the young receiver. Williams finished his freshman season with 48 receptions for 865 yards and eight receiving touchdowns.",
      "Smith was a major part of the Buckeyes' run to a national championship. He regularly hauled in one-handers that decimated the confidence of his defenders. In a CFP quarterfinals win over top-seeded Oregon, Smith had seven receptions, 187 yards and two touchdowns. He finished his freshman year with 76 catches, 1,315 yards and 15 receiving touchdowns.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran has summoned France's representative in protest after the French foreign minister praised a prize-winning Iranian film as \u201ca gesture of resistance against the Iranian regime's oppression.\u201d",
      "Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot had praised \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d after it won the prestigious Palme d\u2019Or award at the Cannes Film Festival. The Iranian film centers on a man who abducts his suspected captor after being tortured in prison.",
      "Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry said the French charge d\u2019affaires was summoned over the minister\u2019s \u201cinterventionist, irresponsible and instigative allegations,\u201d the state-run IRNA news agency reported.",
      "\u201cSpare us Iranians the lectures. You have no moral authority whatsoever,\u201d Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on \u201cX,\u201d citing France's approach to Israel's ongoing war in Gaza. France last week threatened \u201cconcrete action\u201d against Israel if the country didn't halt the offensive in Gaza and lift restrictions on humanitarian aid, but the statement was mostly dismissed as empty threats.",
      "Immediately following the award's announcement, the Iranian state news agency had announced a more muted celebration of the award, crediting the country\u2019s film industry for winning a second Palme d\u2019Or after Abbas Kiarostami\u2019s 1997 drama, \u201cTaste of Cherry.\"",
      "In Iran, film productions need to receive script approval from the government to shoot in public. Dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi refuses to do that, knowing they won\u2019t allow him to make the films he wants to, and \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d was filmed without cooperation. Iranian state TV called the film a mixture of \u201clie and smearing\u201d as well as an \u201cunderground\u201d film produced without required permits in Iran. State TV also chastised Panahi for not mentioning the plight of the Palestinians in his acceptance speech.",
      "The film follows a man named Vahid, played by Vahid Mobasser, who believes he sees his former captor, who tortured him in prison and ruined his life. He abducts him, takes him to the desert and begins to bury him in the ground.",
      "But to satisfy pangs of doubt, Vahid decides to confirm his suspicion by bringing the man, locked in his van, to other former prisoners for identification. In a strange and emotional journey, they are all forced to grapple with revenge and forgiveness. Panahi drew on the experiences from his own imprisonment as well as the stories of detainees around him.",
      "Other state media were more critical of the win. The Mizan news agency, an arm of the country\u2019s judiciary, reported on the win as part of the \u201cPolitical Cannes Film Festival,\u201d suggesting that the prize was given to Panahi because of his political leanings.",
      "Pro-reform media outlets and activists praised Panahi. \u201cThis victory is no accident \u2014 it is the result of a tireless dedication to exploring humanistic values and human rights,\u201d said Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, who was also previously imprisoned at Tehran\u2019s notorious Evin Prison. Inmates at the prison include those with Western ties and political prisoners.",
      "Panahi, one of the leading international directors, was banned from traveling out of Iran in 2009 for attending the funeral of a student killed in anti-government protests, a judgment later extended to two decades. But even when placed under house arrest, Panahi kept making movies, many of which are among the most lauded of the century. He made 2011\u2019s \u201cThis Is Not a Film\u201d on an iPhone in his living room. \u201cTaxi\u201d (2015) was clandestinely shot almost entirely within a car.",
      "Panahi was arrested in 2022 when he went to the Tehran prosecutor\u2019s office to inquire about the arrests of two other Iranian filmmakers. A judge later ruled that he must serve six years for an earlier sentence on charges of propagandizing against the government from 2011 that had never been enforced. In early 2023, Panahi went on a hunger strike and was released from Evin Prison.",
      "Panahi said he would not seek asylum in another country, despite the risks of additional imprisonment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s simple. I\u2019m unable to live here,\u201d he said last week from the Cannes festival. \u201cI have no ability to adapt to a new country, a new culture. Some people have this ability, this strength. I don\u2019t.\u201d",

      "OTTAWA, Ontario -- King Charles III arrives in Ottawa this week to underscore Canada's sovereignty to U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Trump\u2019s repeated suggestion that the U.S. annex its northern neighbor prompted Prime Minister Mark Carney to invite Charles to give the speech from the throne that will outline his government's agenda for the new Parliament. The king is the head of state in Canada, which is a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies.",
      "\u201cHis Majesty King Charles III will read the speech from the throne and thus present the plan of our government, our priorities, as Canada is facing a pivotal moment in its history, the biggest transformation of the global trading system since the fall of the Berlin Wall,\" Carney told his caucus Sunday.",
      "Carney said \u201cCanada has a steadfast defender in the sovereign\" when he announced the visit earlier this month.",
      "It is rare for the monarch to deliver what\u2019s called the speech from the throne in Canada. Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, did it twice in her 70-year reign. The last time was in 1977.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, but Carney has been eager to show the differences between Canada and the U.S. and he said that the king\u2019s visit clearly underscores the sovereignty of Canada.",
      "The Americans had a revolution to gain independence from Britain. Canada remained a colony until 1867 and continued thereafter as a constitutional monarchy with a British-style parliamentary system.",
      "\u201cWe are different and the king illustrates that,\u201d former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said. \u201cIf you look at why King Charles is reading the speech from the throne than you have to then acknowledge Canada\u2019s story.\u201d",
      "But new U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra said sending messages isn\u2019t necessary and Canadians should move on from the 51st state talk, telling the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that if there\u2019s a message to be sent there\u2019s easier ways to do that like calling him or calling the president.",
      "Royal historian Carolyn Harris expects Trump to notice the visit because the president has repeatedly spoken about his admiration for the royal family.",
      "Harris said Trump might see how different Canada is from the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt is a very distinctive history that goes back to the waves of loyalists who settled here after the American revolution,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to seeing the king in a Canadian context, escorted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, surrounded by Canadian symbolism. This is very much King Charles III in his role as King of Canada.\u201d",
      "The speech, which will be delivered Tuesday, is not written by the king or his advisers in the U.K., as the king serves as a nonpartisan head of state. The king will read what is put before him by Canada\u2019s government.",
      "\u201cCharles can only act with the consent and with the advice of his prime minister. But at the same time he cannot act in a way that would throw any of the other 14 Commonwealth realms under the bus. So it is finest tightrope to walk,\" said Justin Vovk, a Canadian royal historian.",
      "Canadians were not happy when U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer extended a state visit invitation to Trump on behalf of the king during a time when Trump threatened Canada's sovereignty.",
      "\u201cTo be frank,\u201d Carney told Britain's Sky News. \u201cThey weren\u2019t impressed by that gesture, quite simply, given the circumstance. It was a time when we were quite clear ... about the issues around sovereignty.\"",
      "The king has more recently been showing support for Canada, including displaying Canadian military medals on his chest during a visit to a British aircraft carrier.",
      "After he arrives on Monday he will drop the ceremonial first puck or ball during a street hockey game. He will also attend a community event and meet with Carney and Canada's governor general, his representative as head of state. The king will return to the U.K. after Tuesday's speech and a visit to Canada's National War Memorial.",

      "Iranian dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday for his revenge thriller \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\" handing the festival's top prize to a director who had been banned from leaving Iran for more than 15 years.",
      "Cate Blanchett presented the award to Panahi, who three years ago was imprisoned in Iran before going on a hunger strike. For a decade and a half, he has made films clandestinely in his native country, including one film (\"This Is Not a Film\") made in his living room, and another (\"Taxi\") set in a car.",
      "The crowd rose in a thunderous standing ovation for the filmmaker, who immediately threw up his arms and leaned back in his seat in disbelief before applauding his collaborators and the audience around him. On stage, Panahi was cheered by Cannes jury president Juliette Binoche, who in 2010 in Cannes held up Panahi's name to honor the director when he was under house arrest.",
      "On stage, Panahi said what mattered most was freedom in his country.",
      "\u201cLet us join forces,\u201d said Panahi. \u201cNo one should dare tell us what kind of clothes we should wear, what we should do or what we should not do. The cinema is a society. Nobody is entitled to tell what we should or refrain from doing.\u201d",
      "The win for \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d extended an unprecedented streak: The indie distributor Neon has now backed the last six Palme d'Or winners. The latest triumph for Neon, which acquired \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d for North American distribution after its premiere in Cannes, follows its Palmes for \u201cParasite,\u201d \u201cTitane,\u201d \u201cTriangle of Sadness,\u201d \u201cAnatomy of a Fall\u201d and \u201cAnora.\u201d",
      "All those films were Oscar contenders and two, \u201cParasite\u201d and \u201cAnora,\u201d won best picture.",
      "Last year, filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran to attend the premiere of his film in Cannes and resettle in Germany. Panahi, though, has said that unlike his friend Rasoulof, life in exile isn't for him. He planned to fly home to Tehran on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d was inspired by Panahi's experience in prison. In the film, a group of former prisoners encounter the man who terrorized them in jail, and weigh whether or not to kill him.",
      "Panahi was jailed in Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison after going there to inquire about the then-jailed Rasoulof. Panahi was released in 2023 after going on a hunger strike.",
      "In 2009, he was banned from traveling out of Iran after attending the funeral of a student killed in the Green Movement protests. Through those years, Panahi continued to make films illegally in Iran, without a permit, and had his films smuggled to festivals on USB drives. His travel ban was lifted after his release in 2023.",
      "\u201cThe film springs from a feeling of resistance, survival, which is absolutely necessary today,\u201d Binoche told reporters after the ceremony. \u201cArt will always win. What is human will always win.\u201d",
      "The Cannes closing ceremony followed a major power outage that struck southeastern France on Saturday in what police suspected was arson. Only a few hours before stars began streaming down the red carpet, power was restored in Cannes.",
      "\u201cA day without electricity,\" sighed John C. Reilly, who sang an English-language \u201cLa Vie En Rose\u201d at the ceremony. The festival's films, he said, supplied \u201call the needed electricity.\"",
      "The Grand Prix, or second prize, was awarded to Joachim Trier\u2019s Norwegian family drama \u201cSentimental Value,\u201d his lauded follow-up to \u201cThe Worst Person in the World.\u201d Some had expected \u201cSentimental Value\u201d to win the Palme, but Trier \u2014 whose film reunites him with actor Renate Reinsve \u2014 still took a major prize.",
      "\u201cWe live in a time of tremendous excess and saturation of images. Moving images are being thrown at us all the time,\" said Trier. \"And I want to give homage to the Cannes Film Festival for being a place where the big cinematic image, which is the foundation of the moving image, the free image, the image that we take time to look at, the image where we can identify with each other in contemplation and empathy, to be cherished in this place in such a way is very important in this moment.\u201d",
      "Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho\u2019s Brazilian political thriller \u201cThe Secret Agent\" won two big awards: best director for Filho and best actor for Wagner Moura. Though Cannes juries are generally urged to spread awards around, the two for \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d showed the jury's strong feelings for it. Asked about the two prizes, juror Jeremy Strong explained, simply, \u201cThat was our wish.\u201d",
      "The wins, which followed the international film Oscar victory for Walter Salles' \u201cI'm Still Here\u201d in March, gave Brazil more to celebrate. On X, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, said the awards \u201cshow that our country\u2019s cinema is second to none.\u201d",
      "The jury prize was split between two films: \u00d3liver Laxe\u2019s desert road trip \u201cSir\u00e2t \" and Mascha Schilinski's German, generation-spanning drama \u201cSound of Falling.\u201d Best actress went to Nadia Melliti for \u201cThe Little Sister,\u201d Hafsia Herzi's French coming-of-age drama.",
      "The Belgian brothers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, who are two-time Palme d'Or winners, won best screenplay for their latest drama, \u201cYoung Mothers.\u201d Its their ninth prize in Cannes. The festival's award for best first film, the Camera d'Or, went to Hasan Hadi for \u201cThe President's Cake,\u201d making it the first Iraqi film to win an award at the festival.",
      "Saturday's ceremony brought to a close a 78th Cannes Film Festival where geopolitics cast a long shadow, both on screen and off. Shortly before the French Riviera extravaganza, which is also the world's largest movie market, U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of a 100% tariff on movies made overseas.",
      "Most filmmakers responded with a shrug, calling the plan illogical. \u201cCan you hold up the movie in customs? It doesn\u2019t ship that way,\u201d said Wes Anderson, who premiered his latest, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d at the festival.

      "Want a COVID-19 vaccination this fall? For many Americans, it\u2019s not clear how easy it will be to get one \u2013 or if they\u2019ve lost the choice.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was a longtime anti-vaccine activist, said this week that the shots are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women, usurping a decision normally made by scientific experts, not political appointees.",
      "The announcement follows an earlier Trump administration step to limit COVID-19 vaccinations among healthy people under age 65.",
      "Until now, the U.S. \u2013 following guidance from independent experts who advise the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2013 has recommended yearly COVID-19 vaccinations for everyone age 6 months and older.",
      "Together, the moves have left health experts, vaccine makers and insurers uncertain about what to advise and what comes next.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to add a lot of confusion overall,\u201d said Ajay Sethi, an epidemiologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.",
      "Some of this season\u2019s vaccine is still available. Insurance industry experts say if people had insurance coverage before Kennedy\u2019s announcement, it\u2019s highly unlikely that would have ended instantly based on the secretary\u2019s video announcement. That means if someone could find a shot, they'd likely be able to get one for now.",
      "Who will be able to get what vaccines this fall is still unclear.",
      "Vaccine manufacturers plan to issue updated COVID-19 shots in the late summer or fall. But the Food and Drug Administration has said it plans to limit approval of seasonal shots to seniors and others at high risk, pending more studies of everyone else.",
      "Even if the U.S. approves vaccines only for certain groups, it still may be possible for others to get the shot depending on the outcome of upcoming advisory meetings, regulatory moves and decisions from insurers and employers.",
      "Insurers base coverage decisions on the recommendations of that CDC panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. It\u2019s not clear what role that panel now will play. Paying out of pocket could cost about $200.",
      "But some insurers and employers may decide to still cover the shots regardless of the new recommendations, said Jen Kates, a senior vice president at the non-profit KFF, which studies health care issues. She noted that they may view the expense as worthwhile if it avoids a higher bill from someone hospitalized by the coronavirus.",
      "The FDA published a list of health conditions it said would qualify, including asthma, cancer, diabetes, obesity and physical inactivity. The CDC has a more extensive list.",
      "But, again, it isn't yet known how this will play out. For example, it could be hard for people to prove they're qualified. If they're vaccinated at a drugstore, for instance, the pharmacist wouldn't normally know about underlying health problems or even ask. Kates said it's unclear whether Kennedy's move would affect whether doctors recommend the shot.",
      "And Sethi, the UW-Madison expert, said \u201cthis elephant in the room\u201d is that blocking vaccination to the healthy may mean people who have a risk factor and simply don't know it will miss out.",
      "Adding to the confusion, the FDA included pregnancy and recent pregnancy on the list of conditions that would qualify someone for a shot \u2014 but Kennedy said that pregnancy was no longer a qualification in his announcement this week.",
      "COVID-19 complications during pregnancy can include preterm birth as well as serious illness in the mother, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine said it \u201cstrongly reaffirms\u201d its recommendation for vaccination during pregnancy.",

      "A verdict is expected in one of France's largest-ever child sex abuse cases",
      "A French court will deliver its verdict Wednesday in one of the country\u2019s largest-ever child sex abuse cases, which has raised questions about how a pedophile surgeon was able to rape hundreds of victims over a period spanning more than two decades.",
      "Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, a 74-year-old former surgeon, stands accused of raping and sexually assaulting 299 children. On Friday, prosecutors requested the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, describing Le Scouarnec as \u201ca devil in a white coat.\u201d He's already serving a 15-year prison sentence, for a conviction in 2020 for the rape and sexual assault of four children, including two nieces.",
      "The new trial in Brittany, western France, began in February and has laid bare a pattern of abuse between 1989 and 2014. Most of the victims were unconscious or sedated hospital patients at the time of the assaults. The average age was 11. Among the victims were 158 boys and 141 girls.",
      "During the trial, advocacy groups have accused health authorities of inaction after they were notified as soon as 2005 of Le Scouarnec\u2019s conviction for possessing child pornography pictures.",
      "At the time, no measures were taken to suspend his medical license or limit his contact with children and Le Scouarnec continued his abuse in hospitals until his arrest in 2017.",
      "\u201cShould Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec have been the only one in the defendant\u2019s box?\u201d prosecutor St\u00e9phane Kellenberger asked during his closing arguments.",
      "\u201cMore could have been done,\" Kellenberger said. \"Things could have been done differently, even within the notorious layers of French bureaucracy, where responsibilities are so often passed from one authority to another until, eventually, that responsibility is lost, and hits innocent lives.\"",
      "Le Scouarnec has confessed to all the sexual abuse alleged by the 299 civil parties, as well as to other assaults that are now beyond the statute of limitations. In a shocking admission during the trial, he also acknowledged sexually abusing his granddaughter \u2014 a statement made in front of her visibly distraught parents.",
      "Le Scouarnec had been convicted in 2005 for possessing and importing child sexual abuse material and sentenced to four months of suspended prison time. Despite that conviction, he was appointed as a hospital practitioner the following year. Child protection groups that have joined the proceedings as civil parties hope that the case will help strengthen the legal framework to prevent such abuse.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s trial came as activists continue to push to dismantle taboos that have long surrounded sexual abuse in France. The most prominent case was that of Gis\u00e8le P\u00e9licot, who was drugged and raped by her now ex-husband and dozens of other men who were convicted and sentenced in December to three to 20 years in prison.",
      "In a separate case focusing on alleged abuse at a Catholic school, an inquiry commission of the National Assembly, France\u2019s lower house of parliament, is investigating allegations of physical and sexual abuse over five decades.",
      "Victims of Le Scouarnec have, however, complained of a perceived lack of attention.",
      "\"This trial, which could have served as an open-air laboratory to expose the serious failings of our institutions, seems to leave no mark on the government, the medical community, or society at large,\u201d a group of victims said in a statement.",
      "Not all victims were initially aware they had been abused. Some were contacted by investigators after their names appeared in journals kept by Le Scouarnec, in which he meticulously documented his crimes. Others only realized they had been hospitalized at the time after checking medical records. Two of his victims took their own lives some years before the trial.",
      "Using the cover of medical procedures, the former abdominal and digestive surgeon took advantage of moments when children were alone in their hospital rooms. His method was to disguise sexual abuse as clinical care, targeting young patients who were unlikely to remember the encounters.",
      "The notebooks, which detail the abuse in graphic language, have become central to the prosecution\u2019s case.",
      "Despite the scope of the allegations, Le Scouarnec has remained calm and composed throughout the trial.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see them as people,\u201d he told the court. \u201cThey were the destination of my fantasies. As the trial went on, I began to see them as individuals, with emotions, anger, suffering and distress.\u201d",
      "He said his first act of abuse occurred in 1985, when he raped his 5-year-old niece.",
      "While he offered apologies to some victims, his demeanor struck many as detached and emotionless.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t show emotion, that\u2019s just how I am,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t feel it, but I don\u2019t express it.\u201d",
      "The case first came to light in April 2017, when a 6-year-old neighbor told her mother that the man next door had exposed himself and touched her through the fence separating their properties.",
      "A search of his home uncovered more than 300,000 photos, 650 pedophilic, zoophilic and scatological video files, as well as notebooks where he described himself as a pedophile and detailed his actions.",
      "\u201cJo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec says he no longer feels any sexual attraction to children, but there\u2019s no way to verify that,\u201d Kellenberger, the prosecutor, told the court. \u201cExperts concluded that we cannot rely on his word alone and that his potential for future danger remains significant.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors are seeking not only a 20-year prison sentence with a two-thirds minimum term, but also a post-sentence preventive detention, a rarely used measure in France that applies to the country\u2019s most dangerous offenders. If approved, Le Scouarnec could be held indefinitely in a secure socio-medical facility, even after serving his time.",
      "A third trial is expected in the coming years, following the emergence of new allegations during this trial, including further abuse involving his granddaughter.",

      "Joyce Bakker, the Sudan coordinator for Doctors Without Borders \u2014 also known as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res or MSF \u2014 said that the alarming spike began in mid-May, with Khartoum's twin city, Omdurman, as the epicenter.",
      "She said MSF treated almost 2,000 suspected cholera cases in the past week alone. There were no immediate official figures of fatalities from cholera in this latest outbreak, though an aid worker said he was told on Monday of 12 people dying of cholera.",
      "In March, MSF said that 92 people had died of cholera in Sudan\u2019s White Nile State, where 2,700 people had contracted the disease since late February.",
      "Sudan plunged into war more than two years ago, when tensions between the Sudanese army and its rival paramilitary Rapid Support Forces group, or RSF, exploded with battles in Khartoum and across the country.",
      "Since then, at least 20,000 people have been tallied as being killed, though the number is likely far higher, and the African nation has been engulfed by what the United Nations says is the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis.",
      "More than 14 million people have been displaced and forced from their homes and disease outbreaks, famine and atrocities have mounted as the country entered its third year of war.",
      "Sudan's Health Minister Haitham Ibrahim said on Saturday that the recent increase in cholera cases is estimated to average 600 to 700 per week, over the past four weeks.",
      "He attributed the surge to the return of many Sudanese to the Khartoum region \u2014 people who had fled their homes to escape the fighting and who are now coming back. Their returns have strained the city's dwindling water resources, he said.",
      "Last week, the Sudanese military said it had regained control of the Greater Khartoum area from the paramilitary forces.",
      "On Monday, Mohanad Elbalal, co-founder of the Khartoum Aid Kitchen, said he was told that 12 people had died of cholera in Omdurman, including a relative of one of his kitchen staff.",

      "The proposed measure on lethal medication defines assisted dying as allowing use under certain conditions so that people may take it themselves. Only those whose physical condition doesn\u2019t allow them to do it alone would be able to get help from a doctor or a nurse.",
      "The bill, which received 305 votes in favor and 199 against, will be sent to the Senate, where the conservative majority could seek to amend it.

      "The problem, aid workers say, is the U.S. hasn't made clear what programs are lifesaving, or whether whatever funding is left will continue after July 1.",
      "The aid group CARE has warned that 4.6 million people in Somalia are projected to face severe hunger by June, an uptick of hundreds of thousands of people from forecasts before the aid cuts.",
      "The effects are felt in rural areas and in Mogadishu, where over 800,000 displaced people shelter. Camps for them are ubiquitous in the city's suburbs, but many of their centers for feeding the hungry are now closing.",
      "Some people still go to the closed centers and hope that help will come.",
      "Mogadishu residents said they suffer, too.",
      "Ma\u2019ow, the bereaved father, is a tailor. He said he had been unable recently to provide three meals a day for his family of six. His wife had no breast milk for Maka'il, whose malnutrition deteriorated between multiple trips to the hospital.",
      "Doctors confirmed that malnutrition was the primary factor in Maka'il's decline.",
      "The nutrition center at Banadir Hospital where Ma'ow family had been receiving food assistance is run by Alight Africa, a local partner for the U.N. children's agency, UNICEF, and one that has lost funding.",
      "The funding cuts have left UNICEF's partners unable to provide lifesaving support, including therapeutic supplies and supplemental nutrition at a time when 15% of Somali children are acutely malnourished, said Simon Karanja, a regional UNICEF official.",
      "One Alight Africa worker, Abdullahi Hassan, confirmed that the group had to close all their nutrition centers in several districts of Mogadishu. One nutrition project supervisor for the group, Said Abdullahi Hassan, said closures have caused, \u201ctragically, the deaths of some children.\u201d",
      "Without the food assistance they had taken for granted, many Somalis are seeing their children waste away.",
      "More than 500 malnourished children were admitted to the center for malnourished children at Banadir Hospital between April and May, according to Dr. Mohamed Jama, head of the nutrition center.",
      "He said such increases in patients usually occur during major crises like drought or famine but called the current situation unprecedented.",
      "\"The funding gap has impacted not only the malnourished but also health staff, whose salaries have been cut,\u201d he said.",
      "Fadumo Ali Adawe, a mother of five who lives in one of the camps, said she urgently needed help for her 3-year-old daughter, malnourished now for nine months. The nearby nutrition center she frequented is now closed.",
      "\u201cWe are unsure of what to do next,\" she said.",
      "Inside that center, empty food packages were strewn about \u2014 and USAID posters still hung on the walls.",

      "Haitians with HIV are defying stigma as they publicly denounce USAID cuts implemented by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump that has led to a dwindling of life-saving medication",
      "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- A video showing dozens of people marching toward the office of Haiti\u2019s prime minister elicited gasps from some viewers as it circulated recently on social media. The protesters, who were HIV positive, did not conceal their faces \u2014 a rare occurrence in a country where the virus is still heavily stigmatized.",
      "\u201cCall the minister of health! We are dying!\u201d the group chanted.",
      "The protesters risked being shunned by society to warn that Haiti is running out of HIV medication just months after the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump slashed more than 90% of USAID\u2019s foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall aid across the globe.",
      "At a hospital near the northern city of Cap-Haitien, Dr. Eugene Maklin said he struggles to share that reality with his more than 550 HIV patients.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain to them, to tell them that they\u2019re not going to find medication,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a suicide.\u201d",
      "More than 150,000 people in Haiti have HIV or AIDS, according to official estimates, although nonprofits believe the number is much higher.",
      "David Jeune, a 46-year-old hospital community worker, is among them. He became infected 19 years ago after having unprotected sex. \u201cI was scared to let people know because they would point their finger at you, saying you are infecting others with AIDS,\u201d he said.",
      "His fear was so great that he didn\u2019t tell anyone, not even his mother. But that fear dissipated with the support Jeune said he received from nonprofits. His confidence grew to the point where he participated in Monday\u2019s protest.",
      "\u201cI hope Trump will change his mind,\u201d he said, noting that his medication will run out in November. \u201cLet the poor people get the medication they need.\u201d",
      "Patrick Jean No\u00ebl, a representative of Haiti\u2019s Federation of Associations of HIV, said that at least five clinics, including one that served 2,500 patients, were forced to close after the USAID funding cuts.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t stay silent,\u201d he said. \u201cMore people need to come out.\u201d",
      "But most people with HIV in Haiti are reluctant to do so, said Dr. Sabine Lustin, executive director of the Haiti-based nonprofit Promoters of Zero AIDS Goal.",
      "The stigma is so strong that many patients are reluctant to pick up their medication in person. Instead, it is sent via packages wrapped as gifts to not arouse suspicion, Lustin said.",
      "Lustin\u2019s organization, which helps some 2,000 people across Haiti, receives funding from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While their funding hasn\u2019t been cut, she said that shortly after Trump was sworn in, the agency banned prevention activities because they targeted a group that is not a priority. By that, Lustin said she understood they were referring to gay men.",
      "That means the organization can no longer distribute up to 200,000 free condoms a year or educate people about the disease.",
      "\u201cYou risk an increase in infections,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have a young population who is sexually active who can\u2019t receive the prevention message and don\u2019t have access to condoms.\u201d",
      "On a recent sunny morning, a chorus of voices drowned out the din of traffic in Haiti\u2019s capital, growing louder as protesters with HIV marched defiantly toward the office of Haiti\u2019s prime minister.",
      "\u201cWe are here to tell the government that we exist, and we are people like any other person,\u201d one woman told reporters.",
      "Another marching alongside her said, \u201cWithout medication, we are dying. This needs to change.\u201d",
      "Three days after Monday's protest, the leader of Haiti\u2019s transitional presidential council, Louis G\u00e9rald Gilles, announced that he had met with activists and would try to secure funding.",
      "Meanwhile, nonprofit organizations across Haiti are fretting.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d said Marie Denis-Luque, founder and executive director of CHOAIDS, a nonprofit that cares for Haitian orphans with HIV/AIDS. \u201cWe only have medication until July.\u201d",
      "Her voice broke as she described her frantic search for donations for the orphans, who are cared for by HIV-positive women in Cap-Haitien after gang violence forced them to leave Port-au-Prince.",
      "Denis-Luque said she has long advocated for the orphans\u2019 visibility.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t keep hiding these children. They are part of society,\u201d she said, adding that she smiled when she saw the video of Monday\u2019s protest. \u201cI was like, whoa, things have changed tremendously. The stigma is real, but I think what I saw \u2026 was very encouraging to me. They can\u2019t be silenced.\u201d",
      "Experts say Haiti could see a rise in HIV infections because medications are dwindling at a time that gang violence and poverty are surging.",
      "Dr. Alain Casseus, infectious disease division chief at Zamni Lasante, the largest non-governmental healthcare provider in Haiti, said they expected to see a surge in patients given the funding cuts, but that hasn\u2019t happened because traveling by land in Haiti is dangerous since violent gangs control main roads and randomly open fire on vehicles.",
      "He warned that abruptly stopping medication is dangerous, especially because many Haitians do not have access or cannot afford nutritious food to strengthen their immune system.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take long, especially given the situation in Haiti, to enter a very bad phase,\u201d he said of HIV infections. And even if some funding becomes available, a lapse in medication could cause resistance to it, he said.",
      "Casseus said gang violence also could accelerate the rates of infection via rapes or physical violence as medication runs out.",
      "At the New Hope Hospital run by Maklin in Haiti\u2019s northern region, shelves are running empty. He used to receive more than $165,000 a year to help HIV/AIDS patients. But that funding has dried up.",
      "\u201cThose people are going to die,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how or where we\u2019re going to get more medication.\u201d",
      "The medication controls the infection and allows many to have an average life expectancy. Without it, the virus attacks a person\u2019s immune system, and they develop AIDS, the late stage of an HIV infection.",
      "Reaction is swift when Dr. Maklin tells his patients that in two months, the hospital won\u2019t have any HIV medication left.",
      "\u201cThey say, \u2018No, no, no, no!\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to keep living.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- Naqi Rizvi loves the \u201cabsolute freedom\u201d he feels on the tennis court.",
      "Winning titles is fun, too.",
      "The 34-year-old blind tennis champion is on a mission to not only raise awareness but also elevate the sport into the Paralympics.",
      "\"That would be the dream, and I\u2019d love to be the first Paralympic champion if I can,\u201d Rizvi said.",
      "The London resident, fully blind from the age of 7 because of congenital glaucoma, only took up the sport a decade ago and is now the No. 1-ranked men's player in the world for his category.",
      "Also an avid runner, Rizvi has completed two marathons and although jogging with a guide is great, tennis offers more.",
      "\u201cOn a tennis court, I have absolute freedom because I know where the boundaries are, no one needs to tell me which way to turn, I don\u2019t need to have a cane or anything of this sort,\" he told The Associated Press during a practice session at the National Tennis Center in southwest London.",
      "\"It\u2019s just the absolute sense of freedom to know that I can run comfortably, make my own decisions, and then be able to play points or rallies. It\u2019s just incredible.\u201d",
      "The rules are basically the same as mainstream tennis just with smaller dimensions and slightly lower net. Tactile lines are taped onto the court so players like Rizvi can feel the boundaries. Depending on the level of visual impairment, you are allowed up to three bounces of the ball. The foam ball contains a bell so players can audibly track it.",
      "\u201cWhat I find interesting about blind tennis is it\u2019s incredibly technical,\u201d said Rizvi, who also possesses a big serve.",
      "The problem-solving aspect of the sport is something Rizvi enjoys \u2014 no surprise given that he studied engineering at University College London.",
      "\u201cYou really need to anticipate after you\u2019ve heard the first bounce where the second and third will be,\u201d he said. \"You obviously can\u2019t see how your opponent has hit the ball, so it\u2019s a lot of anticipation and a lot of practice and getting used to different trajectories that the ball can take.",
      "Rizvi didn't even know that tennis was an option until he visited Metro Blind Sport in London a decade ago. He was hooked right away.",
      "\u201cI can almost assure you that if you did a survey of blind and partially sighted people,\" he said, \"the majority of them wouldn\u2019t have any idea because it\u2019s not televised, it\u2019s not in any other mainstream events, so how are people supposed to find out?\u201d",
      "The Lawn Tennis Association supports a visually impaired program that includes practice sessions at the governing body's National Tennis Center. That's where Jack Draper, the world No. 5 player, tried out the different levels. The LTA also runs tournaments each year and sends \u201cTeam GB\u201d to an international competition.",
      "Rizvi noted that there's not much financial backing in the sport. There's no prize money at tournaments and players often fund their own travel.",
      "\u201cUnless you obviously have the visibility and the money behind it, it\u2019s really hard,\u201d he said. \u201cGoverning bodies need to take a more active role and try and give parity to all forms of disability tennis not just the ones that have made it big like wheelchair tennis, for example.\u201d",
      "Rizvi, who is married and works in finance, originally represented his native Pakistan but for the past year has been part of England's program since gaining British citizenship. He discussed his childhood \u2014 his father is Pakistani and his mother is Indian \u2014 in a TEDx Talk he gave as a student at UCL.",
      "Invented in Japan by Takei Miyoshi in 1984, blind tennis is played around the world. Last year's world championships in Italy were the largest to date with 117 players from 20 countries, the International Blind Tennis Association said.",
      "Rizvi has won several national titles, a European championship, the world championship in 2023 \u2014 as well as gold that year at the ISBA World Games. He is also the two-time defending champion of the Play Your Way to Wimbledon tournament.",
      "The International Paralympic Committee handbook spells out that the sport or discipline must be \u201cwidely and regularly practiced\u201d in at least 32 countries and three continents.",
      "\u201cI really want it to be in the Paralympics,\u201d Rizvi said, \"but I also want this to be a mainstream sport which can be part of the ATP Tour, part of Grand Slam tournaments, just like wheelchair tennis has made such amazing leaps forward. I\u2019d love for blind tennis to be there as well because it\u2019s definitely got the potential.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s got the countries, the continents, the people, the passion behind it.\"",

      "Pope Leo XIV is visiting the papal summer palace south of Rome",
      "ROME -- Pope Leo XIV visited the papal summer palace south of Rome on Thursday as questions swirled whether he will use it himself to escape the heat or follow in Pope Francis\u2019 footsteps and keep the hilltop estate as a museum and environmental center.",
      "Leo paid a visit to the Borgo Laudato Si, an educational sustainability project that grew out of Francis\u2019 2015 environmental encyclical \u201cPraised Be,\u201d the Vatican said. The center is located in the gardens of the Vatican\u2019s Castel Gandolfo property on Lake Alban in the hills south of Rome.",
      "Pope Urban VIII built the palace on the northern end of town in 1624, to give popes an escape from the sweltering Roman summers. It was enlarged over succeeding pontificates to its present size of 55 hectares (136 acres), which is actually bigger than Vatican City itself.",
      "Popes past used it regularly in summer, and Pope Benedict XVI famously closed out his papacy there on Feb. 28, 2013. But Francis, a homebody who never took a proper vacation during his 12-year pontificate, decided to remain in Rome in summer.",
      "In 2014 he decided to open Castel Gandolfo\u2019s gardens to the public, and later turned part of the palazzo itself into a museum, in part to help offset the economic downturn the town experienced with no popes holding weekly Sunday prayers there in summer.",
      "Leo, a former missionary priest who spent the bulk of his priesthood in Peru, hasn\u2019t said where he will live full-time in Rome, much less whether he will use the palace as a summer getaway.",

Royalist groups accuse the country\u2019s major political parties of corruption and failed governance and say people are frustrated with politicians.",

      "The executive secretary to Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. says Marcos will retain Defense Secretary Gilberto during a midterm overhaul of his Cabinet",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. will retain Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr., who is among the most vocal critics of China in Asia, as Marcos presses on with a midterm overhaul of his Cabinet, a senior official said Thursday.",
      "Teodoro, who has strongly echoed Marcos\u2019 criticisms of China\u2019s increasingly assertive actions in the South China Sea, will remain in his post, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin told a news conference.",
      "Maj. Gen. Nicolas Torre III will be the next chief of the 232,000-member national police. Torre led the arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte in March and his turnover to International Criminal Court detention in The Netherlands for his deadly anti-drug crackdowns, Bersamin said.",
      "Last year, Torre oversaw the arrest of Philippine religious leader Apollo Quiboloy, a key Duterte supporter who was placed on the FBI\u2019s most-wanted list after being indicted for sexual abuses and trafficking in the U.S. Torre would take over his retiring predecessor, Gen. Rommel Marbil.",
      "Marcos asked all of his Cabinet secretaries last week to submit resignations in what the government said was a \u201cbold reset\u201d of his administration following the May 12 midterm elections, which saw more opposition candidates win crucial Senate seats.",
      "Marcos, the 67-year-old son of a late Philippine dictator overthrown in 1986, won the presidency in the deeply divided Southeast Asian country by a landslide in 2022 in a stunning political comeback as he made a steadfast call for national unity. But his equally popular vice-presidential running mate, Sara Duterte, later had a falling out with him that has sparked intense political discord.",
      "With support from friendly countries including the U.S., a treaty ally, Marcos emerged as the most vocal critic of China\u2019s actions in the disputed South China Sea while contending with an array of longstanding domestic issues including inflation, delayed fulfillment of a campaign promise to bring down the price of rice and many reports of kidnappings and other crimes.",
      "Teodoro told The Associated Press in March that China\u2019s aggressive policies in the disputed waters were now considered the greatest threat to the Philippines' national security and should also be regarded as a global threat because it could choke a trade route that is crucial for global supply chains.",
      "\"The greatest external threat actually is Chinese aggression, Chinese expansionism and the attempt by China to change the international law through the use of force or acquiescence \u2026 or its attempt to reshape the world order to one that it controls,\u201d Teodoro told the AP.",
      "Bersamin, who serves as executive secretary to Marcos and the Cabinet, has not specified the reasons for each Cabinet change but said \u201cthe president has no patience for under performance.\"",
      "Bersamin said last week that Marcos decided to replace Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo with Foreign Undersecretary Theresa Lazaro, who has relayed Philippine protests and led talks with Chinese officials concerning an alarming spike of confrontations between Chinese and Philippine coast guard and naval forces in recent years.",
      "China claims virtually the entire South China Sea, a key global trade and security route despite a 2016 international arbitration ruling initiated by the Philippines that invalidated those expansive claims based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also are involved in the long-seething territorial standoffs regarded as a flashpoint in Asia.",

      "WARSAW, Poland -- Poland\u2019s presidential election has come down to a stark ideological choice: a liberal pro-European mayor versus a staunch nationalist conservative. They are polling so close that the outcome is impossible to predict in the run-off round on Sunday.",
      "It's not just a domestic affair. President Donald Trump has thrown his weight behind the nationalist candidate, Karol Nawrocki, and dangled the prospect of closer military ties if Poles choose him over liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski.",
      "Trump met with Nawrocki earlier this month at the White House and sent his Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to a meeting of the conservative pressure group CPAC in Poland, where she offered a strong endorsement.",
      "Noem even dangled the prospect of closer U.S.-Polish military ties in the event of a Nawrocki win \u2014 with the implied warning that a Trzaskowski victory could jeopardize Poland\u2019s security.",
      "At stake is not only Poland\u2019s domestic course but also the international standing of a key European Union and NATO member on the alliance\u2019s eastern flank, in a region gripped by anxiety over Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "Sunday\u2019s vote will either empower Prime Minister Donald Tusk, a pro-EU reformer, with a presidential ally who can advance his rule-of-law agenda \u2014 or saddle him with a rival who could veto legislation and block government initiatives.",
      "Trzaskowski\u2019s supporters argue that a pro-European leader would enhance Poland\u2019s global standing during a time of war in Europe. Nawrocki\u2019s backers believe only conservative rule can safeguard national sovereignty and traditional Christian values, and they say Trump\u2019s support would greatly enhance Poland\u2019s security.",
      "But the candidate who may ultimately decide the outcome is one who won\u2019t appear on the runoff ballot.",
      "S\u0142awomir Mentzen, a 38-year-old far-right politician and beer producer from the central city of Torun, finished third in the first round of voting on May 18, with nearly 15% of the vote. Though eliminated, his supporters \u2014 often young, anti-establishment, and deeply skeptical of both Brussels and Poland's political establishment \u2014 have become the most sought-after constituency in the country.",
      "Both remaining candidates have gone out of their way to court Mentzen and his base. In recent days, each man traveled to the north-central Polish town of Torun, famous for being the birthplace of astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, to appear on Mentzen's YouTube channel, where he has built a following with a mix of libertarian economics, nationalist rhetoric, and anti-EU invective.",
      "His influence highlights a broader shift in Polish politics, where the far right \u2014 once considered a fringe force \u2014 is increasingly shaping the national agenda. It\u2019s also part of a larger trend of hard-right parties gaining traction across Europe.",
      "Piotr Buras, head of the European Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 Warsaw office, says Poland is part of a larger pattern in which voters turn to populist forces amid rapid social change. But he also cites local factors, such as disillusionment with Tusk\u2019s coalition.",
      "That coalition, which spans the ideological spectrum, has struggled to agree on key issues, including liberalizing the abortion law \u2014 a campaign promise. Meanwhile, outgoing conservative President Andrzej Duda has blocked parts of Tusk\u2019s agenda. Observers say the coalition\u2019s voters must be highly mobilized on Sunday to defeat Nawrocki.",
      "Many votes in the first round went to protest candidates. Among voters aged 18\u201329, over 35% backed Mentzen, and nearly 20% supported a far-left candidate, Adrian Zandberg, according to exit polls.",
      "In addition, an extreme right-wing antisemite, Grzegorz Braun, won more than 6% of the votes overall.",
      "Buras believes right-wing protest candidates are more appealing today than those on the left because they promise to restore a lost past, while the left promises a better future that many see as unattainable.",
      "\u201cThe world is changing, society is changing very fast, much faster than anytime in the past,\" Buras said. \u201cPeople are worried and they vote for those who say we can go back to the glorious past.\u201d",
      "Since the first round, Mentzen \u2014 co-leader of the Confederation party \u2014 has presented both candidates with an eight-point list of demands: no new taxes; defense of cash payments; expanded gun rights; and opposition to NATO membership for Ukraine, among others.",
      "Nawrocki, who appeared on Mentzen\u2019s show on June 22, signed on to all eight points \u2014 including the controversial Ukraine stance \u2014 breaking with his Law and Justice party\u2019s longstanding support for Kyiv\u2019s integration with the West.",
      "Trzaskowski appeared two days later. He said he could agree with some points, like fiscal restraint, but rejected others. He strongly defended LGBTQ+ rights and reaffirmed that Ukraine should eventually join NATO, once the war ends, calling it key to Poland's own security.",
      "The YouTube interviews have dominated the political conversation, underscoring how Mentzen, a TikTok-savvy outsider, has upended traditional campaigning.",
      "The exchange between Trzaskowski and Mentzen on Saturday was occasionally tense, especially over LGBTQ+ rights, but remained civil and substantive.",
      "In many ways it overshadowed a traditional televised debate the day before. The substance of that debate did not seem to change the trajectory of the campaign. The thing Poles discussed most was a brief moment when Nawrocki inserted something into his mouth which he later said was a tobacco pouch. Some have questioned if he is fit to be president if he couldn't get through a two-hour debate without taking a hit of tobacco.",
      "After the sometimes sharp exchanges, Mentzen sat down for a beer with Trzaskowski and others in the pub he owns.",
      "The informal gathering was documented by Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski, who was there as well. He posted a video on social media Saturday evening showing the group with the words: \u201cFor a Poland that unites, not divides.\u201d",
      "The video quickly went viral, with commentators speculating about whether it was a spontaneous gesture or a calculated political move.",
      "It was also one more example, if more were needed, of how far-right forces in Europe are slowly becoming accepted.",
      "For Mentzen, the moment was also awkward. The man who made his name skewering the political elite appeared cozy with establishment figures. Critics on the hard right lashed out, revealing fractures in the movement he helped popularize.",
      "After dangling the promises of an endorsement for days, Mentzen on Wednesday afternoon said he wouldn\u2019t offer one to either candidate. \u201cVote as your conscience tells you,\u201d he told his supporters.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A New Zealand court on Thursday discharged the husband of an Australian diplomat without convicting him, months after the man pleaded guilty to assault for drunkenly spitting on a teenager during a street altercation on the night of a rugby match in Wellington.",
      "The man was granted permanent name suppression. Judge Paul Mabey, presiding at the Wellington District Court, said he didn\u2019t accept the man\u2019s arguments that the potential harms to him justified the discharge, but the magistrate agreed that his wife\u2019s diplomatic career could be curbed by an assault conviction and the publication of his name.",
      "The man could be barred from travel abroad to her future postings, the judge said, and the family could be split up if the Australian High Commission decided he could not remain in New Zealand to preserve bilateral relations between the countries.",
      "The charges arose after an episode last September after the man attended a rugby match between New Zealand and Australia in the capital, which Australia lost 33-13. He was drunk when he arrived at Wellington\u2019s main nightlife area, where he approached a group of teenagers and became aggressive when they didn\u2019t want to engage with him, the judge said.",
      "A member of the group punched the man, who responded by spitting on a young woman. He was arrested by police officers who happened to be passing.",
      "The case has provoked widespread news coverage in New Zealand and Australia, which featured cell phone footage of the man\u2019s arrest. In the video, he was seen verbally abusing a police officer and claiming to have diplomatic immunity. He had such immunity, conferred by protocol to the partners of senior envoys to New Zealand, which he later waived voluntarily.",
      "He pleaded guilty to New Zealand's lowest level of assault charge in January. It is punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to 4,000 New Zealand dollars ($2,400).",
      "\u201cFor the avoidance of any doubt at all, he is not here to be sentenced for abusing the police or rashly claiming diplomatic immunity,\u201d Judge Mabey said.",
      "\u201cHe was right to say he had that immunity,\" the judge added. \"He was completely stupid to say it at all.\u201d",
      "But the magistrate said he would discharge the man because of his wife\u2019s suggestion that the Australian diplomatic service would be unable to ignore the husband\u2019s conviction and the widely-distributed cell phone video of his arrest when considering her future.",
      "\u201cIf I were not to suppress his name, his offending would be inextricably linked to his wife and she would suffer considerably,\u201d the judge said.",
      "He rejected a bid by the man\u2019s lawyer to suppress the country his wife represented in New Zealand.",

      "But they say more than $4.5 billion of the funds were stolen and laundered through bribes and kickbacks.",
      "The spoils bankrolled extravagant purchases, from wild parties to lavish spending on jewels, art, a superyacht and luxury real estate, prosecutors have said. They also helped finance the 2013 Martin Scorsese film \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d that starred Leonardo DiCaprio.",
      "The scandal led to the fall of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak\u2019s government in 2018. Najib was later convicted by a Malaysian court of abuse of power and other crimes related to the scandal and sentenced to 12 years in prison.",
      "\u201cWhat we did was unequivocally wrong, and I take full responsibility for my role,\u201d Leissner said Thursday. \"I deeply regret my actions, and if I could turn back time, I would undo them without hesitation.\u201d",
      "Leissner had pleaded guilty in 2018 to bribing government officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi.",

      "Leissner is due to report to prison Sept. 15 and his lawyers have requested that he be sent to the federal prison in Otisville, New York, according to the prosecutors.",
      "Henry Mazurek, Leissner's lawyer, said his client is prepared to serve his sentence. It includes two years of supervised release after prison and a forfeiture totaling $43.7 million, which already has been paid.",
      "\u201cMr. Leissner cooperated not only to obtain leniency at sentencing, but to show his true remorse for his actions and tell the full story of 1MDB and Goldman Sachs,\u201d Mazurek said in an email. \"He did that and will continue to tell all who will listen about the poisonous culture at Goldman that inspired the 1MDB scheme.\u201d",

      "The Nebraska Legislature has passed a bill that significantly weakens a voter-backed measure requiring employers to offer paid sick leave",
      "Republicans in the Nebraska Legislature managed to pass a bill that significantly weakens a voter-backed measure requiring employers to offer paid sick leave. And they did it with the help of a Democrat.",
      "Backers of the bill overcame a filibuster on Wednesday with the exact number of votes needed \u2014 33 \u2014 thanks to the support of a Democrat in the officially nonpartisan Legislature, Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln.",
      "Raybould, whose family owns several grocery store chains in the state, was also the main sponsor of another bill that sought to restrict a voter-backed minimum wage law. That bill suffered an unexpected defeat earlier this session when a freshman lawmaker failed to show up for a vote on it. Raybould's attempt to attach it to the paid sick leave measure on Wednesday also failed.",
      "By a nearly 3-to-1 margin, Nebraska voters in November approved a ballot measure that requires all Nebraska employers to provide at least some paid sick leave to their employees.",
      "The ballot language, which had been set to take effect Oct. 1, required businesses to provide workers with one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked, up to seven days at businesses with more than 20 employees. Employees at smaller businesses could accrue up to five days\u2019 worth of paid sick leave a year. The leave could be used for the employees themselves or to tend to a family member.",
      "But the bill passed Wednesday and expected to be signed into law by Gov. Jim Pillen carves out exceptions. It allows businesses to withhold paid sick leave from 14- and 15-year-olds, as well as from temporary and seasonal agricultural workers. Businesses with 10 or fewer employees would not need to provide paid sick leave at all.",
      "More concerning, opponents say, is a provision that strips from the new law the ability of workers to sue employers who retaliate against them for using paid sick leave. The removal of that enforcement language would \u201cessentially gut\u201d the paid leave measure, said Sen. John Cavanaugh, who opposed the bill. Cavanaugh reiterated that paid sick leave received nearly 75% approval \u2014 more support than most lawmakers got at the polls.",
      "\u201cThe voters wanted this more than they wanted you here,\u201d he said, addressing fellow lawmakers. \u201cThis is about respect for the will of the voters.\u201d",
      "Nebraska joins other states leading efforts to counter voter-approved policies on everything from paid sick leave to abortion. Some states are seeking to limit the voter initiative process itself, leading to pushback from voters.",
      "Supporters of the Nebraska paid sick leave rollback say they're seeking to protect both workers and businesses. Raybould has said throughout debate this session that teens under 16 will find themselves unable to get an after-school or summer job without changes to both minimum wage and paid sick leave measures. She says no one will hire teens with limited experience and federal child labor restrictions at $15 per hour \u2014 the minimum wage set to take effect Jan. 1.",
      "\u201cWe have to find that balance between business and labor,\u201d Raybould said during debate Wednesday. \u201cWe have to be competitive, and we have to be flexible.\u201d",
      "Others went further, with Republican Sen. Mike Jacobson saying that government telling businesses what wages and benefits they must offer employees \u201cthreatens democracy.\u201d If employees don't like the terms of their employment, he said, it's incumbent on them to find a different job.",
      "Sen. Robert Hallstrom is another Republican who supported restrictions on both the minimum wage and paid sick leave. He said the Legislature has the right to make changes to voter-backed measures, asking if young or seasonal workers who would be affected by those changes would \u201crather have a $10-an-hour job or no job?\u201d",
      "The Paid Sick Leave for Nebraskans coalition, which was behind the effort to get paid sick leave on the Nebraska ballot last year, said the bill passed Wednesday would remove paid sick leave protections for 140,000 workers in the state.",
      "\u201cDespite thousands of Nebraskans demanding that our Legislature honor the clear will of voters, 33 senators ignored those calls yet again today,\" the coalition said in a statement. \"It will prevent thousands of Nebraskans from being able to access the good life.\u201d",

      "Businesses that have been unsettled by President Donald Trump\u2019s on again, off again tariffs don't know how much faith to put in the reprieve from a federal court that halted most of the taxes on foreign imports",
      "NEW YORK -- Businesses that have been unsettled by President Donald Trump's on again, off again tariffs grappled Thursday with how much faith to put in the latest reprieve, which came from a federal court that halted most of the taxes on foreign imports.",
      "A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled late Wednesday that Trump overstepped his authority when he invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare a national emergency as justification for his wide-ranging tariffs.",
      "The Trump administration has filed a notice of appeal and requested an emergency stay that would keep the tariffs in place during ongoing legal proceedings that are widely expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Business owners and the National Retail Federation said that without a definitive word in the case, the New York-based trade court's ruling only creates more uncertainty and makes it harder to budget and plan orders.",
      "\u201cThe ruling by the U.S. Court of International Trade blocking most of President Trump\u2019s tariffs is just another chapter in this difficult journey toward a clear, consistent and strategic trade policy,\" Jonathan Gold, the trade group's vice president of supply chain and customs policy, said in an emailed statement. \"We urge rapid resolution as this process continues in the courts.\u201d",
      "The president invoked the emergency powers law in early April when he imposed varying import tax rates on products from dozens of countries, including the biggest trading partners of the U.S. After financial markets showed signs of panic, Trump lowered the rate to 10% for every country except China, whose goods were taxed at 145%.",
      "Jonathan Silva, the owner of WS Game Company, said he did not intend to change his plans based on the ruling. He has the board games his company sells made in China,",
      "\u201cWe know that this will take time for the appeals process to take place and a final ruling to be instituted,\u201d Silva said. \u201cBut we are hopeful that this will be the beginning of a more academic use of tariffs in the coming months and years. All we want to do is have certainty in the environment that we are operating in, as the day-to-day retaliations and pauses are not conducive to business operations.\u201d",
      "The CEO of electronics retailer Best Buy, Corie Barry, told reporters on Thursday that the legal news did not make her more or less optimistic but rather underscored the importance of continuing to remain agile while not changing course in response to near-daily tariff developments.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything we would do differently based on the news overnight,\u201d Barry said. \u201cWhat I really tried to work with the team on is to not actually overreact to any given moment in time, but instead to stay maniacally focused on our customers and ensure we are bringing the right assortment, price, and (promotions) to them, whatever the backdrop.\u201d",
      "Barry told analysts that Best Buy has taken a variety of steps to offset higher tariff costs, including pushing vendors to spread out where they do manufacturing. The company is increasing some prices to absorb tariff-related costs, she said, calling the move \u201ca last resort.\u201d She declined to be specific given the fluid situation.",
      "Jim Umlauf, whose business, 4Knines, based in Oklahoma City, makes vehicle seat covers and cargo liners for dog owners and others, said the court ruling did not offer reassurance but only further complicated his decision-making.",
      "\u201cAt this point, we don\u2019t know whether the decision will hold, whether it applies to (Trump's) original 2018 tariffs, or how it will be enforced,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout clarity, we\u2019re left planning around a moving target. Like many others, we\u2019ve already locked in quotes and made purchasing decisions assuming tariffs would remain in place. This development, rather than offering relief, introduces new logistical complications at the worst possible time.\u201d",
      "Kelsey O\u2019Callaghan, the founder of a Salt Lake City kitchen and bathroom accessories company called Dorai Home, said she expected the trade war to continue. The constant flux since Trump's return to office has made her \u201cnumb,\u201d but O'Callaghan said she has tried to make educated decisions.",
      "The company already postponed the launch of several new products, laid off the CEO and some other key employees. It paused order shipments from China in early April but resumed some on a staggered basis when the president Trump lowered the rate for Chinese goods to 30% for 90 days.",
      "Now, Dorai Home plans to test price increases to see if shoppers will still buy its products.",
      "\u201cIn a business sense, you have to try to create as much certainty and stability as you can with the variables you can control,\" O\u2019Callaghan said.",
      "But some businesses were more optimistic. Burlington Coat Factory CEO Michael B. O\u2019Sullivan said Thursday that the tariff pause might help discount retailers like his that buy excess inventory from other retail companies.",
      "The court ruling and continued uncertainty may further fuel a production race that started when the tariff rate for Chinese products were substantially reduced, O'Sullivan said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s now a huge rush on production and shipping across the industry. Now, the court decision last night could add to that rush,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of shortages, this topsy-turvy stop/start surge has the potential to create attractive buying opportunities.\u201d",

      "The meeting comes as Trump has assailed Powell for not reducing the Fed\u2019s key interest rate, calling him \u201cToo Late Powell.\u201d The president initiated the meeting, the Fed said.",
      "Trump argues that there is \u201cno inflation\u201d and so Powell should cut rates, though such a move might not necessarily reduce the borrowing costs consumers face. Inflation is down substantially from a year ago, yet it remains above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. Trump has also called Powell a \u201cfool\u201d and earlier this year suggested he would fire the Fed chair.",
      "After financial markets reacted negatively, Trump said he had \u201cno intention\u201d of removing Powell, whose term as chair ends in May 2026.",
      "The meeting is the first during Trump\u2019s second term, though the two met and had lunch together in his first term. Fed chairs regularly meet with Treasury secretaries but less often with presidents, given that the Fed\u2019s interest rate decisions are intended to be separate from political concerns.",
      "Earlier this month, Powell said he had never requested a meeting with a president and added, \u201cI never will,\u201d suggesting it was inappropriate given the Fed's political independence.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t imagine myself doing that,\" Powell said at a press conference May 7. \u201cIt\u2019s always\u2014comes the other way: A President wants to meet with you.\u201d",

      "Cambodian restaurants are not in every U.S. city the way Chinese and Japanese ones are",
      "Chef Phila Lorn was not necessarily aiming for \u201cquote-unquote authentic\u201d Cambodian food when he opened Mawn in his native Philadelphia two years ago. So when he approached some Cambodian teen patrons, he braced himself for questioning.",
      "\u201cSomeone\u2019s going to say something like, \u2018That\u2019s not how my mom makes her oxtail soup,'\u201d Lorn said. \"So I walk up to the table. I\u2019m like, \u2018How is everything?\u2019 And the kid looks up to me and he goes, \u2018It doesn\u2019t even matter, dude. So glad you\u2019re here.\u2019\u201d",
      "It was at that moment that Lorn realized Mawn \u2014 the phonetic spelling of the Khmer word for \u201cchicken\u201d \u2014 was more than a noodle shop. It meant representation.",
      "In June, he will be representing his dual cultures \u2014 Cambodian and Philly \u2014 at his first James Beard Awards, as a nominee for Best Emerging Chef. In the food world, it's akin to getting nominated for the Academy Awards.",
      "Cambodian restaurants may not be as commonplace in the U.S. as Chinese takeout or sushi spots. And Cambodian food is often lazily lumped in with the food of its Southeast Asian neighbors, despite its own distinctness. But in recent years, enterprising Cambodian American chefs have come into their own, introducing traditional dishes or putting their own twist on them.",
      "Many of them were raised in families who fled the Khmer Rouge's reign of terror, which began 50 years ago and killed about 1.7 million people. Since then, the Cambodian community in the U.S. has grown and set down roots.",
      "Through food, these chefs are putting the attention back on Cambodian heritage and culture, rather than that traumatic history.",
      "Dr. Leakhena Nou, a sociology professor at California State University, Long Beach who has studied social anxiety among post-Khmer Rouge generations, says the Cambodian diaspora is often seen by others too narrowly through the lens of victimhood. In 2022, she publicly opposed California legislation that focused only on genocide for a K-12 curriculum on Cambodian culture.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a part of their history so they shouldn\u2019t run away from it but at the same time they should force others to understand that that\u2019s not the only part of their heritage, their historical identity,\u201d she said.",
      "Cambodian food has sometimes been hastily labeled as a mild mix of Thai and Vietnamese with some Chinese and Indian influence. But, it has its own native spices and flavors that have been used throughout Southeast Asia. Khmer food emphasizes seafood and meats, vegetables, noodles, rice and fermentation. Salty and sour are prevalent tastes, Nou says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s actually a very healthy diet for the most part in terms of fresh vegetables. Cambodians love to eat fresh vegetables dipped with some sauce,\" Nou said.",
      "Signature dishes include amok, a fish curry; lok lak, stir-fried marinated beef; and samlar koko, a soup made using seasonal produce. Nou recalls her father making it with pork bone broth, fish, fresh coconut milk, lemongrass, vegetables and even wildflowers.",
      "It was a half-century ago, on April 15, 1975, that the communist Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia. For the next four years, an estimated one-quarter of the population was wiped out due to starvation, execution and illness.",
      "Refugees came in waves to the U.S. in the 1970s and 1980s. Most took on low-level entry jobs with few language barriers, Nou said. These included manufacturing, meatpacking and agricultural labor. Many worked in Chinese restaurants and doughnut shops.",
      "The U.S. Cambodian population has jumped 50% in the last 20 years to an estimated 360,000 people, according to the Census 2023 American Community Survey.",
      "Lorn\u2019s family settled in Philadelphia in 1985. The only child born in the U.S., he was named after the city (but pronounced pee-LAH\u2019). Like a lot of Asian American kids, Lorn was \u201cthe smelly kid\u201d teased for not-American food in his lunch. But, he said, defending his lunchbox made him stronger. And he got the last laugh.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s cool now to be 38 and have that same lunchbox (food) but on plates and we\u2019re selling it for $50 a plate,\u201d said Lorn, who opened Mawn with wife Rachel after they both had worked at other restaurants.",
      "Indeed, besides popular noodle soups, Mawn has plates like the $60 steak and prohok, a 20-ounce ribeye with Cambodian chimichurri. Prohok is Cambodian fermented fish paste. Lorn\u2019s version has lime juice, kulantro, Thai eggplants and roasted mudfish.",
      "It sounds unappetizing, Lorn admits, \u201cbut everyone who takes a piece of rare steak, dips and eats it is just like, \u2018OK, so let me know more about this food.'\u201d",
      "May, which is Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month and when Cambodia conducts a Day of Remembrance, is also when Long Beach has Cambodian Restaurant Week. The city is home to the largest concentration of Cambodians outside of Cambodia.",
      "Chad Phuong, operator of Battambong BBQ pop-up, was a participant.",
      "Phuong came to Long Beach as a child after fleeing the Khmer Rouge, which murdered his father. After high school, he worked at a Texas slaughterhouse and learned about cutting meats and barbecue. In 2020, he pivoted from working in the medical field to grilling.",
      "Known as \u201cCambodian Cowboy,\" he has been profiled locally and nationally for brisket, ribs and other meats using a dry rub with Cambodian Kampot pepper, \u201cone of the most expensive black peppers in the world.\" There's also sausage with fermented rice and sides like coconut corn.",
      "The pitmaster recently started mentoring younger vendors. Contributing to the community feels like building a legacy.",
      "\u201cIt just gives me a lot of courage to present my food,\u201d Phuong said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to talk about the past or the trauma. Yes, it happened, but we\u2019re moving on. We want something better.\u201d",
      "More Cambodian-run establishments have flourished. In 2023, Lowell, Massachusetts, mayor Sokhary Chau, the country\u2019s first Cambodian American mayor, awarded a citation to Red Rose restaurant for being a Beard semifinalist. This year, Koffeteria bakery in Houston, Sophon restaurant in Seattle and chef Nite Yun of San Francisco\u2019s Lunette Cambodia earned semifinalist nods.",
      "Lorn, an admirer of San Francisco's Yun, says he still feels imposter syndrome.",
      "\u201cI feel like I\u2019m more Ray Liotta than Nite Yun,\u201d said Lorn. \u201cWhether we win or not, to me, honestly, I won already.\"",
      "Meanwhile, he is preparing to open a Southeast Asian oyster bar called Sao. It's not intended to be Cambodian, just a reflection of him.",
      "\u201cI don't want to be pigeonholed,\" Lorn said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not me turning from my people. It's just me keeping it real for my people.\u201d",

      "TOKYO -- Japanese Prime Minsiter Shigeru Ishiba on Thursday showed his determination to defend rules-based free and multilateral trade systems and take a leadership role to expand the Asia-Pacific trade group at a time of deepening tensions and divisions over U.S. tariffs and trade wars.",
      "\u201cHigh tariffs will not bring economic prosperity,\" Ishiba told a global forum in Tokyo. \"A prosperity built on sacrifices by someone or another country will not make a strong economy.\"",
      "Japan seeks to work with the U.S. on investment, job creation and manufacturing high quality products for the prosperity of America and the rest of the world, he said.",

      "Ishiba also called on other countries in Asia, a global hub of growth, to show \u201cthe importance of rules-based, free and fair economic order,\" and said the way to demonstrate it is the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or CPTPP.",
      "Ishiba pledged Japan will work toward further expanding and upgrading the framework, which not only contributes to the economy but also to peace and prosperity.",
      "The 12-nation CPTPP includes Japan, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. The U.S. is not a member.",

      "Major League Baseball is investing in Athletes Unlimited to support its softball league that will debut next month, marking the first time MLB will have a comprehensive partnership with a professional women\u2019s sports league.",
      "MLB said Thursday it was making a strategic investment in the Athletes Unlimited Softball League of an undisclosed amount for operational costs and a commitment to help it gain visibility in various ways, including assistance with content, marketing and sales, events, distribution, editorial, and digital and social platforms. That includes marketing the AUSL and its athletes during MLB's All-Star Game and throughout the postseason.",
      "\u201cThis is something we\u2019re really excited about,\u201d MLB commissioner Rob Manfred told The Associated Press. \u201cWe studied the space hard. We think it\u2019s a real opportunity and we\u2019re excited to be involved.\u201d",
      "Athletes Unlimited has featured softball since 2020, when it unveiled a unique format that crowned an individual champion. The company will launch a league with a traditional, team-based format starting June 7 and will keep its individual format for the AUSL All-Star Cup that follows.",
      "Manfred noted that interest in women\u2019s sports had \u201cescalated significantly\u201d in recent years and his league had been looking for ways to get more involved, including the possible launch of its own softball league. He said Athletes Unlimited\u2019s overall success and its strong infrastructure helped make the decision to collaborate easier.",
      "\u201cWe thought rather than starting on our own and competing, that finding a place where we could invest and grow a business was a better opportunity for us,\u201d Manfred said.",
      "Kim Ng, a former Major League Baseball executive, signed on as an adviser with the AUSL and was promoted to commissioner in April. Ng is the former general manager of the Miami Marlins, the first female GM in any of the major U.S. pro sports leagues, and has three World Series rings from a combined 21 years in the front offices of the Chicago White Sox, New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "\u201cAs the process moved forward and it looked like we were going to make an investment, they hired Kim, and we had a long relationship with Kim, and it just added additional comfort to the idea of making the investment,\u201d Manfred said.",
      "Athletes Unlimited co-founder Jon Patricof said MLB\u2019s commitment to increasing the AUSL\u2019s visibility is as important as the financial investment.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re committed to really elevating the AUSL,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably about one of the most difficult things for any sports league to do which is to get visibility and break through to new audiences, and I think MLB is already doing that for the AUSL, and there\u2019s going to be a lot more to come.\u201d",
      "Women\u2019s pro softball leagues and independent teams have come and gone over the years, but none have offered a consistent option for women to have a stable future in the sport.",
      "It appears that might change, with the help of softball greats Cat Osterman, Jennie Finch, Jessica Mendoza and Natasha Watley as AUSL advisors. On June 7, the Bandits and Talons will open with a three-game series in Rosemont, Illinois, and the Blaze and Volts will start off with a three-game series in Wichita, Kansas. The four teams will play 24 games this season as touring properties that will play games in 12 cities. The top two teams will compete in the AUSL Championship, a best-of-three series July 26-28 in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.",
      "Patricof said the league plans to expand to six teams next season and be city based.",
      "MLB already supports several women's softball and baseball initiatives, including a partnership with USA Softball and operation of the MLB Develops girls baseball pipeline. It is not involved with the upstart Women's Professional Baseball League, which plans to launch in 2026 as the first pro baseball league for women since the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League \u2014 of \"A League of Their Own\" fame \u2014 folded in 1954.",
      "Manfred said he sees a bright future ahead for AUSL.",
      "\u201cI fully expect that they will expand, and we hope that we will end up with a league that is sustainable on its own, a good investment for us, and a partner in growing diamond sports internationally,\u201d he said.",
      "Patricof said the partnership with MLB and the already existing relationship between the Athletes Unlimited and USA Softball combine to help give the AUSL stability.",
      "\u201cAs we announce MLB coming into the fold formally into what we\u2019re doing with the AUSL, you really see a full alignment of this sport behind this league, and that I think is exciting for everyone,\u201d Patricof said. \u201cPeople who have sat on the sidelines or maybe have watched pro softball from a little bit of distance \u2014 everybody\u2019s now jumped in, and I think that is an exciting moment for people who\u2019ve been around this sport.\u201d",

      "Deputy Minister for Migration Nicholas Ioannides said that a prerequisite for families to qualify for the program is that they must drop their claims for asylum or rescind international protection status already granted to them prior to Dec. 31, 2024.",
      "Unveiling the program, Ioannides said that families wishing to voluntarily return will be given a one-off sum of 2,000 euros ($2,255) for one adult and 1,000 euros ($1,128) for each child. Childless couples are also eligible to apply. The application period runs from June 2 to Aug. 31.",

      "\u201cThis new program is a targeted, humanitarian and realistic policy that bolsters Syria\u2019s post-war transition to normality,\u201d Ioannides said, adding that European Home Affairs Commissioner Magnus Brunner considers the program as a potential example for other European Union member countries to follow.",
      "Meanwhile, Ioannides repeated that a 2009 Search and Rescue agreement that Cyprus has with Syria enables Cypriot authorities to send back boatloads of Syrian migrants trying to reach the island nation after they\u2019re rescued in international waters.",
      "Ioannides said that two inflatable boats each loaded with 30 Syrian migrants were turned back in line with the bilateral agreement after being rescued when they transmitted that they were in danger.",

    "story": [
      "A new analysis finds that more than $14 billion in clean energy projects in the U.S. have been canceled this year",
      "More than $14 billion in clean energy investments in the U.S. have been canceled or delayed this year, according to an analysis released Thursday, as President Donald Trump's pending megabill has raised fears over the future of domestic battery, electric vehicle and solar and wind energy development.",
      "Many companies are concerned that investments will be in jeopardy amid House Republicans' passage of a tax bill that would gut clean energy credits, nonpartisan group E2 said in its analysis of projects that it and consultancy Atlas Public Policy tracked.",
      "The groups estimate the losses since January have also cost 10,000 new clean energy jobs.",
      "The tax credits, bolstered in the landmark climate bill passed under former President Joe Biden in 2022, are crucial for boosting renewable technologies key to the clean energy transition. E2 estimates that $132 billion in plans have been announced since the so-called Inflation Reduction Act passed, not counting the cancellations.",
      "Last week's House bill effectively renders moot many of the law\u2019s incentives. Advocacy groups decried the potential impact that could have on the industry after the multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package passed.",
      "\u201cThe House\u2019s plan coupled with the administration\u2019s focus on stomping out clean energy and returning us to a country powered by coal and gas guzzlers is causing businesses to cancel plans, delay their plans and take their money and jobs to other countries instead,\u201d E2 executive director Bob Keefe said.",
      "The Senate is now reviewing the bill with an informal July 4 deadline to get it to the president's desk.",
      "Some of the most recent cancellations include the Kore Power battery factory in Arizona and BorgWarner\u2019s closure of two EV manufacturing sites in Michigan. Bosch suspended a $200 million investment in a hydrogen fuel cell factory in South Carolina, citing changes within the market over the past year in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "Tariffs, inflationary pressures, nascent company struggles and low adoption rates for some technologies may also have been reasons for these companies\u2019 plans changing. For instance, the battery storage and electric vehicle sectors have seen the most impact in 2025, with the latter especially having had had a difficult past few years. Several projects spurred by the IRA were also canceled prior to 2025.",
      "Of the projects canceled this year, most \u2014 more than $12 billion worth \u2014 came in Republican-led states and congressional districts, the analysis said. Red districts have benefited more than blue ones from an influx of clean energy development and jobs, experts say.",
      "Georgia and Tennessee are particularly at risk because they are highly invested in EV and battery production, said Marilyn Brown, an energy policy professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in the analysis.",
      "\u201cIf all of a sudden these tax credits are removed, I\u2019m not sure how these ongoing projects are going to continue,\u201d said Fengqi You, an engineering professor at Cornell University who also was not involved.",
      "A handful of Republican lawmakers have urged the continuation of energy tax credits, with some saying in an April letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. that a repeal could disrupt the American people and weaken the county's position as a global energy leader.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to dismantle much of Biden's environmental and climate-related policy \u2014 what he calls the Democrats\u2019 \u201cgreen new scam\u201d \u2014 withdrawing again from the Paris climate agreement, rolling back countless landmark pollution regulations and environmental initiatives, reconsidering scientific findings supporting climate action, blocking renewable energy sources and more in an effort to bolster a fossil fuel-led \u201cAmerican energy dominance\u201d agenda.",
      "Meanwhile other countries are proceeding with green investments. The European Parliament is committing to the European Union Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a policy meant to prevent \u201ccarbon leakage,\u201d or companies moving production to countries where climate policies are less strict. And the International Maritime Organization is moving toward a global carbon tax on shipping.",
      "In a sign that not all hope is lost for the future of renewables in the U.S., April alone saw nearly $500 million in new development, with Japanese manufacturing company Hitachi's energy arm building out transformer manufacturing in Virginia and materials and technology company Corning investing in solar manufacturing in Michigan.",
      "Still, $4.5 billion in development was canceled or delayed last month, according to E2's tally.",

      "The verdict against central bank Gov. Peter Ka\u017eim\u00edr was issued by Judge Milan Cisarik at the country\u2019s Special Criminal Court in Pezinok.",
      "Ka\u017eim\u00edr's attorneys argued that he should have been acquitted because of the recent changes in Slovakia's penal code, which reduced punishment for corruption and that recently ended a number of corruption cases and trials.",

      "At the time, Ka\u017eim\u00edr was acquiring a luxury villa located in an upscale neighborhood of Bratislava, the capital, from the owner of the companies.",
      "Ka\u017eim\u00edr, who pleaded not guilty, had previously said that he considered the charges to be illegal and fabricated.",
      "The case dates to when Ka\u017eim\u00edr served as finance minister in the leftist government of populist Prime Minister Robert Fico from 2012 to 2019. He was a member of Fico\u2019s Smer, or Direction, party before taking the central bank job.",
      "Smer lost the 2020 general election and was replaced by a coalition government whose parties campaigned on an anti-corruption ticket.",

      "In February 2024, lawmakers loyal to Fico\u2019s new coalition government approved changes to the penal code and eliminated the office of the special prosecutor that deals with major crime and corruption.",
      "The legislation faced sharp criticism at home and abroad while thousands of Slovaks repeatedly took to the streets to protest.",
      "The changes include a reduction in punishments for corruption and some other crimes, including the possibility of suspended sentences, and a significant shortening of the statute of limitations.",

      "An alleged kidnapping in New York is the latest instance in which authorities say cryptocurrency-related crimes have involved real-world violence",
      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- A man says he was tortured for weeks in a New York townhouse. Another in Paris was held for ransom and his finger cut off. A couple in Connecticut were carjacked, beaten and thrown into a van.",
      "All, authorities allege, were victims tied to cryptocurrency-related crimes that have spilled out from behind computer screens and into the real world as the largely unregulated currency surges in value.",
      "While crypto thefts are not new, the use of physical violence is a far more recent trend, said John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas in Austin who tracks financial crimes.",
      "\u201cI think this kind of physical violence is a natural manifestation of the emboldened nature of crypto activities,\u201d he said. \u201cThings that might clearly be outside of social norms in other spaces \u2014 like robbing a bank \u2014 are somehow just part of the game here.\u201d",
      "In the New York case, two American crypto investors \u2014 John Woeltz and William Duplessie \u2014 have been arrested on kidnapping and assault charges in recent days after a 28-year-old Italian man told police they tortured him for weeks to get his Bitcoin password. Attorneys for both men declined to comment.",
      "While the allegations are still emerging, they come just weeks after 13 people were indicted on federal charges in Washington, D.C., accused of combining computer hacking and money laundering with old-fashioned impersonation and burglary to steal more than $260 million from victims\u2019 cryptocurrency accounts.",
      "Some are accused of hacking websites and servers to steal cryptocurrency databases and identify targets, but others are alleged to have broken into victims\u2019 homes to steal their \u201chardware wallets\u201d \u2014 devices that provide access to their crypto accounts.",
      "The case stemmed from an investigation that started after a couple in Connecticut last year were forced out of a Lamborghini SUV, assaulted and bound in the back of a van. Authorities allege the incident was a ransom plot targeting the couple\u2019s son \u2014 who they say helped steal more than $240 million worth of Bitcoin from a single victim. The son has not been charged, but is being detained on an unspecified \u201cfederal misdemeanor offense\u201d charge, according to online jail records. Police stopped the carjacking and arrested six men.",
      "Meanwhile in France, kidnappings of wealthy cryptocurrency holders and their relatives in ransom plots have spooked the industry.",
      "Attackers recently kidnapped the father of a crypto entrepreneur while he was out walking his dog, and sent videos to the son including one showing the dad's finger being severed as they demanded millions of euros in ransom, prosecutors allege. Police freed the father and arrested several suspects.",
      "Earlier this year, men in masks attempted to drag the daughter of Pierre Noizat, the CEO and a founder of the Bitcoin exchange platform Paymium, into a van, but were thwarted by a shopkeeper armed with a fire extinguisher.",
      "And in January, the co-founder of French crypto-wallet firm Ledger, David Balland, and his wife were also kidnapped for ransom from their home in the region of Cher of central France. They also were rescued by police and 10 people were arrested.",
      "The FBI recently released its 2024 internet crime report that tallied nearly 860,000 complaints of suspected internet crime and a record $16.6 billion in reported losses \u2014 a 33% increase in losses compared with 2023.",
      "As a group, cryptocurrency theft victims reported the most losses \u2014 more than $6.5 billion",
      "The agency and experts say the crypto crime underworld is likely being fueled by the large amounts of money at stake \u2013 combined with weak regulation of cryptocurrency that allows many transactions to be made without identity documents.",
      "Violence may be increasing for several reasons including that criminals believe they can get away with crypto theft because transactions are hard to trace and often cloaked by anonymity, according to the crypto tracing firm TRM Labs. And crypto holders are getting easier to identify because of the prevalence of personal information online and people flaunting their crypto wealth on social media, the firm says.",
      "Phil Ariss, TRM Labs\u2019 director of UK public sector relations, said crypto also may be attracting criminal groups that have long used violence.",
      "\u201cAs long as there\u2019s a viable route to launder or liquidate stolen assets, it makes little difference to the offender whether the target is a high-value watch or a crypto wallet,\u201d Ariss said in a statement. \u201cCryptocurrency is now firmly in the mainstream, and as a result, our traditional understanding of physical threat and robbery needs to evolve accordingly.\"",

      "MIRAMAR BEACH, Fla. -- On the one hand, what this new version of cash-infused college sports needs are rules that everybody follows.",
      "On the other, they need to be able to enforce those rules without getting sued into oblivion.",
      "Enter the College Sports Commission, a newly created operation that will be in charge of counting the money, deciding what a \u201cfair market\u201d deal for players looks like and, if things go well, helping everyone in the system avoid trips to court whenever a decision comes down that someone doesn\u2019t like.",
      "With name, image, likeness payments taking over in college, this group will essentially become what the NCAA committee on infractions used to be \u2013 the college sports police, only with the promise of being faster, maybe fairer and maybe more transparent.",
      "In a signal of what the CSC's most serious mission might be, the schools from the four biggest conferences are being asked to sign a document pledging not to rely on state laws \u2013 some of which are more permissive of payments to players -- to work around the rules the commission is making.",
      "\u201cWe need to get out of this situation where something happens, and we run to our attorney general and file suit,\u201d said Trev Alberts of Texas A&M, one of 10 athletic directors who are part of another group, the Settlement Implementation Committee, that is helping oversee the transition. \u201cThat chaos isn\u2019t sustainable. You\u2019re looking for a durable system that actually has some stability and ultimate fairness.\u201d",
      "In this new landsacpe, two different companies will be in charge of two kinds of number crunching.",
      "The first, and presumably more straightforward, is data being compiled by LBi Software, which will track how much schools are spending on every athlete, up to the $20.5 million cap each is allowed to distribute in the first year of the new arrangement expected to begin July 1.",
      "This sounds easy but comes with the assumption that universities \u2013 which, for decades, have sought to eke out every edge they can, rulebook or no \u2013 will provide accurate data.",
      "\u201cOver history, boosters have looked for ways to give their schools an advantage,\u201d said Gabe Feldman, a sports law professor at Tulane. \u201cI think that will continue even with the settlement. It's anyone's guess as to how that manifests, and what the new competitive landscape looks like.\u201d",
      "Adding some level of transparency to the process, along with the CSC's ability to deliver sanctions if it identifies cheaters, will be key to the new venture's success.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s legal risk that prohibits you from doing that,\u201d Alberts said. \u201cBut we want to start as transparent as we can be, because we think it engenders trust.\u201d",
      "Good intentions aside, Alberts concedes, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s illogical to think that, at first, it\u2019s probably going to be a little wonky.\u201d",
      "Some of the wonkiest bookkeeping figures to come from the second category of number crunching, and that involves third-party NIL deals. The CSC hired Deloitte to run a so-called clearinghouse called \u201cNIL Go,\" which will be in charge of evaluating third-party deals worth $600 or more.",
      "Because these deals aren\u2019t allowed to pay players simply for playing \u2013 that\u2019s still technically forbidden in college sports -- but instead for some service they provide (an endorsement, a social media shoutout and so forth), every deal needs to be evaluated to show it is worth a fair price for what the player is doing.",
      "In a sobering revelation, Deloitte shared with sports leaders earlier this month that around 70% of third-party deals given to players since NIL became allowable in 2021 would have been denied by the new clearinghouse.",
      "All these valuations, of course, are subject to interpretation. It\u2019s much easier to set the price of a stock, or a bicycle, than the value of an athlete\u2019s endorsement deal. This is where things figure to get dicey. Though the committee has an appeals process, then an arbitration process, ultimately, some of these cases are destined to be challenged in court.",
      "\u201cYou're just waiting to see, what is a \u2018valid business purpose\u2019 (for an NIL deal), and what are the guidelines around that?\" said Rob Lang, a business litigation partner at Thompson Coburn who deals with sports cases. \u201cYou can see all the lawyer fights coming out of that.\u201d",
      "In fact, elements of all this are ripe to be challenged in court, which might explain why the power conferences drafted the document pledging fealty to the new rules in the first place.",
      "For instance, Feldman called a law recently enacted in Tennessee viewed by many as the most athlete-friendly statute in the country \u201cthe next step in the evolution\" of state efforts to bar the NCAA from limiting NIL compensation for athletes with an eye on winning battles for recruits and retaining roster talent.",
      "\u201cWhat we've seen over the last few years is states trying to one-up each other to make their institutions more attractive places for people to go,\" he said. \u201cThis is the next iteration of that. It may set up a showdown between the schools, the NCAA and the states.\u201d",
      "Greg Sankey, the commissioner of the Southeastern Conference, said a league spanning 12 states cannot operate well if all those states have different rules about how and when it is legal to pay players.",
      "The SEC has been drafting legislation for states to pass to unify the rules across the conference. Ultimately, Sankey and a lot of other people would love to see a national law passed by Congress that does that for all states and all conferences.",
      "That will take months, if not years, which is why the new committee drafted the document for the schools to sign.",
      "\u201cWe are all defendant schools and conferences and you inherently agree to this,\u201d Alberts said of the document. \u201cI sat in the room with all of our football coaches, \u2018Do you want to be governed?\u2019 The answer is \u2018yes.\u2019\u201d",

      "ERIN, Wis. -- Jinhee Im, A Lim Kim, Yealimi Noh and Rio Takeda each carded 4-under 68 to tie for the lead after the morning groupings Thursday in the first round of the U.S. Women\u2019s Open at Erin Hills.",
      "Those scores are notable because only two players finished under par in last year\u2019s U.S. Women\u2019s Open at Lancaster Country Club in Pennsylvania, with Yuka Saso posting a winning four-round total of 4-under 276. Saso, who is seeking her third U.S. Women's Open title, posted a 74 on Thursday.",
      "Noh said the low scores at the 6,829-yard, par-72 course didn\u2019t surprise her. Erin Hills' difficulty often is based on the strength of the wind, and it was relatively calm early Thursday.",
      "\u201cThere are some tees out that are pulled up, and a lot of the par-5s, I think all of them are reachable,\u201d Noh said. \u201cSome par-3s were shorter than normal. So, I think for sure, with the minimal wind today, it was definitely a good scoring day.\u201d",
      "Kim, 29, is seeking her second U.S. Women\u2019s Open title after winning this event in 2020 at Champions Golf Club in Houston. She's the only golfer among the four leaders who already has won a U.S. Women\u2019s Open.",
      "Takeda started at No. 10 and made six birdies in a nine-hole stretch from No. 14 through No. 4 to make up for her bogeys at No. 17 and No. 2. Noh benefited from an eagle at No. 14, a par-5, 510-yard hole. Im had a bogey-free round that included four birdies in a span of five holes from No. 10 through No. 14. Kim made birdie putts of 42\u00bd feet on No. 1 and 32\u00bd feet on No. 4.",
      "\u201cThat course condition is really good,\u201d Im said. \u201cI think green speed is really, really fast, but not firm. So if I can hit the fairway, I can (get) the birdie chance.\u201d",
      "Chisato Iwai was fifth with a 69. Hinako Shibuno, Maja Stark and Pajaree Anannarukarn each posted a 70.",
      "\u201cIt was nice that today\u2019s wind is not as bad as the practice rounds,\u201d Shibuno said. \u201cAlso, that yesterday\u2019s rain was helpful. I think when it went on the green that the ball should stop, it stopped. So that was good.\u201d",
      "Jeeno Thitikul, the world\u2019s second-ranked player, carded a 75. She started at No. 10 and bogeyed four of her first six holes, including three straight from No. 11 through No. 13. She bounced back by making three consecutive birdies on No. 18, No. 1 and No. 2, then bogeyed No. 4 and No. 9.",
      "Lydia Ko, who is ranked third in the world, posted a 73 that included a double bogey on the par-5 No. 1.",
      "This year\u2019s U.S. Women\u2019s Open comes during a season notable for its balance \u2014 there has been a different winner at each of the LPGA Tour\u2019s 12 events. As the most lucrative tournament of the season, the U.S. Women\u2019s Open features a $12 million purse, with $2.4 million going to the winner.",

      "LONDON -- A driver who injured nearly 80 people when his car rammed into a crowd of Liverpool soccer fans celebrating their team\u2019s Premier League championship was charged Thursday with intentionally causing grievous bodily harm and six other serious counts, a prosecutor said.",
      "Paul Doyle, 53, was also charged with dangerous driving and five other counts alleging different variations of causing grievous bodily harm, Prosecutor Sarah Hammond said. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted.",
      "The people injured ranged in age from 9 to 78, with at least 50 treated at hospitals. Seven people remained in the hospital Thursday in stable condition.",
      "The charges did not indicate how many victims the counts were tied to but Hammond said the investigation was at an early stage as police review a huge volume of evidence, including videos and eyewitness statements.",
      "\u201cIt is important to ensure that every victim gets the justice they deserve,\u201d Hammond said.",
      "The city had been celebrating Liverpool\u2019s record-tying 20th title when the driver turned down a street full of fans and joy quickly turned to tragedy.",

      "Coco Gauff has managed to move into the French Open's third round despite some shaky serving",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Coco Gauff kept getting herself in some trouble with shaky serving in the French Open's second round, and she kept putting herself back in position to win by breaking right back Thursday.",
      "The second-seeded Gauff, pursuing her first title at Roland-Garros, eliminated 172nd-ranked qualifier Tereza Valentova of the Czech Republic 6-2, 6-4 in 75 minutes on a partly cloudy, warm afternoon in Court Suzanne-Lenglen.",
      "Amid a soundtrack of sirens from nearby streets and roars from nearby courts, 2023 U.S. Open champion Gauff only managed to produce 11 winners, five fewer than her far-less-experienced opponent. Gauff also finished with 23 unforced errors, a total that included a half-dozen double-faults.",
      "Against Valentova, an 18-year-old who won the junior title at the French Open last year and was competing in the main draw at a major tournament for the first time, Gauff got broken five times. Four of those came in the second set \u2014 and each time, the 21-year-old Floridian managed to immediately rebound to claim Valentova's very next service game.",
      "\u201cThere is a sense of urgency after getting broken, for sure. You don\u2019t want to get too far behind. You don\u2019t want to get two breaks down. You can live with one break. But she\u2019s definitely got to serve better and do a better job of holding as the tournament progresses,\u201d said Gauff's father, Corey. \u201cShe's probably been one of the best returners of serve on the tour the last two to three months. But that's not what you want. You want to hold first, for sure. It's not really a break until you hold.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, 2022 runner-up Gauff will try to reach the fourth round in Paris for the fifth consecutive appearance, facing another Czech player, Marie Bouzkova.",
      "Other winners in the women's bracket included No. 3 Jessica Pegula, who was the runner-up at last year's U.S. Open, 18-year-old Mirra Andreeva, and 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova, who reached the 2019 final at Roland-Garros. Vondrousova, who is unseeded this year, eliminated No. 25 Magdalena Frech 6-0, 4-6, 6-3 on Court 6 and then went out to sit in the stands at Lenglen to watch Gauff vs. Valentova. In men's play, No. 1 Jannik Sinner ended the career of 38-year-old Richard Gasquet by beating the Frenchman 6-3, 6-0, 6-4. No. 3 Alexander Zverev and No. 14 Arthur Fils won, while 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic was in late action against Corentin Moutet of France.",
      "No. 1-ranked Aryna Sabalenka will begin third-round play at Court Philippe-Chatrier on Day 6 by facing Olga Danilovic, while the night match in the main stadium features defending champion Carlos Alcaraz against Damir D\u017eumhur, who hurt his left knee during a fall in his second-round win. Elsewhere, Iga Swiatek continues her bid for a fourth consecutive championship by playing Jaqueline Cristian, 18-year-old qualifier Victoria Mboko of Canada takes on Olympic gold medalist Zheng Qinwen, and No. 15 Frances Tiafoe faces No. 23 Sebastian Korda in an all-American matchup.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had good conversations with CBS and WBD,\u201d Baker said, referring to Warner Bros. Discovery, whose holdings include the Turner networks that air NCAA Tournament games. \u201cOur goal here is to try to sort of get to either yes or no sometime in the next few months because there\u2019s a lot of logistical work that would be associated with doing this. If we were to go down this road, you just think about the opening weekends, who has to travel the longest, it gets complicated.\u201d",
      "The NCAA Tournament expanded from 64 to 68 teams in 2011. The change introduced the First Four round, a set of pre-tournament games where the two lowest-seeded at-large teams and two lowest-seeded conference champions compete for a spot in the traditional 64-team bracket.",
      "Baker indicated that the current formula has flaws and said it would be beneficial to give more opportunities to worthy teams.",
      "\u201cIf you have a tournament that\u2019s got 64 or 68 teams in it, you\u2019re going to have a bunch of teams that are probably among what most people would consider to be the best 68 or 70 teams in the country that aren\u2019t going to make the tournament, period,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThe point behind going from 68 to 72 or 76 is to basically give some of those schools that were probably among the 72, 76, 68, 64 best teams in the country a way into the tournament.\u201d",
      "Baker cited a competitive Indiana State team falling short of the tournament as an example. Indiana State went on to play Seton Hall in the 2024 NIT title game, which he referred to as one of the best games that spring.",

      "The president and vice president of the World Anti-Doping Agency were reelected to unprecedented third terms Thursday in a move the agency's critics say undercuts its promise to make meaningful governance reforms after years of doping scandals.",
      "The third terms for president Witold Banka of Poland and vice president Yang Yang of China will run through the end of 2028 and extend their time in office to nine years.",
      "The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, in a social media post, called it the \u201cultimate \u2018bait and switch\u2019, first promising governance reforms following the Russian anti-doping scandal and then quietly changing the rules the second the world looked away.\u201d",
      "WADA spokesman James Fitzgerald outlined the rules changes made in 2023, which did away with the tradition of having a president represent either sports organizations or governments, each of which represent 50% of WADA\u2019s main policy-making board. When Banka was first elected, he was a government candidate, but is now considered an independent candidate.",
      "\u201cThis change ... was done in order to accommodate the introduction of an initial cooling-off period and the formal election process for those positions,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cIt was also done to harmonize the nine-year term limit with other members of the WADA Foundation Board and Executive Committee.\u201d",
      "Banka said he was \u201cdeeply honored\u201d to be tabbed for a third term.",
      "\u201cDespite the many challenges we have faced over the past five-and-a-half years, it has also been a period of transformation, of resilience, and of undeniable progress,\" he said.",
      "Though the Russian doping scandal began before Banka took office, WADA was under his control during the more recent case involving 23 Chinese swimmers who were not banned after WADA declined to step in on a contamination case handled by that country's anti-doping agency.",
      "The U.S. government is withholding its annual payment of more than $3.6 million to WADA. When that decision was announced, the U.S. drug czar at the time, Rahul Gupta, said \"WADA must take concrete actions to restore trust in the world antidoping system and provide athletes the full confidence they deserve.\u201d",
      "USADA portrayed Banka's re-election process as the latest in a long-running series of moves that have undercut WADA's credibility.",
      "The German media outlet ARD reported that Dutch Olympic triathlete Chiel Warners had wanted to get in the race, but the obstacles to getting on the ballot \u2014 which included getting two nomination forms signed by different members of the WADA Foundation Board \u2014 were too great.",
      "\u201cThe fact that you need letters of support to run for an independent office does not seem particularly democratic,\u201d Warners told ARD. \u201dEspecially since it is not at all clear how you are supposed to obtain this support. In practice, this means that candidates can be excluded from the outset \u2014 and that is exactly what has happened here.\"",

      "Overall leader Isaac Del Toro had a chance to take it relatively easy during the 18th stage of the Giro d\u2019Italia",
      "CESANO MADERNO, Italy -- Overall leader Isaac Del Toro had a chance to take it relatively easy during the 18th stage of the Giro d\u2019Italia on Thursday, which was won by German rider Nico Denz with a solo breakaway.",
      "Del Toro, the first Mexican rider to wear the pink jersey, finished safely in the main pack following the 144-kilometer (89-mile) route from Morbegno to Cesano Maderno, which featured three minor climbs early on before a relatively flat finale.",
      "It will likely be much tougher for the 21-year-old Del Toro the next two days, with grueling back-to-back mountain stages before the mostly ceremonial finish in Rome on Sunday.",
      "For now, Del Toro maintained his advantage of 41 seconds ahead of 2019 champion Richard Carapaz and 51 seconds ahead of British rider Simon Yates.",
      "Juan Ayuso, Del Toro\u2019s UAE Emirates teammate, abandoned the race early on in the stage after struggling for days. Considered a pre-race favorite, Ayuso stood 26th, nearly 50 minutes behind Del Toro, and was battling through knee pain and a bee sting.",
      "\u201cObviously this is not how I wanted my Giro to end but some things are out of my control,\u201d Ayuso said in a team statement. \u201cI wish the guys all the best and hope Isaac can keep pink all the way to Rome.\u201d",
      "It was the third victory at the Giro in Denz\u2019s career, having also won two stages in 2023.",
      "The next two stages are both rated with five stars for maximum difficulty.",
      "Stage 19 on Friday is a 166-kilometer (103-mile) leg from Biella to Champoluc that features five climbs before a short descent into the finish.",
      "Then Saturday\u2019s penultimate stage is a 205-kilometer (127-mile) leg from Verres to Sestriere that features the beyond-category climb on a gravel road to Colle delle Finestre \u2014 where Chris Froome's audacious attack in 2018 earned him the title.",

      "The manner in which the Oklahoma City Thunder clinched their spot in the NBA Finals seemed fitting.",
      "It was a blowout.",
      "Those have been the story of the Thunder season.",
      "There hasn't been a team in NBA history with at least 12 wins by 30 points or more in a season \u2014 or with four such wins in a single postseason \u2014 until now. The Thunder are putting together one of the most dominant years in league history in terms of outscoring opponents. The most recent entry on that list: a 124-94 romp over Minnesota to clinch the Western Conference title, a score that probably could have been a lot worse if the Thunder were so inclined.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t our goal,\" Thunder guard, NBA MVP and West finals MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t start the season like we want to win the West. We want to win the NBA championship. Now we are a step closer to our goal and we\u2019re happy about that. But it\u2019s still four more games to go win, four really hard games to go win and we have to be the best version of ourselves for four nights to reach the ultimate goal.\u201d",
      "A look inside the numbers paints a picture of how dominant this season has been for the Thunder:",
      "The biggest point differential per game in NBA history, including playoffs, was posted by the 1970-71 Milwaukee Bucks \u2014 who outscored teams by 12.6 points per game.",
      "The Thunder are winning by 12.5 per game when counting the regular season and the playoffs (the NBA Cup championship game, by league rule, doesn't figure into any official stats that are kept).",
      "That's the second-biggest rate in league history, for now.",
      "They have beaten 28 of the 29 other NBA teams by double figures at least once this season. The only team to avoid that fate against the Thunder was Golden State, which actually outscored Oklahoma City by an average of 4.7 points per game in their head-to-head matchups.",
      "\u201cThey embody everything it means to be a team,\" Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \"And so, they deserve this. They deserve the opportunity that we have now. I couldn\u2019t be happier for them because they invest so much in their own games, but they also invest so much in each other and in the team. And I just think it\u2019s a really uncommon thing in professional basketball that they\u2019ve built.\u201d",
      "There have been 13 games this season involving the Thunder that were decided by 30 points or more. They won 12 of them.",
      "Minnesota absolutely throttled the Thunder in Game 3 of the West finals, winning by 42 points. It was a rare blip for Oklahoma City.",
      "The Thunder have had a win by at least 30 points in every series \u2014 a 51-point win over Memphis in Round 1, wins by 43 and 32 points over Denver in Round 2, and now the 30-pointer that eliminated Minnesota in Round 3.",
      "Oklahoma City\u2019s eight 30-point wins in the regular season came against teams that all missed the playoffs; Toronto, Washington, Sacramento, Phoenix, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Charlotte and Utah. But to do it four times in the playoffs speaks to the ability the Thunder have to simply run away from quality opposition.",
      "\u201cThey're a really good team,\u201d Minnesota star Anthony Edwards said. \u201cEveryone here knows it. It's no surprise to nobody here that this team is pretty good.\u201d",
      "Oklahoma City is now at 80 wins this season, including playoffs. It's the 15th time in NBA history that a team has won 80 in a season.",
      "If the Thunder win the NBA title, they'll finish with 84 wins \u2014 a total that only the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors (88), 1995-96 Chicago Bulls (87) and 1996-97 Bulls (84) have reached.",
      "\u201cHappy for the moment, but this isn\u2019t our goal,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \"This isn\u2019t the end of the road. ... One more series to try to go win.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The dynamic duo of Skylar Diggins and Nneka Ogwumike is ecstatic about this season with a high-powered Seattle Storm roster",
      "SEATTLE -- Shortly before the Seattle Storm broke for training camp, veteran guard Skylar Diggins exuded some bravado when assessing the franchise\u2019s roster ahead of the 2025 WNBA season.",
      "\u201cHell yeah I feel confident! Did you see our roster?\u201d Diggins said. \u201cBut no, this is definitely the most talented roster I\u2019ve been a part of in my 13 years, 11 on the court.\u201d",
      "As Diggins, 34, astutely noted, she\u2019s been around the block. The six-time All-Star has laced her sneakers up for some stellar teams, and the Storm have the makings of being one, too. Seattle is off to a 3-2 start, which includes a commanding 20-point victory over the Las Vegas Aces.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a great combination of players,\u201d Diggins said. \u201cEverybody knows what they\u2019re good at. Our spacing has been great. People have been picking up really quickly on things.\u201d",
      "Suffice to say, year two of Diggins partnering with fellow superstar Nneka Ogwumike and playing under coach Noelle Quinn has gone well so far. The first year of that power dynamic wasn\u2019t too shabby, either; Diggins assisted on a Storm franchise-record 570 points, and Seattle qualified for the playoffs after missing them entirely and going 11-29 in 2023.",
      "Still, the Storm were bounced by the Aces in the first round, leaving significant room for improvement in 2025.",
      "Ogwumike, 34, who inked another one-year deal in February, feels increasingly comfortable in Seattle. She also believes the duo of her and Diggins can shepherd the Storm \u2013 which has won four WNBA championships \u2013 back to its previous heights.",
      "\u201cI think we can take it pretty far, especially because not only are we both here again, but we were both here for the first time last year,\u201d Ogwumike said. \u201cSo, we have a very shared experience and kind of memory of what we did last year and how we want to build off of it.\u201d",
      "Diggins and Ogwumike have known one another for two decades, but were exclusively opponents rather than teammates prior to last year. They combined to average 31.8 points per game last season, a collective total that very well could increase considering longtime guard Jewell Loyd was traded to the Aces this offseason.",
      "So far, Diggins and Ogwumike have combined to average 37.4 points per game. Unsurprisingly, their comfort in Quinn\u2019s offensive system only increases by the day.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy playing with good players,\u201d Diggins said. \u201cA lot of us are very confident in who we are as basketball players and what we can do. And so, we kind of learn how we can complement each other and use each other to get what we want.\u201d",
      "In many ways, these two WNBA staples represent the next era of Storm basketball, and that particularly became the case when Loyd was traded to the Aces in January following some turmoil. Loyd, though, was part of each of the past two Storm championship teams in 2018 and 2020 that were paced in large part by Sue Bird and Breanna Stewart.",
      "Sure, there\u2019s a different core in the Emerald City these days, but there are some familiar faces from that string of success as well. Forward Alysha Clark is back in Seattle after five years away, and fellow forward Ezi Magbegor has only taken on a more prominent role since she was drafted in 2019.",
      "Adding 2025 No. 2 overall pick Dominique Malonga and her 6-foot-6 frame to the mix doesn\u2019t hurt matters, either, though she\u2019s been slowly brought along in the early stages of the season.",
      "\u201cWhat really sealed the deal for what could potentially be a new era was (Malonga) getting drafted here,\u201d Ogwumike said. \u201cSo, being able to be a part of a little bit of the history, but also the future too.\u201d",
      "As Diggins pointed out, there\u2019s a solid mix of both accomplished and young WNBA players on the scene in Seattle. But the buck stops with both her and Ogwumike, the latter of whom was a WNBA champion in 2016 with the Los Angeles Sparks.",
      "Diggins, meanwhile, is still seeking her first title \u2014 and joined the Storm in large part two winters ago because of her belief in the franchise\u2019s capabilities.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always been a great landing spot for free agents and winning basketball,\u201d Diggins said. \u201cWe just want to continue to build off our plus-14 win (improvement) season last year that we did and just continue to position us where we want to be, and that\u2019s contending for a championship.\u201d",

      "On May 29, 1985, 39 people went to the biggest club game in soccer and never returned home.",
      "Heysel Stadium in Brussels was staging the European Cup final between Juventus and Liverpool exactly 40 years ago.",
      "Crowd disorder culminated in a surge by Liverpool fans into an adjacent stand containing mostly Juventus supporters. In the ensuing chaos, some were trampled or suffocated to death as they tried to flee and others died when a retaining wall collapsed.",
      "A total of 39 people \u2014 32 from Italy, four from Belgium, two from France and one from Northern Ireland \u2014 died and around 600 were injured in events that took place in real time on international television.",
      "On the 40th anniversary of the Heysel disaster, here\u2019s a look at what exactly happened and the consequences of one of soccer\u2019s darkest days.",
      "English soccer was in a bad place in the mid-1980s, with racism and hooliganism damaging the reputation of fans in the game\u2019s birthplace. Just two weeks before Heysel, a 15-year-old boy died during fighting at a game between Birmingham and Leeds, and a fire that ripped through a wooden stand at Bradford killed 56 people. Two months earlier, some of the worst ever rioting occurred at an FA Cup game between Luton and Millwall.",
      "\u201cA slum sport played in slum stadiums and increasingly watched by slum people\u201d was how an editorial by The Sunday Times summed up the state of English soccer ahead of Heysel.",
      "Liverpool fans might therefore have been viewed with suspicion as they poured into Brussels for the match against Juventus, but they were also suspicious themselves. A year earlier, at the 1984 European Cup final in Rome, Liverpool supporters were attacked by their Roma counterparts after the game.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a case of revenge,\u201d Tony Evans, a Liverpool fan who was at Heysel at age 24, told The Associated Press, \u201cbut rather no ultra will ever do this to me again.\u201d",
      "Adding to the potential for catastrophe at the 1985 final was the condition of Heysel, a 55,000-capacity structure with outdated standing-room only stands, flimsy chicken-wire fences and crumbling walls inside and outside the stadium. There were too few police officers present, and organizers arranged for there to be a section for \u201cneutral\u201d fans beside one of the two stands holding Liverpool supporters at one end of the ground.",
      "Many Juve fans ended up getting tickets in the \u201cneutral\u201d section \u2014 and that's where the tragedy occurred.",
      "Evans attended the match with family and friends and remembers the level of drunkenness among Liverpool fans was unlike anything he\u2019d seen.",
      "\u201cPeople were out of control everywhere,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cWhen you got to the ground, people were kicking holes in the wall to climb in. By then, the atmosphere had deteriorated and there were wild rumors going round that Liverpool fans had been stabbed and one had been hung.\u201d",
      "Evans, who has written about Heysel in two books, \u201cFar Foreign Land\u201d and \u201cTwo Tribes,\u201d recalls the Liverpool section being so overcrowded that fans were already spilling through a collapsed barrier into the \u201cneutral\u201d section.",
      "Fans were seen throwing beer cans and chunks of concrete torn from the stands.",
      "What ultimately set off a fatal surge by Liverpool fans, Evans said, was flares being set off.",
      "\u201cThat seemed to spark a huge panic, a charge down the front,\u201d he said.",
      "Those fleeing the panic were crushed in the corner of the neutral section next to an old wall, which collapsed.",
      "Despite the chaos, organizers decided the final should be played, believing it would prevent further disorder between fans outside the stadium. Juventus won 1-0.",
      "Some 26 Liverpool fans were arrested and charged with manslaughter, 14 of whom were found guilty and given three-year prison sentences.",
      "Suspended prison sentences were handed to a Belgian Football Association official and a police chief.",
      "Heysel never hosted another major game. It was torn down in 1994 and replaced with King Baudouin Stadium.",
      "In terms of sporting sanctions, English clubs were banned from playing in European competition for five years. Liverpool received an indefinite suspension that ultimately lasted for six years.",
      "Heysel was \u201cthe low point for the English game\u201d that was hated by the British government \u201cfor its internationally shaming events,\u201d according to John Williams, an expert in the sociology of football at the University of Leicester.",
      "Fans voted with their feet, with crowds in the English league in the 1985-86 season plummeting to around 16 million \u2014 a post-war low \u2014 when they had once been two and a half times that, Williams said.",
      "Yet Williams said Heysel started the process of reflection among English soccer fans that something needed to change. Within a decade \u2014 and turbo-charged by another stadium tragedy when Liverpool fans were crushed at an FA Cup match at Hillsborough, leading to the death of 97 people \u2014 the English game would have all-seater stadiums, CCTV, stronger powers for the police, an alcohol ban inside grounds, a national organization of fans, the Premier League and be the envy of the rest of Europe.",
      "\u201cIronically, in many ways it was England that benefitted most from Heysel in the long run, more than for the Italians and others in Europe,\u201d Williams said.",
      "He referred to what authorities abroad call the \u201cEnglish miracle \u2014 the managing of fans competently with stewards rather than police and the generally very low levels of disorder in new elite modern stadia.\u201d",
      "For Evans, fans took a deep breath and stepped away from \u201cthe abyss.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was a natural development by the people who watched the game and realized if this sort of behavior that had characterized the first half of the 1980s continued, football would be dead within a decade,\u201d Evans said. \u201cEveryone says Hillsborough was the determining factor, but the reality is the tides of history had changed four years before.\u201d",
      "Liverpool and Juventus were unveiling memorials on Thursday in honor of the Heysel victims to mark the 40th anniversary.",
      "For Liverpool, the occasion would be even more poignant coming just days after a minivan plowed into dozens of fans during the team\u2019s latest Premier League victory parade.",
      "Liverpool said its newly designed memorial at Anfield will feature \"two scarves knotted together and gently tied \u2014 symbolizing the unity and solidarity between the two clubs and the bond formed through shared grief and mutual respect in the aftermath of the disaster.\" It will include the names of the 39 people who died.",
      "Juventus ' memorial will be near its stadium and training complex.",

      "Clarke Schmidt continued a six-week stretch of superb starting pitching with six shutout innings, and Anthony Volpe drove in the only run with a first-inning sacrifice fly as the Yankees (35-20) completed a three-game sweep and sent the Angels (25-30) to their fifth straight loss.",

      "Left-hander Max Fried, who is 7-0 with a 1.29 ERA in 11 starts, will pitch Friday night\u2019s series opener against the Dodgers, and right-hander Will Warren, who is 3-2 with a 4.09 ERA in 11 starts, is scheduled to pitch Saturday.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve given us a chance to win every single night,\u201d said Yankees reliever Mark Leiter Jr., who notched his second save with a scoreless ninth inning Wednesday night.",
      "\u201cEach guy is going out there and doing it a little different way, putting their own spin on it, which is great for us, because it gives them a different look for six or seven innings, and we get to do our thing with a different look for the last couple innings. You\u2019re only as good as your starting pitching, generally, and they\u2019ve been great.\u201d",

      "The two-way star, who has a 38-19 record and 3.01 ERA in 86 starts over five seasons but did not pitch while recovering from Tommy John surgery in 2024, is also on track to return to the mound sometime after the All-Star break.",

      "The Dodgers held Ohtani to two hits in 19 at-bats (.105) and no RBIs in the World Series, but he played the final three games with a dislocated left shoulder that was surgically repaired after the season.",

      "The Yankees will have a Dodgers nemesis that they didn\u2019t have last October in veteran first baseman Paul Goldschmidt, who signed a one-year, $12.5 million deal last winter and is batting .347 with an .899 OPS, five homers and 27 RBIs in his first 55 games with the Yankees.",
      "A former Arizona Diamondbacks and St. Louis Cardinals slugger, Goldschmidt has a .283 average, .872 OPS, 35 homers and 109 RBIs in 163 career games against the Dodgers and a .308 average, .928 OPS, 19 homers and 50 RBIs in 77 games in Dodger Stadium.",
      "\u201cI would say he\u2019s more than an X-factor,\u201d Boone said of Goldschmidt, who led off Wednesday night\u2019s game with a double and scored on Volpe\u2019s sacrifice fly. \u201cHe\u2019s one of our dudes.\u201d",

This is what 24 years of severe drought looks like in the world\u2019s largest rainforest.",
      "But this patch of degraded forest, about the size of a soccer field, is a scientific experiment. Launched in 2000 by Brazilian and British scientists, Esecaflor \u2014 short for \u201cForest Drought Study Project\u201d in Portuguese\u2014 set out to simulate a future in which the changing climate could deplete the Amazon of rainfall. It is the longest-running project of its kind in the world, and has become a source for dozens of academic articles in fields ranging from meteorology to ecology and physiology.",
      "Understanding how drought can affect the Amazon, an area twice the size of India that crosses into several South American nations, has implications far beyond the region. The rainforest stores a massive amount of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that is the main driver of climate change. According to one study, the Amazon stores the equivalent of two years of global carbon emissions, which mainly come from the burning of coal, oil and gasoline. When trees are cut, or wither and die from drought, they release into the atmosphere the carbon they were storing, which accelerates global warming.",
      "To mimic stress from drought, the project, located in the Caxiuana National Forest, assembled about 6,000 transparent plastic rectangular panels across one hectare (2.5 acres), diverting around 50% of the rainfall from the forest floor. They were set 1 meter above ground (3.3 ft) on the sides to 4 meters (13.1 ft) above ground in the center. The water was funneled into gutters and channeled through trenches dug around the plot\u2019s perimeter.",
      "Next to it, an identical plot was left untouched to serve as a control. In both areas, instruments were attached to trees, placed on the ground and buried to measure soil moisture, air temperature, tree growth, sap flow and root development, among other data. Two metal towers sit above each plot.",
      "In each tower, NASA radars measure how much water is in the plants, which helps researchers understand overall forest stress. The data is sent to the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, where it is processed.",
      "\u201cThe forest initially appeared to be resistant to the drought,\" said Lucy Rowland, an ecology professor at the University of Exeter.",
      "That began to change about 8 years in, however. \"We saw a really big decline in biomass, big losses and mortality of the largest trees,\u201d said Rowland.",
      "This resulted in the loss of approximately 40% of the total weight of the vegetation and the carbon stored within it from the plot. The main findings were detailed in a study published in May in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. It shows that during the years of vegetation loss, the rainforest shifted from a carbon sink, that is, a storer of carbon dioxide, to a carbon emitter, before eventually stabilizing.",
      "There was one piece of good news: the decades-long drought didn\u2019t turn the rainforest into a savanna, or large grassy plain, as earlier model-based studies had predicted.",
      "In November, most of the 6,000 transparent plastic covers were removed, and now scientists are observing how the forest changes. There is currently no end date for the project.",
      "\u201cThe forest has already adapted. Now we want to understand what happens next,\u201d said meteorologist Jo\u00e3o de Athaydes, vice coordinator of Esecaflor, a professor at the Federal University of Para and coauthor of the Nature study. \u201cThe idea is to see whether the forest can regenerate and return to the baseline from when we started the project.\u201d",
      "During a visit in April, Athaydes guided Associated Press journalists through the site, which had many researchers. The area was so remote that most researchers had endured a full-day boat trip from the city of Belem, which will host the next annual U.N. climate talks later this year. During the days in the field, the scientists stayed at the Ferreira Penna Scientific Base of the Emilio Goeldi Museum, a few hundred yards (meters) from the plots.",
      "Four teams were at work. One collected soil samples to measure root growth in the top layer. Another gathered weather data and tracking soil temperature and moisture. A third was measured vegetation moisture and sap flow. The fourt focused on plant physiology.",
      "\"We know very little about how drought influences soil processes,\u201d said ecologist Rachel Selman, researcher at the University of Edinburgh and one of the co-authors of the Nature study, during a break.",
      "Esecaflor's drought simulation draws some parallels with the past two years, when much of the Amazon rainforest, under the influence of El Nino and the impact of climate change, endured its most severe dry spells on record. The devastating consequences ranged from the death of dozens of river dolphins due to warming and receding waters to vast wildfires in old-growth areas.",
      "Rowland explained that the recent El Nino brought short-term, intense impacts to the Amazon, not just through reduced rainfall but also with spikes in temperature and vapor pressure deficit, a measure of how dry the air is. In contrast, the Esecaflor experiment focused only on manipulating soil moisture to study the effects of long-term shifts in rainfall.",
      "\u201cBut in both cases, we\u2019re seeing a loss of the forest\u2019s ability to absorb carbon,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, carbon is being released back into the atmosphere, along with the loss of forest cover.\u201d",

      "The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply",
      "NEW YORK -- The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply.",
      "Many companies have heeded calls from shareholders to tie CEO compensation more closely to performance. As a result, a large proportion of pay packages consist of stock awards, which the CEO often can\u2019t cash in for years, if at all, unless the company meets certain targets, typically a higher stock price or market value or improved operating profits.",
      "The Associated Press\u2019 CEO compensation survey, which uses data analyzed for The AP by Equilar, included pay data for 344 executives at S&P 500 companies who have served at least two full consecutive fiscal years at their companies, which filed proxy statements between Jan. 1 and April 30.",
      "Here are the key takeaways from the survey:",
      "The median pay package for CEOs rose to $17.1 million, up 9.7%. Meanwhile, the median employee at companies in the survey earned $85,419, reflecting a 1.7% increase year over year.",
      "CEOs had to navigate sticky inflation and relatively high interest rates last year, as well as declining consumer confidence. But the economy also provided some tail winds: Consumers kept spending despite their misgivings about the economy; inflation did subside somewhat; the Fed lowered interest rates; and the job market stayed strong.",
      "The stock market's main benchmark, the S&P 500, rose more than 23% last year. Profits for companies in the index rose more than 9%.",
      "\u201c2024 was expected to be a strong year, so the (nearly) 10% increases are commensurate with the timing of the pay decisions,\u201d said Dan Laddin, a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners.",
      "Sarah Anderson, who directs the Global Economy Project at the progressive Institute for Policy Studies, said there have been some recent \u201clong-overdue\u201d increases in worker pay, especially for those at the bottom of the wage scale. But she said too many workers in the world's richest countries still struggle to pay their bills.",
      "Rick Smith, the founder and CEO of Axon Enterprises, topped the survey with a pay package valued at $164.5 million. Axon, which makes Taser stun guns and body cameras, saw revenue grow more than 30% for three straight years and posted record annual net income of $377 million in 2024. Axon's shares more than doubled last year after rising more than 50% in 2023.",
      "Almost all of Smith's pay package consists of stock awards, which he can only receive if the company meets targets tied to its stock price and operations for the period from 2024 to 2030. Companies are required to assign a value to the stock awards when they are granted.",
      "Other top earners in the survey include Lawrence Culp, CEO of what is now GE Aerospac e ($87.4 million), Tim Cook at Apple ($74.6 million), David Gitlin at Carrier Global ($65.6 million) and Ted Sarandos at Netflix ($61.9 million). The bulk of those pay packages consisted of stock or options awards.",
      "The median stock award rose almost 15% last year compared to a 4% increase in base salaries, according to Equilar.",
      "\u201cFor CEOs, target long-term incentives consistently increase more each year than salaries or bonuses,\" said Melissa Burek, also a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners. \"Given the significant role that long-term incentives play in executive pay, this trend makes sense.\u201d",
      "Jackie Cook at Morningstar Sustainalytics said the benefit of tying CEO pay to performance is \u201cthat share-based pay appears to provide a clear market signal that most shareholders care about.\" But she notes that the greater use of share-based pay has led to a \u201cphenomenal rise\u201d in CEO compensation \u201ctracking recent years' market performance,\u201d which has \"widened the pay gap within workplaces.\"",
      "Some well-known billionaire CEOs are low in the AP survey. Warren Buffett's compensation was valued at $405,000, about five times what a worker at Berkshire Hathaway makes. According to Tesla\u2019s proxy, Elon Musk received no compensation for 2024, but in 2018 he was awarded a multiyear package that has been valued at $56 billion and is the subject of a court battle.",
      "Other notable CEOs didn't meet the criteria for inclusion the survey. Starbucks' Brian Niccol received a pay package valued at $95.8 million, but he only took over as CEO on Sept. 9. Nvidia's Jensen Huang saw his compensation grow to $49.9 million, but the company filed its proxy after April 30.",
      "At half the companies in AP\u2019s annual pay survey, it would take the worker at the middle of the company\u2019s pay scale 192 years to make what the CEO did in one. Companies have been required to disclose this so-called pay ratio since 2018.",
      "The pay ratio tends to be highest at companies in industries where wages are typically low. For instance, at cruise line company Carnival Corp., its CEO earned nearly 1,300 times the median pay of $16,900 for its workers. McDonald's CEO makes about 1,000 times what a worker making the company's median pay does. Both companies have operations that span numerous countries.",
      "Overall, wages and benefits netted by private-sector workers in the U.S. rose 3.6% through 2024, according to the Labor Department. The average worker in the U.S. makes $65,460 a year. That figure rises to $92,000 when benefits such as health care and other insurance are included.",
      "\u201cWith CEO pay continuing to climb, we still have an enormous problem with excessive pay gaps,\u201d Anderson said. \"These huge disparities are not only unfair to lower-level workers who are making significant contributions to company value \u2013 they also undercut enterprise effectiveness by lowering employee morale and boosting turnover rates.\u201d",
      "For the 27 women who made the AP survey \u2014 the highest number dating back to 2014 \u2014 median pay rose 10.7% to $20 million. That compares to a 9.7% increase to $16.8 million for their male counterparts.",
      "The highest earner among female CEOs was Judith Marks of Otis Worldwide, with a pay package valued at $42.1 million. The company, known for its elevators and escalators, has had operating profit above $2 billion for four straight years. About $35 million of Marks' compensations was in the form of stock awards.",
      "Other top earners among female CEOs were Jane Fraser of Citigroup ($31.1 million), Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices ($31 million), Mary Barra at General Motors ($29.5 million) and Laura Alber at Williams-Sonoma ($27.7 million).",
      "Christy Glass, a professor of sociology at Utah State University who studies equity, inclusion and leadership, said while there may be a few more women on the top paid CEO list, overall equity trends are stagnating, particularly as companies cut back on DEI programs.",
      "\u201cThere are maybe a couple more names on the list, but we\u2019re really not moving the needle significantly,\u201d she said.",
      "Equilar found that a larger number of companies are offering security perquisites as part of executive compensation packages, possibly in reaction to the December shooting of UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Equilar said an analysis of 208 companies in the S&P 500 that filed proxy statements by April 2 showed that the median spending on security rose to $94,276 last year from $69,180 in 2023.",
      "Among the companies that increased their security perks were Centene, which provides health care services to Medicare and Medicaid, and the chipmaker Intel.",

      "A push in Texas to ban children under 18 years old from social media platforms is fading at the state Capitol",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A push in Texas to ban social media accounts for children under 18 faded Thursday after lawmakers did not take a key vote on creating one of the nation's toughest restrictions aimed at keeping minors off platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram.",
      "The bill, which already passed the GOP-controlled state House, aims to go further than a Florida social media ban for minors under 14. Australia banned social media accounts for anyone under 16.",
      "But earlier momentum behind the Texas measure slowed at the eleventh hour in the state Senate as lawmakers face a weekend deadline to send bills to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. Abbott has not said publicly whether he supported the proposed ban, which was opposed by tech trade groups and critics who called it it an unconstitutional limit on free speech.",
      "\u201cThis bill was the best way to protect children in this state,\u201d state Rep. Jared Patterson, a Republican carrying the measure, said Wednesday.",
      "The legislative session ends Monday. That leaves a narrowing path for the proposal that, if passed, would set up another test of state efforts to set boundaries on how and when children can access social media.",
      "Many tech companies have established a presence in Texas, including X, which is owned by Elon Musk.",
      "Earlier this week, Abbott signed into law a separate measure requiring Apple and Google to verify the age of online app store users, as well as parental consent to download apps and make in-app purchases for users under 18. Utah passed a similar bill earlier this year.",
      "The proposed Texas ban aimed at minors is the latest move in a growing bipartisan push nationwide to address the impacts of social media on the well-being of children.

      "Some are accused of hacking websites and servers to steal cryptocurrency databases and identify targets, but others are alleged to have broken into victims\u2019 homes to steal their \u201chardware wallets\u201d \u2014 devices that provide access to their crypto accounts.",
      "The case stemmed from an investigation that started after a couple in Connecticut last year were forced out of a Lamborghini SUV, assaulted and bound in the back of a van. Authorities allege the incident was a ransom plot targeting the couple\u2019s son \u2014 who they say helped steal more than $240 million worth of Bitcoin from a single victim. The son has not been charged, but is being detained on an unspecified \u201cfederal misdemeanor offense\u201d charge, according to online jail records.

      "As a group, cryptocurrency theft victims reported the most losses \u2014 more than $6.5 billion",
      "The agency and experts say the crypto crime underworld is likely being fueled by the large amounts of money at stake \u2013 combined with weak regulation of cryptocurrency that allows many transactions to be made without identity documents.",
      "Violence may be increasing for several reasons including that criminals believe they can get away with crypto theft because transactions are hard to trace and often cloaked by anonymity, according to the crypto tracing firm TRM Labs. And crypto holders are getting easier to identify because of the prevalence of personal information online and people flaunting their crypto wealth on social media, the firm says.",
      "Phil Ariss, TRM Labs\u2019 director of UK public sector relations, said crypto also may be attracting criminal groups that have long used violence.",
      "\u201cAs long as there\u2019s a viable route to launder or liquidate stolen assets, it makes little difference to the offender whether the target is a high-value watch or a crypto wallet,\u201d Ariss said in a statement. \u201cCryptocurrency is now firmly in the mainstream, and as a result, our traditional understanding of physical threat and robbery needs to evolve accordingly.\"",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Artificial intelligence technology bellwether Nvidia overcame a wave of tariff-driven turbulence to deliver another quarter of robust growth amid feverish demand for its high-powered chips that are making computers seem more human.",
      "The results announced Wednesday for the February-April period came against the backdrop of President Donald Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again trade war that has whipsawed Nvidia and other Big Tech companies riding AI mania to propel their revenue and stock prices upward.",
      "But Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 many of which have been reduced or temporarily suspended \u2013 hammered the market values of Nvidia and other tech powerhouses heading into the springtime earnings season as investors fretted about the trade turmoil dimming the industry\u2019s prospects.",
      "Those worries have eased during the past six weeks as most Big Tech companies lived up to or exceeded the analyst projections that steer investors, capped by Nvidia\u2019s report for its fiscal first quarter.",
      "Nvidia earned $18.8 billion, or 76 cents per share, for the period, a 26% increase from the same time last year. Revenue surged 69% from a year ago to $44.1 billion. If not for a $4.5 billion charge that Nvidia absorbed to account for the U.S. government\u2019s restrictions on its chip sales to China, Nvidia would have made 96 cents per share, far above the 73 cents per share envisioned by analysts.",
      "In another positive sign, Nvidia predicted its revenue for the May-July period would be about $45 billion, roughly the level that investors had been anticipating. The forecast includes an estimated $8 billion loss in sales to China due to the export controls during its fiscal second quarter, after the restrictions cost it about $2.5 billion in revenue during the first quarter.",
      "In a conference call with analysts, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lamented that the U.S. government had effectively blocked off AI chip sales to China \u2014 a market that he estimated at $50 billion. Huang warned the export controls have spurred China to build more of its own chips in a shift that he predicted the U.S. will eventually regret.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. based its policy on the assumption that China cannot make AI chips. That assumption was always questionable, and now it\u2019s clearly wrong,\u201d Huang said.",
      "Despite Nvidia's lost opportunities in China, investors were heartened by the company's first-quarter performance. Nvidia's shares gained more than 4% in extended trading after the numbers came out. Nvidia\u2019s stock price ended Wednesday\u2019s regular trading session at $134.81, just slightly below where it stood before Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 inauguration. The price had plunged to as low as $86.62 last month during a nosedive that temporarily erased $1.2 trillion in shareholder wealth.",
      "The outlook began brightening for Nvidia last month after AI leaders such as Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms reaffirmed their plans to invest heavily in AI. That spending has been a boon for Nvidia because its chipsets provide the technology\u2019s brainpower, an advantage that has helped the company's annual revenue from $27 billion to $130 billion in just two years.",
      "Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives estimates Big Tech companies will spend about $325 billion on long-term investments primarily revolving around AI this year, with a substantial chunk of that money budgeted for Nvidia\u2019s chips \u201cThere is one chip in the world fueling the AI revolution and it's Nvidia. That narrative is clear from these results,\u201d Ives wrote in a research note.",
      "Trump\u2019s trade war has been raising doubts about Nvidia\u2019s ability to maintain its astounding momentum by threatening to close off other key markets besides China.",
      "In apparent attempt to curry favor with the president, Huang last month announced Nvidia will help boost U.S. manufacturing by building some of its AI chips and supercomputers in plants located in Arizona and Texas. Huang also accompanied Trump on a trip to Saudi Arabia earlier this month, signaling Nvidia\u2019s ambitions to sell more of its AI chips in the Middle East as that region attempts to lessen its economy dependence on oil.",
      "Trump also extended a helping hand to Nvidia of by rescinding the scheduled start export controls that had been drawn up under President Joe Biden\u2019s administration that would have broadened the restrictions on chips sales in foreign markets beyond the limits already in place on deals with China and Russia.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. will always be Nvidia\u2019s largest market and home to the largest installed base of our infrastructure,\u201d Huang said. \u201cEvery nation now sees AI as core to the next industrial revolution.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to unleash innovation and use it to improve the lives of countless American citizens,\u201d Vance said in his address. \u201cBut if we fail to create regulatory clarity now, we risk chasing this $3 trillion industry offshore in search of a friendly jurisdiction.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s speech comes after Trump promised to make the U.S. the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet\u201d when he addressed the same bitcoin conference in Nashville last year in the middle of the presidential campaign. The crypto industry, which felt unfairly attacked by the Biden administration, spent heavily to help Trump and pro-crypto lawmakers win election.",

      "Vance hailed crypto as a hedge that can help conservative populists protect themselves against bad politicians, overly aggressive regulators and unethical elites.

Trump has also staked his administration with outspoken crypto backers while his administration has undone or paused several enforcement actions taken against large crypto companies.",
      "Several other Trump officials are speakers at the bitcoin conference, as are his sons Don Jr. and Eric. The president and his family\u2019s use of crypto as a platform to make money for the Trump brand has drawn criticism from Democrats and even crypto enthusiasts as corrupt and unseemly.",
      "The Trump family holds about a 60% stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that recently launched its own stablecoin, a fast-growing form of cryptocurrency whose values is often tied to the U.S. dollar.

      "Researchers are still charting how human populations spread across the Americas thousands of years ago, arriving first in North America before veering south. Groups that split off developed their own collection of genes that scientists can use to piece together the human family tree.",

      "The new study was published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.",
      "\u201cUp to this point, we didn\u2019t believe there was any other lineage that would appear in South America,\" said archaeologist Andre Luiz Campelo dos Santos with Florida Atlantic University who was not involved with the new research. \u201cThis is unexpected.\u201d",

      "Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin offer traders full control of their funds without the need for a bank or permission from a government to buy, sell or hold it. The trade-off is that if funds are lost or stolen, there can be no way to get them back.",
      "Self-reliance is a key ethos of crypto. Securing and controlling one\u2019s private keys, which are like passwords used to access one\u2019s crypto holdings, is viewed as sacrosanct among many in the crypto community. A popular motto is \u201cnot your keys, not your coins.\u201d",

      "Experts suggest several ways to mitigate the threats of wrench attacks, including using wallets that require multiple approvals before any transactions.",
      "Perhaps the most common way crypto-wealthy individuals try to prevent wrench attacks is by trying to stay anonymous. Using nicknames and cartoon avatars in social media accounts is common in the crypto community, even among top executives at popular companies.",

      "An international team reported Wednesday that this celestial object \u2014 perhaps a star, pair of stars or something else entirely \u2014 is emitting X-rays around the same time it\u2019s shooting out radio waves. What\u2019s more, the cycle repeats every 44 minutes, at least during periods of extreme activity.",
      "Located 15,000 light-years away in a region of the Milky Way brimming with stars, gas and dust, this object could be a highly magnetized dead star like a neutron or white dwarf, Curtin University\u2019s Ziteng Andy Wang said in an email from Australia.",

      "Given the uncertain distance, astronomers can't tell if the weird object is associated with the supernova remnant or not. A single light-year is 5.8 trillion miles.",
      "The hyperactive phase of this object \u2014 designated ASKAP J1832\u2212091 \u2014 appeared to last about a month. Outside of that period, the star did not emit any noticeable X-rays. That could mean more of these objects may be out there, scientists said.",

      "The 403-foot (123-meter) rocket blasted off on its ninth demo from Starbase, SpaceX\u2019s launch site at the southern tip of Texas. Residents voted this month to organize as an official city.",
      "CEO Elon Musk 's SpaceX hoped to release a series of mock satellites following liftoff, but that got nixed because the door failed to open all the way. Then the spacecraft began spinning as it skimmed space toward an uncontrolled landing in the Indian Ocean.",
      "SpaceX later confirmed that the spacecraft experienced \u201ca rapid unscheduled disassembly,\u201d or burst apart. \u201cTeams will continue to review data and work toward our next flight test,\u201d the company said in an online statement.",
      "Musk noted in a post on X it was a \u201cbig improvement\u201d from the two previous demos, which ended in flaming debris over the Atlantic. Despite the latest setback, he promised a faster launch pace moving forward, with a Starship soaring every three to four weeks for the next three flights.",
      "It was the first time one of Musk's Starships \u2014 intended for moon and Mars travel \u2014 flew with a recycled booster. There were no plans to catch the booster with giant chopsticks back at the launch pad, with the company instead pushing it to its limits. Contact with the booster was lost at one point, and it slammed into the Gulf of Mexico in pieces as the spacecraft continued toward the Indian Ocean.",
      "Then the spacecraft went out of control, apparently due to fuel leaks.",
      "\u201cNot looking great with a lot of our on-orbit objectives for today,\u201d said SpaceX flight commentator Dan Huot. The company had been looking to test the spacecraft\u2019s heat shield during a controlled reentry.",
      "Communication ceased before the spacecraft came down, and SpaceX ended its webcast soon afterward.",
      "The previous two Starships never made it past the Caribbean. The demos earlier this year ended just minutes after liftoff, raining wreckage into the ocean. No injuries or serious damage were reported, although airline travel was disrupted. The Federal Aviation Administration last week cleared Starship for another flight, expanding the hazard area and pushing the liftoff outside peak air travel times.",
      "Besides taking corrective action and making upgrades, SpaceX modified the latest spacecraft\u2019s thermal tiles and installed special catch fittings. This one was meant to sink in the Indian Ocean, but the company wanted to test the add-ons for capturing future versions back at the pad, just like the boosters.",
      "NASA needs SpaceX to make major strides over the next year with Starship \u2014 the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built \u2014 in order to land astronauts back on the moon. Next year\u2019s moonshot with four astronauts will fly around the moon, but will not land. That will happen in 2027 at the earliest and require a Starship to get two astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface and back off again.",

      "Scientists have pinpointed the oldest known evidence of humans making tools from whale bone",
      "NEW YORK -- Scientists have pinpointed the oldest known evidence of humans making tools from whale bone.",
      "The bones, fashioned into narrow projectiles for hunting, had been uncovered in excavations dating back over a century in the Bay of Biscay near Spain and France. Scientists figured the tools were quite ancient, but many were small fragments so it was hard to determine their age.",
      "Technological advancements in the past decade have now made it possible to date the oldest of the tools to about 20,000 years ago. Scientists found that the bones came from blue whales, fin whales, sperm whales and other species.",
      "\u201cHumans and whales have clearly been encountering one another for a long time,\u201d said Vicki Szabo with Western Carolina University, who studies the history of whaling and was not involved with the latest research.",
      "Scientists think that ancient humans were crafting whale bone instruments in places including the Arctic and South Pacific. There\u2019s been solid evidence of whale bone tools dating back to about 5,000 years ago, but the new research published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications pushes the timeline back.",
      "Ancient humans weren't necessarily hunting whales, said study author Jean-Marc Petillon with the French National Centre for Scientific Research. More likely, they were scavenging the bodies of beached whales and fashioning their dense, heavy bones into tools to hunt reindeer or bison.",
      "The tools indicate that ancient people in the area took advantage of resources near the sea for survival. They likely also collected seashells and fished. Finding such evidence has been difficult as rising sea levels disrupt coastlines across the globe, scientists said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one more contribution to the importance of coastal environments for human groups, even in this long past,\" said Petillon.",

    "story": [
      "Rising concerns about the misuse of drones have led to the development of new technologies designed to counter unmanned aircraft",
      "WASHINGTON -- Drones have harassed airports and bedeviled local police. They have trespassed over nuclear plants and prisons. On the battlefield, they can kill.",
      "But aside from shooting down the devices, which may create further danger, there's often not much anyone can do to stop drones when they pose a threat or wander where they're not welcome.",
      "That's beginning to change. Cheap and easily modified, unmanned aerial vehicles have become a part of daily life as well as a tool for governments and bad actors alike \u2014 used for intelligence gathering, surveillance, sabotage, terrorism and more. Concerns about their misuse have spurred a technological scramble for ways to stop the devices in midair.",
      "\u201cAn adversary can use an off-the-shelf drone they bought for $500 and find out what\u2019s going on at U.S. nuclear weapons bases,\" said Zachary Kallenborn, a London-based national security consultant and expert on drone warfare. \u201cChina, Russia, Iran: If they're not doing it they're stupid.\u201d",
      "Military drones are already potent weapons of war, used to track enemy movements and deliver attacks. But they have become an increasing threat at home, too. And anti-drone systems now hold significant promise for airports, water treatment plants, military installations and public events targeted by drones in recent years.",
      "The rise in incidents involving unmanned aircraft \u2014 like the wave of sightings reported last year in New Jersey \u2014 has led to more research and investment into the most effective ways of countering drones, preferably while preventing injuries to those below.",
      "Some systems work by firing a projectile to destroy it. Others jam the radio frequencies used to control the drones, causing them to land in place or fly back to their origin. Another approach uses other drones to fire nets at the offending devices.",
      "All the techniques have their strengths and weaknesses.",
      "Jamming a drone is highly effective and relatively easy from a technical standpoint. But it\u2019s a blunt tool \u2014 jamming not just the drone's signal but other electromagnetic signals used by telephones, emergency responders, air traffic control and the internet.",
      "The most basic anti-drone measures are called kinetic defenses, which involve shooting a missile, bullet, net or other projectile at the device to destroy or disable it.",
      "Kinetic systems can be risky, however, by creating the threat that debris could fall on people or property or that a missile fired at unmanned aircraft could miss and hit civilians instead. In 2022, for instance, 12 people were injured in Saudi Arabia when they were hit by debris after authorities took down a drone launched by Houthi rebels near the Yemen border.",
      "The Israeli firm D-Fend Solutions created a system it calls EnforceAir that allows the operator to hack into an adversarial drone and take over its controls. The equipment looks like a large computer router and can be set up on a tripod or a vehicle or carried in a backpack.",
      "Like other anti-drone systems, D-Fend's product also detects any drones entering a predetermined area, allowing the operator to permit friendly devices to fly through while disabling others.",
      "In a demonstration of the technology in an empty athletic field in suburban Washington, the system quickly hijacked a drone operated by one of D-Fend's technicians as it entered an area being monitored.",
      "\u201cWe detect the drone, we take control and we land it,\u201d said Jeffrey Starr, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer.",
      "Landing the aircraft safely allows authorities to study the device \u2014 a critical benefit to law enforcement or national security investigations. It also allows the drone to be given back to its owner in the case of harmless mistakes involving hobbyists.",
      "Anti-drone systems that involve hacking the invading aircraft may not work on military drones, however, as they come equipped with greater cyberdefenses.",
      "National security experts predict that a variety of techniques to counter drones could soon become commonplace, used to protect sensitive buildings, pipelines, ports and public areas. But before that can happen, federal laws must catch up to the threat.",
      "\u201cMost of the laws we're dealing with were written for manned aviation,\u201d said DJ Smith, senior technical surveillance agent with the Virginia State Police's Bureau of Criminal Investigations.",
      "Smith, who oversees his department\u2019s use of drones, said any new federal rules should come with a public awareness campaign so hobbyists and commercial drone users understand the law and the responsibilities of using a drone. Authorities also need greater powers to use systems to track suspicious drones, he said, and take action against them when they pose a threat.",
      "\u201cWe want to detect, we want to track, we want to identify,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Federal law currently restricts how local and state police can use anti-drone systems. Some lawmakers are pushing to change that.",
      "\u201cIt is paramount that our state and local law enforcement agencies are able to be granted the proper authority to protect citizens at large events and gatherings,\u201d said Rep. Cory Mills, a Florida Republican and a sponsor of legislation designed to make it easier for local authorities to use technology to counter drones at large public events.",
      "The bill, introduced this month, would give local law enforcement the ability to use anti-drone systems that have been approved by the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies.",

      "Since World War II, the U.S. has invested huge amounts of money in scientific research conducted at independent universities and federal agencies. That funding helped the U.S. to become the world\u2019s leading scientific power \u2014 and has led to the invention of cell phones and the internet as well as new ways to treat cancer, heart disease and strokes, noted Holden Thorp, editor-in-chief of the journal Science.",
      "But today that system is being shaken.",
      "Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has pointed to what it calls waste and inefficiency in federal science spending and made major cuts to staff levels and grant funding at the National Science Foundation,the National Institutes of Health, NASA and other agencies, as well as slashing research dollars that flow to some private universities.",
      "The White House budget proposal for next year calls to cut the NIH budget by roughly 40% and the National Science Foundation\u2019s by 55%.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is spending its first few months reviewing the previous administration\u2019s projects, identifying waste, and realigning our research spending to match the American people\u2019s priorities and continue our innovative dominance,\" said White House spokesperson Kush Desai.",
      "Already, several universities have announced hiring freezes, laid off staff or stopped admitting new graduate students. On Thursday, the Trump administration revoked Harvard University\u2019s ability to enroll international students, though a judge put that on hold.",
      "Research institutions abroad are watching with concern for collaborations that depend on colleagues in the U.S. \u2014 but they also see opportunities to potentially poach talent.",
      "\u201cThere are threats to science ... south of the border,\u201d said Brad Wouters, of University Health Network, Canada\u2019s leading hospital and medical research center, which launched the \u201cCanada Leads\u201d recruitment drive. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole pool of talent, a whole cohort that is being affected by this moment.\u201d",
      "Universities worldwide are always trying to recruit from one another, just as tech companies and businesses in other fields do. What's unusual about the current moment is that many global recruiters are targeting researchers by promising something that seems newly threatened: academic freedom.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said this month that the European Union intends \u201cto enshrine freedom of scientific research into law.\u201d She spoke at the launch of the bloc's \u201cChoose Europe for Science\u201d \u2014 which was in the works before the Trump administration cuts but has sought to capitalize on the moment.",
      "Eric Berton, president of Aix-Marseille University, expressed a similar sentiment after launching the institution\u2019s \u201cSafe Place for Science\u201d program.",
      "\u201cOur American research colleagues are not particularly interested by money,\" he said of applicants. \"What they want above all is to be able to continue their research and that their academic freedom be preserved.\"",
      "It\u2019s too early to say how many scientists will choose to leave the U.S. It will take months for universities to review applications and dole out funding, and longer for researchers to uproot their lives.",
      "Plus, the American lead in funding research and development is enormous \u2014 and even significant cuts may leave crucial programs standing. The U.S. has been the world\u2019s leading funder of R&D \u2014 including government, university and private investment \u2014 for decades. In 2023, the country funded 29% of the world\u2019s R&D, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.",
      "But some institutions abroad are reporting significant early interest from researchers in the U.S. Nearly half of the applications to \u201cSafe Place for Science\u201d \u2014 139 out of 300 total \u2014 came from U.S.-based scientists, including AI researchers and astrophysicists.",
      "U.S.-based applicants in this year\u2019s recruitment round for France\u2019s Institute of Genetics, Molecular and Cellular Biology roughly doubled over last year.",
      "At the Max Planck Society in Germany, the Lise Meitner Excellence Program \u2014 aimed at young female researchers \u2014 drew triple the number of applications from U.S.-based scientists this year as last year.",
      "Recruiters who work with companies and nonprofits say they see a similar trend.",
      "Natalie Derry, a U.K.-based managing partner of the Global Emerging Sciences Practice at recruiter WittKieffer, said her team has seen a 25% to 35% increase in applicants from the U.S. cold-calling about open positions. When they reach out to scientists currently based in the U.S., \u201cwe are getting a much higher hit rate of people showing interest.\u201d",
      "Still, there are practical hurdles to overcome for would-be continent-hoppers, she said. That can include language hurdles, arranging childcare or eldercare, and significant differences in national pension or retirement programs.",
      "Brandon Coventry never thought he would consider a scientific career outside the United States. But federal funding cuts and questions over whether new grants will materialize have left him unsure. While reluctant to leave his family and friends, he\u2019s applied to faculty positions in Canada and France.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted to necessarily leave the United States, but this is a serious contender for me,\u201d said Coventry, who is a postdoctoral fellow studying neural implants at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.",

She said it felt like \u201cAmerica as a country was no longer interested in studying questions like mine.\u201d",
      "Still, she wasn\u2019t sure of her next move. \u201cIt\u2019s no easy solution, just fleeing and escaping to another country,\u201d she said.",
      "The recruitment programs range in ambition, from those trying to attract a dozen researchers to a single university to the continent-wide \u201cChoose Europe\u201d initiative.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear if the total amount of funding and new positions offered could match what's being shed in the U.S.",

      "The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued an administrative stay of the decision while it considers Trump\u2019s appeal.",
      "The administration earlier Thursday urged the New York-based Court of International Trade to delay its order, warning that enforcement of the ruling will cause a \u201cforeign policy disaster scenario.\u201d",
      "In an opinion on Wednesday, the three-judge panel struck down Trump's global tariffs as \"contrary to law.\"",
      "The judges found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act -- which Trump used to enact his tariffs -- does not give him the \"unlimited\" power to levy tariffs like the president has in recent months.",
      "\"The President's assertion of tariff-making authority in the instant case, unbounded as it is by any limitation in duration or scope, exceeds any tariff authority delegated to the President under IEEPA. The Worldwide and Retaliatory tariffs are thus ultra vires and contrary to law,\" the judges wrote.",
      "According to the judges, Congress, not the president, has the authority to impose tariffs under most circumstances, and Trump's tariffs do not meet the limited condition of an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" that would allow him to act alone.",
      "On Thursday, a second federal court determined that Trump\u2019s global were \u201cunlawful.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras said in an order the International Economic Emergency Economic Powers Act does not give the president the power to impose most of his recent tariffs.",
      "Notably, the decision from Contreras \u2013 an Obama appointee \u2013 only restricts the Trump administration's ability to collect tariffs from the two companies that filed the lawsuit, Learning Resources, Inc., and hand2mind, Inc.",
      "The Department of Justice on Thursday requested a stay to Wednesday's ruling, saying it's needed \"to avoid immediate irreparable harm to United States foreign policy and national security.\"",
      "\u201cIt is critical, for the country\u2019s national security and the President\u2019s conduct of ongoing, delicate diplomatic efforts, that the Court stay its judgment. The harm to the conduct of foreign affairs from the relief ordered by the Court could not be greater,\u201d lawyers with the Department of Justice argued.",
      "According to the administration, the court order would strip the president of leverage in trade negotiations, imperil the trade deals already reached, and make the country vulnerable to countries that \u201cfeel a renewed boldness to take advantage of\u201d the current situation.",
      "Responding to the ruling, White House spokesman Kush Desai evoked the trade deficit and said, \"It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency,\" adding that that the administration is committed to using \"every lever of executive power to address this crisis.\"",
      "The Trump administration had quickly filed a notice of appeal to challenge Wednesday's decision.",
      "The case now heads to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit where they could ask for a stay of the order.",
      "The Court of International Trade issued the decision across two cases -- one filed by a group of small businesses and another filed by 12 Democratic attorneys general.",
      "Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford called the ruling \"a win for the rule of law and for Nevadans' pocketbooks.\"",
      "\"I am extremely pleased with the court's decision to strike down these tariffs; they were both unlawful and economically destructive,\" he said. \"The president had no legal authority to impose these tariffs, and his unlawful actions would have caused billions of dollars of damage to the American economy.\"",
      "Since Trump announced sweeping tariffs on more than 50 countries in April, his administration has faced half a dozen lawsuits challenging the president's ability to impose tariffs without the approval of Congress.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James called the decision a \"major victory for our efforts to uphold the law and protect New Yorkers from illegal policies that threaten American jobs and economy.\"",
      "\"The law is clear: no president has the power to single-handedly raise taxes whenever they like. These tariffs are a massive tax hike on working families and American businesses that would have led to more inflation, economic damage to businesses of all sizes, and job losses across the country if allowed to continue,\" James' statement continued.",
      "Lawyers for the small businesses alleged that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act -- which Trump invoked to impose the tariffs -- does not give the president the right to issue \"across-the-board worldwide tariffs,\" and that Trump's justification for the tariffs was invalid.",
      "\"His claimed emergency is a figment of his own imagination,\" the lawsuit said. \"Trade deficits, which have persisted for decades without causing economic harm, are not an emergency.\"",
      "During a hearing earlier this month, a group of three judges -- who were appointed by presidents Obama, Trump and Reagan -- pushed a lawyer for the small businesses to provide a legal basis to override the tariffs. While a different court in the 1970s determined that the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 -- the law that preceded the International Emergency Economic Powers Act -- gave the president the right to impose tariffs, no court has weighed whether the president can impose tariffs unilaterally under the IEEPA.",
      "During a May 13 hearing, Jeffrey Schwab, a lawyer from the conservative Liberty Justice Center representing the plaintiffs, argued that Trump's purported emergency to justify the tariffs is far short of what is required under the law.",
      "\"I'm asking this court to be an umpire and call a strike; you're asking me, well, where's the strike zone? Is it at the knees or slightly below the knees?\" Schwab argued. \"I'm saying it's a wild pitch and it's on the other side of the batter and hits the backstop, so we don't need to debate that.\"",
      "The ruling marks the first time a federal court has issued a ruling on the legality of Trump's tariffs. In May, a federal judge in Florida nominated by Trump suggested the president has the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, but opted to transfer the case to the Court of International Trade.",

      "\"TACO trade,\" which stands for \"Trump always chickens out,\" was coined by Financial Times columnist Robert Armstrong but has since spread across Wall Street and the internet, mocking the president's back-and-forth on tariff policies.",

      "While fielding questions from reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday, a reporter asked for Trump's reaction to the now-viral Wall Street jab.",
      "\"Oh, I chicken out? Isn't that nice? I've never heard that,\" Trump said.",
      "The president went on to defend his decision to slash the tariffs on China for 90 days and push back the deadline for 50% tariffs on European Union countries until July 9.",
      "\"You call that chickening out?\" Trump asked, appearing visibly agitated by the question, which he called \"nasty.\"",
      "\"I think we really helped China tremendously because, you know, they were having great difficulty because we were basically going cold turkey with China,\" the president continued. \"We were doing no business because of the tariff, because it was so high. But I knew that.\"",
      "\"Don't ever say what you said,\" Trump told the reporter. \"That's a nasty question.\"",

      "The Trump administration appealed the decision on Thursday, with the court temporarily delaying the judges' order.",

    "summary": "Public health experts said healthy children also at risk of severe disease and death from COVID amid RFK Jr.'s announcement of new CDC COVID vaccine recommendations.",
    "story": [
      "Experts say healthy children are also at risk of severe disease and death.",
      "Earlier this week, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in a video posted on X that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would no longer be recommending COVID-19 vaccines for \"healthy children and pregnant people.\"",
      "In the video, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said there is no evidence that healthy children \"need\" the vaccine. National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya also appeared in the video.",
      "Public health experts said they were surprised by the way the decision was announced.",
      "\"The risks are real of COVID but, in general, for an otherwise healthy kid, the bad stuff is thankfully on the low side,\" Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccinologist and president and co-director of the Atria Research Institute, which focuses on disease prevention, told ABC News.",
      "\"But you have to keep remembering that the risks of the vaccine are lower still,\" he continued. \"You can get the vaccine and get infected, but your infection will be much less severe, or you cannot get the vaccine and get infected and have far higher rates of illness and complications and even a risk of death.\"",
      "Risks of COVID in children",
      "The current COVID-19 vaccine, the updated 2024-25 shot, was until recently recommended for all Americans ages 6 months and older.",
      "While those with one or more underlying conditions are at higher risk of severe COVD, anybody who becomes infected with the virus can be hospitalized, develop severe disease and die.",
      "When the CDC's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), which provides advice and guidance on the control of vaccine-preventable diseases, presented data at its last meeting, it \"showed that 152 children died last year of COVID. 40% of those children were perfectly healthy,\" Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told ABC News.",
      "\"So when [Kennedy] says he's not recommending the vaccine for healthy children, that flies in the face of data,\" he added.",
      "Offit explained that usually it's the ACIP that discusses if there is a benefit to a yearly vaccine and who should get it. The independent advisory committee then makes recommendations to the CDC, which has the final say on who should get what vaccine.",
      "\"That's not the way this played out. You basically had three men standing up in a little Twitter event making this declaration \u2026 without any input from the public, without any input from experts, just these three people, specifically RFK Jr. at the center,\" Offit said.",
      "There is also a risk of long-term side effects even in otherwise healthy children, according to experts.",
      "As of 2023, more than 1 million U.S. children may have been affected by long COVID at some point, a CDC study published in February found.",

      "\"About a million U.S. kids, it's estimated, have [had] long COVID,\" Poland said. \"If you get the vaccine, you can reduce that risk. Getting the vaccine decreases ER visits and hospitalization by about 40%.\"",
      "A CDC-led study, published in February found that COVID mRNA vaccination lowered the risk of having at least one or two long COVID symptoms in children ages 5 to 17.",
      "Poland and Offit said there is also a community benefit from being vaccinated. When otherwise healthy children are vaccinated, it protects vulnerable members of the community from infection.",
      "Although immunity wanes, COVID-19 vaccines do, at least temporarily, provide some protection against transmission.",
      "\"I would say the primary benefit is to the actual child who gets immunized. There's a secondary, but admittedly transient, benefit to the community,\" Poland said. \"The protection against transmission is short-lived. It's there for a period of time. It's there, but it's transient. But when you do it across a community, you get added benefits.\"",
      "Questions remain on new policy",
      "Offit said it's unclear if Kennedy's announcement means the CDC will no longer recommend COVID vaccines to healthy children who are previously vaccinated or up to date on vaccines or if the announcement applies to all children regardless of vaccination status.",
      "\"I assume what he's saying is that otherwise healthy children who have been fully vaccinated don't necessarily benefit from a yearly vaccine,\" Offit said. \"If that's what he means, that's what he should say. He didn't say yearly dosing. He said 'healthy children.'\"",
      "Federal health officials also did not elaborate on what \"healthy\" children means, which the experts said is bound to lead to some confusion.",
      "Poland said this is because Kennedy has made previous public comments on the growing rate of chronic disease in children, which could mean that he considers many children \"unhealthy.\"",
      "For example, in the White House's Make America Healthy Again Commission report on chronic disease, which was published last week, it cited an unnamed study that allegedly found 77% of young Americans are ineligible for military service due to chronic conditions.",
      "\"That's saying, in effect, that 77% of the U.S. childhood population is not healthy,\" Poland said.",

      "The decision in Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County was 8-0. (Justice Neil Gorsuch recused from the case but did not explain his decision.)",
      "The dispute, the first of its kind in 20 years to reach the court, focused on the purpose of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, which requires federal agencies to study the significant environmental effects of a project and identify alternatives to mitigate any harms.",

      "Acknowledging those concerns, Justice Brett Kavanaugh writing for the majority said use of NEPA to stymie energy and infrastructure programs has gotten out of hand and needs to be curtailed.",
      "\"A 1970 legislative acorn has grown over the years into a judicial oak that has hindered infrastructure development under the guise of just a little more process,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"A course correction of sorts is appropriate to bring judicial review under NEPA back in line with the statutory text and common sense. \"",

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agreed.",
      "The groups told the Supreme Court that approving the railway could also mean heightened risk of oil spills, train spark-induced wildfires and enhanced greenhouse gas emissions nationwide.",

      "The Seven County Infrastructure Coalition, which supports the railway, said those downstream risks are too far afield and beyond the scope of the law and that the project has fallen victim of bureaucratic red tape.",
      "\"The effects from a separate project may be factually foreseeable, but that does not mean that those effects are relevant to the agency's decision making process or that it is reasonable to hold the agency responsible for those effects,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"In those circumstances, the causal chain is too attenuated.\"",

      "CPAC is holding events in Poland and Hungary this week.",
      "LONDON -- The \"Make America Great Again\" roadshow arrived in Europe this week with events in two nations where American conservatives see prime opportunities for a new transatlantic political culture -- one molded by President Donald Trump's right-wing populism and imbued with grand \"clash of civilizations\" rhetoric.",
      "The Conservative Political Action Conference -- CPAC -- opened its week of European events on Tuesday in Jasionka, Poland, where Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was among the speakers, urging Poles to vote for right-wing presidential candidate Karol Nawrocki in this weekend's runoff election.",
      "Noem eschewed the diplomatic norm of non-alignment in elections in allied nations, as have other administration officials including Vice President JD Vance. \"You will be the leaders that will turn Europe back to conservative values,\" she told attendees in Jasionka.",
      "\"We need you to elect the right leader,\" Noem said, dismissing Nawrocki's rival -- liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski -- as \"an absolute train wreck of a leader.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump is a strong leader for us, but you have an opportunity that you have just as strong of a leader in Karol if you make him the leader of this country,\" Noem said.",
      "CPAC's next stop will be in Budapest, Hungary, on Thursday, hosted by populist Prime Minister Viktor Orban -- a totem of the European anti-establishment right wing who has long enjoyed cozy relations with Trump.",
      "Peter Kreko, the director of the Political Capital Institute in Budapest, said Orban is positioning himself as \"another recipient of the MAGA soft power export.\"",
      "\"Orban is still positioning himself as someone who is exporting his campaign tactics, who can help others in terms of campaign consultancy and provide help from the United States,\" Kreko said. \"He's trading off of his good partnership with Donald Trump.\"",
      "On the web page promoting CPAC's Hungary event, the organization hit out at \"corrupt elites\" who it said \"betray all that once made us great: patriotic virtue has been replaced by internationalism, common sense by bureaucracy and tradition by woke madness.\"",
      "\"People on both sides of the Atlantic have risen up against this repackaged version of socialism, but success can only be complete when the tides of change converge and the age of patriotism begins at both poles of the West,\" CPAC wrote.",
      "Internationalism is front and center in the CPAC event agendas. Among the speakers in Budapest will be American conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, Yair Netanyahu -- the son of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Santiago Abascal, the leader of Spain's far-right Vox party.",
      "Also attending will be a host of other European conservative politicians from Poland, Austria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Denmark, France, Estonia and Greece -- among others.",
      "\"With the triumph of Donald Trump and the rise of the European Right, the Age of the Patriots of Western Civilization has begun -- CPAC Hungary 2025 will be the hub of this movement,\" the organizing website said.",
      "But the CPAC events come at a moment of peril for transatlantic relations. Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs threaten to touch off a costly trade war with the European Union.",
      "Trump has made no secret of his disdain for the bloc. \"Now we're going to charge the European Union,\" Trump said when unveiling his tariff plans in April. \"They're very tough. Very, very tough traders. You know, you think of the European Union, very friendly. They rip us off. It's so sad to see. It's so pathetic.\"",
      "Trump announced last weekend that his planned 50% tariffs on EU goods would be delayed into July. But the bloc remains on a collision course with the Trump administration.",
      "The economic and political aspirations of all EU leaders rely heavily on the bloc's own fortunes, even for those populist leaders like Orban who so often define themselves in opposition to the grand European project.",
      "The president's European offensive could yet sour budding ties between the MAGA movement and its foreign allies, if the latter's \"core interests appear directly threatened by Trumpism,\" Celia Belin, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations and head of its Paris office, told ABC News.",
      "Kati Piri, Hungarian-born member of the Dutch parliament and the Labour Party's spokesperson for foreign affairs, migration and asylum, told ABC News in a statement that \"Trump's unilateralist policies are designed to hurt all Europeans, and that so-called allies will not be spared.\"",
      "\"Trump's continued threats of tariffs on EU products and global trade wars are making him an unpopular friend to have -- and this is fragmenting the unity of the global right,\" Piri suggested.",
      "The glitz and glamour of CPAC's Budapest event will be welcome for Orban, Kreko said, as the prime minister grapples with his own domestic challenges -- not least the meteoric rise of liberal opposition leader Peter Magyar.",
      "Around 10,000 people rallied in Budapest earlier this month to protest government plans to restrict the rights of independent media organizations -- the latest in a wave of large protests against Orban and his Fidesz party government.",
      "Kreko said Orban's popularity is flagging after 15 years of uninterrupted power, even as he positions himself at the forefront of the nascent right-wing \"illiberal international.\"",
      "\"Orban is nowhere as popular as he was, let's say in 2022, when he won the last elections,\" Kreko said. \"His popularity is waning, he is having a hard time getting it back and he also uses increasingly authoritarian tools to be able to keep power.\"",
      "\"He has a hard time at home persuading his own constituency that the regime he is promoting all over the world is as powerful, as beautiful, as successful as it is seen by the MAGA camp in the United States,\" Kreko added.",
      "Trump's America has become the center of gravity of the global right-wing movement -- with the weight of the federal government and the broader national conservative movement behind it.",
      "This week Samuel Samson -- a senior advisor for the State Department's Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor -- gave an indication of the prevailing winds in American transatlantic policy, publishing an article setting out \"the need for civilizational allies in Europe.\"",
      "Claiming the existence of \"an aggressive campaign against Western civilization itself,\" Samson accused European governments of having \"devolved into a hotbed of digital censorship, mass migration, restrictions on religious freedom and numerous other assaults on democratic self-governance.\"",
      "Opening the CPAC event in Poland on Tuesday, chairman Matt Schlapp told attendees, \"The globalists intend to take each one of us out one by one -- to shame us, to silence us, to bankrupt us, to ruin us, to make our kids turn against us.\"",
      "That is why, he said, it was important to \"win all these elections, including in Poland, that are so important to the freedom of people everywhere.\"",
      "For now, Kreko suggested the transatlantic MAGA project is incomplete, as did recent election results in Romania, Portugal and the first round of Poland's presidential vote in which conservative and far-right candidates did not win power.",
      "\"What is common between Trump, Orban and many others in central and eastern Europe is that they really want to build this illiberal international,\" Kreko said.",
      "\"But at the same time, we also have to be careful about overestimating its impact,\" he said.",

      "CONCORD, N.H. -- New Hampshire Gov. Kelly Ayotte rejected on Thursday the latest request for a sentence reduction hearing from Pamela Smart, who is serving life in prison for orchestrating the murder of her husband by her teenage student in 1990.",
      "Smart, 57, was a 22-year-old high school media coordinator when she began an affair with a 15-year-old boy who later fatally shot her husband, Gregory Smart, in Derry. The shooter was freed in 2015 after serving a 25-year sentence. Though Smart denied knowledge of the plot, she was convicted of being an accomplice to first-degree murder and other crimes and sentenced to life without parole.",
      "It took until last year for Smart to take full responsibility for her husband\u2019s death. In a video released in June, she said she spent years deflecting blame \u201calmost as if it was a coping mechanism.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, Smart wrote to Ayotte and the governor\u2019s Executive Council asking for a hearing on commuting her sentence. But Ayotte, a Republican elected in November, said she has reviewed the case and decided it is not deserving of a hearing before the five-member panel.",
      "\u201cPeople who commit violent crimes must be held accountable to the law,\u201d said Ayotte, a former state attorney general. \u201cI take very seriously the action of granting a pardon hearing and believe this process should only be used in exceptional circumstances.\u201d",
      "In her letter, Smart said she has spent the last 35 years \u201cbecoming a person who can and will be a contributing member of society.\u201d Calling herself \u201cwhat rehabilitation looks like,\u201d she noted that she has taken responsibility for her husband\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cI have apologized to Gregg\u2019s family and my own for the life taken and for my life denied to my parents and family for all these long years,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Smart\u2019s trial was a media circus and one of America\u2019s first high-profile cases about a sexual affair between a school staff member and a student. The student, William Flynn, testified that Smart told him she needed her husband killed because she feared she would lose everything if they divorced. Flynn and three other teens cooperated with prosecutors and all have since been released.",
      "The case inspired Joyce Maynard's 1992 book \u201cTo Die For\u201d and the 1995 film of the same name, starring Nicole Kidman and Joaquin Phoenix.",

      "It\u2019s a quiet exit after a turbulent entrance, and he's trailed by upheaval and unmet expectations. Thousands of people were indiscriminately laid off or pushed out \u2014 hundreds of whom had to be rehired \u2014 and some federal agencies were eviscerated.",
      "But no one has been prosecuted for the fraud that Musk and Trump said was widespread within the government. Musk reduced his target for cutting spending from $2 trillion to $1 trillion to $150 billion, and even that goal may not be reached.",
      "In Silicon Valley, where Musk got his start as a founder of PayPal, his kind of promises are known as vaporware \u2014 a product that sounds extraordinary yet never gets shipped to market.",
      "Trump, who once called Musk \u201ca truly great American\u201d and \u201ca patriot,\u201d said nothing about the departure. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said: \u201cWe thank him for his service.\u201d",
      "Musk's position was always designed to be temporary, and he had previously announced his intention to dedicate more of his time to his companies. But he also told reporters last month that he was willing to work part-time for Trump \u201cindefinitely, as long as the president wants me to do it.\u201d",
      "It was clear that Musk wouldn\u2019t be the typical kind of presidential adviser around the time that he showed the world his belly button.",
      "Racing on stage at a campaign rally one month before the election, he jumped for joy next to Trump, his T-shirt rising to expose his midriff. Musk had already sold Trump on his idea for a Department of Government Efficiency while also putting at least $250 million behind his candidacy.",
      "The plan called for a task force to hunt for waste, fraud and abuse, a timeworn idea with a new twist. Instead of putting together a blue-ribbon panel of government experts, Trump would give his top donor a desk in the White House and what appeared to be carte blanche to make changes.",
      "Musk deployed software engineers who burrowed into sensitive databases, troubling career officials who sometimes chose to resign rather than go along. Trump brushed off concerns about Musk\u2019s lack of experience in public service or conflicts of interest from his billions of dollars in federal contracts.",
      "Their unlikely partnership had the potential for a generational impact on American politics and government. While Musk dictated orders for government departments from his perch in the White House, he was poised to use his wealth to enforce loyalty to the president.",
      "His language was that of catastrophism. Excessive spending was a crisis that could only be solved by drastic measures, Musk claimed, and \u201cif we don\u2019t do this, America will go bankrupt.\u201d",
      "But even though he talked about his work in existential terms, he treated the White House like a playground. He brought his children to a meeting with the Indian prime minister. He let the president turn the driveway into a makeshift Tesla showroom to help boost sales. He installed an oversized screen in his office that he occasionally used to play video games.",
      "Sometimes, Trump invited Musk to sleep over in the Lincoln Bedroom.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll be on Air Force One, Marine One, and he\u2019ll be like, \u2018do you want to stay over?\u2019\u201d Musk told reporters. The president made sure he got some caramel ice cream from the kitchen. \u201cThis stuff\u2019s amazing,\u201d Musk said. \u201cI ate a whole tub of it.\u201d",
      "Looking back on his experience in government, he described it as a lark.",
      "\u201cIt is funny that we\u2019ve got DOGE,\u201d an acronym that references an online meme featuring a surprised-looking dog from Japan. \u201cHow did we get here?\u201d",
      "From the beginning, Musk treated federal workers with contempt. At best, they were inefficient; at worst, they were committing fraud.",
      "His team offered them a \u201cfork in the road,\u201d meaning they could get paid to quit. Probationary employees, generally people new on the job without full civil service protection, were shown the door.",
      "Anyone who stayed faced escalating demands, such as what became known as the \u201cfive things\u201d emails. Musk wanted every government employee to submit a list of five things they accomplished in the previous week, and he claimed that \u201cfailure to respond will be taken as a resignation.\u201d",
      "Some administration officials curtailed the plan, concerned that it could jeopardize security in more sensitive areas of the government, and it eventually faded, an early sign of Musk\u2019s struggle to get traction.",
      "But in the meantime, he continued issuing orders like thunderbolts.",
      "One day in February, Musk posted \u201cCFPB RIP,\u201d plus an emoji of a tombstone. The headquarters of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, created after the Great Recession to protect Americans from fraud and deceptive practices, was shut down and employees were ordered to stop working.",
      "Musk had already started gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development, a pillar of the country\u2019s foreign policy establishment and the world\u2019s largest provider of humanitarian assistance.",
      "\u201cSpent the weekend feeding USAID into a wood chipper,\u201d he bragged.",
      "Thousands of contacts were cut off, pleasing conservatives who disliked the agency\u2019s progressive initiatives on climate change and gay rights.",
      "Musk rejected concerns about the loss of a crucial lifeline for impoverished people around the globe, saying, \u201cno one has died.\u201d However, children who once relied on American assistance perished from malnutrition, and the death toll is expected to increase.",
      "The lawsuits began piling up. Sometimes workers got their jobs back, only to lose them again.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration, which is responsible for ensuring the safety of everything from baby formula to biotech drugs, planned to lay off 3,500 employees. But again and again, the agency was forced to rehire people who were initially deemed expendable, including laboratory scientists, travel bookers and document specialists.",
      "Commissioner Marty Makary, who started his job after many of the cuts took place, told attendees at a recent conference that \u201cit was hard and my job is to make sure we can heal from that.\u201d",
      "Only 1,900 layoffs took place, but another 1,200 staffers took buyouts or early retirement. Experts fear the agency has lost much of its institutional knowledge and expertise in areas like vaccines, tobacco and food.",
      "There are also concerns about safety on public lands. The National Park Service has been bleeding staff, leaving fewer people to maintain trails, clean restrooms and guide visitors. More cuts at the Forest Service could undermine efforts to prevent and fight wildfires.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency faces a broad overhaul, such as gutting the Office of Research and Development, which was responsible for improving air pollution monitoring and discovering harmful chemicals in drinking water.",
      "Not even low-profile organizations were exempt. Trump ordered the downsizing of the U.S. Institute of Peace, a nonprofit think tank created by Congress, and Musk\u2019s team showed up to carry out his plan. The organizations' leaders were deposed, then reinstated after a court battle.",
      "The bulk of federal spending goes to health care programs like Medicaid and Medicare, plus Social Security and the military.",
      "Unfortunately for Musk, all of those areas are politically sensitive and generally require congressional approval to make changes.",
      "Thousands of civilian workers were pushed out at the Pentagon, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is reducing the ranks of top generals and looking to consolidate various commands. A plan to downsize an office for testing and evaluating new weapons systems could save $300 million per year. Hegseth recently asked employees to submit one idea per week for cutting waste.",
      "However, the Pentagon budget would increase by $150 billion, for a total of more than $900 billion, under Trump\u2019s spending proposal working its way through Congress. The money includes $25 billion to lay the groundwork for Trump\u2019s \u201cgolden dome\u201d missile defense program and $34 billion to expand the naval fleet with more shipbuilding.",
      "Another $45 million is expected to be spent on a military parade on June 14, which is the 250th anniversary of the Army\u2019s founding and Trump\u2019s 79th birthday.",
      "Musk also faced blowback for targeting Social Security, which provides monthly benefits to retirees and some children. He suggested that the popular program was \u201ca Ponzi scheme\u201d and the government could save between $500 billion and $700 billion by tackling waste and fraud.",
      "However, his estimates were inflated. Social Security\u2019s inspector general said there was only $71.8 billion in improper payments over eight years. Nor was there any evidence that millions of dead people were receiving benefits.",
      "Changes to Social Security phone services, pitched as a way to eliminate opportunities for fraud, were walked back after an outcry from lawmakers and beneficiaries. But the agency could still shed 7,000 workers while closing some of its offices.",
      "Musk\u2019s popularity cratered even though Americans often agreed with his premise that the federal government is bloated and wasteful, according to polling from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Just 33% of U.S. adults had a favorable view of Musk in April, down from 41% in December. In addition, 65% said Musk had too much influence over the federal government.",
      "During a campaign rally in October, Musk said he could find \u201cat least $2 trillion\u201d in spending cuts. In January, before Trump was inaugurated, he revised by saying, \u201cif we try for $2 trillion, we\u2019ve got a good shot at getting one.\u201d",
      "But in April, at a Cabinet meeting, Musk provided a different target. He was \u201cexcited to announce\u201d that they could reach $150 billion in savings during the current fiscal year.",
      "Whether that figure proves to be accurate is difficult to measure, especially because DOGE routinely inflated or mischaracterized its work. But it falls short of President Bill Clinton\u2019s initiative three decades ago, which resulted in $136 billion in savings \u2014 the equivalent of more than $240 billion today.",
      "Elaine Kamarck, a key figure in the Clinton administration, said they focused on making the government more responsive and updating antiquated internal procedures. The work took years.",
      "\u201cWe went about it methodically, department by department,\u201d she said. The effort also reduced the federal workforce by more than 400,000 employees.",
      "However, Musk did little to seek insight from people who knew the inner workings of government.",
      "\u201cThey made some changes without really knowing what they were doing,\u201d said Alex Nowrasteh, vice president for economic and social policy studies for the libertarian think tank Cato Institute. He said there were \u201ca lot of unforced errors.\u201d",
      "In the end, Nowrasteh said, \u201cthey set themselves up for failure.\u201d",

      "A little-known federal court threw a giant monkey wrench into a foundational part of President Donald Trump\u2019s economic agenda by striking down most of the sweeping tariffs he has imposed since taking office",
      "WASHINGTON -- A little-known federal court threw a giant monkey wrench into a foundational part of President Donald Trump's economic agenda by striking down most of the sweeping tariffs he has imposed since taking office.",
      "The Court of International Trade, based in New York, on late Wednesday said that Trump had overstepped his authority by using a 1977 law, the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, to justify tariffs on Canada, Mexico, China, and more than 50 other nations.",
      "The CIT typically deals with more obscure and highly-technical issues surrounding tariffs and trade policies, and rarely deals with cases of such magnitude. It handles trade-related disputes from all over the country, and as a result sits outside the standard federal court structure of district courts and appellate circuit courts.",
      "Nine judges sit on the court, and most of its cases are handled by just one of those judges. But three judges considered the challenge to Trump's tariffs, which typically happens when a case involves \u201cthe constitutionality of an act of Congress, a Presidential proclamation, or an Executive order, or otherwise has broad and significant implications,\u201d the court says on its website.",
      "Its decisions can be appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and then to the Supreme Court. The Trump administration has already said it will appeal.",
      "Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary, sharply criticized the decision, saying that the members of the three-judge panel \u201cbrazenly abused their judicial power to usurp the authority of President Trump\u201d and added that the courts \u201cshould have no role here.\u201d",
      "Leavitt said the president\u2019s tariff policies are \u201clegally sound and grounded in common sense.\u201d",
      "Yet many trade and legal experts said that at least parts of the CIT's ruling would likely stand up under scrutiny.",
      "Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that the decision striking down Trump's 10% universal tariffs, as well as his so-called reciprocal tariffs on more than 50 countries, would likely withstand appeal. That's because, as the CIT pointed out, those duties are intended to counter trade deficits the United States has with those countries.",
      "Yet Congress specifically said that duties to address trade imbalances must be applied under a different law, not IEEPA. That law allows a maximum of 15% tariff for up to 150 days.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s airtight because there\u2019s no way around the reasoning,\u201d Alden said, \u201cwhich is Congress controls tariffs and Congress quite explicitly delegated the authority\u201d to a separate law.",
      "Trump said that his duties on Canada, Mexico, and some of the tariffs on China were in response to those countries' alleged shortcomings in combatting illegal drugs and unauthorized immigration. It's possible that other judges will find that the president has the authority to impose those tariffs under the IEEPA law, Alden said.",
      "Some of Trump\u2019s duties \u2014 those on steel, aluminum, and cars \u2014 will remain in place because they rely on separate laws that weren\u2019t challenged. Many economists have said that Trump could seek to re-impose many of his tariffs under a range of other laws that authorize tariffs, though usually after a legal process that can take a few months.",

      "Stephens asked the state Supreme Court to pick one of two federal legal tests used for Second Amendment challenges, \u201cstrict scrutiny\" or \u201chistory and tradition,\u201d to evaluate whether Georgia's law is constitutional. The decision, written by Justice Andrew Pinson, says those standards are \u201cnot viable substitutes\u201d for determining what the text of the state Constitution originally meant.

      "The State Department has notified Congress of an updated reorganization of the massive agency",
      "WASHINGTON -- The State Department on Thursday notified Congress of an updated reorganization of the massive agency, proposing cuts to programs beyond what had previously been revealed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and a steeper 18% reduction of staff in the U.S.",
      "The planned changes, detailed in a notification letter obtained by The Associated Press, reflect the Trump administration's push to reshape American diplomacy and scale back the size of the federal government.",
      "The proposal includes an even higher reduction of domestic staff than the 15% initially floated in April. The department also is planning to eliminate some divisions tasked with oversight of America's two-decade involvement in Afghanistan, including an office focused on resettling Afghan nationals who worked alongside the U.S. military.",
      "The letter sent to Congress by the State Department notes that the reorganization will affect more than 300 bureaus and offices \u201cto refocus on core U.S. foreign policy objectives and the needs of contemporary diplomacy.\u201d The department says it's eliminating offices it describes as doing unclear or overlapping work and that Rubio \u201cbelieves that effective modern diplomacy requires streamlining this bloated bureaucracy.\u201d",
      "The document is clear that the reorganization also is intended to eliminate programs, particularly those related to refugees and immigration as well as human rights and democracy promotion, that the Trump administration believes have become ideologically driven in a way that is incompatible with its priorities and policies. It says, without evidence, that such offices \u201chave proven themselves prone to ideological capture and radicalism.\u201d",
      "Some of the bureaus set to be cut include the Office of Global Women\u2019s Issues and the State Department\u2019s diversity and inclusion efforts, which have been eliminated government-wide under Trump. The letter says the women's issues office is being eliminated to \u201censure that promoting women\u2019s rights and empowerment is a priority across the full scope of the Department\u2019s diplomatic engagement.\u201d",
      "Efforts to cut the department's Afghan programs received immediate backlash from veterans groups and advocates who have spent the last three and a half years since the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan working to resettle and integrate Afghans into life in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThis is not streamlining,\u201d said Shawn VanDiver, a Navy veteran and head of #AfghanEvac. \u201cThis is deliberate dismantling.\u201d",
      "CARE, which stands for the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts, was created in October 2021 in the aftermath of the withdrawal. The office was designed to help Afghans, like interpreters who aided the U.S. military, who were eligible for resettlement in the U.S. due to their work helping America during the war.",
      "The State Department notification says its work will be \u201crealigned\u201d to the Afghanistan Affairs Office.",
      "Over time, CARE was credited with streamlining visa and immigration processes that many people helping Afghans and Iraqis, who benefited from similar resettlement programs, said were overly bureaucratic, opaque and left at-risk Afghans waiting for far too long on programs specifically intended to help them.",
      "In December, then-President Joe Biden signed the National Defense Authorization Act, which included a provision authorizing the CARE office for three years, but ever since President Donald Trump took office, concerns have loomed over the office\u2019s future.",
      "\u201cEliminating it \u2014 without public explanation, transition planning, or reaffirmation of mission \u2014 is a profound betrayal of American values and promises,\u201d VanDiver added.",

      "The prosecution is resting in the second trial of Karen Read after attorneys for the state of Massachusetts took a more streamlined approach to try to prove Read\u2019s guilt in the killing of her Boston police officer boyfriend",
      "The prosecution in the second trial of Karen Read rested Thursday after about a month of testimony spotlighting evidence from the scene and witnesses who heard the defendant repeatedly say \u201cI hit him\u201d in reference to the killing of her Boston police officer boyfriend.",
      "Read, 45, is accused of backing her SUV into her boyfriend, John O\u2019Keefe, and leaving the 46-year-old officer to die on a snowy night in the front yard of another officer\u2019s home after she dropped him off at a party there in January 2022. Her lawyers say she was framed in a police conspiracy and someone in the home that night killed him.",
      "A mistrial was declared last year and the second trial has attracted massive media attention and become the subject of a Hulu documentary series. Read\u2019s second trial on charges of second-degree murder, manslaughter and leaving the scene has often looked similar to the first trial. If she is found guilty of the most serious charge of second-degree murder, she could spend the rest of her life in prison.",
      "The prosecution, led this time by Hank Brennan, has taken a more streamlined, focused approach.",
      "Unlike the first trial where witness after witness undermined the prosecution's case, Brennan did everything to avoid those mistakes. Most significantly, he refrained from putting Michael Proctor, the lead investigator in the case, on the stand.",
      "Proctor was fired in March after a disciplinary board found he sent sexist and crude text messages about Read to his family and colleagues. His testimony played a key role in the first trial. Defense attorneys used his text messages to attempt to show Proctor was biased and ignored the possibility of other suspects.",
      "Brennan also didn't put Brian Albert, the Boston officer who owned the house where O'Keefe's body was found, on the stand. He also passed on putting on Brian Higgins, a federal agent who had exchanged flirty texts with Read, on the stand.",
      "All three testified in the first trial and could be called by the defense as it seeks to show O'Keefe was beaten at the house party hosted by Albert and left outside to die.",
      "Read\u2019s attorney, Alan Jackson, still managed to raise concerns about Higgins and Proctor.",
      "During the cross-examination of Massachusetts State Police Sgt. Yuriy Bukhenik, he made him read all the flirtatious texts between Higgins and Read.",
      "Jackson also brought up a text message chain with Bukhenik in which Proctor said, \u201cI hate that man, I truly hate him\u201d about David Yannetti, an attorney for Read.",
      "Broken pieces of Read's taillight. A broken cocktail glass. Read's words the scene.",
      "Prosecutors have spent much of the trial building their case through evidence from the scene. Like before, they started by introducing several law enforcement witnesses who were among the first responders and recalled hearing Read repeatedly say \u201cI hit him\u201d after she found O'Keefe.",
      "They also played several clips of interviews Read has done since the first trial, in which she talked about how much she drank and made comments suggesting she knew what she did. She also talked about pulling a piece of glass from O'Keefe's nose.",
      "\u201cCould I have clipped him? Could I have tapped him in the knee and incapacitated him?\u201d she said during an interview for a documentary on the case. \u201cHe didn\u2019t look mortally wounded, as far as I could see\u201d but \u201ccould I have done something that knocked him out and in his drunkenness and in the cold didn\u2019t come to again.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors called a neurosurgeon who testified O\u2019Keefe suffered a \u201cclassic blunt trauma injury\u201d associated with falling backward and hitting the back of his head.",
      "Prosecutors also showed jurors pieces of the Read's broken taillight, which they say was damaged when she hit O'Keefe. The defense argues the taillight was damaged later when she was backing out of O'Keefe's house and hit O'Keefe's car.",
      "Prosecutors also introduced evidence of a broken cocktail glass, found at the scene, which they said O'Keefe was holding when Read backed into him.",
      "Andre Porto, a forensic scientist who works in the DNA unit of the Massachusetts State Police Crime Lab, detailed various items he tested, including the broken rear taillight and pieces of a broken cocktail glass found in in the yard. Only O'Keefe was a likely match for both.",
      "Porto found three DNA contributors but only O\u2019Keefe was a likely match. He also tested DNA from parts of a broken cocktail glass found in the yard and only O\u2019Keefe was seen as a likely match. Porto also tested a hair found on the taillight.",
      "Later in the trial, analyst Karl Miyasako of Bode Technology testified that tests of the hair sample taken from Read\u2019s vehicle found a mitochondrial DNA match to O\u2019Keefe. He said that means the DNA could be a match to O\u2019Keefe or any one of his maternal relatives.",
      "The trial could easily continue several more weeks as Read's defense team makes its case. Read has said the defense's case will be \u201cmore robust\u201d this time. It listed over 90 witnesses who could testify.",
      "\u201cI'm anxious for everyone to learn what we know,\u201d she said last week.",
      "Read's defense has vigorously questioned the prosecution's witnesses and called into question evidence presented about O'Keefe's death. During opening statements in April, Brennan said Read \u201cadmitted what she did that night\u201d and pointed to a television interview in which Read said \u201ccould I have clipped him?\u201d about O'Keefe's death.",

      "The U.S. Constitution guarantees that they don't have to. Jurors are told that they can't hold such silence against defendants and that it's up to prosecutors to prove their case; defendants do not need to prove anything.

      "Officials say that nearly a year after a search was suspended for a family of four missing after the boat they were on capsized in waters off Alaska, the vessel along with human remains have been found",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Nearly a year after the U.S. Coast Guard suspended the search for a family of four missing after the boat they were on capsized in waters off south-central Alaska, the vessel along with human remains have been found, officials said Wednesday.",
      "The discovery came after three private Alaska companies, including one that uses sonar equipment to search underwater, offered in April to help look for the family, who are from Texas, according to a statement released by the Alaska Department of Public Safety.",
      "Earlier this month, they found the missing boat along with human remains in 180 feet (55 meters) of water in Kachemak Bay near Homer, the department said.",
      "Divers from the state were then able to recover three sets of remains from the sunken vessel during dives on Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "The remains have been taken to the State Medical Examiner\u2019s Office to perform autopsies and identify them, according to the public safety department. It did not say how long identifying the remains would take.",
      "The missing family from Troy, Texas, includes Mary Maynard, 37, and David Maynard, 42, along with sons Colton, 11, and Brantley, 8, according to the statement.",
      "The search for the family was launched in August after a report came in that a 28-foot (8.5-meter) aluminum boat carrying eight people had begun taking on water, the U.S. Coast Guard said at the time. The Coast Guard notified other ships in the area of the situation, and a boat nearby rescued four people.",
      "The Coast Guard scoured Kachemak Bay and Alaska search and rescue crews tried to use sonar equipment to find the family, according to the state's public safety department. But they were not successful and by the next evening, the search was suspended.",
      "Christi Wells, who provided a statement on behalf of Mary Maynard\u2019s parents at the time, said the family enjoyed spending time with friends and relatives, and traveling, according to the Anchorage Daily News. Mary Maynard was a traveling nurse and David Maynard stayed at home with the children and had a lawn care business, she said.",

      "Harvard University is holding it commencement Thursday",
      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Harvard University is holding its commencement Thursday at a pivotal moment, when its place as one of the world's leading higher education institutions is under what increasingly seems like existential threats from the Trump administration.",
      "Other schools face the loss of federal funding and their ability to enroll international students if they don't agree to the Trump administration's shifting demands. But Harvard, which was founded in 1636, a century and a half before the nation itself, is taking the lead on defying the White House in federal court \u2014 and paying a significant price.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s latest salvos include asking federal agencies to cancel about $100 million in contracts with the Ivy League school. The government already canceled more than $2.6 billion in federal research grants, moved to cut off Harvard\u2019s enrollment of international students and threatened its tax-exempt status.",
      "Visa interviews for international students admitted to schools nationwide were halted on Tuesday, and Trump said Wednesday that Harvard should reduce its international enrollment from 25% to about 15%.",
      "Sustained by a $53 billion endowment, the nation\u2019s oldest and wealthiest university is testing whether it can be a bulwark against Trump\u2019s efforts to limit what it calls antisemitic activism on campus, which Harvard sees as an affront to the freedom to teach and learn nationwide.",
      "The Trump administration has demanded Harvard enact broad government and leadership reforms and changes to its admissions policies. It also demanded the university audit views of diversity on campus and stop recognizing some student clubs.",
      "Dr. Abraham Verghese, the bestselling author and Stanford expert on infectious diseases, will be the principal speaker at the university's 374th commencement. On Wednesday, NBA Hall of Famer and activist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was the \u201cClass Day\u201d speaker, and journalist Christiane Amanpour addressed graduates of Harvard's Kennedy School.",
      "Both praised Harvard for standing up to the Trump administration, with Abdul-Jabbar specifically calling out the actions of Harvard President Alan Garber.",
      "\u201cWhen a tyrannical administration tried to bully and threaten Harvard, to revoke their academic freedom and to destroy free speech, Dr. Alan Garber rejected the illegal and immoral pressures,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said to wide applause as he compared Garber's response to Rosa Parks' stand against racist segregation.",
      "\u201cAfter seeing so many cowering billionaires, media moguls, law firms, politicians and other universities bend their knee to an administration that is systematically strip-mining the U.S. Constitution, it is inspiring to me to see Harvard University take a stand for freedom,\" he continued.",
      "In response to the administration's threats, Harvard has sued to block the funding freeze and persuaded a federal judge to temporarily halt the enrollment ban. It is going to court in Boston on Thursday just as the commencement is wrapping up, hoping for a ruling that allows it to continue enrolling international students.",
      "\u201cWe believe that the government overreach and devastating attacks on scientific and medical research are unwarranted and unlawful, and so we have taken legal action to defend the institution,\u201d Garber said in an interview with a university publication.",
      "\u201cWe should all be concerned that colleges and universities have increasingly come under attack. But we should not dismiss the criticisms even when they are based on distortions or inaccuracies \u2014 we need to look for the underlying concerns that can be embedded in them,\u201d said Garber, who commissioned internal reports last year on antisemitism and anti-Arab prejudice at the Ivy League campus.",
      "The Trump administration has said it wants \"to protect American students and faculty from antisemitic violence and harassment.\u201d It cites campus protests against Israel. Like many college students around the country, Harvard students set up tents called on the university to divest from companies supporting Israel's military, which has leveled Gaza in response to attacks by Hamas.",
      "Last year, hundreds of graduating students walked out of commencement chanting \u201cFree, free Palestine\u201d after weeks of campus protests. Harvard also said some protesters would not receive diplomas alongside their classmates, although it eventually allowed most to get them.",
      "This year, the anti-war demonstrations have largely faded from view, but protesters plan a silent vigil before Thursday's ceremony.",
      "\u201cAs a graduate of Harvard, I am horrified by Israel\u2019s mass murder of Palestinians (including by deliberate starvation), its total leveling of Gaza, its targeting of hospitals, its assaults on Palestinian educational and cultural institutions, and its relentless killings of journalists,\" Harvard graduate Victor Wallis explained in a statement.",

      "In 2024, Gaulden was sentenced by a federal judge in Utah after he acknowledged possessing weapons despite being a convicted felon. He reached an agreement that resolved Utah state charges against him and settled two sets of federal charges against him \u2014 one carried a 23-month sentence and the other ordered five years of probation and a $200,000 fine.",
      "Gaulden was released from federal prison in March and sent to home confinement after receiving credit for time served, according to his attorney Drew Findling.

      "NEW YORK -- A big rally for stocks that began in Asia on Thursday is easing off the accelerator amid uncertainty about what will happen next after a U.S. court blocked many of President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 0.1 % in afternoon trading after giving up most of an earlier gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 25 points, or 0.1%, as of 2:28 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was mostly unchanged.",
      "It's a downshift after stocks initially leaped nearly 2% in Tokyo and Seoul, where markets had the first chance to react to the ruling late Wednesday by the U.S. Court of International Trade. It said that the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act that Trump cited for ordering massive increases in taxes on imports from around the world does not authorize the use of tariffs.",
      "The ruling raised hopes in financial markets that a hamstrung Trump would not be able to drive the economy into a recession with his tariffs, which had threatened to grind down on global trade and raise prices for consumers already sick of high inflation. Trump has said he wants to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, and he warned the process could cause some pain for U.S. households.",
      "But the White House filed notice of appeal, and the long-term outcome of legal disputes over tariffs remains uncertain. The court\u2019s ruling also affects only some of Trump\u2019s tariffs, not those on foreign steel, aluminum and autos, which were invoked under a different law.",
      "Trump \u201cis still able to impose significant and wide-ranging tariffs over the longer-term through other means,\u201d according to Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer of global equities at UBS Global Wealth Management.",
      "Such uncertainty helped dampen the excitement in financial markets as trading headed through Europe into the United States, where the moves were much more modest than in Asia. The U.S. court's move was nevertheless seen as a positive for financial markets.",
      "\u201cThe bar is raised for President Trump to resurrect his tariffs,\u201d said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management.",
      "\u201cMarkets are pricing that this is a better type of uncertainty than what we\u2019ve had since Liberation Day,\u201d which is what Trump called his April 2 announcement of a worldwide set of sweeping tariffs.",
      "The S&P 500 has pulled within 4% of its all-time high after dropping roughly 20% below at one point last month.",
      "On Wall Street, tech stocks led the way after Nvidia once again topped analysts\u2019 expectations for profit and revenue in the latest quarter.",
      "The chip company has grown into one of the U.S. stock market\u2019s largest and most influential stocks because of the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology, and its 2.9% rise was the strongest force by far lifting the S&P 500.",
      "C3ai, an AI application software company, jumped 24.2% after it reported stronger profit than analysts expected for its latest quarter. It also said the U.S. Air Force increased the maximum possible value for its contract by $350 million to $450 million. The company's revenue last quarter totaled $108.7 million.",
      "E.l.f. Beauty was another big winner and rose 24.9% after the cosmetics company delivered a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also said it agreed to buy Hailey Bieber\u2019s Rhode skincare brand in a $1 billion deal. Rhode had $212 million in net sales in the 12 months through March.",
      "Bieber, a model and the wife of singer Justin Bieber, will be Rhode\u2019s chief creative officer and head of innovation and also a strategic advisor to the combined companies.",
      "They helped offset a drop for Best Buy, which fell 8.7% even though it reported a stronger profit than expected. Its revenue fell short of analysts\u2019 forecasts.",
      "The electronics retailer also cut its forecasted ranges for revenue and profit over the full year on the assumption that \u201ctariffs stay at the current levels for the rest of the year, and there is no material change in consumer behavior from the trends we have seen in recent quarters,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Matt Bilunas said.",
      "Many companies have recently said that the uncertainty caused by tariffs is making it too difficult to offer any financial forecasts for the upcoming year.",
      "In the bond market, Treasury yields eased following some mixed reports on the economy. One said that the U.S. economy likely shrunk by less in the first three months of the year than earlier estimated. Another said slightly more U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week than economists expected.",
      "The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.43% from 4.47% late Wednesday. The two-year Treasury yield, which moves more closely with expectations for where the Federal Reserve will take overnight interest rates, slipped to 3.94% from 3.96%.",
      "In stock markets abroad, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.9% to help lead Asian markets higher, while stocks rose 1.4% in Hong Kong and 0.7% in Shanghai. South Korea's Kospi rallied 1.9% after the Bank of Korea cut its key interest rate to ease pressure on the economy.",
      "The moves for European stocks were much more muted. France\u2019s CAC 40 fell 0.1%, and Germany\u2019s DAX swung from an early gain to a dip of 0.4%.",

He was sentenced to serve 12 years in prison, followed by eight years of probation. He appealed his conviction of aggravated assault and one count of violation of his oath, and the Georgia Court of Appeals last year overturned those convictions.",
      "Before trial, Olsen's lawyers had argued that the DeKalb County Police Department\u2019s use of force policy should not be submitted as evidence. The appeals court agreed that the trial court was wrong to admit the policy into evidence without identifying and redacting the portions that conflict with Georgia law.",

      "State and local officials have generally disputed Hutson\u2019s characterization of the $150 million state-of-the-art facility built in 2015 and blamed the sheriff\u2019s leadership since taking office in 2022. The jail system has been under the oversight of a federal judge and the U.S. Justice Department since 2013.",
      "\u201cThese recurring plumbing issues highlight a much deeper infrastructure crisis at OJC, rooted in years of deferred maintenance, chronic overcrowding, and a lack of meaningful investment,\u201d Hutson said in statement Wednesday. \u201cThis is not just a facilities problem. It\u2019s a public safety issue, a staffing issue, and most of all, a human dignity issue.\u201d",
      "The sheriff's office renewed calls this week for \u201cimmediate and sustained infrastructure investment,\u201d saying jail flooding and other issues were both \u201cforeseeable and preventable.\u201d It said it requires at least $13 million in urgent fixes and that requests for help have been made repeatedly to city officials.",
      "But New Orleans City Council members questioned management of the jail last week during a tense meeting and argued the sheriff's office requires greater transparency and accountability. The city's chief administrative officer also noted the department has received a larger proportionate increase in funding since 2019 than any other public safety agency in the city.",
      "The longstanding debate over how to improve the city's jail system persists as two inmates remain at large. The group of fugitives escaped in the early hours of May 16 by yanking open a jail door, removing a toilet and crawling through a hole in the wall where steel bars had been cut away, then hopping over barbed-wire fencing using blankets.",
      "Authorities say the inmates were able to escape because a maintenance worker, Sterling Williams, turned off the water in the cell after an inmate allegedly threatened to shank him.",
      "Williams' lawyer Michael Kennedy has said the plumber was not threatened and had only turned off the water after being told to do so by a deputy. Williams was unaware that the inmates intentionally clogged the toilet as part of an orchestrated plan to escape, Kennedy said. Authorities have made no mention of the cell having a clogged toilet.",
      "Over the weekend \u2014 in a seemingly unrelated incident \u2014 the jail received \u201cemergency repairs\u201d as water pooled and the facility remains forced to rely on an \u201cexternal water supply\" as of Wednesday, the sheriff's office said.",
      "Flooding in the jail has been exacerbated by inmates' \u201cmisuse the plumbing system\u201d such as flushing \u201cinappropriate items\u201d down the toilet, the sheriff's office added.",
      "While the Orleans Justice Center is only a decade old, dysfunction has long plagued the city\u2019s jail system.",

To \"Survivor\" watchers, White was a fan favorite \u2014 but to another fandom, his name rings a different bell. He is also the creator of the hit HBO show \"The White Lotus.\"",
      "On the reality competition series, White was shipped off to an exotic land and forced to deal with the challenges that come with being surrounded by strangers. The theme of \"The White Lotus\" is not far off. Each season of the scripted show is set in a different faraway destination at a fictional White Lotus resort, where the worlds of the often ostentatious guests collide \u2014 in an over-the-top fashion.",
      "Unbeknownst to many, White has stealthily combined \"Survivor\" and \"The White Lotus\" by casting former contestants of the long-running reality show as extras on the drama series.

      "Merlino appeared alongside White on Season 37 of \"Survivor\" in Fiji, a season dubbed \"Survivor: David vs. Goliath\" because it pitted underdogs and overachievers against each other. Merlino, who started on Team Goliath, was voted out ninth while White, also originally playing as a Goliath, was runner up.",
      "Each season of \"White Louts\" has a different cast with new plot lines, but White likes to bring people back, surprising the audience with the recurring characters. Merlino's character stayed in Maui. But during Season Two, set in Italy, more \"Survivor\" contestants showed up.",
      "Angela Keeley and Kara Kay",

      "On the \"RHAP: We Know Scripted TV\" podcast, Hubicki explained he and his girlfriend, Emily \u2014 who also made a small appearance on \"Survivor\" when loved ones were allowed to visit contestants \u2014 were already planning a trip to Japan for a conference.",
      "\"I was like, 'Wait they'll be filming in Thailand while we are in Japan for this trip,'\" he said, adding that White had given \"Survivor\" casemates an open invitation to stop by the \"The White Louts\" if they ever found themselves nearby. \"So, we were like, 'What if we went there?'\"",

      "During a recent interview on Apple Music's \"The Zane Lowe Show,\" the singer, 32, described the disorder as \"abuse of the vocal cords.\"",
      "\"Being 21 and staying up and drinking and smoking and partying after every show does not help. But also, in my case, it does not cause it. My voice always sounded like this, so it's a part of my unique anatomy,\" she explained. \"So I have this very large polyp on my vocal cord, which has given me a lot of the tone and the texture that has made me who I am.\"",
      "But it also makes touring challenging because the condition creates the \"ultimate vocal fry,\" Cyrus said.",
      "Here's what to know about the disorder.",

      "Reinke's edema, also known as polypoid corditis or vocal cord edema, is the swelling of your vocal cords, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "Though it's most common in people with a long-term history of smoking, it can also occur in people with chronic acid reflux or repetitive vocal trauma.",
      "Certain types of Reinke's edema can lead to polyp-like growths on one or both vocal folds, the clinic adds.",
      "Reinke's edema is also rare, the clinic notes, affecting less than 1% of the general population.",
      "Reinke's edema symptoms",
      "Symptoms of the disorder include changes in vocal quality or loudness, a gradual deepening of the voice as well as hoarseness or raspiness, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "Cyrus said that it can make live performances physically taxing for her.",
      "\"It's extremely difficult to perform with because it's like running a marathon with ankle weights on,\" she said. \"Even when I'm talking sometimes, at the end of the day, I'll call my mom, and she'll go, 'Oh you sound like you're talking through a radio,' and that's how you know I'm really tired because it creates that like ultimate vocal fry.\"",
      "\"My voice is super unique because of it,\" she added.",
      "Reinke's edema treatment",
      "There are a number of ways to treat Reinke's edema, including nonsurgical and surgical options. The Cleveland Clinic notes surgical options include laser therapy to remove vocal fold growths as well as microlaryngoscopy, where a surgeon removes swollen tissue with small tools and a microscope.",
      "Nonsurgical options include speech therapy and treating underlying causes, including quitting smoking or taking medication to reduce acid reflux.",
      "Cyrus said she's \"not willing to sever it because the chance of waking up from a surgery and not sounding like myself is a probability.\"",

      "More than 100,000 kitchen faucets have been recalled because they could lead to dangerous levels of lead exposure according to three separate\u00a0notices posted Thursday by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "Three different faucets models, manufactured in China and sold under the brands Vfauosit, Kicimpro and Basdehen, were determined unsafe after tests revealed they contain lead that could leak into the water supply and cause harm to young infants and children. No injuries have been reported thus far.",
      "Lead ingestion can \"cause harmful neurological effects on infants and young children, including attention-related behavioral problems, decreased cognitive performance and lower IQ,\" the CPSC says in the recall notices.",
      "The recalled faucets were sold for roughly $40 on Amazon.com between January 2024 and May 2025 by vendors Whisper08, Kicimpro and Chenfeng Store. The recalls, issued on May 29, affect an estimated 103,000 products. Amazon and two of the vendors are contacting known customers who purchased the items directly to notify them of the recall.",
      "Consumers with the faucets are advised to stop using them immediately and to reach out to the vendor for a refund. Consumers will have to provide a photograph of disposal to get their money back, all three vendors state in their respective recall notices.",

    "story": [
      "Doctors, environmental groups and residents are trying to figure out if there is a causal connection between pollutants from the steel industry and rates of cancer in Gary, Indiana.",
      "Pollutants you can see, and tiny particulates you can't, come from different types of industry in the Gary region. But according to Environmental Protection Agency records, steel production plants release the most toxins of all the industries in the region.",
      "Beryl Fitzpatrick is one of the residents affected. You can hear the cancer as she speaks.",
      "\"I was having trouble swallowing,\" she recalled.",
      "Fitzpatrick was diagnosed with Stage 3 tongue cancer. She didn't know if she would ever speak again after doctors removed part of her tongue while removing a cancerous tumor, but she fought to keep her voice.",
      "\"I had to learn phonics. I had to learn, I had to learn words and sounds,\" she said. \"It was humbling.\"",
      "And she knows the very air in her own backyard could be playing a role in her disease.",
      "\"It's almost certain that her place of residence, with the high pollution and other industrial output contributed to her cancer,\" said Dr. Kerstin Stenson, lead of the head and neck cancer program at Rush University Medical Center who's been treating Fitzpatrick.",
      "The City of Gary was built by the steel industry, but when families like Fitzpatrick's moved to the region in droves from the South during the Great Migration for jobs and opportunities, they didn't know as much as we do now about the health risks linked to industrial production.",
      "\"A lot of the teachers would talk about students that had asthma,\" Fitzpatrick said.",
      "Seven major coal-powered steel production plants operate in the United States. Three plants are clustered in the Gary region: Burns Harbor, Gary Works and Indiana Harbor.",
      "CBS News Chicago Investigators dug into state and federal data from the Environmental Protection Agency to see how these facilities impact the community.",
      "Our investigation found that in 2023, the latest data available, the three mills emitted 25 million pounds of toxins, more industrial pollution than the combined toxic release of the four similar mills in other states.",
      "\"We do not need to sacrifice health and communities to make steel,\" said Hilary Lewis, a director of Industrial Labs.",
      "Industrial Labs, a nonprofit environmental organization, released a report in October 2024 detailing its findings on the steel industry's impact on the community.",
      "\"The people in Northwest Indiana are bearing the brunt of the coal-based steel industry today,\" she said.",
      "The study found people living near one steel production facility have a 12% to 26% higher risk of getting cancer. People in Gary live near three.",
      "And cancer isn't the only health risk associated with this kind of industrial exposure.",
      "Industrial Labs' study found people living in Gary are in the top 10% of the nation at risk for developing asthma. Even Gary Mayor Eddie Melton grew up with asthma, and the irony of the steel industry that built the city now being the thing making people sick is not lost on him.",
      "\"I mean, that's a stark reality that a lot of folks have to deal with,\" Melton said.",
      "The mayor wants this dealt with, in part, by toughening toxic emissions standards. But that may not happen; in March, the federal EPA announced it's considering lowering some standards polluters must meet.",
      "\"What we're seeing from a federal and state government concerns me, in terms of rolling back the regulations on industries such as the steel industry, and other industries,\" Mayor Melton said.",
      "Gary already fails to meet federal air quality standards. Lake County, Indiana has more toxic releases than 99% of all other counties across the country, and the state ranks second in the nation for the most industrial pollution released per square mile.",
      "So what is the EPA doing for the people of Gary?",
      "\"They're responsible for protecting clean air,\" Lewis said. \"And right now, they're not doing that.\"",
      "CBS News Chicago Investigatiors dug into EPA records dating back to 1977 and found that since then the EPA took 152 formal actions against the steel production facilities. Nearly half of those actions were for violating the Clean Air Act. For those air pollution violations, regulators issued more than $23 million in penalties paid by the parent companies.",
      "\"If you're a multi-billion-dollar corporation, fees and fines probably are just a drop in the bucket for you,\" Melton said.",
      "Both the state and federal EPA declined interviews but sent statements saying they act when facilities are out of compliance, and those actions have reduced air emissions.",
      "Fitzpatrick lives about 43 blocks from the largest steel mill in the nation, and we found they released more pollutants than any other steel or iron mill tracked by the EPA across the country.",
      "More than half the industrial pollution in Lake County comes from Gary Works, which is owned by U.S Steel.",
      "U.S. Steel declined an interview, but responded to questions by email, saying the EPA's data includes byproducts \"legally emitted,\" and said they have systems in place to comply with environmental regulations.",
      "In regards to the Industrial Labs report, U.S. Steel said it was \"designed to create media attention rather than reach any scientific conclusions.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick has lived in Gary for 60 of her 71 years, never fully knowing what she was exposed to.",
      "\"I didn't think I was living a lifestyle that was polluting my body,\" she said.",
      "She wasn't. Dr. Stenson said Fitzpatrick doesn't have the typical risk factors for her cancer. And she's not alone.",
      "\"There are many patients that have come from that industrial area that would present with head and neck cancer without risk factors,\" Stenson said.",
      "Gary has been notorious for its pollution for decades.",
      "Dr. Mihir Bhayani, also at Rush University Medical Center, is getting closer to directly linking air pollution and some cancers. The new research he is working on could force change.",
      "\"What we are working on currently is, again, a direct causal link between air pollution and head and neck cancer,\" he said.",
      "He believes steel mills are making people sick in Gary, and he wants to see emissions standards toughened.",
      "\"So that individuals who are living in those areas, they're exposed to the same clean air that individuals who are living in more affluent areas are,\" he said.",
      "\"The types of communities that this industry is impacting are disproportionately people of color and low-income communities,\" said Lewis.",
      "More than 76% of Gary's population is Black, and the average income is less than $23,000 a year.",
      "About four hours away from Gary by car is the steel plant in Middletown, Ohio. It's getting a major portion of a $500 million federal grant to change the steel-making process and cut hazardous pollution in that city, which has an average income of $30,000 a year and is 73% white.",
      "Fitzpatrick believes more would be done to keep the air clean and her community healthy if Gary's demographics were different.",
      "\"I am worthy. No matter what you think about my Black skin, my dark skin, I'm worthy. I'm worthy for this community to be cleaned up and I am a person worthy of a good life,\" she said.",
      "Gary and other communities found to be disproportionately impacted by pollution were getting extra help from the federal EPA's Environmental Justice office, but in April it was labeled a DEI program and shut down.",
      "If nothing is done, Bhayani said, there will be long-term effects on people living in communities like Gary.",
      "\"They are going to have higher rates of cancer. They're going to have higher rates of cardiac disease. They're going to have high rates of lung disease,\" Bhayani said.",
      "That's why Fitzgerald, who fought for her voice while still battling the disease that nearly took it, said she'll do whatever it takes to make change here so that it can be different for someone else.",
      "\"As long as I have breath and I can breathe and I have strength to get up, I'm going to join other people, like-minded people. We're going to fight. We're going to fight,\" she said.",
      "Cleveland Cliffs, which owns two of the plants in Northwest Indiana, did not return messages from CBS News Chicago Investigators. U.S. Steel maintains its work is essential to the health of the American economy.",
      "But Fitzgerald and others who live there worry about their own health, and they're asking lawmakers to step up and join their fight for cleaner air.",

      "FULL STATEMENTS",
      "On whether they have studied the impact of releases from Gary Works and the health effects, including cancer and asthma, in the community:",
      "\"In 2020, the EPA deemed that there was an ample margin of safety around iron and steel emissions to protect public health and prevent adverse environmental effects.\"",
      "It is important to note that there are many industrial facilities in Northwest Indiana. Focusing solely on Gary Works as a source of pollution is both incorrect and irresponsible.",
      "On the study released by Industrial Labs:",
      "\"It is clear that these conclusions were pre-determined by a group that describes itself as 'scaling campaigns and building a movement to clean up heavy industry', which is to say that this document is designed to create media attention rather than reach any scientific conclusions. There are certain interests campaigning to eliminate U.S.-based blast furnaces, which are essential to national security and the health of America's economy because they are the only facilities capable of making certain types and qualities of steels required for critical applications.\"",
      "On residents believing toxic releases would not be allowed at the same level in more affluent communities with different demographics:",
      "\"Federal and state emissions laws and regulations apply equally to any municipality in the same jurisdiction. Gary, Indiana, is no exception. We care deeply about the communities where we live and work, as evidenced by the contributions by the Company and our employees. Since 2020, U. S. Steel Gary Works and its employees have donated over $1.3 million dollars to community organizations and efforts. In addition, our dedicated employees volunteer countless hours of their time to organizations and schools across the area. Our more than 3,400 Gary Works employees put safety and environmental compliance first. We are proud of their work and the Northwest Indiana community we call home.\"",
      "\"In addition to our spend on environmental compliance and community investment and engagement, we were the only U.S. Metals, Minerals and Mining company recognized as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies for 2025- the fourth consecutive year we received this designation. It is a testament to our commitment to ethical conduct and compliance.\"",
      "\"Gary Works was built in 1908, and the city was built around it. Any notion that we select certain areas to operate because of their demographics is wholly incorrect.\"",
      "On state and federal EPA fines, violations and consent decrees:",
      "\"U. S. Steel spends more than $80 million annually on environmental controls in Indiana as part of its commitment to environmental excellence. The EPA's Toxic Release Inventory, from which this data is drawn, includes manufacturing byproducts that are legally emitted under the EPA's stringent regulations and those which are legally disposed of in permitted landfills. As the nation's largest integrated steelmaking facility, it is common sense that U. S. Steel's Gary Works will have more legally allowed releases than smaller iron or steel mills in the country.\"",
      "Additional comment on emissions controls and other projects:",
      "\"U. S. Steel has robust systems and emissions control equipment at all levels of the steelmaking process to adhere to environmental regulations.",

    "summary": "A federal court on Wednesday froze the April 2 tariffs imposed by President Trump on almost every foreign nation. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping tariffs on goods imported from almost every foreign nation have been ruled illegal\u00a0by the U.S. Court of International Trade, marking a setback for the president's trade agenda \u2014 and adding another level of uncertainty for U.S. consumers and businesses.",
      "However, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted the decision, reinstating the levies for now. Its order said that it would grant the Trump administration's request for an immediate administrative stay, and gave the plaintiffs \u2014 five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states \u2014 until June 5 to respond to the administration.",
      "The Wednesday ruling from the court halted the tariffs\u00a0Mr. Trump assessed on virtually every other country on April 2, a day he termed \"Liberation Day.\" Some trading partners faced substantially higher import duties, with the president hiking tariffs on China-produced goods to as high as 145% before easing them temporarily earlier this month.",
      "Mr. Trump's trade agenda hinges on wide-ranging tariffs that he has promised will help bring back U.S. manufacturing jobs while also raising trillions in new revenue for federal coffers. The trade court decision could provide a measure of relief to American businesses and consumers, given that they're typically on the hook for paying the tariffs when imports reach U.S. soil. However, the federal appeal's decision on Thursday to reinstate the duties adds more uncertainty over tariffs.",
      "As the Trump administration's appeal works its way through the courts, it's unclear whether business should ultimately plan for relief if the trade court's ruling stands, or whether the tariffs might stick. And Mr. Trump could seek alternate routes to deploy additional tariffs, experts say.",
      "\"At the moment, it is anyone's guess as to whether these very unpopular tariffs will be reinstated on appeal or by the Supreme Court,\" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, in a May 29 research note. \"So, uncertainty is now poised to escalate.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Mr. Trump's tariffs following the ruling.",
      "Are any of Mr. Trump's tariffs still in effect?",
      "With the temporary stay imposed by the appeals court, all of his tariffs are \u2014 at least for now \u2014 still in effect.",
      "But the U.S. Court of International Trade's ruling applies to the Trump administration's tariffs that were issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. The Trump administration has also levied additional import duties by tapping other trade rules, and those remain in effect.",
      "\"The tariffs that remain in place are the Section 232 tariffs of 25% on automotive, steel and aluminum imports and the Section 301 tariffs on China that were imposed during President Trump's first term and expanded under the Biden administration,\" analysts at research company Capital Economics noted in a May 29 note.",
      "The president cited the IEEPA to announce the so-called reciprocal tariffs on April 2. At the time of the announcement, Mr. Trump said that trade deficits with other nations represented \"a national emergency.\"",
      "But the court on Wednesday ruled that Mr. Trump's global tariffs aren't authorized by the IEEPA, and said it would be unconstitutional for any law passed by Congress to give the president blanket authority to set tariffs.",
      "\"The court does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder,\" the judges wrote Wednesday.",
      "Could Mr. Trump reinstate the tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump could reinstate the tariffs if he wins on appeal, but his administration could also seek other routes to reimpose the import duties, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",
      "For instance, the president could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to impose tariffs of up to 15%, but they would be limited to 150 days, according to Goldman Sachs. A section of the Trade Act of 1930 would allow the president to impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from nations that discriminate against the U.S., they added.",
      "\"Section 232 tariffs, which President Trump has already used for steel, aluminum and autos, could be broadened to cover other sectors,\" they noted.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House's National Economic Council, told Fox Business on Thursday that the Trump administration had other tariff measures available that would take a few months to put in place. He added, \"But we're not planning on pursuing those right now because we are confident this ruling is incorrect,\" Hassett said.",
      "What about other lawsuits targeting the tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs are being challenged in a number of other lawsuits, including one filed by a family-owned toy company called Learning Resources. Its CEO, Rick Woldenberg, had told CBS MoneyWatch in April that he was suing because he believed the tariffs would prove catastrophic, both for his business and the U.S. economy.",
      "On Thursday, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled in favor of Learning Resources, writing in his decision that the IEEPA \"does not authorize the President to impose the tariffs.\" The judge also blocked the Trump administration from collecting tariffs from the toy maker and its sibling business, hand2mind, writing that the companies were likely to suffer \"significant and unrecoverable losses.\"",
      "Woldenberg told CBS MoneyWatch on Thursday that while the court's decision was \"gratifying,\" he's still facing uncertainty over the ongoing threat of tariffs because he expects the Trump administration to appeal the ruling.",
      "\"There is going to be a lot of dust in the air for the next two weeks as 'emergency this' and 'emergency that' are filed all over the place,\" he said. \"For things to change in our business, we need some certainty on our costs.\"",
      "What does this mean for U.S. businesses and consumers?",
      "Until the appeal is resolved, there will be some added level of uncertainty for U.S. businesses, which are on the hook for paying the tariffs when imported goods reach U.S. ports, some economists said on Thursday.",
      "Most or all of the tariffs are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, economists say, which has prompted them to forecast higher inflation in 2025. If the trade court's decision is upheld, the effective tariff rate will ultimately be lowered, although it would still be significantly higher than it was prior to the current Trump administration.",
      "\"We calculate that the effective tariff rate is now 6.5%, up from 2.5% at the start of the year but far lower than the 15% rate based on our assumption of the IEEPA-related tariffs remaining in place,\" noted Capital Economics on Thursday, after the trade court's ruling but before the appeals court said the tariffs could remain in place temporarily.",
      "\"I hope this is a process that will lead to certainty,\" Learning Resources CEO Woldenberg said about the two court rulings. But, he added, \"until I know if it's going to stick, I can't plan around not paying the tariffs.\"",

      "The decision from the U.S. Court of International Trade was a significant setback for Mr. Trump's economic agenda, a centerpiece of which are his tariffs. The president has argued that the duties are crucial to returning manufacturing jobs to the U.S. and will raise more than $1 trillion in revenue. Mr. Trump has also used the tariffs and the threat of higher rates as leverage to force trade partners into negotiations.",
      "The president rolled out his 10% tariffs, as well as a set of now-paused \"reciprocal\" tariffs, in April on what the White House dubbed \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "But the president's tariffs have shaken financial markets and sparked fears of an economic downturn. Mr. Trump has also halted some of the duties, including the \"reciprocal\" tariffs on 57 trading partners.",
      "Mr. Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs led to more than half-a-dozen lawsuits from states and businesses impacted by the duties. The plaintiffs argued that the president did not have the authority to unilaterally slap the tariffs on trading partners under the IEEPA, which has never before been used in that way.",

      "U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras found that the law \"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in five of his orders and barred the Trump administration from collecting any tariff deriving from them from the plaintiffs in the case, two family-owned businesses based in Illinois. The judge paused his order for 14 days to give the Justice Department time to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "The case, Contreras wrote in a 33-page decision, \"is about whether IEEPA enables the president to unilaterally impose, revoke, pause, reinstate, and adjust tariffs to reorder the global economy. The court agrees with plaintiffs that it does not.\"",
      "The Trump administration said in court papers with the trade court that it will appeal the ruling to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. The Justice Department has said that if the appeals court declines to provide interim relief in the coming hours, the U.S. will ask the Supreme Court to intervene Friday.",
      "\"Absent at least interim relief from this Court, the United States plans to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court tomorrow to avoid the irreparable national-security and economic harms at stake,\" the Justice Department filing said.",
      "The department has also asked the U.S. Court of International Trade to pause enforcement of its ruling pending appeal. That court has given the states and small businesses until Friday at 12 p.m. to respond to the government's stay request.",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai responded to the ruling by defending the reasoning for the tariffs, saying the U.S.'s trade deficits with other countries have \"created a national emergency that has decimated American communities.\"",
      "\"It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency. President Trump pledged to put America First, and the Administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness,\" Desai said in a statement.",
      "Tariffs are a signature part of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda. He argues the levies are necessary to boost U.S. manufacturing and end what he views as unfair trade practices. But the moves have rattled financial markets and drawn rebuke from Democrats, as well as some Republicans.",
      "Mr. Trump has stood by his tariff strategy but halted many of the levies while vowing to negotiate with U.S. trading partners. A set of so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries were paused in April for a period of at least three months. Goods that fall under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement were exempted from 25% tariffs. Massive tariffs on Chinese goods have also been cut back amid negotiations.",
      "Meanwhile, the tariffs have drawn lawsuits from businesses, Democratic states and other parties. Wednesday's ruling was linked to two lawsuits: One from a group of businesses that say they have been harmed by the tariffs, and one from several states.",
      "Some of the lawsuits against the tariffs have raised legal doctrines long championed by conservative lawyers and judges to restrict the authority of executive branch agencies. Those include the major questions doctrine, which says Congress needs to give clear authorization for federal agencies to decide issues of major economic significance, and the nondelegation doctrine, which holds that Congress can't delegate its legislative power to the executive branch.",
      "\"If this issue gets to the Supreme Court, which is a big if, and if it comes down to the major questions doctrine or the nondelegation doctrine, and those are big ifs as well, we believe the court's precedent requires them to rule in our favor,\" Somin\u00a0told CBS News earlier this month.",

    "story": [
      "Federal judges in the U.S. have challenged the Trump administration on everything from deportations of immigrants to mass layoffs of\u00a0government workers. Now, the U.S. Court of International Trade is stepping in to challenge President Trump's sweeping tariffs.",
      "The New York-based court\u00a0late Wednesday struck down most of the tariffs implemented under Mr. Trump, dealing a serious blow to one of his signature economic policies. Mr. Trump has said tariffs are necessary to erase the trade deficit, make the U.S. more competitive and energize the U.S. manufacturing sector.",
      "The ruling\u00a0voided both a 10% baseline tariff on most countries introduced on April 2 in what the president referred to as \"Liberation Day,\" and also blocks a separate set of levies imposed on China, Mexico and Canada. It does not impact U.S. tariffs assessed on specific sectors, including steel, aluminum and autos.",
      "A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily suspended the trade court's decision freezing the tariffs, reinstating the levies for now.",
      "Read on to learn more about the Court of International Trade and how it operates.",
      "What is the Court of International Trade?",
      "Located in downtown Manhattan, the U.S. Court of International Trade, or CIT, is a federal court that focuses on international trade issues. It resolves disputes between governments, manufacturers, trade associations and other parties that may be privy to trade dealings.",
      "According to the CIT's\u00a0website, the court serves as the main judicial forum for resolving civil actions related to import transactions and federal issues affecting global trade. In that role, the CIT helps avoid jurisdictional conflicts on trade matters that might arise among other federal courts.",
      "The Court of International Trade was created\u00a0as part of the the Customs Court Act of 1980, which reorganized the U.S. Customs Court into the CIT. The new court was established under Article III of the Constitution and has jurisdiction over any trade-related issues arising in the U.S. It is also authorized to hold hearings in foreign countries, according the court's website.",
      "The courthouse is located at One Federal Plaza in New York City.",
      "How many judges sit on the court?",
      "Nine judges sit on the Court of International Trade, all of whom are appointed for life. Those judges are chosen by the U.S. president, but the Senate must consent to those selections. According to the rules of the court, no more than five judges can be from the same political party.",
      "Currently, the court's chief judge is Mark Barnett. He appointed by President Barack Obama in 2013 and began his post as chief judge in 2021, according to his bio page on the court's website.",
      "Which judges stuck down the Trump tariffs?",
      "Three CIT judges rules that President Trump exceeded his legal authority in imposing the tariffs: Judge Timothy Reif, who was nominated by Mr. Trump; Judge Jane Restani, who was nominated by former President Ronald Reagan; and Judge Gary Katzmann, who was nominated by former President Obama.",
      "How do rulings work?",
      "Typically, the CIT's chief judge assigns cases to a specific judge. In certain instances, including when the case involves a presidential executive order or if it has broad legal implications for customs laws, the chief judge can assign it to a three-judge panel. Cases are then decided by a majority of judges.",
      "In Wednesday's decision, the judges unanimously ruled to block the Trump administration tariffs introduced under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977.",
      "Although the CIT is in New York, the court's judges have nationwide jurisdiction and preside over cases across the U.S. If a case is appealed, as it was in this instance, it then moves the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. and, potentially, to the Supreme Court.",
      "What types of cases does the court rule on?",
      "The Court of International Trade resolves trade disputes by interpreting U.S. customs and international trade laws, such as the Tariff Act of 1930. One example would be enforcing anti-dumping or countervailing duties, which protect domestic manufacturers by preventing foreign companies from selling goods at prices below market value.",
      "The court rules on dozens of cases each year. So far this year, it has issued 66 opinions.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/student-loans-credit-scores-plunge/",
    "published": "Thu, 29 May 2025 15:41:02 -0400",
    "summary": "New delinquency reports will hurt the credit scores of borrowers who fail to make payments on their student loans.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's resumption of student loan payments earlier this month is taking a toll on many borrowers' credit records.",
      "Credit scores dropped by more than 100 points for 2.2 million delinquent student loan borrowers from January through March of 2025, according to recent\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. For its report, the Fed looked at a borrower delinquency rate based on shares of student loan borrowers with at least one student loan reported as past due or in default.",
      "Another 1 million borrowers experienced credit score drops of at least 150 points for the first three months of 2025. A low credit score makes securing future loans both more difficult and more costly, pushing milestones like buying a home, or saving for retirement, further out of reach. It can even impact one's employment prospects.",
      "\"The key risk is that this could lead to reduced credit limits and higher interest rates for new loans, which could reduce delinquent borrowers' access to credit, which would then be used for other areas of spending such as on cars and mortgages,\" Grace Zwemmer, associate economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some 2.4 million of the newly delinquent borrowers previously had credit scores above 620, which are considered good and would have allowed them to qualify for new car loans, mortgages and credit cards before the delinquencies were reported, Fed researchers said.",
      "\"These borrowers saw substantial declines in their credit standing in the first quarter and will now face steeper borrowing costs or denial for new credit,\" Fed researchers said in the report.",
      "Grace period expires",
      "Student loan repayments were paused at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic by President Trump in March 2020, during his first term. After multiple extensions of the payment pause by former President Biden, repayments resumed in October 2023.",
      "The U.S. Department of Education then instituted a 12-month \"on ramp\" period which expired in October 2024, to give student borrowers some leniency as they resumed payments. During the transition period, loan servicers did not report missed payments or delinquent loans to credit bureaus, protecting many student borrowers from the worst consequences of not making their payments. Borrowers are considered delinquent on their loans when a payment is more than 90 days late.",
      "The pandemic-era pause on repayment had a positive effect on borrowers' credit scores: Between 2019 and 2024, the number of borrowers with credit scores below 620 fell by more than 4 million, as borrowers moved into higher credit score brackets, an analysis from Oxford economics shows.",
      "With that grace period having ended on May 5, newly delinquent student borrowers' credit scores are also being dinged, as their failures to pay back their debts are reported to credit bureaus.",
      "\"Borrowers receiving a new delinquency will see a drop in their credit score. This may signal a reversal of the positive credit score trend seen during the pandemic, which would lead to reduced credit limits and higher interest rates for new loans,\" Oxford Economics researchers wrote in a report.",
      "Long-lasting consequences",
      "Substantial drops in delinquent student borrowers' credit scores will have long-lasting ramifications for those affected, including lower credit limits, higher interest rates for new loans and limited access to credit in general, according to experts.",
      "\"The long-term issue is they'll have trouble accessing other types of loans in the future, like mortgage and car loans. It's easier to build credit scores when you don't have negative data, but when you have a delinquency, it's hard to come out of that. It takes a lot of effort,\" Tushar Bagamane, CEO of budgeting tool Vola Finance, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Consumers with multiple delinquencies report having to pay \"exorbitantly high on interest\" on larger loans once a delinquency impacts their credit score, Bagamane said.",
      "\"They have to pay more on their home loans and the cost of those lines of credit affects the income they have left after meeting their essential needs,\" he said. \"The ability to refinance existing loans with a low credit score can be prohibitively expensive and at that point, borrowers are almost left outside the financial system.\"",
      "By that he means they can't achieve milestones like owning a home or acquiring other assets, \"which is not a good position to be in,\" Bagamane added.",
      "American dream increasingly out of sight",
      "Zwemmer, of Oxford Economics, noted that a delinquency remains on one's credit report for seven years, and so avoiding becoming delinquent on a loan in the first place is the best course of action. If millions of student borrowers drop into lower credit score brackets, it could exacerbate the divide between low-income and higher-income Americans.",
      "\"Older and lower-income segments of the population will be most impacted, so we'll be looking to see if there's a further bifurcation of U.S. consumers,\" Zwemmer said.",
      "Jason Ackerman, a certified public accountant and co-founder of WealthRabbit, a retirement planning platform, said that as their credit scores drop, those who can least afford to shoulder higher borrowing costs will see their rates rise.",
      "\"Younger people are getting further behind on the American dream of buying a house and saving for retirement,\" Ackerman told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Their payments get higher \u2014 and the more you're putting toward student loans, the less you can put toward other things.\"",

      "According to the statement, Powell told the president at the meeting that the Fed would make its decisions based on \"careful, objective, and nonpolitical analysis.\" He did not discuss actions he expects to take, the Fed said.",
      "The Fed chair did, however, indicate that \"the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook,\" the central bank added.",
      "He also stressed that monetary policy will support \"maximum employment and stable prices,\" referring to the Fed's dual mandate of keeping unemployment and inflation low.",
      "At a press conference earlier this month, Powell emphasized that he's never requested a meeting with a U.S. president, and never would.",
      "\"I wouldn't do that,\" he said. \"There's never a reason for me to ask for a meeting; it's always been the other way.\" Mr. Trump had not requested that they meet, Powell said at the time.",
      "The meeting comes as ongoing tariff uncertainty clouds business and investment decisions. A U.S. trade court on Wednesday ruled that Mr. Trump's broad-based tariffs are illegal. However, the president is expected to keep pushing tariffs, which are already having an inflationary effect, as retailers raise consumer prices to offset added costs they are facing.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly called on Powell to lower interest rates and even threatened to remove him from his post, writing in an April 17 social media post that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\"",

      "Todd Chrisley, 57, has been serving a 12-year sentence at Florida's FPC Pensacola minimum-security men's federal prison with a release date of April 2032, according to the Bureau of Prisons. Julie Chrisley, 52, meanwhile, has been serving a 7-year sentence at the FMC Lexington prison in Kentucky, with a release date of January 2028, the BOP says.",
      "Scott Taylor, a spokesperson for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, told CBS News in an email that both Todd and Julie Chrisley were released from prison Wednesday.",
      "\"I am grateful to God and extremely grateful to President Trump and his entire administration. I'm beyond thankful to finally have my parents back home and my family together again!\" said Chase Chrisley, one of the couple's children, in a statement.",
      "Who are Todd and Julie Chrisley?",
      "The married couple gained prominence on the reality show \"Chrisley Knows Best,\" which debuted on the cable channel USA Network in 2014. The show depicted the wealthy couple \u2014 Todd Chrisley made his money in real estate \u2014 as they dealt with issues such as child-rearing and their careers.",
      "The show was\u00a0described as \"humorously voyeuristic\" by Common Sense Media. The program ended after 10 seasons in March 2023, after the Chrisleys were sentenced for tax and bank fraud.",
      "What were the Chrisleys convicted of?",
      "The pair were indicted in 2019\u00a0on charges including conspiring to defraud community banks out of more than $30 million in loans, with a federal jury convicting them in June 2022. The couple was also convicted of conspiring to defraud the IRS, along with additional tax crimes, the U.S. Attorney's Office of the Northern District of Georgia said at the time.",
      "The jury found that the couple submitted fake bank statements and other financial records to obtain personal loans, which they then used to buy luxury cars, designer clothes, real estate and travel.",
      "\"After spending all the money, Todd Chrisley filed for bankruptcy and walked away from more than $20 million of the fraudulently obtained loans,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office said in 2022 after their conviction.",
      "Meanwhile, the couple concealed their income from their reality TV show from the IRS to avoid paying nearly $500,000 in delinquent taxes. The Chrisleys also failed to file tax returns and pay taxes from 2013 through 2016.",
      "\"These convictions should send a clear message regardless of your fame or notoriety, everyone will be held accountable for paying their fair share of taxes,\" said James E. Dorsey, special agent in charge, IRS-Criminal Investigation, in a statement\u00a0on the Chrisley's convictions.",
      "Why did Trump pardon the Chrisleys?",
      "In a call Tuesday with the couple's children, Mr. Trump said the couple received \"pretty harsh treatment, based on what I'm hearing.\" He added that he doesn't know the Chrisleys personally.",
      "According to the statement from the Chrisley's law firm, the pair had sought a presidential pardon earlier this year by alleging \"serious misconduct by the government, including an illegal raid, reliance on tainted evidence and a trial that featured false testimony from a key government witness.\"",
      "Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, was a speaker at the 2024 Republican National Convention, with the law firm noting that she \"publicly thanked President Trump for standing up against political prosecutions and fighting for families like hers.\"",
      "Their lawyer, Alex Little, said in the statement that the Chrisleys were targets because of their political views.",
      "\"This pardon corrects a deep injustice and restores two devoted parents to their family and community,\" Little said. \"President Trump recognized what we've argued from the beginning: Todd and Julie were targeted because of their conservative values and high profile. Their prosecution was tainted by multiple constitutional violations and political bias.\"",

      "The company said it was notified Wednesday that the Health and Human Services Department had withdrawn funds awarded in July 2024 and in January to pay for development and purchase of its investigational vaccine.",
      "The funds were awarded through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, a program that focuses on medical treatments for potential pandemics.",

      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed deep skepticism regarding mRNA vaccines, despite real-world evidence that the vaccines are safe and saved millions of lives.",
      "The cancelation came as Moderna announced positive interim results from an early-stage trial of the vaccine that targeted H5 bird flu virus, tested in 300 healthy adults.",
      "\"While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis,\" CEO Stephane Bancel said in a statement.",
      "He added that Moderna would \"explore alternatives\" for funding the development and manufacturing of the vaccine, according to French news agency AFP.",
      "\"These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats,\" AFP cited Bancel as saying.",
      "In a statement in March, Moderna told CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder that, \"Researchers have been exploring mRNA's potential in medicine for over 30 years, leading to the rapid deployment of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines that transformed the course of the pandemic.

The attack on mRNA vaccines is beyond absurd. It was President Trump's Operation Warp Speed that gave us mRNA vaccines. ... \u00a0If Bird Flu starts spreading from people to people, we will come to regret this as the day we decided to put the lives of the American people at grave risk. \"",

A longstanding backer of cryptocurrencies, Vance owned between $250,000 and $500,000 worth of Bitcoin, according to an August 2024 financial disclosure.",
      "\"We want our fellow Americans to know that crypto and digital assets and particularly Bitcoin, are part of the mainstream economy, and are here to stay,\" Vance said Wednesday.",
      "Vance said it's been a while since he's been to a conference with \"this level of energy,\" adding, \"but I promise I'm not just saying that to juice my own memecoins.\" Vance gave few policy specifics in his speech. But he insisted that, through decentralized finance, crypto has \"transformed\" how Americans make transactions and acts as a \"hedge\" against bad policy.",
      "\"Crypto is a hedge against bad policymaking from Washington, no matter what party's in control,\" he said. \"It's a hedge against skyrocketing inflation, which has eroded the real savings rates of Americans over the last four years. And as you all know well, it's a hedge against a private sector that's increasingly willing to discriminate against consumers on the basis of their basic beliefs, including their politics.\"",
      "Vance urged Congress to pass the GENIUS Act, which would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Stablecoins are a type of crypto tied to an underlying asset such as the U.S. dollar.",
      "\"In this administration, we do not think that stablecoin's threatened the integrity of the United States dollar, quite the opposite,\" Vance said Wednesday. \"In fact, we view them as a force multiplier of our economic might.\"",
      "Vance said he knows a lot of people in 2024 chose to \"speak up\" and \"get involved,\" and he needs them to step up again.",
      "\"Unless you guys get involved in politics, politics is going to ignore this industry,\" Vance said. \"... While Bitcoin is digital, none of you are. None of us are. What happens in the world of politics, what happens in the world of bureaucracy, it will affect even the most transformational and valuable technologies if we don't make the right decisions. So the first piece of advice, the first thing that I'd ask you, is to take the momentum of your political involvement in 2024 and carry it forward to 2026 and beyond.\"",
      "The Las Vegas event is also featuring a handful of other Trump backers: His two eldest sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, who have invested in crypto ventures, are speaking Wednesday on a panel about \"the rise of new bitcoin business models.\" Chris LaCivita, who co-managed Mr. Trump's 2024 campaign, and David Sacks, a venture capitalist who serves as the White House's crypto czar, spoke on Tuesday.",
      "Vance is the highest-ranking sitting politician to address the Bitcoin Conference, which describes itself as \"the world's largest gathering of bitcoiners\" and often draws crypto-friendly lawmakers. Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, was the headline speaker last year.",

      "\"And now suddenly, you're allowed to play some offense\u2026And we have an administration that's open to the technology,\" he added.\"",
      "Bitcoin \u2014 and cryptocurrency more generally \u2014 has grown in prominence and drawn allies from both parties, despite skepticism about its volatility. The price of Bitcoin, the world's most widely used cryptocurrency, has leaped nearly 60% in the last year.",
      "Mr. Trump was once a crypto skeptic, calling Bitcoin a \"scam\" whose value is \"based on thin air.\" But in his second term, he has enthusiastically boosted crypto and promised to reverse strict Biden-era regulations.",
      "Mr. Trump and his family also have financial interests in crypto, which makes up $2.9 billion of his net worth, according to one recent report. Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, announced Tuesday it is raising $2.5 billion to invest in Bitcoin.",
      "Meanwhile, businesses linked to the president launched a Trump-branded \"meme coin\" earlier this year, and Mr. Trump hosted the digital currency's top investors at his Virginia golf club last week. The president and his sons are linked to crypto exchange World Liberty Financial. And Eric Trump co-founded a Bitcoin mining venture that's seeking to go public.",
      "The moves have drawn criticism from Democrats and some ethics experts who argue Mr. Trump's crypto ventures pose a conflict of interest, and investing in them could be a quick route to gaining access to the president.",

    "story": [

      "Coined by Financial Times journalist Robert Armstrong in a May 2\u00a0column, the tongue-in-cheek term stands for \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\" That phrase is meant to describe a pattern of stocks plunging when the Trump administration announces stiff new tariffs, then surging when Mr. Trump eases up on them days or weeks later.",
      "Since Armstrong's column, Mr. Trump has pulled back on import duties on two other major U.S. trading partners. On May 12, he placed a 90-day freeze\u00a0on 145% tariffs on Chinese goods, while on May 26 he\u00a0delayed 50% tariffs on European goods until July. In both cases, the markets jumped after Mr. Trump offered to ease tariffs.",
      "\"[T]he recent rally has a lot to do with markets realizing that the U.S. administration does not have a very high tolerance for market and economic pressure, and will be quick to back off when tariffs cause pain. This is the TACO theory: Trump Always Chickens Out,\" Armstrong wrote on May 2.",
      "In the most recent case, the market dropped sharply on Friday after Mr. Trump said he planned to hike tariffs on European imports to 50%. But on Memorial Day, Mr. Trump said he would ease up on those plans until July to give the European Union and the U.S. more time to negotiate. On Tuesday, the day U.S. markets reopened after the holiday, the S&P 500 rallied 2.1%.",
      "When asked about the term by a reporter at the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Trump responded that it was a \"nasty question.\"",
      "\"It's called negotiation,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They wouldn't be over here today negotiating if I didn't put a 50% tariff\" on Europe.",
      "He added, \"[T]hey'll say, oh, he was chicken. He was chicken. That's unbelievable. I usually have the opposite problem. They say, 'You're too tough, Mr. President.'\"",
      "Whatever the strategy at the White House, investors are becoming more comfortable with the Trump administration's pattern of initially setting high tariff rates that it later reduces, noted Vital Knowledge analyst Adam Crisafulli.",
      "\"[T]he narrative is growing increasingly bullish as investors become more comfortable with the severity of the tariff threat (the \"TACO\" mindset is being embraced by more people) while companies demonstrate an ability to absorb the import tax hike relatively well (the hit to [earnings per share] hasn't been as draconian as feared),\" Crisafulli wrote in a May 28 research note.",
      "Still, there may be too much complacency in the market about the threat of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which major businesses like Walmart have warned will cause them to hike prices, as well as the wobbly fiscal outlook for the U.S., Crisafulli added. Earlier this month, Moody's downgraded the U.S. credit rating, highlighting investor concerns about the government's growing debt.",
      "\"That said, the tariff narrative could stay in a state of benign optimism for the next several weeks (the big deadline is early/mid-July, when the 90-day reciprocal tariff/50% EU tariff suspensions expires) while tariff-driven inflation may not appear in the data until July (when the June numbers are reported),\" the analyst noted.",

      "On Tuesday, the Trump administration wrote in a letter that all federal agencies should consider canceling their\u00a0government contracts\u00a0with Harvard, or move them to other organizations.",
      "Research universities apply for federal grants in a competitive process, with the money awarded for specific purposes, such as scientific research. That includes having the necessary faculty, researchers and other staff on hand to conduct the research, as well as laboratories or other facilities that are needed to complete the project.",
      "For instance, one recent National Science Foundation grant awarded to Harvard is for research into \"a complexity theoretic lens on near- and medium-term quantum devices,\" with the proposal describing the project as aiming to \"grapple with present-day challenges in quantum computing.\"",
      "By contrast, trade schools offer hands-on vocational training in fields ranging from cosmetology to plumbing, and typically don't undertake the type of research that is funded by agencies such as the NSF and National Institutes of Health, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It is both illegal and unrealistic as a proposal, and it's the sort of thing that a responsible administration shouldn't be saying,\" Jon Fansmith, senior vice president of the American Council on Education, a non-profit representing higher education institutions, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"The money that has been awarded to Harvard is awarded because they competitively applied for, and were awarded, scientific research funding, which is what it overwhelmingly is.\"",
      "While other schools, including those that operate trade programs, can apply for similar grants, Harvard's money can't simply be funneled to another recipient, he said.",
      "Do trade schools get federal grants?",
      "Trade schools, which can be either for- or non-profit, typically offer certificates or associate degrees rather than the bachelor's, master's and PhDs offered by universities such as Harvard.",
      "Although a trade school could apply for and win a grant or contract for services that it's equipped to provide the government, they generally don't have the faculty, staff or facilities to undertake scientific or medical research, Albany Law School Professor Raymond Brescia told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Trade schools can apply for and get grants from the NSF or NIH if they qualify,\" he said. \"But there are rules around government procurement and awarding grants to the applicants that are best-positioned to provide the services that the government seeks.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not identify any institutions that might receive Harvard's grant funding beyond referring to them as \"trade schools.\"",
      "Different focuses",
      "If Mr. Trump wanted to redirect funding, he'd likely have to follow a prescribed process, according to experts.",
      "\"You can't, as president, simply take money that Congress has directed for a certain purpose and say, 'I am going to spend it somewhere else',\" Fansmith said. \"You need some basis for giving it to other schools.\"",
      "More specifically, the Trump administration would need to provide evidence that Harvard's grants were not awarded based on merit, according to Brescia. \"Then there are avenues that the government can take in the future to ensure it follows its own procurement rules better. But I haven't heard anyone allege any awards to Harvard were improperly given to them,\" he added.",
      "A range of schools that offer trade programs compete for federal grants. For example, LaGuardia Community College in Queens, New York, part of the City University of New York, in 2023 received more than $400,000 from the U.S. Department of Labor to enhance its vocational training offerings across electrical, plumbing, HVAC and similar fields.",
      "But such schools don't generally conduct the type of academic and scientific research that qualifies for the federal grants awarded to institutions like Harvard.",
      "\"Private trade schools and community colleges don't do that stuff, so he couldn't redirect the same academic responsibility from Harvard to a trade school,\" Jason Altmire, CEO of Career Education Colleges and Universities, a group representing 800 private postsecondary career schools, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Altmire said his group's organizations don't typically receive any federal funding for academic or scientific research, while noting that trade schools would welcome additional government support and financial aid for students. But such assistance is unlikely to come in the form of grants from the NIH or NSF, he said.",
      "\"They could fund apprenticeships and support students so they have access to career schools,\" Altmire said. \"There are appropriate ways the federal government can support the work of trade schools, both private and public, and we would be excited about that.\"",

    "summary": "It doesn't take $1 million to secure a sense of financial well-being, according to new research from Vanguard.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't take $1 million to achieve the top predictor of financial well-being, according to new research from investment firm Vanguard. Instead, it's something far more attainable: Socking away at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account.",
      "A survey of more than 12,000 Vanguard investors found that it's not assets or income that is most associated with a higher level of financial well-being, but rather $2,000 worth of emergency savings. Having that $2,000 in savings increased financial well-being by 21%, while an income of $500,000 increased well-being by 12%, and assets of $1 million or more boosted well-being by 18%.",
      "A sense of financial well-being signifies that an adult can fully meet their financial obligations and are secure in their financial future, allowing them to make choices to enjoy their life, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "The findings come as many Americans are feeling more financially stressed, with a separate study from Primerica finding that about half of middle-class households expect to be worse off financially in 2026, almost double the share in December, due to worries about the cost of living and the economy. Taking small steps to build an emergency savings account could prove to help alleviate financial anxiety, noted Paulo Costa, a behavioral economist and certified financial planner at Vanguard who co-authored the research.",
      "\"What's so powerful about this research is that it's not about gathering a lot of money to have that peace of mind,\" Costa told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That initial $2,000 makes a big difference.\"",
      "While it may seem that having $1 million in assets should boost financial well-being more than $2,000 in a savings account, the results show the importance of being prepared for an unplanned expense, Costa added. (To be sure, most people in the study had $2,000 in emergency savings \u2014 about 8 in 10 \u2014 versus $1 million in assets, at about 3 in 10.)",
      "The median cost of an emergency is about $2,000, which means having that cash on hand gives people the confidence that they can handle a sudden money stressor, he said.",
      "\"When is $2,000 more than a million dollars? It's when it comes to emergency savings,\" Costa said. \"The point of emergency savings is to have that money readily available if you need it. A lot of people have money, for example, in retirement accounts that may have some requirements about when you can withdraw that money and may have some tax consequences and some penalties.\"",
      "Retirement assets are generally not readily available to cover unexpected expenses, with people younger than 59 1/2 incurring a 10% penalty for taking out money. But having $2,000 set aside in a bank account means that you've got the peace of mind that you'll be able to handle a surprise car repair or medical bill.",
      "And people with $2,000 in emergency savings typically spend about 2 hours less each week thinking about their finances versus those without any savings, the study found.",
      "How many people can handle emergency expenses?",
      "To be sure, obtaining $2,000 in savings could prove out of reach for many Americans, especially those who are low income, struggling with debt or who reside in an area with a high cost of living. Vanguard's survey includes only people who have investment accounts at the company, which signals they have access to 401(k)s and other types of investment accounts that many Americans lack.",
      "Almost 4 in 10 Americans say they don't have the cash on hand to pay for an $400 emergency expense, according to research from the Federal Reserve.",
      "Still, more Americans appear to be socking away money for a rainy day, with the Primerica study finding that 64% of those surveyed in March said they had an emergency fund of at least $1,000, up from 58% two years earlier.",
      "Even if saving $2,000 seems out of reach, you can start small by saving as little as $10 week, Costa said. The best idea is to find a strategy that works for you, whether that's budgeting or automating savings by directing a certain amount into a dedicated account with each paycheck, he said.",
      "\"I love the idea of, 'out of sight, out of mind,' so when you get paid, you immediately send money to your savings account,\" he said. \"By saving $50 per week, you will build up to $2,000 in less than a year.\"",
      "He added, \"Saving something is better than saving nothing. So just getting started, that really makes a big difference.\"",

      "That's according to a new report from Oxford Economics which shows that unemployed recent college grads account for 12% of an 85% rise in the national unemployment rate since mid-2023. That's a high number, given that this cohort only makes up 5% of the total labor force.",
      "What's more, the rate of unemployment among workers who have recently graduated from college and are between the ages of 22 and 27, is nearing 6% \u2014which is above the national unemployment rate of 4.2%.",
      "\"People who have obtained a bachelor's degree or higher have a higher unemployment rate than national average, and this is the first time this has happened in the last 45 years of data,\" Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That's noteworthy, he said, because \"those with higher educational attainment usually have better prospects overall than their peer with less.\"",
      "So why are recent college grads are having a tougher time finding work post-college than previous graduating classes did?",
      "While the report points to a couple of factors, it finds that a slowdown in hiring in formerly hot sectors is driving the growth in unemployment among degree holders.",
      "\"The rise in the recent graduate unemployment rate is largely part of a mismatch between an oversupply of recent graduates in fields where business demand has waned,\" according to the report.",
      "That holds especially true in the tech industry, as more college students graduate with degrees in computer science and related fields than any other major.",
      "\"Prospects for employment will remain minimal for these individuals, keeping the unemployment rate elevated in the near term,\" Oxford Economics researchers wrote in the report.",
      "Tech sector-centric",
      "Computer science is among the fastest-growing fields of study among undergrads, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, but jobs in the sector are particularly vulnerable to replacement by automation. Recent advances in artificial intelligence also expose workers in the field to being rendered obsolete.",
      "\"There's a mismatch between business demand and the labor supply overall,\" Martin said. \"And it's very concentrated in the technology sector.\"",
      "The industry hired at a fast clip when the economy reopened post-pandemic, before pulling back. Those cuts are likely still affecting the current unemployment rate, according to Martin.",
      "\"Some of it could be a normalization after the tech sector's hiring surge at the end of the pandemic around 2021,\" he said. \"But there's also evidence that AI is starting to impact lower-level computer science gigs,\" he added.",
      "Experienced workers who graduated with computer science degrees but have racked up more than a few years of experience are faring fine, noted Martin. It's those who do the kind of lower-level, rote work that AI is already adept at, who are seeing a mismatch between the number of jobs available and the supply of workers seeking them.",
      "\"Some of it might be businesses being productive with the workers they have and not wanting to increase costs overall by hiring. It could also be higher adoption rates of AI,\" Martin said. \"At the moment, it looks to be a bit of both.\"",
      "Uncertainty slows hiring",
      "Economic uncertainty, driven largely by President Trump's aggressive, yet ever-changing tariff agenda, is also leading a number of businesses to press pause on growth and investment. Because of this, the unemployment rate among recent college graduates could continue to inch upward, according to Martin.",
      "\"We are heading into a period where uncertainty is really high; the impact of tariffs is starting to bleed through, and businesses are facing higher input costs,\" he said.",
      "Although recent college graduates who have secured employment aren't being laid off at higher rates than the rest of the workforce, Martin doesn't expect things to get easier for young graduates on the hunt for employment, absent a surge in hiring by tech companies or mass exodus of workers from the labor force.",
      "\"There is some softening in demand overall, but a lot of it is concentrated at the moment in recent college graduates, and we are looking for the unemployment rate to rise,\" he said.",
      "The \"underemployment\" effect",
      "When qualified workers with college degrees try and fail to find work in their desired field, they tend to continue seeking work, sometimes looking for a job in another sector, as opposed to withdrawing from the labor force, the report notes. That can lead to college-educated workers finding themselves \"underemployed,\" or in roles where 50% of the workers who occupy them do not have a bachelor's degree or higher.",
      "This scenario can doom them for years to come: Underemployed workers tend to remain so for the rest of their careers, according to a report.",

      "The idea of taking the two government-sponsored enterprises public has drawn some support for years, with advocates arguing Fannie and Freddie could function better if released from federal control. Releasing Fannie and Freddie could also benefit some investors who have bought shares in the firms over the years, betting on an eventual federal spinoff of the mortgage giants.",
      "One of the largest \u2014 and most vocal \u2014 is Ackman, whose hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management invested in Fannie and Freddie over a decade ago. The firm is the biggest private holder of Fannie, at just over 115 million shares according to S&P Capital IQ data \u2014 worth over $1.2 billion at Friday's price. Ackman said in an earnings call Thursday that Pershing Square owns about 220 million shares in Fannie and Freddie combined.",
      "Other major holders of the two enterprises include Capital Research and Management Company, which has the largest known stake in Freddie ($350 million) and the second-largest stake in Fannie (over $1 billion), according to S&P Capital IQ. Paulson & Co., founded by billionaire John Paulson, also invested in Fannie and Freddie at one point, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2021 \u2014 though the size of its current stake is unclear.",
      "Since Mr. Trump was reelected last year, Ackman has publicly pushed on X to end the federal conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie, calling it a good deal for taxpayers that could generate as much as $300 billion for the government. In January, Pershing Square put together a presentation called \"The Art of the Deal\" that made the case in more detail.",
      "\"Trump likes big deals and this would be the biggest deal in history. I am confident he will get it done,\" Ackman wrote on X in December.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced Wednesday he's \"giving very serious consideration\" to the idea, Ackman responded on X with a thumbs-up emoji. In Thursday's earnings call, Ackman said, \"[W]e're extremely encouraged by the president's announcement.\" Ackman also said Thursday the firm wasn't aware of any plans by the Trump administration to release Fannie and Freddie from conservatorship.",
      "Famous for his sharp-elbowed activist investing strategy and pandemic-era bets, Ackman has made waves in recent months for his political views. He endorsed Mr. Trump in 2024 and has taken aim at the leadership of Harvard University over its handling of Israel-Hamas war protests.",
      "Skeptics of releasing Fannie and Freddie, like Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have pushed back on the idea, warning it could benefit investors at the risk of disrupting the mortgage market.",
      "\"[The president] hasn't come to Congress with any kind of plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2013 and the last thing we need is to privatize them in a way that rewards Wall Street while driving up housing prices for people already struggling to buy homes,\" Warren, a Massachusetts lawmaker and the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement, \"The Trump Administration is committed to strengthening the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to advance the President's mission of restoring the dream of homeownership for all Americans. Any actions under consideration will be carefully evaluated in a safe and sound manner to deliver on the President's historic agenda.\"",
      "Ackman's Pershing Square declined to comment to CBS News. FHFA \u2014 which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "What are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 and why could they be privatized?",
      "The government created Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 or, more formally, the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation \u2014 in the 20th century, with Fannie Mae dating back to the Great Depression. They essentially buy mortgages from lenders like banks and bundle them together into guaranteed mortgage-backed securities that can be sold to all kinds of investors \u2014 a space known as the secondary mortgage market.",
      "The point of this work is to bring more money into the nation's residential lending system, making it easier for average families to buy a home. Fannie Mae describes itself as \"the backbone of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.\"",
      "For decades, Fannie and Freddie were both publicly traded companies, though many observers believed they operated with an \"implicit guarantee\" that the government would step in if either company wobbled.",
      "But after a mortgage crisis sparked the 2008 recession, the Bush administration bailed out Fannie and Freddie and put them under federal conservatorship to save them from collapse. Since then, the FHFA has effectively controlled the two firms. That arrangement wasn't necessarily supposed to be permanent, but it has lasted for over a decade, with the two companies making billions in payments to the government.",
      "A push for the government to end its conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie has been brewing for years. Some critics view the firms as unfairly dominant in the mortgage industry and believe they fill a role that should be played by the private sector. Other supporters of privatization like Ackman argue it could provide a windfall to taxpayers, partly because, in a holdover from the financial crisis, the government has the right to purchase almost 80% of both firms' shares.",
      "Opponents of privatization argue it could push up mortgage rates, especially if Fannie and Freddie are no longer viewed as backstopped by the government. How that plays out could depend on how the government decides to end the conservatorship, though, and whether it still offers some kind of guarantee. Credit agency Fitch Ratings said it would keep rating Fannie and Freddie's debt similarly to the U.S. government's debt if the firms maintain a federal backstop, but if not, they would be rated separately \u2014 and could slip if their market dominance shrinks.",
      "The risk of higher mortgage costs could be a major stumbling block in an era of elevated interest rates. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg earlier this year, \"anything that is done around a safe and sound release [of Fannie and Freddie] is going to hinge on the effect of long-term mortgage rates.\"",
      "In part for that reason, Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at TD Cowen, said in a note Friday that the firm expects the Trump administration to make changes to Fannie and Freddie at a \"slower and more deliberate\" pace than it has moved on other issues, like tariffs.",
      "\"Tariffs may have impacted the stock market, but they did not result in immediate price hikes at Walmart or Dollar General. By contrast, the price of mortgages will respond to each recap and release development,\" Seiberg wrote. \"That makes the political cost more immediate and gives the President less room to alter positions as he has done on trade.\"",
      "In his first term, Mr. Trump's Treasury Department proposed ending Fannie and Freddie's conservatorship. While the first Trump administration ultimately didn't take this step, it made some changes to how the two institutions operate.",
      "Ackman's Pershing Square called releasing Fannie and Freddie the \"Unfinished Business of the First Trump Administration\" in its January presentation. The firm laid out a possible roadmap to turn Fannie and Freddie into independent publicly traded companies: It suggested holding initial public offerings by 2026 for Fannie and 2027 for Freddie, and then allowing the federal government to sell its stakes over five years.",
      "But it's unclear how \u2014 or if \u2014 the Trump administration may pursue the idea. In his Senate confirmation hearing earlier this year, FHFA Director William Pulte said he believed that any end to government control of Fannie and Freddie needed to be \"extremely thoughtful.\"",
      "\"While their conservatorship should not be indefinite, any exit from conservatorship must be carefully planned to ensure the safety and soundness of the housing market without upward pressure on mortgage rates,\" Pulte said.",

    "story": [
      "Trump Media and Technology Group on Tuesday said it's struck a deal to raise $2.5 billion that will be tapped to buy bitcoin, creating a reserve of the cryptocurrency.",
      "The company's move into cryptocurrency comes after Trump Media has ventured into other investment arenas, including starting exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, and separately managed accounts with investment strategies the company says are \"rooted in American values and priorities.\"",
      "In its Tuesday announcement, Trump Media said it has an agreement with about 50 institutional investors to buy $1.5 billion of the company's stock, along with another $1 billion in debt that can be converted into stock at a later date. The $2.5 billion in funds will be used to create a \"bitcoin treasury,\" which the company said will be added to its balance sheet.",
      "This would be in addition to cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments that Trump Media already holds, which it said were worth $759 million.",
      "President Trump, the largest investor in Trump Media, has increasingly focused on cryptocurrencies, both through his private business and his administration. He has directed his officials to create a national \"crypto strategic reserve\" that will include bitcoin, ethereum and lesser-known cryptocurrencies. The goal for Trump Media \u2014 best known for its Truth Social app \u2014 is to push the company into becoming more than a tech business, according to CEO Devin Nunes.",
      "\"It's a big step forward in the company's plans to evolve into a holding company by acquiring additional profit-generating, crown jewel assets consistent with America First principles,\" Nunes said in the Tuesday statement.",
      "Shares of Trump Media tumbled $2.14, or 8.3% to $23.58 in early afternoon trading. Because the deal is based on issuing $1.5 billion worth of new shares of the company, as well $1 billion in convertible debt, the offer could dilute the value of existing shareholders' stock, including Mr. Trump's.",
      "What's happening with Truth Social?",
      "Trump Media's push into money management and cryptocurrencies comes as Truth Social continues to lose money.",
      "In the first quarter, Truth Social lost $31.2 million, while its revenue rose 7% to $821.2 million. In a May 9 regulatory filing, Trump Media said its Truth Social has \"generated limited advertising revenue\" to date, while it expects to \"incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future\" as it builds its streaming business.",
      "Social media businesses typically rely on advertising as a core source of revenue, with companies targeting their ads to specific demographics, such as app users who are, say, young parents or retirees.",
      "Truth Social doesn't release data about the size of its user base, but rival social media apps have typically recorded much higher sales growth, such as Reddit, which said its fourth-quarter ad sales jumped 60% to $394.5 million from a year earlier.",
      "Why is Trump Media venturing into financial services?",
      "Trump Media describes its new division, called Truth.Fi, as mixing financial services and financial technology.",
      "\"By expanding into this realm, we aim to serve millions of investors in America and around the world who believe in the greatness of the American economy and want to invest in superior companies while avoiding the giant, woke investment funds and politically motivated debanking problems,\" the company's May 9 regulatory filing said.",
      "\"Debanking\" is the term used by some conservative figures who have accused banks of barring them from opening accounts or blocking access to their assets because of their political views, prompting a Senate hearing in February over the issue. It's\u00a0also been the focus of some crypto investors, such as Nathan McCauley, who testified in the Senate hearing that his bank had closed his company's account on short notice because they weren't comfortable with crypto transactions.",
      "Trump Media's crypto investment \"will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions, which plague many Americans and U.S. firms, and will create synergies for subscription payments, a utility token and other planned transactions across Truth Social and Truth+,\" Nunes said in the statement.",

      "Analysts noted that the stop-and-go nature of the president's tariff policies have been a key driver of market volatility in recent weeks, with stock movements hinging upon news of potential trade deals.

The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index, released Tuesday morning, found consumer confidence rose 12.3 points to reach 98.0, up from 85.7 in April. The upswing follows month of decline in the index, triggered by fears of inflation and tariff-induced economic uncertainty. Analysts, however, warned the positive turnaround may be short-lived.",
      "\"Consumer confidence in May rebounded after trade tensions eased, but this may only be temporary,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, in a research note.",
      "The bond market remained steady after easing slightly on Friday, after concerns earlier in the week over the nation's debt led to an uptick in Treasury Yields. Yields on the 10-Year Treasury were at 4.5% as of Tuesday afternoon.",
      "Still, this moment of calm may also be temporary, some economists say. In a research note on Tuesday, UBS analysts said investors should brace for more volatility in the bond market, as Mr. Trump's budget bill still\u00a0awaits approval from the Senate.",

    "summary": "Prices and finances are big factors in how Americans decide their summer plans.",
    "story": [
      "Summer begins with Americans' economy ratings continuing to get a bit brighter than they were this winter \u2014 though still not good \u2014 with their outlook more mixed. But feelings of financial concern and stress are more prevalent than feelings of being secure.",
      "With a big majority still saying their incomes don't keep pace with inflation, prices and finances of course play a big role in how Americans decide what their summer plans will be. And that, too, helps define two different outlooks heading into the season.",
      "Slightly more Americans say they'll take a vacation this summer than report taking one in 2024. Most likely to take a vacation are the just-over half who say they're at least doing OK financially and can keep up with expenses. (For the higher income earners among them especially, summer will also involve travel.)",
      "But for those who say their finances are not good, it continues to be largely because of prices and incomes not keeping up with inflation. They're largely forgoing any vacation or travel.",
      "In all, feelings about finances span a range and most report feeling things from stress and concern to security and optimism at least once in a while. But Americans describe feeling concern or stress even more often these days, rather than feeling secure or content. That's especially the case among those whose personal financial situation isn't good.",
      "Ratings of the economy remain net-negative overall \u2014 this has been the case for years \u2014 but lately they have been ticking up off the dips they saw in late winter, February and March.",
      "Outlook and direction remains mixed, and with more negativity than positivity. But relatively fewer today are planning as if the country is headed for outright recession, as said so last month; opinion has shifted toward expectations of a slowdown, but not recession.",
      "In a different study consumer confidence was also reported to have rebounded lately.",
      "Those in comparably lower income levels report feeling stress about finances more often. Stress and concern go up with feeling less secure in a job (for those employed.) Concern about monthly ability to pay for food and groceries is strongly associated with more frequent feelings of stress. Conversely, feelings of being secure or optimistic financially are linked to confidence in being able to save, buy extras and pay for the basics.",
      "People for whom the stock market matters to their finances report less frequent feelings of stress. The market has had volatility over recent months, but those invested also have higher incomes, and report less concern about paying for day to day items to begin with.",
      "Summer plans",
      "As summer begins, one way Americans traditionally try to alleviate stress, of course, is a vacation or getaway. But access to that, too, splits on financial lines.",
      "For the just over half of Americans who say their financial situation is good, most plan to take a vacation of some form this summer, and most of those will also involve travel.",
      "Large majorities, often even if their finances are ok, say their incomes are not keeping pace with inflation, and this generally hasn't changed over time.",
      "For the bulk of people who do travel, summer means a road trip. It's far and away the main way they'll travel. (Though on balance, people who say their financial situation is bad say they'll take fewer car trips than last summer.)",
      "Peoples' assessment of the direction of gas prices is mixed and not very different than it was in March.",
      "Americans are more likely to expect their summer to be exciting rather than boring. And yet, for all the attention it gets, summer doesn't rate as Americans' favorite season. That's fall.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,216\u00a0 U.S. adults interviewed between May 26-29, 2025.

    "summary": "The Trump administration plans to eliminate thousands of State Department jobs and close or merge hundreds of domestic divisions \u2014 while adding a new office focused on \"Democracy & Western Values.\"",
    "story": [
      "The State Department is planning a sweeping reorganization of its bureaus and U.S. staff, with around 3,400 jobs eliminated and almost half of its domestic offices closed or consolidated in the coming months, the department told lawmakers Thursday, according to documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "The plans were previewed by senior State Department officials last month and are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to slash the size of the federal government. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the department \u2014 which employs tens of thousands of domestic staff in addition to foreign service workers at embassies and consulates \u2014 \"bloated\" and \"bureaucratic.\"",
      "The department aims to reduce its domestic workforce by up to 3,448 personnel, it said in a more than 130-page notification submitted to Congress \u2014 affecting around 18% of its existing staff. That includes 1,873 workers who could be cut through layoffs, or reductions-in-force, and another 1,575 who have indicated they would leave voluntarily.",
      "The cuts do not affect U.S.-based staff responsible for issuing passports and visas, or diplomatic security agents, the plan to Congress, marked \"sensitive but unclassified,\" said.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a briefing with reporters on Thursday that the changes were the result of \"thoughtful and deliberative\" work by senior department leadership that took into account feedback from long-serving employees.",
      "\"The reorganization plan will result in a more agile Department, better equipped to promote America's interests and keep Americans safe across the world,\" Rubio said in a statement.",
      "The reorganization should be \"largely concluded by July 1,\" with staff notified before then if their position is eliminated, the State Department told its workforce in a frequently-asked-questions document also obtained by CBS News. Staff were told to make sure their personal contact information was up to date.",
      "Meanwhile, around 45% of offices within the State Department could be merged or eliminated altogether, according to an executive summary sent internally to staffers Thursday and obtained by CBS News.",
      "Some departments focused on democracy and human rights will be scrapped or consolidated, with the report to Congress describing some of those offices as \"prone to ideological capture and radicalism.\" A new senior job will be added focused on \"Democracy & Western Values,\" with offices focused on \"civil liberties\" and \"free market principles.\"",
      "Offices that handle migration issues will be \"substantially reorganized\" to focus on \"supporting the Administration's efforts to return illegal aliens to their country of origin or legal status,\" the congressional notification says.",
      "Some of the offices within the State Department's regional bureaus will also be merged. For example, Russia Affairs and the Caucasus will merge into one office within the Europe bureau, Haiti and Caribbean Affairs will become one within the Western Hemisphere bureau, and Iran and Iraq Affairs will merge within the Near East Asia bureau.",
      "The plan also eliminates a program that was tasked with helping relocate Afghans who assisted U.S. military personnel during the war in Afghanistan, a move that drew sharp criticism from veterans' groups.",
      "\"This is not administrative streamlining,\" said Shawn VanDiver, the founder of nonprofit AfghanEvac, in a statement. \"This is a betrayal.\"",
      "In an internal frequently-asked-questions document obtained by CBS News, the State Department told employees many of the offices that are slated to be shut down will still see their core responsibilities moved elsewhere.",
      "\"Just because your office does not appear on the new organizational chart does not necessarily mean you will be receiving a [reduction-in-force] notification,\" the FAQ also read.",
      "The administration has sought to shutter most of the U.S. Agency for International Development, cancelling many of its programs and folding most of its remaining foreign aid duties into the State Department. That plan has drawn pushback from Democrats who argue the moves were not authorized by Congress.",
      "\"Taken together, these moves significantly undercut America's role in the world and open the door for adversaries to threaten our safety and prosperity,\" said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee, respectively. \"We welcome reforms where needed, but they must be done with a scalpel, not a chain saw.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 29 May 2025 17:41:13 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal court on Wednesday froze the April 2 tariffs imposed by President Trump on almost every foreign nation. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping tariffs on goods imported from almost every foreign nation have been ruled illegal\u00a0by the U.S. Court of International Trade, marking a setback for the president's trade agenda \u2014 and adding another level of uncertainty for U.S. consumers and businesses.",
      "However, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted the decision, reinstating the levies for now. Its order said that it would grant the Trump administration's request for an immediate administrative stay, and gave the plaintiffs \u2014 five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states \u2014 until June 5 to respond to the administration.",
      "The Wednesday ruling from the court halted the tariffs\u00a0Mr. Trump assessed on virtually every other country on April 2, a day he termed \"Liberation Day.\" Some trading partners faced substantially higher import duties, with the president hiking tariffs on China-produced goods to as high as 145% before easing them temporarily earlier this month.",
      "Mr. Trump's trade agenda hinges on wide-ranging tariffs that he has promised will help bring back U.S. manufacturing jobs while also raising trillions in new revenue for federal coffers. The trade court decision could provide a measure of relief to American businesses and consumers, given that they're typically on the hook for paying the tariffs when imports reach U.S. soil. However, the federal appeal's decision on Thursday to reinstate the duties adds more uncertainty over tariffs.",
      "As the Trump administration's appeal works its way through the courts, it's unclear whether business should ultimately plan for relief if the trade court's ruling stands, or whether the tariffs might stick. And Mr. Trump could seek alternate routes to deploy additional tariffs, experts say.",
      "\"At the moment, it is anyone's guess as to whether these very unpopular tariffs will be reinstated on appeal or by the Supreme Court,\" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, in a May 29 research note. \"So, uncertainty is now poised to escalate.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Mr. Trump's tariffs following the ruling.",
      "Are any of Mr. Trump's tariffs still in effect?",
      "With the temporary stay imposed by the appeals court, all of his tariffs are \u2014 at least for now \u2014 still in effect.",
      "But the U.S. Court of International Trade's ruling applies to the Trump administration's tariffs that were issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. The Trump administration has also levied additional import duties by tapping other trade rules, and those remain in effect.",
      "\"The tariffs that remain in place are the Section 232 tariffs of 25% on automotive, steel and aluminum imports and the Section 301 tariffs on China that were imposed during President Trump's first term and expanded under the Biden administration,\" analysts at research company Capital Economics noted in a May 29 note.",
      "The president cited the IEEPA to announce the so-called reciprocal tariffs on April 2. At the time of the announcement, Mr. Trump said that trade deficits with other nations represented \"a national emergency.\"",
      "But the court on Wednesday ruled that Mr. Trump's global tariffs aren't authorized by the IEEPA, and said it would be unconstitutional for any law passed by Congress to give the president blanket authority to set tariffs.",
      "\"The court does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder,\" the judges wrote Wednesday.",
      "Could Mr. Trump reinstate the tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump could reinstate the tariffs if he wins on appeal, but his administration could also seek other routes to reimpose the import duties, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",
      "For instance, the president could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to impose tariffs of up to 15%, but they would be limited to 150 days, according to Goldman Sachs. A section of the Trade Act of 1930 would allow the president to impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from nations that discriminate against the U.S., they added.",
      "\"Section 232 tariffs, which President Trump has already used for steel, aluminum and autos, could be broadened to cover other sectors,\" they noted.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House's National Economic Council, told Fox Business on Thursday that the Trump administration had other tariff measures available that would take a few months to put in place. He added, \"But we're not planning on pursuing those right now because we are confident this ruling is incorrect,\" Hassett said.",
      "What about other lawsuits targeting the tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs are being challenged in a number of other lawsuits, including one filed by a family-owned toy company called Learning Resources. Its CEO, Rick Woldenberg, had told CBS MoneyWatch in April that he was suing because he believed the tariffs would prove catastrophic, both for his business and the U.S. economy.",
      "On Thursday, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled in favor of Learning Resources, writing in his decision that the IEEPA \"does not authorize the President to impose the tariffs.\" The judge also blocked the Trump administration from collecting tariffs from the toy maker and its sibling business, hand2mind, writing that the companies were likely to suffer \"significant and unrecoverable losses.\"",
      "Woldenberg told CBS MoneyWatch on Thursday that while the court's decision was \"gratifying,\" he's still facing uncertainty over the ongoing threat of tariffs because he expects the Trump administration to appeal the ruling.",
      "\"There is going to be a lot of dust in the air for the next two weeks as 'emergency this' and 'emergency that' are filed all over the place,\" he said. \"For things to change in our business, we need some certainty on our costs.\"",
      "What does this mean for U.S. businesses and consumers?",
      "Until the appeal is resolved, there will be some added level of uncertainty for U.S. businesses, which are on the hook for paying the tariffs when imported goods reach U.S. ports, some economists said on Thursday.",
      "Most or all of the tariffs are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, economists say, which has prompted them to forecast higher inflation in 2025. If the trade court's decision is upheld, the effective tariff rate will ultimately be lowered, although it would still be significantly higher than it was prior to the current Trump administration.",
      "\"We calculate that the effective tariff rate is now 6.5%, up from 2.5% at the start of the year but far lower than the 15% rate based on our assumption of the IEEPA-related tariffs remaining in place,\" noted Capital Economics on Thursday, after the trade court's ruling but before the appeals court said the tariffs could remain in place temporarily.",
      "\"I hope this is a process that will lead to certainty,\" Learning Resources CEO Woldenberg said about the two court rulings. But, he added, \"until I know if it's going to stick, I can't plan around not paying the tariffs.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted a federal trade court's decision blocking most of President Trump's sweeping tariffs, for now reinstating the levies imposed by the president under an emergency powers law.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in a brief order that it would grant the Trump administration's request for an immediate administrative stay \"to the extent that the judgments and the permanent injunctions entered by the Court of International Trade in these cases are temporarily stayed\" for now.",
      "A three-judge panel on the trade court unanimously ruled Wednesday that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, which Mr. Trump invoked to impose the levies, did not give the president the authority to set unlimited tariffs on imports from nearly every foreign nation.",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade permanently blocked Mr. Trump's 10% tariff assessed on virtually every U.S. trading partner, as well as the president's duties on imports from Mexico, Canada and China, which the president had imposed in response to what he said was the trafficking of drugs into the U.S. The judges had given the Trump administration 10 days to put their permanent injunction in effect.",
      "\"IEEPA does not authorize any of the Worldwide, Retaliatory, or Trafficking Tariff Orders,\" the trade court found. \"The Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the president by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.\"",
      "The Justice Department asked the Federal Circuit to review the trade court's decision and also requested it halt that ruling while it considers the appeal. The administration warned in a filing Thursday that absent interim relief, it would turn to the Supreme Court \"to avoid the irreparable national-security and economic harms at stake.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News, White House spokesperson Kush Desai called Thursday's ruling \"a positive development for America's industries and workers.\"",
      "\"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country's national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the President in the Constitution and by Congress,\" Desai said. \"Regardless of the developments of this litigation, the President will continue to use all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "In its brief order, the Federal Circuit gave the two sets of plaintiffs \u2014 five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states \u2014 until June 5 to response to the Trump administration's request for a stay. The appeals court has agreed to consider the pair of cases together.",
      "The decision from the U.S. Court of International Trade was a significant setback for Mr. Trump's economic agenda, a centerpiece of which are his tariffs. The president has argued that the duties are crucial to returning manufacturing jobs to the U.S. and will raise more than $1 trillion in revenue. Mr. Trump has also used the tariffs and the threat of higher rates as leverage to force trade partners into negotiations.",
      "The president rolled out his 10% tariffs, as well as a set of now-paused \"reciprocal\" tariffs, in April on what the White House dubbed \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "But the president's tariffs have shaken financial markets and sparked fears of an economic downturn. Mr. Trump has also halted some of the duties, including the \"reciprocal\" tariffs on 57 trading partners.",
      "Mr. Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs led to more than half-a-dozen lawsuits from states and businesses impacted by the duties. The plaintiffs argued that the president did not have the authority to unilaterally slap the tariffs on trading partners under the IEEPA, which has never before been used in that way.",
      "The three judges on the U.S. Court of International Trade agreed, writing in their decision that it \"does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority.\"",
      "In a separate dispute brought by two Illinois-based toy companies, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that Mr. Trump's tariffs imposed under the emergency powers law are unlawful.",
      "Contreras\u00a0found that IEEPA\u00a0\"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in his executive orders and barred the Trump administration from collecting any tariff deriving from them from the two companies. The judge paused his order for 14 days to give the Justice Department time to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which the administration has said it will do.",
      "The case, Contreras wrote in a\u00a033-page decision, \"is about whether IEEPA enables the president to unilaterally impose, revoke, pause, reinstate, and adjust tariffs to reorder the global economy. The court agrees with plaintiffs that it does not.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. and Israel are waiting for Hamas to respond to a 60-day Gaza ceasefire proposal, the White House said Thursday.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Israel signed off on a proposal that special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Trump submitted, and it's been sent to Hamas.",
      "An Israeli official and a U.S. source familiar confirmed the proposed deal includes not only the 60-day ceasefire but also plans to release 10 living hostages and the remains of 18 dead hostages.",
      "The U.S. source added that \"aid will flow.\"",
      "\"I can confirm that special envoy Witkoff and the president submitted a ceasefire proposal to Hamas that Israel backed and supported,\" Leavitt said Thursday. \"Israel signed off on this proposal before it was sent to Hamas. I can also confirm that those discussions are continuing, and we hope that a ceasefire in Gaza will take place so we can return all of the hostages home.\"",
      "Leavitt said Hamas hasn't accepted the deal, to her knowledge, but if there is a deal, the public will hear so directly from her, Witkoff or the president himself.",
      "Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas official, said in a statement that the proposal \"fails to meet any of our people's demands, foremost among them an end to the war and famine,\" but the \"movement's leadership is studying the response with full national responsibility, in light of the genocide our people are facing.\"",
      "A senior Hamas figure closely involved in negotiations told CBS News they are studying the proposal and don't feel there are a lot of options. Hamas is asking the U.S. for clear guarantees that Israel is not going to attack Gaza within the 60 days of the ceasefire, the senior Hamas figure said.",
      "A source familiar with the U.S. outreach to Hamas tells CBS News that a deal is close, and once a response is received, it will be transmitted directly to Mr. Trump and Witkoff.",
      "President Trump has expressed optimism recently that there would be a deal. Hamas still holds 58 hostages, roughly one-third of whom are believed to still be alive, out of about 250 who were taken during the group's terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The rest have either been released during earlier pauses in fighting or have been confirmed dead.",
      "An earlier two-month ceasefire between Israel and Hamas ended in March after the two sides failed to agree on terms for extending it and Israel resumed strikes on the Gaza Strip. During that temporary truce, dozens of hostages were released by Hamas in exchange for Israel freeing some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was open to a temporary ceasefire deal to release more hostages, but \"there will be no way we will stop the war\" until Hamas is defeated.",
      "Some 1,200 people were killed in Hamas' 2023 terrorist attack on Israel, mostly civilians. Since then, about 54,000 people have been killed in Israel's war in the Gaza Strip, most of whom are women and children, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, which does not distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths.",

    "summary": "A federal court on Wednesday blocked most of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "A federal court on Wednesday froze most of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump on virtually every foreign nation, ruling the levies exceed the president's legal authority.",
      "(UPDATE: The ruling has been temporarily halted by an appeals court - read more here.)",
      "The ruling \u2014 issued by a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of International Trade \u2014 halted the sweeping 10% tariffs Mr. Trump assessed on virtually every U.S. trading partner on \"Liberation Day\" last month, with higher tariffs threatened for dozens of countries. The court also blocked a separate set of tariffs imposed on China, Mexico and Canada by the Trump administration, which has cited drug trafficking and illegal immigration as its reasoning for the hikes.",
      "Global markets rallied on the news.",
      "The Trump administration has justified the tariffs by citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which gives the president the power to regulate imports during certain emergency situations. But the court on Wednesday rejected the government's interpretation of the law, and said it would be unconstitutional for any law passed by Congress to give the president blanket authority to set tariffs.",
      "\"The court does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder,\" the judges wrote Wednesday.",
      "The court said Mr. Trump's global 10% tariffs aren't authorized by IEEPA because they're designed to deal with trade imbalances between the U.S. and the rest of the world, which the judges said should fall under non-emergency legislation.",
      "And the China, Canada and Mexico tariffs aren't legal because they \"do not deal with the threats set forth in those orders,\" the court also found.",
      "The three judges who wrote Wednesday's ruling were nominated to the bench by former President Ronald Reagan, former President Barack Obama and Mr. Trump in his first term.",
      "\"It's great to see that the court unanimously ruled against this massive power grab by the President. The ruling emphasizes that he was wrong to claim a virtually unlimited power to impose tariffs, that IEEPA law doesn't grant any such boundless authority, and that it would be unconstitutional if it did.\" Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University involved in one of the lawsuits before the U.S. Court of International Trade, said in a statement.",
      "Following the decision by the U.S. Court of International Trade, a federal district judge in Washington, D.C., ruled that Mr. Trump's tariffs deriving from a series of executive orders invoking IEEPA are unlawful.",
      "U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras found that the law \"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in five of his orders and barred the Trump administration from collecting any tariff deriving from them from the plaintiffs in the case, two family-owned businesses based in Illinois. The judge paused his order for 14 days to give the Justice Department time to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "The case, Contreras wrote in a 33-page decision, \"is about whether IEEPA enables the president to unilaterally impose, revoke, pause, reinstate, and adjust tariffs to reorder the global economy. The court agrees with plaintiffs that it does not.\"",
      "The Trump administration said in court papers with the trade court that it will appeal the ruling to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. The Justice Department has said that if the appeals court declines to provide interim relief in the coming hours, the U.S. will ask the Supreme Court to intervene Friday.",
      "\"Absent at least interim relief from this Court, the United States plans to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court tomorrow to avoid the irreparable national-security and economic harms at stake,\" the Justice Department filing said.",
      "The department has also asked the U.S. Court of International Trade to pause enforcement of its ruling pending appeal. That court has given the states and small businesses until Friday at 12 p.m. to respond to the government's stay request.",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai responded to the ruling by defending the reasoning for the tariffs, saying the U.S.'s trade deficits with other countries have \"created a national emergency that has decimated American communities.\"",
      "\"It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency. President Trump pledged to put America First, and the Administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness,\" Desai said in a statement.",
      "Tariffs are a signature part of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda. He argues the levies are necessary to boost U.S. manufacturing and end what he views as unfair trade practices. But the moves have rattled financial markets and drawn rebuke from Democrats, as well as some Republicans.",
      "Mr. Trump has stood by his tariff strategy but halted many of the levies while vowing to negotiate with U.S. trading partners. A set of so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries were paused in April for a period of at least three months. Goods that fall under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement were exempted from 25% tariffs. Massive tariffs on Chinese goods have also been cut back amid negotiations.",
      "Meanwhile, the tariffs have drawn lawsuits from businesses, Democratic states and other parties. Wednesday's ruling was linked to two lawsuits: One from a group of businesses that say they have been harmed by the tariffs, and one from several states.",
      "Some of the lawsuits against the tariffs have raised legal doctrines long championed by conservative lawyers and judges to restrict the authority of executive branch agencies. Those include the major questions doctrine, which says Congress needs to give clear authorization for federal agencies to decide issues of major economic significance, and the nondelegation doctrine, which holds that Congress can't delegate its legislative power to the executive branch.",
      "\"If this issue gets to the Supreme Court, which is a big if, and if it comes down to the major questions doctrine or the nondelegation doctrine, and those are big ifs as well, we believe the court's precedent requires them to rule in our favor,\" Somin\u00a0told CBS News earlier this month.",

      "As the Department of Homeland Security's investigative arm, HSI is a specialized law enforcement agency that has historically focused on combating transnational crime, like child exploitation and human trafficking, but many of its agents have been diverted by the Trump administration to support immigration arrest and deportation efforts.",
      "Genalo and Hammer will be replaced by Marcos Charles and Derek Gordon, two career ICE officials, the agency said in a statement Thursday.",
      "In that statement, ICE portrayed the changes as a \"leadership realignment to support its increasing operational tempo.\"",
      "\"Organizational realignments will help ICE achieve President Trump and the American people's mandate of arresting and deporting criminal illegal aliens and making American communities safe,\" the agency said.",

    "story": [
      "Federal judges in the U.S. have challenged the Trump administration on everything from deportations of immigrants to mass layoffs of\u00a0government workers. Now, the U.S. Court of International Trade is stepping in to challenge President Trump's sweeping tariffs.",
      "The New York-based court\u00a0late Wednesday struck down most of the tariffs implemented under Mr. Trump, dealing a serious blow to one of his signature economic policies. Mr. Trump has said tariffs are necessary to erase the trade deficit, make the U.S. more competitive and energize the U.S. manufacturing sector.",
      "The ruling\u00a0voided both a 10% baseline tariff on most countries introduced on April 2 in what the president referred to as \"Liberation Day,\" and also blocks a separate set of levies imposed on China, Mexico and Canada. It does not impact U.S. tariffs assessed on specific sectors, including steel, aluminum and autos.",
      "A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily suspended the trade court's decision freezing the tariffs, reinstating the levies for now.",
      "Read on to learn more about the Court of International Trade and how it operates.",
      "What is the Court of International Trade?",
      "Located in downtown Manhattan, the U.S. Court of International Trade, or CIT, is a federal court that focuses on international trade issues. It resolves disputes between governments, manufacturers, trade associations and other parties that may be privy to trade dealings.",
      "According to the CIT's\u00a0website, the court serves as the main judicial forum for resolving civil actions related to import transactions and federal issues affecting global trade. In that role, the CIT helps avoid jurisdictional conflicts on trade matters that might arise among other federal courts.",
      "The Court of International Trade was created\u00a0as part of the the Customs Court Act of 1980, which reorganized the U.S. Customs Court into the CIT. The new court was established under Article III of the Constitution and has jurisdiction over any trade-related issues arising in the U.S. It is also authorized to hold hearings in foreign countries, according the court's website.",
      "The courthouse is located at One Federal Plaza in New York City.",
      "How many judges sit on the court?",
      "Nine judges sit on the Court of International Trade, all of whom are appointed for life. Those judges are chosen by the U.S. president, but the Senate must consent to those selections. According to the rules of the court, no more than five judges can be from the same political party.",
      "Currently, the court's chief judge is Mark Barnett. He appointed by President Barack Obama in 2013 and began his post as chief judge in 2021, according to his bio page on the court's website.",
      "Which judges stuck down the Trump tariffs?",
      "Three CIT judges rules that President Trump exceeded his legal authority in imposing the tariffs: Judge Timothy Reif, who was nominated by Mr. Trump; Judge Jane Restani, who was nominated by former President Ronald Reagan; and Judge Gary Katzmann, who was nominated by former President Obama.",
      "How do rulings work?",
      "Typically, the CIT's chief judge assigns cases to a specific judge. In certain instances, including when the case involves a presidential executive order or if it has broad legal implications for customs laws, the chief judge can assign it to a three-judge panel. Cases are then decided by a majority of judges.",
      "In Wednesday's decision, the judges unanimously ruled to block the Trump administration tariffs introduced under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977.",
      "Although the CIT is in New York, the court's judges have nationwide jurisdiction and preside over cases across the U.S. If a case is appealed, as it was in this instance, it then moves the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. and, potentially, to the Supreme Court.",
      "What types of cases does the court rule on?",
      "The Court of International Trade resolves trade disputes by interpreting U.S. customs and international trade laws, such as the Tariff Act of 1930. One example would be enforcing anti-dumping or countervailing duties, which protect domestic manufacturers by preventing foreign companies from selling goods at prices below market value.",
      "The court rules on dozens of cases each year. So far this year, it has issued 66 opinions.",

      "\"As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President [Trump] for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,\" Musk wrote on X. He added that his Department of Government Efficiency's \"mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.\"",

He will continue to be a friend to the president, and we can characterize that as an 'adviser.'\"",
      "Musk is not likely to participate in Cabinet meetings, but potentially could in the future, the official said.

      "Asked who is in charge of DOGE, Leavitt responded, \"Well again, the DOGE leaders are each and every member of the president's Cabinet and the president himself, who is wholeheartedly committed to cutting waste, fraud and abuse from our government.\"",
      "Musk's DOGE team has upturned the government through employee cuts at nearly every federal agency and the termination of billions of dollars of government contracts. Musk has said the effort has cut around $160 billion in spending. However, some of the spending cuts cited by DOGE have\u00a0contained errors, and one report estimates the cuts could cost the government $135 billion due to lost productivity and the cost of putting staff on leave and re-hiring some workers.",
      "The White House said in February that Musk is a \"special government employee,\" or SGE. The designation allowed him to work for the executive branch, subject to different ethics rules than federal employees.",
      "But SGEs are limited to working 130 days in a 365-day period. Friday, May 30, would mark 130 days since Mr. Trump was inaugurated for his second term and when Musk's work at DOGE began.",
      "Musk's announced departure comes a day after a\u00a0\"CBS Sunday Morning\" interview\u00a0where he criticized the budget bill passed by House Republicans last week. The bill has been backed heavily by Mr. Trump, who dubbed it the \"big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "\"I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Musk told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" correspondent David Pogue in a broadcast exclusive interview.",
      "In an April earnings call with Musk's car company Tesla, he told investors his time at DOGE would \"drop significantly\" in May so he could focus on his companies. Musk suggested he would spend one to two days a week on government work, \"as long as the president would like me to do so.\" Some Tesla investors pushed Musk to dial back his involvement in the Trump administration, worrying his attention was divided and the carmaker's brand was at risk.",
      "White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said in a Fox Business interview on Wednesday that the Trump administration will make some of DOGE's cuts permanent through a bill in Congress known as a rescission package, which is a way for Congress to cancel funds it previously appropriated but that the federal government has not yet spent. Vought said that cuts to foreign aid and the U.S. Agency for International Development, as well as funds to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, would be included first.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate will soon be considering the massive legislation containing President Trump's second-term agenda after House Republicans passed it last week, following days of negotiations over changes to Medicaid, among other key issues.",
      "Senate Republicans will put their \"imprint\" on the bill, as Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota put it, and some pointed to changes to Medicaid as a possible red line for those who are undecided. As recently as Memorial Day weekend, at least one, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said she's still going over the House bill: \"I'm still looking at it because it kept changing up until literally the very minute it passed.\"",
      "Medicaid is the popular entitlement program that provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans and people with disabilities. The federal government shares the costs of the program with states, shouldering a minimum of 50% of the costs for richer states, while contributing more for the poorest. In 2025, it\u00a0paid\u00a077% of the Medicaid costs for Mississippi.",
      "Here's what to know about the changes to Medicaid in the House measure and the reaction so far by some GOP senators who have said they're concerned about the Medicaid provisions:",
      "Potential Republican opposition in the Senate",
      "Some of the House's Medicaid provisions may face resistance in the Senate. And with a narrow majority, Senate Republicans can only afford to lose three of their members if everyone votes.",
      "Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who have been willing to break with their party on certain issues, say changes to Medicaid must not hurt their states. And the two senators, along with Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, supported an amendment to the budget resolution that would have removed the language instructing the committee that oversees Medicaid from finding $880 billion in cuts. That amendment failed.",
      "In a New York Times opinion piece earlier this month, Hawley called \"slashing health insurance for the working poor\" both \"morally wrong and politically suicidal.\" And although he's outlined his support for the legislation's work requirements, he's drawn a red line on any Medicaid benefit cuts.",
      "Expanding Medicaid work requirements",
      "The legislation includes new work requirements that would apply to childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64. A last-minute amendment to the bill would speed up the implementation of the work requirements from Jan. 1, 2029, to no later than Dec. 31, 2026 \u2014 a change sought by hardliners. There are exemptions for those who are caregivers for dependent children or who are pregnant, among others.",
      "Hawley likes the idea of work requirements and told the Washington Examiner in February that it's \"probably something that unites Republicans.\" Collins recently also said she supports some work requirements, and Murkowski, in a conversation with the nonprofit Foraker Group, suggested that she could support them \u2014 as long as its implementation is overseen by states, which could have \"some level of flexibility\" in applying the requirement.",
      "In a state like Alaska, Murkowski said, \"It's going to be a little bit different if you're out in a rural area where you don't have the opportunity for jobs unless you move into the city, or if you are the full-time caregiver for someone in your family.\"",
      "Cutting down on \"waste, fraud and abuse\"",
      "Republicans argue that more frequent eligibility checks on Medicaid recipients will cut down significantly on \"waste, fraud and abuse.\" The bill requires states to check at least every six months whether adults covered under the Medicaid expansion are still eligible. States would also be required to take steps to obtain enrollees' updated contact information and check a Social Security Administration database more frequently to determine whether any enrolled individuals have died. GOP senators who may be undecided on the bill have not yet indicated whether they object to this proposal.",
      "Penalizing states that provide health benefits to undocumented migrants",
      "The bill also includes a provision that would reduce federal funds to states that provide state-funded health care to undocumented immigrants. Though people who are in the U.S. illegally are not eligible to receive Medicaid coverage, 14 states and Washington, D.C., have expanded their state-funded health coverage to include children regardless of their immigration status, according to KFF, while seven states and D.C. cover some adults.",
      "Under the Affordable Care Act, 40 states and D.C. have expanded Medicaid, enabling them to receive federal funding for 90% of the costs for low-income people receiving health care coverage under the expansion. The House bill would reduce the match rate to 80% for states providing health care to undocumented immigrants.",
      "Banning Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming care",
      "The House bill also prohibits federal Medicaid funding from covering gender transition services for children and adults, including surgeries, hormone therapy and puberty blockers. The bill initially blocked gender-affirming care for minors but was updated to include adults before its passage in the House.",
      "Freezing provider taxes",
      "States can boost federal Medicaid contributions to their states through what's known as a provider tax, often levying taxes on health care providers, which raises the overall cost of a service and therefore increases the portion paid by the state. For instance, if the cost of a service is $1,000, and the state and federal government split is 50-50, the state might add a 5% provider tax that would bring the total cost of the service to $1,050. That would mean that the federal government would reimburse the state $525, rather than $500. The House measure aims to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "Murkowski cited provider taxes as one possible cost-saving measure that's \"not going to hurt Alaskans.\"",
      "\"It's about $170 billion in savings that could be had if we were to eliminate that,\" she told The Foraker Group. \"To me, that's a real savings.\"",

      "Agreeing with pro-immigrant advocates who sued the Trump administration, Talwani found that the government's actions were arbitrary and capricious, in violation of federal administrative law.",
      "\"This court emphasizes, as it did in its prior order, that it is not in the public interest to manufacture a circumstance in which hundreds of thousands of individuals will, over the course of several months, become unlawfully present in the country, such that these individuals cannot legally work in their communities or provide for themselves and their families,\" Talwani wrote in her order.",
      "The programs at the center of Talwani's order rely on a legal immigration authority known as parole, which allows the federal government to temporarily admit foreigners on humanitarian or public interest grounds. President Trump's appointees have sought to curtail the use of parole, arguing that the authority was broadly abused by the Biden administration.",
      "Talwani directed the Trump administration to end a pause it quietly enacted in February to suspend the processing of immigration benefit applications filed by immigrants allowed into the U.S. under several Biden administration programs that relied on the parole authority.",
      "That pause mainly affected 240,000 Ukrainians allowed into the U.S. under a sponsorship program known as Uniting for Ukraine set up after the Russian invasion of their homeland in February 2022, as well as 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who benefited from another Biden-era parole policy. It prevented those who entered the U.S. under those policies from obtaining other forms of legal status, like asylum, Temporary Protected Status or permanent residency.",
      "Talwani ordered the government to lift another pause, issued in January, that has barred immigration officials from considering parole extension requests from Afghans, Ukrainians and other immigrant populations granted entry into the U.S. through parole programs, mostly under the Biden administration.",
      "Her ruling also blocked the Trump administration from taking any actions to stop processing parole applications under a longstanding program designed to give temporary legal relief to the immigrant relatives of U.S. service members or veterans. The administration has said this program has not been affected by its efforts to restrict the use of parole.",
      "In a statement Thursday, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the law and facts of the case favored the Trump administration.",
      "\"The Biden Administration abused the parole authority to allow millions of illegal aliens into the U.S. which further fueled the worst border crisis in U.S. history,\" McLaughlin said. \"Under federal law, Secretary Noem \u2014 in support of the President \u2014 has full authority to cancel or modify these policies.\"",
      "The ruling by Talwani is the second time she ruled against the Trump administration's efforts to scale back parole programs.",
      "In April, Talwani blocked the administration from moving forward with a plan to terminate the legal status and seek the deportation of the hundreds of thousands of migrants who came to the U.S. under the parole program for citizens of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The Trump administration justified the move by saying the parole initiative was plagued by fraud and inadequate vetting procedures.",
      "The Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to suspend Talwani's ruling from April, saying federal courts are unjustifiably interfering with Mr. Trump's immigration agenda.",
      "\"The court's order blocks the Executive Branch from exercising its discretionary authority over a key aspect of the Nation's immigration and foreign policy and thwarts Congress's express vesting of that decision in the Secretary, not courts,\" the Justice Department wrote in a May 8 request to the Supreme Court.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has signed off on a full pardon for former Rep. Michael Grimm of New York, according to a White House official.",
      "Grimm, a Republican, was convicted in November 2014 of tax fraud and related charges stemming from his ownership of a Manhattan restaurant before joining Congress. Prosecutors said he underreported wages and revenue to the government, and that he filed false tax documents.",
      "They alleged Grimm employed unauthorized workers whom he paid \"off the books\" in cash, took deliberate steps to obstruct the federal and state governments from collecting taxes he properly owed, cheated the state of New York out of workers' compensation insurance premiums, caused numerous false business and personal tax returns to be filed for several years and lied under oath to cover up his crimes.",
      "When prosecutors successfully argued for a prison term for Grimm, they raised Grimm's threats against a reporter who questioned him about his case and statements he made in court about the impact of his sentencing.",
      "\"Though the defendant casts himself as an individual with a life 'nothing short of extraordinary in its commitment to service to this country and those in need', his habit of falsely denying and minimizing his criminal conduct and impugning anyone who questions him is indicative of an individual who has not come to terms with his own crimes,\" the Justice Department argued.",
      "Grimm won reelection in 2014 in spite of his indictment, but he pleaded guilty a month later to one count of tax fraud. He resigned from Congress in January 2015 and served eight months in prison.",
      "He was released from prison in May 2016, after serving approximately half a year.",
      "Grimm, who was former Marine and FBI agent before he was elected to Congress, represented Staten Island and part of Brooklyn from 2011 to 2015.",
      "Separately, he was\u00a0under investigation\u00a0for alleged campaign finance violations relating to his fundraising in his 2010 race.",
      "In 2018, he attempted a comeback but lost a Republican primary for his old district to incumbent Rep. Dan Donovan, who then lost the general election to Democrat Max Rose.",

    "story": [
      "The federal government is working to secure a charter flight to return a man who was removed from the U.S. back to America so he can have proper due process proceedings, the Justice Department said in court documents filed Wednesday.",
      "Last week, U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy ordered the man, only known by the initials O.C.G., to be returned to the United States after he found that necessary due process steps in his removal proceedings were \"ignored\" by the Trump administration.",
      "O.C.G.'s attorneys argued that he has no criminal history and sought asylum in the United States after multiple violent attacks against him in his native country of Guatemala.",
      "In March 2024, O.C.G. entered the United States illegally and was deported. After making it back to the United States again last year, he presented himself to Border Patrol for asylum proceedings. An immigration judge found in February 2025 that O.C.G. would face serious harm if he were sent back to Guatemala and ordered a \"withholding of removal\" that barred deportation back to his home country.",
      "Two days after the immigration judge's February decision, O.C.G. says he was placed on a bus and removed without due process to Mexico, where his attorneys said he was previously held for ransom and raped during his second attempt to get to the United States. He submitted evidence at his immigration hearing of his experiences in Mexico, and as a result the immigration judge said that O.C.G. could not be removed to a country other than Guatemala without additional due process.",
      "After O.C.G. was sent to Mexico by the United States, Mexican authorities removed him to Guatemala, where he remains in hiding, according to court documents.",
      "\"[The] immigration judge told O.C.G.\u2014 consistent with this Court's understanding of the law\u2014that he could not be removed to a country other than his native Guatemala, at least not without some additional steps in the process,\" Murphy wrote in his order last week. \"Those necessary steps, and O.C.G.'s pleas for help, were ignored.\"",
      "Murphy had previously ordered additional fact finding in the case, after the Trump administration submitted a declaration under oath that O.C.G. told government officials that he had no fear of being sent to Mexico. O.C.G had previously submitted a declaration to the court stating that he was told at the last minute before his removal that he was being sent to Mexico, and that he was denied a request to speak to his attorneys beforehand.",
      "The Justice Department admitted to Murphy that there was no witness who could verify the government's account of O.C.G.'s removal under oath and the declaration was made in error.",
      "\"The only evidence before the Court therefore is O.C.G.'s uncontroverted assertion that he was given no notice of his transfer to Mexico and no opportunity to explain why it would be dangerous to send him there,\" Murphy wrote in his order mandating the man's return.",
      "\"Defendants' retraction of their prior sworn statement makes inexorable the already-strong conclusion that O.C.G. is likely to succeed in showing that his removal lacked any semblance of due process,\" the judge added.",
      "The Trump administration's push to ramp up deportations has drawn other scrutiny from other federal judges who argue deportees aren't being given enough due process.",
      "Another judge ordered the Trump administration to \"facilitate\" the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who the government admitted was sent to El Salvador in error. The Supreme Court affirmed that ruling, but Abrego Garcia remains in a Salvadoran prison, and the Trump administration says it's up to that country's government to return him.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has canceled $766 million awarded to drugmaker Moderna Inc. to develop a vaccine against potential pandemic influenza viruses, including the H5N1 bird flu.",
      "The company said it was notified Wednesday that the Health and Human Services Department had withdrawn funds awarded in July 2024 and in January to pay for development and purchase of its investigational vaccine.",
      "The funds were awarded through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, a program that focuses on medical treatments for potential pandemics.",
      "The new vaccine, called mRNA-1018, used the same technology that allowed development and rollout of vaccines to fight COVID-19 in record time.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed deep skepticism regarding mRNA vaccines, despite real-world evidence that the vaccines are safe and saved millions of lives.",
      "The cancelation came as Moderna announced positive interim results from an early-stage trial of the vaccine that targeted H5 bird flu virus, tested in 300 healthy adults.",
      "\"While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis,\" CEO Stephane Bancel said in a statement.",
      "He added that Moderna would \"explore alternatives\" for funding the development and manufacturing of the vaccine, according to French news agency AFP.",
      "\"These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats,\" AFP cited Bancel as saying.",
      "In a statement in March, Moderna told CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder that, \"Researchers have been exploring mRNA's potential in medicine for over 30 years, leading to the rapid deployment of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines that transformed the course of the pandemic. With more than a billion doses distributed worldwide and an unprecedented amount of real-world safety and efficacy data, the benefits of mRNA vaccination ... are well established.\"",
      "Dr. Ashish Jha, a public health expert who served as former President Joe Biden's COVID-19 response coordinator, remarked about the funding withdrawal on X, saying, \"This move puts the lives of Americans at risk. The attack on mRNA vaccines is beyond absurd. It was President Trump's Operation Warp Speed that gave us mRNA vaccines. ... \u00a0If Bird Flu starts spreading from people to people, we will come to regret this as the day we decided to put the lives of the American people at grave risk. \"",
      "H5N1 bird flu viruses spilled from wild bird into cattle in the U.S. last year, infecting hundreds of animals in several states. At least 70 people in the U.S. have been sickened by bird flu infections, mostly mild. One person died.",
      "Scientists fear that continued mutation of the virus could enable it to become more virulent or more easily spread in people, with the possibility that it could trigger a pandemic.",
      "Moderna received $176 million in July 2024 and $590 million in January. The January award would have supported a late-stage clinical trial that could have determined the vaccine's efficacy against pandemic viruses, including bird flu, a company spokesman said.",

    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday touted the Trump administration's ties with the cryptocurrency industry\u00a0 \u2014 a once-fringe business that President Trump and his allies have embraced in recent months.",
      "\"I'm here today to say loud and clear, with President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House,\" Vance told the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas.",
      "The Trump administration has leaned into cryptocurrency, looking to ease regulations, promote growth in the industry, and bring it into the mainstream. A longstanding backer of cryptocurrencies, Vance owned between $250,000 and $500,000 worth of Bitcoin, according to an August 2024 financial disclosure.",
      "\"We want our fellow Americans to know that crypto and digital assets and particularly Bitcoin, are part of the mainstream economy, and are here to stay,\" Vance said Wednesday.",
      "Vance said it's been a while since he's been to a conference with \"this level of energy,\" adding, \"but I promise I'm not just saying that to juice my own memecoins.\" Vance gave few policy specifics in his speech. But he insisted that, through decentralized finance, crypto has \"transformed\" how Americans make transactions and acts as a \"hedge\" against bad policy.",
      "\"Crypto is a hedge against bad policymaking from Washington, no matter what party's in control,\" he said. \"It's a hedge against skyrocketing inflation, which has eroded the real savings rates of Americans over the last four years. And as you all know well, it's a hedge against a private sector that's increasingly willing to discriminate against consumers on the basis of their basic beliefs, including their politics.\"",
      "Vance urged Congress to pass the GENIUS Act, which would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Stablecoins are a type of crypto tied to an underlying asset such as the U.S. dollar.",
      "\"In this administration, we do not think that stablecoin's threatened the integrity of the United States dollar, quite the opposite,\" Vance said Wednesday. \"In fact, we view them as a force multiplier of our economic might.\"",
      "Vance said he knows a lot of people in 2024 chose to \"speak up\" and \"get involved,\" and he needs them to step up again.",
      "\"Unless you guys get involved in politics, politics is going to ignore this industry,\" Vance said. \"... While Bitcoin is digital, none of you are. None of us are. What happens in the world of politics, what happens in the world of bureaucracy, it will affect even the most transformational and valuable technologies if we don't make the right decisions. So the first piece of advice, the first thing that I'd ask you, is to take the momentum of your political involvement in 2024 and carry it forward to 2026 and beyond.\"",
      "The Las Vegas event is also featuring a handful of other Trump backers: His two eldest sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, who have invested in crypto ventures, are speaking Wednesday on a panel about \"the rise of new bitcoin business models.\" Chris LaCivita, who co-managed Mr. Trump's 2024 campaign, and David Sacks, a venture capitalist who serves as the White House's crypto czar, spoke on Tuesday.",
      "Vance is the highest-ranking sitting politician to address the Bitcoin Conference, which describes itself as \"the world's largest gathering of bitcoiners\" and often draws crypto-friendly lawmakers. Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, was the headline speaker last year.",
      "Vance headlined a fundraiser hosted by MAGA Inc. on Tuesday night in Las Vegas, where tickets were priced at $1 million a head, CBS News has learned. The fundraiser was first reported by The Washington Post.",
      "Vlad Tenev, CEO of Robinhood, the popular trading platform for stocks and crypto, told CBS News at the conference that the Trump administration's approach to the crypto industry is welcome news.",
      "\"Under the previous administration, we have been subject to\u2026it was basically a carpet bombing of the entire industry,\" Tenev said.",
      "\"And now suddenly, you're allowed to play some offense\u2026And we have an administration that's open to the technology,\" he added.\"",
      "Bitcoin \u2014 and cryptocurrency more generally \u2014 has grown in prominence and drawn allies from both parties, despite skepticism about its volatility. The price of Bitcoin, the world's most widely used cryptocurrency, has leaped nearly 60% in the last year.",
      "Mr. Trump was once a crypto skeptic, calling Bitcoin a \"scam\" whose value is \"based on thin air.\" But in his second term, he has enthusiastically boosted crypto and promised to reverse strict Biden-era regulations.",
      "Mr. Trump and his family also have financial interests in crypto, which makes up $2.9 billion of his net worth, according to one recent report. Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, announced Tuesday it is raising $2.5 billion to invest in Bitcoin.",
      "Meanwhile, businesses linked to the president launched a Trump-branded \"meme coin\" earlier this year, and Mr. Trump hosted the digital currency's top investors at his Virginia golf club last week. The president and his sons are linked to crypto exchange World Liberty Financial. And Eric Trump co-founded a Bitcoin mining venture that's seeking to go public.",
      "The moves have drawn criticism from Democrats and some ethics experts who argue Mr. Trump's crypto ventures pose a conflict of interest, and investing in them could be a quick route to gaining access to the president.",
      "Tenev weighed in on Trump's personal investment in crypto.",
      "\"Of course, it is a potential conflict,\" Tenev said, but added, \"The idea that they're motivated by personal gain\u2026I don't know if that has too much backing in fact.\"",
      "The GENIUS Act, the once-bipartisan Senate bill aimed at regulating stablecoins, bled support after Democratic lawmakers pushed for restrictions on elected officials buying or selling crypto \u2014 with some Democrats directly citing Mr. Trump's crypto investments.

    "story": [
      "A new acronym is popping up on Wall Street to explain investors' reaction to President Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs: TACO.",
      "Coined by Financial Times journalist Robert Armstrong in a May 2\u00a0column, the tongue-in-cheek term stands for \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\" That phrase is meant to describe a pattern of stocks plunging when the Trump administration announces stiff new tariffs, then surging when Mr. Trump eases up on them days or weeks later.",
      "Since Armstrong's column, Mr. Trump has pulled back on import duties on two other major U.S. trading partners. On May 12, he placed a 90-day freeze\u00a0on 145% tariffs on Chinese goods, while on May 26 he\u00a0delayed 50% tariffs on European goods until July. In both cases, the markets jumped after Mr. Trump offered to ease tariffs.",
      "\"[T]he recent rally has a lot to do with markets realizing that the U.S. administration does not have a very high tolerance for market and economic pressure, and will be quick to back off when tariffs cause pain. This is the TACO theory: Trump Always Chickens Out,\" Armstrong wrote on May 2.",
      "In the most recent case, the market dropped sharply on Friday after Mr. Trump said he planned to hike tariffs on European imports to 50%. But on Memorial Day, Mr. Trump said he would ease up on those plans until July to give the European Union and the U.S. more time to negotiate. On Tuesday, the day U.S. markets reopened after the holiday, the S&P 500 rallied 2.1%.",
      "When asked about the term by a reporter at the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Trump responded that it was a \"nasty question.\"",
      "\"It's called negotiation,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They wouldn't be over here today negotiating if I didn't put a 50% tariff\" on Europe.",
      "He added, \"[T]hey'll say, oh, he was chicken. He was chicken. That's unbelievable. I usually have the opposite problem. They say, 'You're too tough, Mr. President.'\"",
      "Whatever the strategy at the White House, investors are becoming more comfortable with the Trump administration's pattern of initially setting high tariff rates that it later reduces, noted Vital Knowledge analyst Adam Crisafulli.",
      "\"[T]he narrative is growing increasingly bullish as investors become more comfortable with the severity of the tariff threat (the \"TACO\" mindset is being embraced by more people) while companies demonstrate an ability to absorb the import tax hike relatively well (the hit to [earnings per share] hasn't been as draconian as feared),\" Crisafulli wrote in a May 28 research note.",
      "Still, there may be too much complacency in the market about the threat of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which major businesses like Walmart have warned will cause them to hike prices, as well as the wobbly fiscal outlook for the U.S., Crisafulli added. Earlier this month, Moody's downgraded the U.S. credit rating, highlighting investor concerns about the government's growing debt.",
      "\"That said, the tariff narrative could stay in a state of benign optimism for the next several weeks (the big deadline is early/mid-July, when the 90-day reciprocal tariff/50% EU tariff suspensions expires) while tariff-driven inflation may not appear in the data until July (when the June numbers are reported),\" the analyst noted.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is planning to expand social media screenings for international students applying for visas.",
    "story": [
      "The State Department has ordered U.S. embassies to temporarily stop scheduling new student visa appointments, as the Trump administration works to expand social media screenings for applicants, the latest in a series of restrictions on international students.",
      "In a cable dated Tuesday and obtained by CBS News, Secretary of State Marco Rubio instructed diplomatic posts not to add any more appointments for student and foreign exchange visas in preparation for the expanded vetting, and to take any unfilled appointments off their calendars. If students have already scheduled their visa interviews, those can still go forward.",
      "The pause will last \"until further guidance is issued\" in the next few days.",
      "The State Department is preparing for an \"expansion of required social media screening and vetting,\" and all student visa applicants could be subject to social media checks, according to the cable. This extra screening would have \"significant implications\" for embassies and consulates' operations, making a pause on new appointments necessary, the cable said.",
      "A senior State Department official confirmed the cable's accuracy to CBS News.",
      "The memo was first reported by Politico.",
      "When asked about student visas, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters Tuesday, \"We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country, and we're going to continue to do that.\"",
      "A State Department official said Wednesday that while the department does not comment on internal communications, the scheduling of nonimmigrant visa interview appointments is \"dynamic.\" The official said that an embassy or consulate's capacity reflects the time required for consular officers to adjudicate the cases before them in full compliance with U.S. law, including to ensure applicants do not pose a security or safety risk to the United States.",
      "\"Every visa adjudication is a national security decision,\" the State Department official said, adding that every prospective traveler to the United States undergoes interagency security vetting. \"Prohibiting entry to the United States by those who might pose a threat to U.S. national security or public safety is key to protecting U.S. citizens at home.\"",
      "International students who want to study in the U.S. are typically required to schedule interviews at an American embassy or consulate, usually in their home country, as part of the visa application process. Wait times vary widely: At most embassies, appointments for student visa interviews can be scheduled less than two months in advance, though some diplomatic posts have longer waits.",
      "Last month, the Department of Homeland Security said it would screen some visa applicants, including people seeking student visas, for what it called \"antisemitic activity on social media and the physical harassment of Jewish individuals.\"",
      "The screenings are part of a wider slate of controls aimed at international students \u2014 some of which have run into pushback from the court system.",
      "Last week, DHS told Harvard University it can no longer enroll international students, escalating a monthslong battle between the administration and the Ivy League school. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said the administration is \"holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,\" but Harvard said the move was illegal. A judge quickly blocked the policy.",
      "The government has sought to deport a handful of students based on their pro-Palestinian activism \u2014 some of whom have green cards, including Columbia University's Mohsen Mahdawi and Mahmoud Khalil \u2014 citing a law that allows visas to be revoked if somebody poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\" Lawyers argue these visa revocations violate students' First Amendment rights, though the government says it has the right to do so. Some students, including Mahdawi, have been released on bail.",
      "And lawyers say the Trump administration has tried to end legal status for thousands of other international students, many of whom appeared to be targeted over minor legal infractions. A federal judge has blocked that effort.",

      "Now, a U.S.-based trio hunting the elusive world has instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches. And the existence of the new kid on the block could challenge the Planet Nine theory, the researchers have calculated.",
      "Named 2017 OF201, the new object is roughly 430 miles across, according to a preprint study, which has not been peer-reviewed and was\u00a0published online last week. That makes it three times smaller than Pluto.",

      "\"Lucky\" discovery",
      "The object is currently three times farther away from Earth than Neptune. Its extremely elongated orbit swings out more than 1,600 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun, taking it into the ring of icy rocks around the solar system called the Oort cloud. It goes so far out, it could have passed by stars other than our sun in the past, Cheng said.",
      "During its 25,000-year orbit, the object is only close enough to Earth to be observed around 0.5 percent of the time, which is roughly a century.",
      "\"It's already getting fainter and fainter,\" Cheng said.",
      "The discovery suggests \"there are many hundreds of similar things on similar orbits\" in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, Cheng said.",
      "After taking a risk spending more than half a year sorting through a difficult dataset in search of Planet Nine, Cheng said he was \"lucky\" to have found anything at all.",
      "The researchers are requesting time to point the James Webb, Hubble and ALMA telescopes at their discovery.",

      "\"See almost to the edge of the universe\"",
      "The icy rocks discovered in the Kuiper belt tend to have a clustered orbit going in a particular direction. Two decades ago, astronomers proposed this was due to the gravitational pull of a world up to 10 times larger than Earth, naming it Planet Nine and kicking off a debate that has rumbled since.",
      "It is also sometimes called Planet X, a name proposed for a hypothetical world beyond Neptune more than a century ago.",
      "Back in 1930, astronomers were searching for Planet X when they discovered Pluto, which became our solar system's ninth planet. But Pluto turned out to be too tiny \u2014 it is smaller than the moon \u2014\u00a0  and was demoted to dwarf planet status in 2006.",
      "There are now four other officially recognized dwarf planets, and Cheng believes 2017 OF201 could join their ranks.",

      "Washington \u2014 Get ready for several years of even more record-breaking heat that pushes Earth to more deadly, fiery and uncomfortable extremes, two of the world's top weather agencies forecast.",
      "There's an 80% chance the world will break another annual temperature record in the next five years, and it's even more probable that the world will again exceed the international temperature threshold set 10 years ago, according to a five-year forecast released Wednesday by the World Meteorological Organization and the U.K. Meteorological Office.",
      "Last year's record was just the latest in a decade of record-breaking\u00a0heat, with every year since 2015 ranking among the 10 hottest ever recorded.",
      "\"Higher global mean temperatures may sound abstract, but it translates in real life to a higher chance of extreme weather: stronger hurricanes, stronger precipitation, droughts,\" said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, who wasn't part of the calculations but said they made sense. \"So higher global mean temperatures translates to more lives lost.\"",
      "With every tenth of a degree the world warms from human-caused climate change \"we will experience higher frequency and more extreme events (particularly heat waves but also droughts, floods, fires and human-reinforced hurricanes/typhoons),\" emailed Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. He was not part of the research.",
      "And for the first time there's a chance - albeit slight - that before the end of the decade, the world's annual temperature will shoot past the Paris climate accord goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) and hit a more alarming 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) of heating since the mid-1800s, the two agencies said.",
      "There's an 86% chance that one of the next five years will pass 1.5 degrees and a 70% chance that the five years as a whole will average more than that global milestone, they figured.",
      "The projections come from more than 200 forecasts using computer simulations run by 10 global centers of scientists.",
      "\"We have just experienced the ten warmest years on record. Unfortunately, this WMO report provides no sign of respite over the coming years, and this means that there will be a growing negative impact on our economies, our daily lives, our ecosystems and our planet,\" said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett.",
      "\"Continued climate monitoring and prediction is essential to provide decision-makers with science-based tools and information to help us adapt,\" she said.",
      "Fears of repeats",
      "Ten years ago, the same teams figured there was a similar remote chance - about 1% - that one of the upcoming years would exceed that critical 1.5 degree threshold and then it happened last year. This year, a 2-degree Celsius above pre-industrial year enters the equation in a similar manner, something UK Met Office longer term predictions chief Adam Scaife and science scientist Leon Hermanson called \"shocking.\"",
      "\"It's not something anyone wants to see, but that's what the science is telling us,\" Hermanson said. Two degrees of warming is the secondary threshold, the one considered less likely to break, set by the 2015 Paris agreement.",
      "Technically, even though 2024 was 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial times, the Paris climate agreement's threshold is for a 20-year time period, so it has not been exceeded. Factoring in the past 10 years and forecasting the next 10 years, the world is now probably about 1.4 degrees Celsius (2.5 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter since the mid 1800s, World Meteorological Organization climate services director Chris Hewitt estimated.",
      "\"With the next five years forecast to be more than 1.5C warmer than preindustrial levels on average, this will put more people than ever at risk of severe heat waves, bringing more deaths and severe health impacts unless people can be better protected from the effects of heat. Also we can expect more severe wildfires as the hotter atmosphere dries out the landscape,\" said Richard Betts, head of climate impacts research at the UK Met Office and a professor at the University of Exeter.",
      "Ice in the Arctic - which will continue to warm 3.5 times faster than the rest of the world - will melt and seas will rise faster, Hewitt said.",
      "What tends to happen is that global temperatures rise like riding on an escalator, with temporary and natural El Nino weather cycles acting like jumps up or down on that escalator, scientists said. But lately, after each jump from an El Nino, which adds warming to the globe, the planet doesn't go back down much, if at all.",

What's more, the cycle repeats every 44 minutes, at least during periods of extreme activity.",
      "X-rays and radio waves are two different types of electromagnetic radiation. The correlation in their emission patterns in this case, along with other mysterious observations, led the study's authors to characterize what they found as \"unlike any known Galactic object.\"",
      "Located 15,000 light-years away in a region of the Milky Way brimming with stars, gas and dust, this object could be a highly magnetized dead star like a neutron or white dwarf, Curtin University's Ziteng Andy Wang said in an email from Australia.",
      "Or it could be \"something exotic\" and unknown, said Wang, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature.",

      "\"Starship made it to the scheduled ship engine cutoff, so big improvement over last flight!\" SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk wrote on X. \"Also, no significant loss of heat shield tiles during ascent. Leaks caused loss of main tank pressure during the coast and re-entry phase. Lot of good data to review.\"",
      "He added that the Super Heavy launch cadence for the next three flights will be faster, at approximately one per month or less, assuming, of course, engineers reviewing telemetry can quickly pin down what went wrong and implement fixes to correct the problems.",
      "The huge rocket's launching, known as Integrated Flight Test 9, got underway with a ground-shaking liftoff at 7:37 p.m. EDT from SpaceX's sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight facility \u2014 Starbase \u2014 on the Texas coast.",
      "The mission featured the first use of a previously flown Super Heavy first stage, which flew itself back to capture by giant mechanical arms on the launch tower during the program's seventh test flight in January.",
      "For the program's latest launch, the Super Heavy, powered by 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines generating up to 16 million pounds of thrust, followed the same ascent flight plan as previous missions, propelling the Starship upper stage out of the thick lower atmosphere on an easterly trajectory toward the Straits of Florida.",
      "Equipped with six Raptors of its own, the 160-foot-long Starship separated from its booster about two and a half minutes after liftoff, heading for a suborbital trajectory carrying it toward a planned vertical splashdown in the southern Indian Ocean.",
      "The Super Heavy, meanwhile, used a different method for flipping around for the trip back to the launch site in a bid to save propellants. It was also programmed to fly a much steeper descent than usual to learn more about the thermal and aerodynamic stresses it can safely endure.",
      "\"The booster will attempt to fly at a higher angle of attack during its descent,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"By increasing the amount of atmospheric drag on the vehicle, a higher angle of attack can result in a lower descent speed which in turn requires less propellant for the initial landing burn.\"",
      "\"Getting real-world data on how the booster is able to control its flight at this higher angle of attack will contribute to improved performance on future vehicles, including the next generation of Super Heavy,\" SpaceX said.",
      "As a result of the high-stress tests, SpaceX targeted a splashdown in the Gulf instead of attempting a launch pad capture where critical infrastructure could be damaged in a landing mishap.",
      "As it turned out, that was a good decision.",
      "Launch attempt follows two Starship breakups",
      "Tuesday's launch came on the heels of back-to-back Starship upper stage breakups during the two previous test flights that generated spectacular showers of flaming debris along the flight paths.",
      "Since then, SpaceX engineers have carried out extensive testing and implemented multiple upgrades and improvements to minimize the chances for similar failures. The Federal Aviation Administration, which oversaw both failure investigations, gave SpaceX permission to proceed with IFT-9 last week after wrapping up the IFT-8 review.",
      "\"The FAA conducted a comprehensive safety review of the SpaceX Starship Flight 8 mishap and determined that the company has satisfactorily addressed the causes of the mishap, and therefore, the Starship vehicle can return to flight,\" the agency said in a statement. \"The FAA will verify SpaceX implements all corrective actions.\"",
      "In both of the previous failures, commercial airline traffic in and around the Straits of Florida was held up pending confirmation falling debris was no longer a threat. For the ninth flight, the length of the Aircraft Hazard Area was expanded from about 1,000 statute miles to around 1,840 miles and SpaceX was required to launch the rocket during non-peak air travel periods.",
      "Plans for the moon and Mars",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship rocket is critical to NASA's plans to land astronauts on the moon in the next few years and to Musk's plans to eventually send humans to Mars.",
      "NASA plans to use a variant of the Starship upper stage as a lunar lander in the agency's Artemis program. NASA wants to use its own rocket and crew capsule to ferry astronauts to lunar orbit where the SpaceX lander will be waiting to carry them down to the surface.",
      "The Trump administration wants to cancel NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule, leaving the future of the Artemis program, as it's currently envisioned, in doubt. For his part, Musk has argued the United States should pass up moon missions, which he called a \"distraction,\" and instead head directly to Mars.",
      "In any case, the Super Heavy-Starship rocket is expected to play a major role in future deep space exploration, regardless of the target. But multiple successful test flights will be needed to demonstrate the safety and reliability needed for astronauts and passengers heading to the moon, Mars or beyond.",
      "In an interview for \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" taped shortly before Tuesday's launch, Musk told correspondent David Pogue, \"If we're lucky, we've probably got about a 50% chance of sending ... ships from Earth to Mars at the end of next year. So November, December next year, in about 18 months.\"",
      "Asked if that timeline was realistic, Musk replied, \"Well, I try to give the 50th percentile. ... So you should expect half the time I'm wrong.\" [See more of the exclusive interview with Musk on \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Sunday, June 1.]",
      "SpaceX made changes after two catastrophic explosions",
      "The last two Starships, launched Jan. 16 and March 6, both ended with unrelated catastrophic explosions as they neared their planned sub-orbital trajectories.",
      "During the January flight, a propellant leak in an unpressurized \"attic\" above the Raptor engines led to sustained fires that eventually triggered shutdown of all but one of the spacecraft's engines. Telemetry was lost eight minutes and 20 seconds after launch and moments later, the vehicle broke apart.",
      "\"The most probable root cause for the loss of ship was identified as a harmonic response several times stronger in flight than had been seen during testing, which led to increased stress on hardware in the propulsion system,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"The subsequent propellant leaks exceeded the venting capability of the ship's attic area and resulted in sustained fires.\"",
      "After extensive ground tests, SpaceX made changes to propellant feedlines, and thrust levels and installed additional vents and a new nitrogen purge system in the attic to reduce the potential for fire.",
      "Those fixes appeared to work as expected during the Starship's eighth test flight in March, but the upper stage again suffered a catastrophic failure. This time around, the Starship suffered a \"hardware failure in one of the upper stage Raptor engines that resulted in inadvertent propellant mixing and ignition,\" SpaceX said on its website.",
      "To fix the problem, upper stage Raptors now feature a new nitrogen purge system, improvements to the propellant drain system and tighter joints in key areas. SpaceX is also developing an improved Raptor engine that will eliminate several failure modes.",

      "\"Empire of AI\" by Karen Hao",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Chapter 1",
      "Divine Right",
      "Everyone else had arrived, but Elon Musk was late as usual. It was the summer of 2015, and a group of men had gathered for a private dinner at Sam Altman's invitation to discuss the future of AI and humanity.",
      "Musk had met Altman, fourteen years his junior, a while earlier and had formed a good impression. President of the famed Silicon Valley startup accelerator Y Combinator, Altman's reputation preceded him. After starting his first company at age nineteen, he had rapidly established himself within Silicon Valley as a brilliant strategist and dealmaker with grand ambitions, even for the land of big\u2011thinking founders. Musk found him to be smart, driven, and, most important, someone who espoused like\u2011minded views on the need to carefully develop and govern artificial intelligence. It was as if, Musk would describe in a lawsuit years later, Altman had mirrored everything Musk had ever said about the subject to win his trust.",
      "For Altman's part, he often said that Musk had been a childhood hero. After the older entrepreneur had shown him around the sprawling SpaceX factory in Hawthorne, California, that admiration had only deepened. \"The thing that sticks in memory was the look of absolute certainty on his face when he talked about sending large rockets to Mars,\" Altman wrote later of the experience. \"I left thinking 'huh, so that's the benchmark for what conviction looks like.'\"",
      "Musk had been deeply concerned about AI for some time. In 2012, he'd met Demis Hassabis, the professorial CEO of the London\u2011based AI lab DeepMind Technologies. Shortly thereafter, Hassabis had also paid Musk a visit at his SpaceX factory. As the two men sat in the canteen, surrounded by the sounds of massive rocket parts being transported and assembled, Hassabis raised the possibility that more advanced AI, of the kind that might one day exceed human intelligence, could pose a threat to humanity. What's more, Musk's fail\u2011safe of colonizing Mars to escape would not work in this scenario. Superintelligence, Hassabis said with amusement, would simply follow humans into the galaxy. Musk, decidedly less amused, invested $5 million in DeepMind to keep tabs on the company.",
      "Later, at his 2013 birthday party in the lush wine\u2011growing landscapes of Napa Valley, Musk had gotten into a heated and emotional debate with his longtime friend and Google cofounder Larry Page over whether AI surpassing human intelligence was in fact a problem. Page didn't think so, calling it the next stage of evolution. When Musk balked, Page accused him of being a \"specist,\" discriminating against nonhuman species.",
      "After that, Musk began to speak incessantly about the existential risk of AI. At an MIT symposium, he described AI as probably the \"biggest existential threat\" to humanity and its development as \"summoning the demon.\" He met with publishers in New York, gripped by the thought of writing his own book about extinction\u2011level threats, including AI. Later, at a recurring AI Salon event at Stanford, a young researcher named Timnit Gebru would come up to him after a talk and ask him why he was so obsessed with AI when the threat of climate change was more clearly existential. \"Climate change is bad, but it's not going to kill everyone,\" he said. \"AI could render humanity extinct.\"",

      "The federal government will begin revoking the visas of some Chinese international students, including those studying in \"critical fields,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday \u2014 the latest restriction on foreign students.",
      "\"Under President Trump's leadership, the U.S. State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields,\" Rubio wrote in a statement.",
      "Rubio also said the government will \"revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong.\"",
      "China is the second-largest country of origin for international students, behind only India. In the 2023-24 school year, more than 270,000 international students were from China, making up roughly a quarter of all foreign students in the United States.",
      "The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. blasted the announcement, saying it is \"firmly opposed to this politically motivated and discriminatory action,\" and urged the administration to \"immediately correct its mistakes and ensure the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese students.\"",
      "\"Such a move by the U.S. side will seriously undermine the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese students in the U.S. It will also further damage the image and reputation of the U.S. itself,\" the statement read.",
      "The U.S. action comes at a time of intensifying scrutiny of the ties between U.S. higher education and China.

      "The reward has been hiked to $50,000 per escapee, authorities announced Thursday, a hefty increase from the $20,000 amount that had been in place for more than a week following the brazen May 16 escape of 10 inmates from the Orleans Justice Center. Eight of the 10 have been captured.",
      "One of the men still at large \u2014 Derrick Groves \u2014 was convicted of murder for the shooting deaths of Jamar Robinson and Byron Jackson in 2024. The other escapee \u2014 Antoine Massey \u2014 was being held on charges of domestic abuse involving strangulation prior to the jailbreak.",
      "Remaining 2 fugitives may have escaped Louisiana, official says",
      "Louisiana State Police Col. Robert Hodges said in a news conference Thursday that while he does not believe Groves or Massey have the resources to flee the U.S., they may have escaped Louisiana thanks to the help from other potential accomplices, and given the amount of time that has passed.",
      "Hodges also said Massey and Groves may have also had time to change their appearance, but that time has likely taken a toll on them, adding, \"they are tired, they are running out of resources.\"",

      "More than 700 tips from the public have poured in since the May 16 escape, Cusanza said, and the Crimestoppers office has had to open up four more phone lines to accommodate all of the calls they are receiving.",
      "So far, at least 14 people have been arrested on allegations they helped the inmates either before or after the escape, including one employee of the jail.",
      "Investigation ongoing into how escape was carried out",

      "The men even took the time to write taunting messages on the wall of the cell before they made a run for it, including, \"we innocent,\" and another misspelled, \"to easy LOL.\"",
      "Jail staff didn't notice the inmates were gone for more than seven hours, and it took a few more hours after that for the public to be notified.",
      "Even New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said that, on the morning of the escape, Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson didn't notify her about what had occurred until after she saw media reports online during a meeting with other managers in her department.",
      "\"We're all sitting here, and (a staff member) said, 'Have you heard anything about an escape?',\" Kirkpatrick recalled in an interview with CBS News. \"We were like, 'No we don't know anything about escape.' And then one of the other chiefs picked up his phone and said, 'It's already in the media.'\"",
      "The Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office has faced sharp criticism for its handling of the investigation into how the escape occurred.",
      "Hutson has alleged that for years she had been asking the city for funding to make critical upgrades to the correctional facility, but that she had been turned down repeatedly.",
      "A 33-year-old maintenance worker at the jail has been arrested and charged with helping the inmates escape, and Murrill has said more employee arrests could be coming.",

    "summary": "A federal court on Wednesday froze the April 2 tariffs imposed by President Trump on almost every foreign nation. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping tariffs on goods imported from almost every foreign nation have been ruled illegal\u00a0by the U.S. Court of International Trade, marking a setback for the president's trade agenda \u2014 and adding another level of uncertainty for U.S. consumers and businesses.",
      "However, a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted the decision, reinstating the levies for now. Its order said that it would grant the Trump administration's request for an immediate administrative stay, and gave the plaintiffs \u2014 five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states \u2014 until June 5 to respond to the administration.",
      "The Wednesday ruling from the court halted the tariffs\u00a0Mr. Trump assessed on virtually every other country on April 2, a day he termed \"Liberation Day.\" Some trading partners faced substantially higher import duties, with the president hiking tariffs on China-produced goods to as high as 145% before easing them temporarily earlier this month.",
      "Mr. Trump's trade agenda hinges on wide-ranging tariffs that he has promised will help bring back U.S. manufacturing jobs while also raising trillions in new revenue for federal coffers. The trade court decision could provide a measure of relief to American businesses and consumers, given that they're typically on the hook for paying the tariffs when imports reach U.S. soil. However, the federal appeal's decision on Thursday to reinstate the duties adds more uncertainty over tariffs.",
      "As the Trump administration's appeal works its way through the courts, it's unclear whether business should ultimately plan for relief if the trade court's ruling stands, or whether the tariffs might stick. And Mr. Trump could seek alternate routes to deploy additional tariffs, experts say.",
      "\"At the moment, it is anyone's guess as to whether these very unpopular tariffs will be reinstated on appeal or by the Supreme Court,\" said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, in a May 29 research note. \"So, uncertainty is now poised to escalate.\"",
      "Here's what to know about Mr. Trump's tariffs following the ruling.",
      "Are any of Mr. Trump's tariffs still in effect?",
      "With the temporary stay imposed by the appeals court, all of his tariffs are \u2014 at least for now \u2014 still in effect.",
      "But the U.S. Court of International Trade's ruling applies to the Trump administration's tariffs that were issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. The Trump administration has also levied additional import duties by tapping other trade rules, and those remain in effect.",
      "\"The tariffs that remain in place are the Section 232 tariffs of 25% on automotive, steel and aluminum imports and the Section 301 tariffs on China that were imposed during President Trump's first term and expanded under the Biden administration,\" analysts at research company Capital Economics noted in a May 29 note.",
      "The president cited the IEEPA to announce the so-called reciprocal tariffs on April 2. At the time of the announcement, Mr. Trump said that trade deficits with other nations represented \"a national emergency.\"",
      "But the court on Wednesday ruled that Mr. Trump's global tariffs aren't authorized by the IEEPA, and said it would be unconstitutional for any law passed by Congress to give the president blanket authority to set tariffs.",
      "\"The court does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder,\" the judges wrote Wednesday.",
      "Could Mr. Trump reinstate the tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump could reinstate the tariffs if he wins on appeal, but his administration could also seek other routes to reimpose the import duties, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",
      "For instance, the president could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 to impose tariffs of up to 15%, but they would be limited to 150 days, according to Goldman Sachs. A section of the Trade Act of 1930 would allow the president to impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from nations that discriminate against the U.S., they added.",
      "\"Section 232 tariffs, which President Trump has already used for steel, aluminum and autos, could be broadened to cover other sectors,\" they noted.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the White House's National Economic Council, told Fox Business on Thursday that the Trump administration had other tariff measures available that would take a few months to put in place. He added, \"But we're not planning on pursuing those right now because we are confident this ruling is incorrect,\" Hassett said.",
      "What about other lawsuits targeting the tariffs?",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs are being challenged in a number of other lawsuits, including one filed by a family-owned toy company called Learning Resources. Its CEO, Rick Woldenberg, had told CBS MoneyWatch in April that he was suing because he believed the tariffs would prove catastrophic, both for his business and the U.S. economy.",
      "On Thursday, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled in favor of Learning Resources, writing in his decision that the IEEPA \"does not authorize the President to impose the tariffs.\" The judge also blocked the Trump administration from collecting tariffs from the toy maker and its sibling business, hand2mind, writing that the companies were likely to suffer \"significant and unrecoverable losses.\"",
      "Woldenberg told CBS MoneyWatch on Thursday that while the court's decision was \"gratifying,\" he's still facing uncertainty over the ongoing threat of tariffs because he expects the Trump administration to appeal the ruling.",
      "\"There is going to be a lot of dust in the air for the next two weeks as 'emergency this' and 'emergency that' are filed all over the place,\" he said. \"For things to change in our business, we need some certainty on our costs.\"",
      "What does this mean for U.S. businesses and consumers?",
      "Until the appeal is resolved, there will be some added level of uncertainty for U.S. businesses, which are on the hook for paying the tariffs when imported goods reach U.S. ports, some economists said on Thursday.",
      "Most or all of the tariffs are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, economists say, which has prompted them to forecast higher inflation in 2025. If the trade court's decision is upheld, the effective tariff rate will ultimately be lowered, although it would still be significantly higher than it was prior to the current Trump administration.",
      "\"We calculate that the effective tariff rate is now 6.5%, up from 2.5% at the start of the year but far lower than the 15% rate based on our assumption of the IEEPA-related tariffs remaining in place,\" noted Capital Economics on Thursday, after the trade court's ruling but before the appeals court said the tariffs could remain in place temporarily.",
      "\"I hope this is a process that will lead to certainty,\" Learning Resources CEO Woldenberg said about the two court rulings. But, he added, \"until I know if it's going to stick, I can't plan around not paying the tariffs.\"",

      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in a brief order that it would grant the Trump administration's request for an immediate administrative stay \"to the extent that the judgments and the permanent injunctions entered by the Court of International Trade in these cases are temporarily stayed\" for now.",
      "A three-judge panel on the trade court unanimously ruled Wednesday that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, which Mr. Trump invoked to impose the levies, did not give the president the authority to set unlimited tariffs on imports from nearly every foreign nation.",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade permanently blocked Mr. Trump's 10% tariff assessed on virtually every U.S. trading partner, as well as the president's duties on imports from Mexico, Canada and China, which the president had imposed in response to what he said was the trafficking of drugs into the U.S. The judges had given the Trump administration 10 days to put their permanent injunction in effect.",
      "\"IEEPA does not authorize any of the Worldwide, Retaliatory, or Trafficking Tariff Orders,\" the trade court found. \"The Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the president by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.\"",
      "The Justice Department asked the Federal Circuit to review the trade court's decision and also requested it halt that ruling while it considers the appeal. The administration warned in a filing Thursday that absent interim relief, it would turn to the Supreme Court \"to avoid the irreparable national-security and economic harms at stake.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News, White House spokesperson Kush Desai called Thursday's ruling \"a positive development for America's industries and workers.\"",
      "\"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country's national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the President in the Constitution and by Congress,\" Desai said. \"Regardless of the developments of this litigation, the President will continue to use all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "In its brief order, the Federal Circuit gave the two sets of plaintiffs \u2014 five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states \u2014 until June 5 to response to the Trump administration's request for a stay. The appeals court has agreed to consider the pair of cases together.",
      "The decision from the U.S. Court of International Trade was a significant setback for Mr. Trump's economic agenda, a centerpiece of which are his tariffs. The president has argued that the duties are crucial to returning manufacturing jobs to the U.S. and will raise more than $1 trillion in revenue. Mr. Trump has also used the tariffs and the threat of higher rates as leverage to force trade partners into negotiations.",
      "The president rolled out his 10% tariffs, as well as a set of now-paused \"reciprocal\" tariffs, in April on what the White House dubbed \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "But the president's tariffs have shaken financial markets and sparked fears of an economic downturn. Mr. Trump has also halted some of the duties, including the \"reciprocal\" tariffs on 57 trading partners.",
      "Mr. Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs led to more than half-a-dozen lawsuits from states and businesses impacted by the duties. The plaintiffs argued that the president did not have the authority to unilaterally slap the tariffs on trading partners under the IEEPA, which has never before been used in that way.",
      "The three judges on the U.S. Court of International Trade agreed, writing in their decision that it \"does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority.\"",
      "In a separate dispute brought by two Illinois-based toy companies, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that Mr. Trump's tariffs imposed under the emergency powers law are unlawful.",
      "Contreras\u00a0found that IEEPA\u00a0\"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in his executive orders and barred the Trump administration from collecting any tariff deriving from them from the two companies. The judge paused his order for 14 days to give the Justice Department time to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which the administration has said it will do.",
      "The case, Contreras wrote in a\u00a033-page decision, \"is about whether IEEPA enables the president to unilaterally impose, revoke, pause, reinstate, and adjust tariffs to reorder the global economy. The court agrees with plaintiffs that it does not.\"",

    "summary": "A federal court on Wednesday blocked most of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "A federal court on Wednesday froze most of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump on virtually every foreign nation, ruling the levies exceed the president's legal authority.",
      "(UPDATE: The ruling has been temporarily halted by an appeals court - read more here.)",
      "The ruling \u2014 issued by a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of International Trade \u2014 halted the sweeping 10% tariffs Mr. Trump assessed on virtually every U.S. trading partner on \"Liberation Day\" last month, with higher tariffs threatened for dozens of countries. The court also blocked a separate set of tariffs imposed on China, Mexico and Canada by the Trump administration, which has cited drug trafficking and illegal immigration as its reasoning for the hikes.",
      "Global markets rallied on the news.",
      "The Trump administration has justified the tariffs by citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which gives the president the power to regulate imports during certain emergency situations. But the court on Wednesday rejected the government's interpretation of the law, and said it would be unconstitutional for any law passed by Congress to give the president blanket authority to set tariffs.",
      "\"The court does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder,\" the judges wrote Wednesday.",
      "The court said Mr. Trump's global 10% tariffs aren't authorized by IEEPA because they're designed to deal with trade imbalances between the U.S. and the rest of the world, which the judges said should fall under non-emergency legislation.",
      "And the China, Canada and Mexico tariffs aren't legal because they \"do not deal with the threats set forth in those orders,\" the court also found.",
      "The three judges who wrote Wednesday's ruling were nominated to the bench by former President Ronald Reagan, former President Barack Obama and Mr. Trump in his first term.",
      "\"It's great to see that the court unanimously ruled against this massive power grab by the President. The ruling emphasizes that he was wrong to claim a virtually unlimited power to impose tariffs, that IEEPA law doesn't grant any such boundless authority, and that it would be unconstitutional if it did.\" Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University involved in one of the lawsuits before the U.S. Court of International Trade, said in a statement.",
      "Following the decision by the U.S. Court of International Trade, a federal district judge in Washington, D.C., ruled that Mr. Trump's tariffs deriving from a series of executive orders invoking IEEPA are unlawful.",
      "U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras found that the law \"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in five of his orders and barred the Trump administration from collecting any tariff deriving from them from the plaintiffs in the case, two family-owned businesses based in Illinois. The judge paused his order for 14 days to give the Justice Department time to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "The case, Contreras wrote in a 33-page decision, \"is about whether IEEPA enables the president to unilaterally impose, revoke, pause, reinstate, and adjust tariffs to reorder the global economy. The court agrees with plaintiffs that it does not.\"",
      "The Trump administration said in court papers with the trade court that it will appeal the ruling to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. The Justice Department has said that if the appeals court declines to provide interim relief in the coming hours, the U.S. will ask the Supreme Court to intervene Friday.",
      "\"Absent at least interim relief from this Court, the United States plans to seek emergency relief from the Supreme Court tomorrow to avoid the irreparable national-security and economic harms at stake,\" the Justice Department filing said.",
      "The department has also asked the U.S. Court of International Trade to pause enforcement of its ruling pending appeal. That court has given the states and small businesses until Friday at 12 p.m. to respond to the government's stay request.",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai responded to the ruling by defending the reasoning for the tariffs, saying the U.S.'s trade deficits with other countries have \"created a national emergency that has decimated American communities.\"",
      "\"It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency. President Trump pledged to put America First, and the Administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness,\" Desai said in a statement.",
      "Tariffs are a signature part of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda. He argues the levies are necessary to boost U.S. manufacturing and end what he views as unfair trade practices. But the moves have rattled financial markets and drawn rebuke from Democrats, as well as some Republicans.",
      "Mr. Trump has stood by his tariff strategy but halted many of the levies while vowing to negotiate with U.S. trading partners. A set of so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries were paused in April for a period of at least three months. Goods that fall under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement were exempted from 25% tariffs. Massive tariffs on Chinese goods have also been cut back amid negotiations.",
      "Meanwhile, the tariffs have drawn lawsuits from businesses, Democratic states and other parties. Wednesday's ruling was linked to two lawsuits: One from a group of businesses that say they have been harmed by the tariffs, and one from several states.",
      "Some of the lawsuits against the tariffs have raised legal doctrines long championed by conservative lawyers and judges to restrict the authority of executive branch agencies. Those include the major questions doctrine, which says Congress needs to give clear authorization for federal agencies to decide issues of major economic significance, and the nondelegation doctrine, which holds that Congress can't delegate its legislative power to the executive branch.",
      "\"If this issue gets to the Supreme Court, which is a big if, and if it comes down to the major questions doctrine or the nondelegation doctrine, and those are big ifs as well, we believe the court's precedent requires them to rule in our favor,\" Somin\u00a0told CBS News earlier this month.",

      "The Trump administration is shaking up Immigration and Customs Enforcement leadership amid continued frustrations within the White House about the level of immigration arrests and deportations conducted by the agency, officials announced Thursday.",
      "Kenneth Genalo will no longer lead Enforcement and Removal Operations, the ICE branch tasked with carrying out arrests and deportations. Genalo, a longtime ICE official, is retiring and plans to advise agency leaders as a special government employee, officials said.",
      "ERO has been spearheading the Trump administration's aggressive and government-wide campaign to ramp up efforts to locate, arrest and deport unauthorized migrants across the country.",
      "Meanwhile, Robert Hammer, the head of ICE's Homeland Security Investigations office, was reassigned to another post within the agency that officials described as a \"critical leadership position.\"",
      "As the Department of Homeland Security's investigative arm, HSI is a specialized law enforcement agency that has historically focused on combating transnational crime, like child exploitation and human trafficking, but many of its agents have been diverted by the Trump administration to support immigration arrest and deportation efforts.",
      "Genalo and Hammer will be replaced by Marcos Charles and Derek Gordon, two career ICE officials, the agency said in a statement Thursday.",
      "In that statement, ICE portrayed the changes as a \"leadership realignment to support its increasing operational tempo.\"",
      "\"Organizational realignments will help ICE achieve President Trump and the American people's mandate of arresting and deporting criminal illegal aliens and making American communities safe,\" the agency said.",
      "ICE leadership has faced intense pressure from the White House to increase arrests of migrants who are living in the U.S. illegally or under one of several temporary immigration programs the Trump administration is seeking to dismantle.",
      "Stephen Miller, the White House's deputy chief of staff, said Wednesday on Fox News that the administration is pushing ICE to carry out \"a minimum\" of 3,000 arrests per day \u2014 a target that would amount to an unprecedented expansion of immigration enforcement.",
      "Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

    "summary": "The Court of International Trade has dealt a serious blow to President Trump's tariff policy. Here's what to know about the court.",
    "story": [
      "Federal judges in the U.S. have challenged the Trump administration on everything from deportations of immigrants to mass layoffs of\u00a0government workers. Now, the U.S. Court of International Trade is stepping in to challenge President Trump's sweeping tariffs.",
      "The New York-based court\u00a0late Wednesday struck down most of the tariffs implemented under Mr. Trump, dealing a serious blow to one of his signature economic policies. Mr. Trump has said tariffs are necessary to erase the trade deficit, make the U.S. more competitive and energize the U.S. manufacturing sector.",
      "The ruling\u00a0voided both a 10% baseline tariff on most countries introduced on April 2 in what the president referred to as \"Liberation Day,\" and also blocks a separate set of levies imposed on China, Mexico and Canada. It does not impact U.S. tariffs assessed on specific sectors, including steel, aluminum and autos.",
      "A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily suspended the trade court's decision freezing the tariffs, reinstating the levies for now.",
      "Read on to learn more about the Court of International Trade and how it operates.",
      "What is the Court of International Trade?",
      "Located in downtown Manhattan, the U.S. Court of International Trade, or CIT, is a federal court that focuses on international trade issues. It resolves disputes between governments, manufacturers, trade associations and other parties that may be privy to trade dealings.",
      "According to the CIT's\u00a0website, the court serves as the main judicial forum for resolving civil actions related to import transactions and federal issues affecting global trade. In that role, the CIT helps avoid jurisdictional conflicts on trade matters that might arise among other federal courts.",
      "The Court of International Trade was created\u00a0as part of the the Customs Court Act of 1980, which reorganized the U.S. Customs Court into the CIT. The new court was established under Article III of the Constitution and has jurisdiction over any trade-related issues arising in the U.S. It is also authorized to hold hearings in foreign countries, according the court's website.",
      "The courthouse is located at One Federal Plaza in New York City.",
      "How many judges sit on the court?",
      "Nine judges sit on the Court of International Trade, all of whom are appointed for life. Those judges are chosen by the U.S. president, but the Senate must consent to those selections. According to the rules of the court, no more than five judges can be from the same political party.",
      "Currently, the court's chief judge is Mark Barnett. He appointed by President Barack Obama in 2013 and began his post as chief judge in 2021, according to his bio page on the court's website.",
      "Which judges stuck down the Trump tariffs?",
      "Three CIT judges rules that President Trump exceeded his legal authority in imposing the tariffs: Judge Timothy Reif, who was nominated by Mr. Trump; Judge Jane Restani, who was nominated by former President Ronald Reagan; and Judge Gary Katzmann, who was nominated by former President Obama.",
      "How do rulings work?",
      "Typically, the CIT's chief judge assigns cases to a specific judge. In certain instances, including when the case involves a presidential executive order or if it has broad legal implications for customs laws, the chief judge can assign it to a three-judge panel. Cases are then decided by a majority of judges.",
      "In Wednesday's decision, the judges unanimously ruled to block the Trump administration tariffs introduced under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977.",
      "Although the CIT is in New York, the court's judges have nationwide jurisdiction and preside over cases across the U.S. If a case is appealed, as it was in this instance, it then moves the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. and, potentially, to the Supreme Court.",
      "What types of cases does the court rule on?",
      "The Court of International Trade resolves trade disputes by interpreting U.S. customs and international trade laws, such as the Tariff Act of 1930. One example would be enforcing anti-dumping or countervailing duties, which protect domestic manufacturers by preventing foreign companies from selling goods at prices below market value.",
      "The court rules on dozens of cases each year. So far this year, it has issued 66 opinions.",

    "published": "Thu, 29 May 2025 15:41:02 -0400",
    "summary": "New delinquency reports will hurt the credit scores of borrowers who fail to make payments on their student loans.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's resumption of student loan payments earlier this month is taking a toll on many borrowers' credit records.",
      "Credit scores dropped by more than 100 points for 2.2 million delinquent student loan borrowers from January through March of 2025, according to recent\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. For its report, the Fed looked at a borrower delinquency rate based on shares of student loan borrowers with at least one student loan reported as past due or in default.",
      "Another 1 million borrowers experienced credit score drops of at least 150 points for the first three months of 2025. A low credit score makes securing future loans both more difficult and more costly, pushing milestones like buying a home, or saving for retirement, further out of reach. It can even impact one's employment prospects.",
      "\"The key risk is that this could lead to reduced credit limits and higher interest rates for new loans, which could reduce delinquent borrowers' access to credit, which would then be used for other areas of spending such as on cars and mortgages,\" Grace Zwemmer, associate economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some 2.4 million of the newly delinquent borrowers previously had credit scores above 620, which are considered good and would have allowed them to qualify for new car loans, mortgages and credit cards before the delinquencies were reported, Fed researchers said.",
      "\"These borrowers saw substantial declines in their credit standing in the first quarter and will now face steeper borrowing costs or denial for new credit,\" Fed researchers said in the report.",
      "Grace period expires",
      "Student loan repayments were paused at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic by President Trump in March 2020, during his first term. After multiple extensions of the payment pause by former President Biden, repayments resumed in October 2023.",
      "The U.S. Department of Education then instituted a 12-month \"on ramp\" period which expired in October 2024, to give student borrowers some leniency as they resumed payments. During the transition period, loan servicers did not report missed payments or delinquent loans to credit bureaus, protecting many student borrowers from the worst consequences of not making their payments. Borrowers are considered delinquent on their loans when a payment is more than 90 days late.",
      "The pandemic-era pause on repayment had a positive effect on borrowers' credit scores: Between 2019 and 2024, the number of borrowers with credit scores below 620 fell by more than 4 million, as borrowers moved into higher credit score brackets, an analysis from Oxford economics shows.",
      "With that grace period having ended on May 5, newly delinquent student borrowers' credit scores are also being dinged, as their failures to pay back their debts are reported to credit bureaus.",
      "\"Borrowers receiving a new delinquency will see a drop in their credit score. This may signal a reversal of the positive credit score trend seen during the pandemic, which would lead to reduced credit limits and higher interest rates for new loans,\" Oxford Economics researchers wrote in a report.",
      "Long-lasting consequences",
      "Substantial drops in delinquent student borrowers' credit scores will have long-lasting ramifications for those affected, including lower credit limits, higher interest rates for new loans and limited access to credit in general, according to experts.",
      "\"The long-term issue is they'll have trouble accessing other types of loans in the future, like mortgage and car loans. It's easier to build credit scores when you don't have negative data, but when you have a delinquency, it's hard to come out of that. It takes a lot of effort,\" Tushar Bagamane, CEO of budgeting tool Vola Finance, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Consumers with multiple delinquencies report having to pay \"exorbitantly high on interest\" on larger loans once a delinquency impacts their credit score, Bagamane said.",
      "\"They have to pay more on their home loans and the cost of those lines of credit affects the income they have left after meeting their essential needs,\" he said. \"The ability to refinance existing loans with a low credit score can be prohibitively expensive and at that point, borrowers are almost left outside the financial system.\"",
      "By that he means they can't achieve milestones like owning a home or acquiring other assets, \"which is not a good position to be in,\" Bagamane added.",
      "American dream increasingly out of sight",
      "Zwemmer, of Oxford Economics, noted that a delinquency remains on one's credit report for seven years, and so avoiding becoming delinquent on a loan in the first place is the best course of action. If millions of student borrowers drop into lower credit score brackets, it could exacerbate the divide between low-income and higher-income Americans.",
      "\"Older and lower-income segments of the population will be most impacted, so we'll be looking to see if there's a further bifurcation of U.S. consumers,\" Zwemmer said.",
      "Jason Ackerman, a certified public accountant and co-founder of WealthRabbit, a retirement planning platform, said that as their credit scores drop, those who can least afford to shoulder higher borrowing costs will see their rates rise.",
      "\"Younger people are getting further behind on the American dream of buying a house and saving for retirement,\" Ackerman told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Their payments get higher \u2014 and the more you're putting toward student loans, the less you can put toward other things.\"",

He added that his Department of Government Efficiency's \"mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.\"",
      "Musk, a billionaire entrepreneur, was set to begin his offboarding process with the White House on Wednesday night, according to an administration official. But that doesn't mean his relationship with the president or time at the White House are over.",
      "\"Musk left on good terms and is still friends with the president,\" a senior administration official told CBS News. \"This isn't a separation, but just a return to the private sector for Musk. He will continue to be a friend to the president, and we can characterize that as an 'adviser.'\"",
      "Musk is not likely to participate in Cabinet meetings, but potentially could in the future, the official said. Steve Davis, a top Musk lieutenant at DOGE, is also leaving the White House, as are top adviser Katie Miller and DOGE general counsel James Burnham, according to a White House official.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that others in the administration, including the president himself, will be responsible for implementing the DOGE agenda going forward.",
      "Asked who is in charge of DOGE, Leavitt responded, \"Well again, the DOGE leaders are each and every member of the president's Cabinet and the president himself, who is wholeheartedly committed to cutting waste, fraud and abuse from our government.\"",
      "Musk's DOGE team has upturned the government through employee cuts at nearly every federal agency and the termination of billions of dollars of government contracts. Musk has said the effort has cut around $160 billion in spending. However, some of the spending cuts cited by DOGE have\u00a0contained errors, and one report estimates the cuts could cost the government $135 billion due to lost productivity and the cost of putting staff on leave and re-hiring some workers.",
      "The White House said in February that Musk is a \"special government employee,\" or SGE. The designation allowed him to work for the executive branch, subject to different ethics rules than federal employees.",
      "But SGEs are limited to working 130 days in a 365-day period. Friday, May 30, would mark 130 days since Mr. Trump was inaugurated for his second term and when Musk's work at DOGE began.",
      "Musk's announced departure comes a day after a\u00a0\"CBS Sunday Morning\" interview\u00a0where he criticized the budget bill passed by House Republicans last week. The bill has been backed heavily by Mr. Trump, who dubbed it the \"big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "\"I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Musk told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" correspondent David Pogue in a broadcast exclusive interview.",
      "In an April earnings call with Musk's car company Tesla, he told investors his time at DOGE would \"drop significantly\" in May so he could focus on his companies. Musk suggested he would spend one to two days a week on government work, \"as long as the president would like me to do so.\" Some Tesla investors pushed Musk to dial back his involvement in the Trump administration, worrying his attention was divided and the carmaker's brand was at risk.",
      "White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said in a Fox Business interview on Wednesday that the Trump administration will make some of DOGE's cuts permanent through a bill in Congress known as a rescission package, which is a way for Congress to cancel funds it previously appropriated but that the federal government has not yet spent. Vought said that cuts to foreign aid and the U.S. Agency for International Development, as well as funds to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, would be included first.",

    "story": [
      "Stocks are up on Thursday following an early morning boost after a U.S. court blocked many of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. But the gains got less strong as trading progressed from Asia to New York.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 26 points, or 0.5% as of 1:03 p.m. EST. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 26 points, or 0.06%, the Nasdaq composite was .6% higher.",
      "\"Investors are keeping their enthusiasm in check for a variety of reasons,\" Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, said in a research. \"To start, the tariff drama isn't over \u2013 Trump has other legal avenues to pursue an aggressive tariff agenda, and investors expect he will utilize them. In addition, the popularity of the \"TACO Trade\" perspective has caused the tariff narrative to ease dramatically in the last couple of weeks, to the point where many people already assumed the overall burden won't be much worse than the 10% baseline when all is said and done,\" he said.",
      "Gains were bigger in Asia, where markets had the first chance to react to the ruling issued late on Wednesday by the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York. It said that the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act that Trump cited for ordering massive increases in taxes on imports worldwide does not authorize the use of tariffs.",
      "Tariff threat still \"very real\"",
      "The White House immediately appealed, and the long-term outcome of legal disputes over tariffs remains uncertain. The court's ruling also affects only some of Trump's tariffs, not those on foreign steel, aluminum and autos, which were invoked under a different law.",
      "Trump \"is still able to impose significant and wide-ranging tariffs over the longer-term through other means,\" according to Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer of global equities at UBS Global Wealth Management.",

      "Until the appeal is resolved, there will also be some added level of\u00a0uncertainty for U.S. businesses, some economists said on Thursday.",
      "The trade court's decision \"to suspend newly imposed tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, along with the universal 10% duties, \"offers potential short-term tariff relief,\" but also \"introduces greater ambiguity around the future direction of U.S. trade policy, particularly as the ruling faces appeal,\" Gregory Daco, EY chief Economist, said in a research note.",

    "summary": "Senate Republicans say they intend to change the House-passed bill, and some pointed to changes to Medicaid as a possible red line.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate will soon be considering the massive legislation containing President Trump's second-term agenda after House Republicans passed it last week, following days of negotiations over changes to Medicaid, among other key issues.",
      "Senate Republicans will put their \"imprint\" on the bill, as Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota put it, and some pointed to changes to Medicaid as a possible red line for those who are undecided. As recently as Memorial Day weekend, at least one, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said she's still going over the House bill: \"I'm still looking at it because it kept changing up until literally the very minute it passed.\"",
      "Medicaid is the popular entitlement program that provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans and people with disabilities. The federal government shares the costs of the program with states, shouldering a minimum of 50% of the costs for richer states, while contributing more for the poorest. In 2025, it\u00a0paid\u00a077% of the Medicaid costs for Mississippi.",
      "Here's what to know about the changes to Medicaid in the House measure and the reaction so far by some GOP senators who have said they're concerned about the Medicaid provisions:",
      "Potential Republican opposition in the Senate",
      "Some of the House's Medicaid provisions may face resistance in the Senate. And with a narrow majority, Senate Republicans can only afford to lose three of their members if everyone votes.",
      "Collins and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who have been willing to break with their party on certain issues, say changes to Medicaid must not hurt their states. And the two senators, along with Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, supported an amendment to the budget resolution that would have removed the language instructing the committee that oversees Medicaid from finding $880 billion in cuts. That amendment failed.",
      "In a New York Times opinion piece earlier this month, Hawley called \"slashing health insurance for the working poor\" both \"morally wrong and politically suicidal.\" And although he's outlined his support for the legislation's work requirements, he's drawn a red line on any Medicaid benefit cuts.",
      "Expanding Medicaid work requirements",
      "The legislation includes new work requirements that would apply to childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64. A last-minute amendment to the bill would speed up the implementation of the work requirements from Jan. 1, 2029, to no later than Dec. 31, 2026 \u2014 a change sought by hardliners. There are exemptions for those who are caregivers for dependent children or who are pregnant, among others.",
      "Hawley likes the idea of work requirements and told the Washington Examiner in February that it's \"probably something that unites Republicans.\" Collins recently also said she supports some work requirements, and Murkowski, in a conversation with the nonprofit Foraker Group, suggested that she could support them \u2014 as long as its implementation is overseen by states, which could have \"some level of flexibility\" in applying the requirement.",
      "In a state like Alaska, Murkowski said, \"It's going to be a little bit different if you're out in a rural area where you don't have the opportunity for jobs unless you move into the city, or if you are the full-time caregiver for someone in your family.\"",
      "Cutting down on \"waste, fraud and abuse\"",
      "Republicans argue that more frequent eligibility checks on Medicaid recipients will cut down significantly on \"waste, fraud and abuse.\" The bill requires states to check at least every six months whether adults covered under the Medicaid expansion are still eligible. States would also be required to take steps to obtain enrollees' updated contact information and check a Social Security Administration database more frequently to determine whether any enrolled individuals have died. GOP senators who may be undecided on the bill have not yet indicated whether they object to this proposal.",
      "Penalizing states that provide health benefits to undocumented migrants",
      "The bill also includes a provision that would reduce federal funds to states that provide state-funded health care to undocumented immigrants. Though people who are in the U.S. illegally are not eligible to receive Medicaid coverage, 14 states and Washington, D.C., have expanded their state-funded health coverage to include children regardless of their immigration status, according to KFF, while seven states and D.C. cover some adults.",
      "Under the Affordable Care Act, 40 states and D.C. have expanded Medicaid, enabling them to receive federal funding for 90% of the costs for low-income people receiving health care coverage under the expansion.

The bill initially blocked gender-affirming care for minors but was updated to include adults before its passage in the House.",
      "Freezing provider taxes",
      "States can boost federal Medicaid contributions to their states through what's known as a provider tax, often levying taxes on health care providers, which raises the overall cost of a service and therefore increases the portion paid by the state. For instance, if the cost of a service is $1,000, and the state and federal government split is 50-50, the state might add a 5% provider tax that would bring the total cost of the service to $1,050. That would mean that the federal government would reimburse the state $525, rather than $500. The House measure aims to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "Murkowski cited provider taxes as one possible cost-saving measure that's \"not going to hurt Alaskans.\"",
      "\"It's about $170 billion in savings that could be had if we were to eliminate that,\" she told The Foraker Group. \"To me, that's a real savings.\"",

    "story": [
      "Reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley were pardoned\u00a0Wednesday by President Trump. The couple have been incarcerated since 2022 after being found guilty of bank and tax fraud.",
      "Todd Chrisley, 57, has been serving a 12-year sentence at Florida's FPC Pensacola minimum-security men's federal prison with a release date of April 2032, according to the Bureau of Prisons. Julie Chrisley, 52, meanwhile, has been serving a 7-year sentence at the FMC Lexington prison in Kentucky, with a release date of January 2028, the BOP says.",
      "Scott Taylor, a spokesperson for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, told CBS News in an email that both Todd and Julie Chrisley were released from prison Wednesday.",
      "\"I am grateful to God and extremely grateful to President Trump and his entire administration. I'm beyond thankful to finally have my parents back home and my family together again!\" said Chase Chrisley, one of the couple's children, in a statement.",
      "Who are Todd and Julie Chrisley?",
      "The married couple gained prominence on the reality show \"Chrisley Knows Best,\" which debuted on the cable channel USA Network in 2014. The show depicted the wealthy couple \u2014 Todd Chrisley made his money in real estate \u2014 as they dealt with issues such as child-rearing and their careers.",
      "The show was\u00a0described as \"humorously voyeuristic\" by Common Sense Media. The program ended after 10 seasons in March 2023, after the Chrisleys were sentenced for tax and bank fraud.",
      "What were the Chrisleys convicted of?",
      "The pair were indicted in 2019\u00a0on charges including conspiring to defraud community banks out of more than $30 million in loans, with a federal jury convicting them in June 2022. The couple was also convicted of conspiring to defraud the IRS, along with additional tax crimes, the U.S. Attorney's Office of the Northern District of Georgia said at the time.",
      "The jury found that the couple submitted fake bank statements and other financial records to obtain personal loans, which they then used to buy luxury cars, designer clothes, real estate and travel.",
      "\"After spending all the money, Todd Chrisley filed for bankruptcy and walked away from more than $20 million of the fraudulently obtained loans,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office said in 2022 after their conviction.",
      "Meanwhile, the couple concealed their income from their reality TV show from the IRS to avoid paying nearly $500,000 in delinquent taxes. The Chrisleys also failed to file tax returns and pay taxes from 2013 through 2016.",
      "\"These convictions should send a clear message regardless of your fame or notoriety, everyone will be held accountable for paying their fair share of taxes,\" said James E. Dorsey, special agent in charge, IRS-Criminal Investigation, in a statement\u00a0on the Chrisley's convictions.",
      "Why did Trump pardon the Chrisleys?",
      "In a call Tuesday with the couple's children, Mr. Trump said the couple received \"pretty harsh treatment, based on what I'm hearing.\" He added that he doesn't know the Chrisleys personally.",
      "According to the statement from the Chrisley's law firm, the pair had sought a presidential pardon earlier this year by alleging \"serious misconduct by the government, including an illegal raid, reliance on tainted evidence and a trial that featured false testimony from a key government witness.\"",
      "Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, was a speaker at the 2024 Republican National Convention, with the law firm noting that she \"publicly thanked President Trump for standing up against political prosecutions and fighting for families like hers.\"",
      "Their lawyer, Alex Little, said in the statement that the Chrisleys were targets because of their political views.",
      "\"This pardon corrects a deep injustice and restores two devoted parents to their family and community,\" Little said. \"President Trump recognized what we've argued from the beginning: Todd and Julie were targeted because of their conservative values and high profile. Their prosecution was tainted by multiple constitutional violations and political bias.\"",

    "story": [
      "An Argentine court on Thursday declared a mistrial in the case of seven health professionals accused of negligence in the death of soccer legend Diego Maradona, the latest soap-operatic turn in the trial that has transfixed the soccer world.",
      "The judges ruled there would be a new trial, without specifying when.",
      "The pivot comes after one of the three judges overseeing the trial stepped down over criticism surrounding her participation in a forthcoming documentary series about the case, \"Divine Justice,\" which spanned from the aftermath of Maradona's death, as scandals and suspicions of foul play began to emerge, to the start of the trial.",
      "In calling for the judge, Julieta Makintach, to be recused, the prosecutor on Tuesday presented the trailer for her documentary \u2014 a one-and-a-half-minute teaser that intercuts archival footage of Maradona scoring iconic goals with shots of Makintach strutting through the corridors of the Buenos Aires courthouse in high heels and a short skirt as a string soundtrack heightens suspense.",
      "The prosecutor asked judges to investigate allegations that Makintach had violated judicial ethics in allowing a camera crew inside the courthouse to film her overseeing closed-door hearings for the reality TV-style series.",
      "As the claims snowballed into a national scandal, Makintach on Tuesday said that she had \"no choice\" but to resign from the case.",
      "The judges decided on Thursday to retry the entire case, effectively turning the clock back on all proceedings since March 11, when the trial began amid intense media scrutiny and called dozens of distraught witnesses to testify over 21 hearings.",
      "\"Judge Makintach did not act impartially. Her conduct caused harm to both the plaintiffs and the defense,\" Judge Maximiliano Savarino said in declaring the mistrial. \"The only person responsible is the recused judge.\"",
      "He added: \"This is an unpleasant decision.\"",
      "At the courthouse, two of the soccer star's daughters, Gianinna and Dalma Maradona, began to weep.",
      "The decision threw into doubt the timeline of the trial, which was initially expected to last until July. Thursday's ruling said that a higher court would select the three new judges by lottery \"within a reasonable period of time.\"",
      "The case accuses Maradona's medical team of failing to provide adequate care for the soccer star in weeks leading up to his sudden death on Nov. 25, 2020. Maradona died at age 60 from cardiac arrest while recovering from surgery for a blood clot on the brain at a rented home outside Buenos Aires.",
      "Although the case largely hinges on medical technicalities, the biweekly testimonies have also become tabloid fodder \u2014 like much in Maradona's life, which included long spates of drug and alcohol abuse.",
      "Experts have taken the stand to allege that Maradona agonized for 12 hours before his death, while his sisters and daughters have tearfully accused his medics of leaving him alone in squalor when he should have been hospitalized.",
      "The defendants, who deny all accusations, were charged with culpable homicide, a crime similar to involuntary manslaughter in that it implies the accused were aware of the risk caused by their reckless conduct and ignored it.",
      "They include Leopoldo Luque, Maradona's primary physician at the time of his death, as well as his psychologist, psychiatrist, medical coordinator and nurses.",
      "The crime carries a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison. The defendants say Maradona was a difficult patient who did not allow himself to be treated.",
      "Maradona, who famously led Argentina to victory in the 1986 World Cup, is regarded as one of the greatest soccer players of all time. His rags-to-riches story resonated with his fellow Argentines and he is widely revered as a national hero.",

    "story": [
      "Berlin \u2014\u00a0When Karin Prien's mother brought her to Germany as a little girl in the late 1960s, she gave her one urgent warning: \"Don't tell anyone you're Jewish.\"",
      "Nearly six decades later, Prien is now post World War II Germany's first Jewish federal cabinet member, having been selected as the Minister for Education, Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth.",
      "Prien told CBS News she intends to use her platform to confront the rise of antisemitism in Germany and further afield, and the fragility of democracy in a country still reckoning with its past.",
      "\"Well, in a way, I'm proud,\" the minister told CBS News in a candid interview. \"Proud to be a minister in the federal government, but also that I'm recognized as Jewish and that German society is now so far [advanced] as to accept that Jewish people have a right to be a self-conscious part of this society.\"",
      "Prien's political career, and her personal story, represent an arc of conflict, tension and reconciliation that echoes that of post-Holocaust Germany itself.",
      "\"A question of responsibility\"",
      "Born in the Netherlands to Holocaust survivors, Prien moved to Germany at the age of 4. Even as a child, she was heavily aware of the silence surrounding her family's identity. Her mother's warning that it was still too dangerous to talk about being Jewish \u2014 more than two decades after the war ended \u2014 shaped her early years.",
      "\"There was always fear. My mother was afraid that there were too many Nazis still around,\" Prien said. \"It wasn't taken for granted that you could talk about being Jewish. It was something you kept inside the home.\"",
      "But that silence eventually became intolerable. As a young teen, she said she began to understand that the democratic values she cherished \u2014 freedom, human dignity, anti-discrimination\u2014- required defending.",
      "\"I decided, 'I have to do something about it. Democracy is not something you can take for granted,'\" she said.",
      "But Prien still waited decades before publicly acknowledging her Jewish identity.",
      "The turning point came in the early 2010s, when she was already a member of state parliament in Hamburg. Prien began pushing for systematic documentation of antisemitic incidents in schools. When a journalist asked why the issue mattered so much to her, she paused and then told him: \"Because I'm Jewish.\"",
      "\"That was the moment I realized I had a political voice,\" she recalled. \"I had some kind of influence. And for me, it was a question of responsibility.\"",
      "Lessons from the past for the threats of today",
      "That sense of responsibility weighs heavily on Prien in today's Germany, where she said antisemitism is no longer confined to the political fringes.",
      "\"We see rising antisemitism all over the world,\" Prien said. \"They dare to be openly antisemitic. I think it's now more than after the end of World War II. They dare to be openly antisemitic, and that's also in Germany getting stronger and stronger. That has changed. And so we have antisemitic tendencies on the margins, but we also have it in the middle of society.\"",
      "While Germany once appeared to be a model of historical reckoning, Prien said she fears complacency is setting in.",
      "After some \"honest decades,\" during which Prien says Germans confronted themselves with the stark realities of their country's history, \"now, people are dying. And now we have to find new ways to talk about that.\"",
      "Prien thinks that should include a shift in Holocaust education. She wants German schools to expand from their current focus on the atrocities of World War II to also teach the history of Israel, the cultural contributions of Jewish Germans, and the origins of antisemitism.",
      "\"Jewish identity is part of German identity,\" she told CBS News. \"Young people need to know that Jews are not only victims. Jewish people are diverse. They have a voice. They are part of this society.\"",
      "Prien said she draws inspiration from figures including Margot Friedl\u00e4nder, a Holocaust survivor who famously coined the phrase: \"Be Human.\"",
      "That, Prien said, should be the foundation of any education system in a democracy: teaching empathy and human dignity.",
      "But it's not only historical facts and universal dignity that need defending, she said, it's also Germany's democratic fabric.",
      "\"We are an immigration society,\" Prien said. \"But we're not very good at having fair and equal chances for children who start with more difficult conditions.\"",
      "She sees educational equity and national democratic resilience as intrinsically linked.",
      "Prien is now leading efforts to limit mobile phone use in German elementary schools, warning that parents and policymakers have been too naive about the risks of digital exposure for young people.",
      "\"We are anxious about the real world. We drive our kids to school and into the classrooms but we are not anxious about the stuff online,\" she said. \"That has to change.\"",
      "Asked what message she has for young Jews with political ambitions in Germany today, Prien didn't hesitate: \"Stay. Don't pack your luggage. This is a different Germany. This is a country where you can live safely. And it's our job to make that promise true every day.\"",

      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Israel signed off on a proposal that special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Trump submitted, and it's been sent to Hamas.",
      "An Israeli official and a U.S. source familiar confirmed the proposed deal includes not only the 60-day ceasefire but also plans to release 10 living hostages and the remains of 18 dead hostages.",
      "The U.S. source added that \"aid will flow.\"",
      "\"I can confirm that special envoy Witkoff and the president submitted a ceasefire proposal to Hamas that Israel backed and supported,\" Leavitt said Thursday. \"Israel signed off on this proposal before it was sent to Hamas. I can also confirm that those discussions are continuing, and we hope that a ceasefire in Gaza will take place so we can return all of the hostages home.\"",
      "Leavitt said Hamas hasn't accepted the deal, to her knowledge, but if there is a deal, the public will hear so directly from her, Witkoff or the president himself.",
      "Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas official, said in a statement that the proposal \"fails to meet any of our people's demands, foremost among them an end to the war and famine,\" but the \"movement's leadership is studying the response with full national responsibility, in light of the genocide our people are facing.\"",
      "A senior Hamas figure closely involved in negotiations told CBS News they are studying the proposal and don't feel there are a lot of options. Hamas is asking the U.S. for clear guarantees that Israel is not going to attack Gaza within the 60 days of the ceasefire, the senior Hamas figure said.",
      "A source familiar with the U.S. outreach to Hamas tells CBS News that a deal is close, and once a response is received, it will be transmitted directly to Mr. Trump and Witkoff.",
      "President Trump has expressed optimism recently that there would be a deal. Hamas still holds 58 hostages, roughly one-third of whom are believed to still be alive, out of about 250 who were taken during the group's terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The rest have either been released during earlier pauses in fighting or have been confirmed dead.",
      "An earlier two-month ceasefire between Israel and Hamas ended in March after the two sides failed to agree on terms for extending it and Israel resumed strikes on the Gaza Strip. During that temporary truce, dozens of hostages were released by Hamas in exchange for Israel freeing some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was open to a temporary ceasefire deal to release more hostages, but \"there will be no way we will stop the war\" until Hamas is defeated.",
      "Some 1,200 people were killed in Hamas' 2023 terrorist attack on Israel, mostly civilians. Since then, about 54,000 people have been killed in Israel's war in the Gaza Strip, most of whom are women and children, according to the Hamas-run Ministry of Health, which does not distinguish between civilian and combatant deaths.",
      "Aid deliveries to the Gaza Strip resumed earlier this month after a more than two-month blockade. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a controversial new U.S.- and Israeli-backed aid group, began distributing food this week.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-settlements-west-bank-obstacle-palestinian-statehood/",
    "published": "Thu, 29 May 2025 15:15:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Israel said the newly announced settlements\u200b in the occupied West Bank would include the legalization of outposts already built without government authorization.",
    "story": [
      "Israel said Thursday it would establish 22 Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, including the legalization of outposts already built without government authorization. Neighboring Jordan and Britain slammed the move, with a top U.K. official calling it a \"deliberate obstacle\" to Palestinian statehood.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, along with the Gaza Strip  and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war and the Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. The majority of the international community views settlements as illegal and an obstacle to resolving the decades-old conflict.",
      "Defense Minister Israel Katz said the settlement decision \"strengthens our hold on Judea and Samaria,\" using the biblical term for the West Bank. He said it \"anchors our historical right in the Land of Israel, and constitutes a crushing response to Palestinian terrorism.\"",
      "He added that the construction of settlements was also \"a strategic move that prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger Israel.\"",
      "The Israeli anti-settlement watchdog group Peace Now said the announcement was the most extensive move of its kind since the 1993 Oslo accords that launched the now-defunct peace process. It said the settlements, which are deep inside the territory, would \"dramatically reshape the West Bank and entrench the occupation even further.\"",
      "Israel has already built well over 100 settlements across the territory that are home to some 500,000 settlers. The settlements range from small hilltop outposts to fully developed communities with apartment blocks, shopping malls, factories and parks.",
      "The West Bank is home to 3 million Palestinians, who live under Israeli military rule with the Palestinian Authority administering population centers. The settlers have Israeli citizenship.",
      "Peace Now said the plans call for the authorization of 12 existing outposts, the development of nine new settlements and reclassifying a neighborhood of an existing settlement as a separate one.",
      "\"The government is making clear \u2014 again and without restraint \u2014 that it prefers deepening the occupation and advancing de facto annexation over pursuing peace,\" the group said.",
      "Israel has accelerated settlement construction in recent years \u2014 long before Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel, which ignited the war in Gaza. The settlements have confined\u00a0Palestinians to smaller and smaller areas of the West Bank and made the prospect of establishing a viable, independent state even more remote.",
      "A spokesperson for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called the move a \"dangerous escalation\" and accused Israel of moving the region into a \"cycle of violence and instability.\"",
      "\"This extremist Israeli government is trying by all means to prevent the establishment of an independent Palestinian state,\" the spokesperson, Nabil Abu Rudeineh, told the Reuters news agency.",
      "In a statement, Hamas \u2014 the group that the U.S. and Israel have designated as terrorists that controls Gaza \u2014 accused Israel of \"an acceleration of efforts to Judaize Palestinian land as part of an explicit annexation project.\"",
      "\"It constitutes a brazen challenge to international will and a grave violation of international law and United Nations resolutions,\" said the Palestinian militant group.",
      "Western ally Jordan also condemned the move as illegal, and said it \"undermines prospects for peace by entrenching the occupation.\"",
      "The Jordanian foreign ministry warned that \"such unilateral actions further erode the viability of a two-state solution by impeding the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state.\"",
      "Britain's minister for the Middle East, Hamish Falconer, slammed the decision as a \"deliberate obstacle to Palestinian statehood,\" saying settlements \"imperil the two state solution, and do not protect Israel.\"",
      "During his first term, President Trump's administration broke with decades of U.S. foreign policy by supporting Israel's claims to territory seized by force and taking steps to legitimize the settlements. Former President Joe Biden, like most of his predecessors, opposed the settlements but applied little pressure to Israel to curb their growth.",
      "The top United Nations court ruled last year that Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territories is unlawful and called on it to end, and for settlement construction to stop immediately.",
      "Israel denounced the non-binding opinion by a 15-judge panel of the International Court of Justice, saying the territories are part of the historic homeland of the Jewish people.",
      "Israel withdrew its settlements from the Gaza Strip in 2005, but leading figures in the current government have called for them to be re-established and for much of the Palestinian population of the territory to be resettled elsewhere through what they describe as voluntary emigration.",
      "Palestinians view such plans as a blueprint for their forcible expulsion from their homeland, and experts say the plans would likely violate international law.",
      "Israel now controls more than 70% of Gaza, according to Yaakov Garb, a professor of environmental studies at Ben Gurion University, who has examined Israeli-Palestinian land use patterns for decades.",
      "The area includes buffer zones along the border with Israel as well as the southern city of Rafah, which is now mostly uninhabited, and other large areas that Israel has ordered to be evacuated.",
      "The war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, in which terrorists stormed into Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Hamas still holds 58 hostages, around a third of them believed to be still alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements. Israeli forces have rescued eight and recovered dozens of bodies.",
      "Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 54,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilian and combatant casualties.",

    "story": [
      "London - The controversial U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), whose operations got off to a chaotic start this week in the war-torn Palestinian territory, says it is winding down its Swiss operation after three months. The move comes as Swiss authorities said GHF was breaching rules for foundations registered in that country. GHF told CBS News that moving forward, its only operations would be based out of the United States.",
      "The legal complication for GHF in Switzerland emerged as the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said one Palestinian was killed and 47 others were wounded when Israeli forces fired shots as\u00a0people were seeking food at one of its aid distribution hubs\u00a0in southern Gaza on Tuesday. The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement Tuesday that troops had only fired \"warning shots\" to restore order at the site. GHF later said in a statement that \"no shots were fired at Palestinian crowds\" and \"there were no casualties.\" Some injured Palestinians could be seen in video footage of the incident verified by CBS News Confirmed, which showed hundreds of people around the distribution center.",
      "Little has been made public about GHF, including who funds it. CBS News has been told by one source that GHF has employed at least 300 American contractors, all heavily armed, who have been given \"as much ammunition as they can carry.\"",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said, according to a document obtained by CBS News that appears to have been written by the group, that it was registering in both Delaware and Geneva, Switzerland. The Swiss \"affiliate\" was established in order to \"address donors who would prefer to participate outside of the U.S. structure,\" the document says.",
      "\"The Swiss GHF Board and Executive team will closely mirror that of the U.S. GHF and will adhere to the same principles, mission and values,\" says the document.",
      "A separate document seeking to register the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation in Switzerland, dated Jan. 31, 2025, was published as part of the country's commercial register. The foundation is shown as being registered from Feb. 12.",
      "According to the Swiss registration document, \"the foundation pursues exclusively charitable and philanthropic objectives for the benefit of people in need of support for material, psychological or health reasons, and more specifically to provide humanitarian aid to those affected by the conflict in the Gaza Strip, including the secure provision of food, water, medicine, shelter and reconstruction.\"",
      "It lists three individuals as leaders of the Swiss foundation: David Papazian, who the document says is from Armenia but based in the U.K.; Lolk Samuel Marcel Henderson, an American in Arlington, Virginia; and David Kohler, from Switzerland.",
      "Subsequent documents, dated May 19 and May 23 respectively, announced the removal of Swiss national Kohler from the board of the foundation, and then the end of Swiss accounting firm OGH Expertises Comptables et Fiscales SA's role as an auditor of the foundation.",
      "Switzerland's Federal Supervisory Authority for Foundations, known as the ESA, told CBS News on Wednesday that, according to its assessment, the Swiss branch of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is \"currently not fulfilling various legal obligations,\" in the country.",
      "The ESA said the aid group's Swiss branch does not have the required signatory member of its board resident in Switzerland, that it doesn't have the minimum three board members required by Swiss statutes, and that it did not appear to have a Swiss bank account, a valid Swiss address, or an auditor \u2014 all of which are requirements for foundations like GHF which are registered in the country.",
      "\"Based on this information, the ESA assumes that the Swiss foundation has not yet commenced its activities and is therefore inactive,\" the authority told CBS News. \"The ESA has informed the foundation of its legal requirements and requested that it clarify the situation. The necessary clarifications are currently under way.\"",
      "A Swiss non-governmental watchdog organization, TRIAL International, said it had filed two legal submissions to the Swiss government on May 20 and 21, with the Federal Supervisory Authority for Foundations and the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, seeking to assess GHF's compliance with the Swiss legal system, as well as with Switzerland's Federal Act on Private Security Services Provided Abroad.",
      "The legal submissions were \"intended to urgently remedy potential breaches by the GHF of various rules of national and international law, in particular concerning 'private security services' within the framework of the foundation's activities, such as the militarized security of distribution points and the control of individuals,\" the NGO said in a statement.",
      "Switzerland \"has a moral but also a particular legal obligation to make sure that entities operating from its territory, themselves, respect the Geneva Conventions. That's enshrined in the first article of the Geneva Conventions,\" TRIAL International director Philip Grant told CBS News.",
      "\"So we just wanted to understand what they did\" through the Swiss entity, he said.",
      "Grant said it was unclear how much GHF activity had actually taken place in Geneva, which was part of the motivation for his group's submissions. It was also looking to find out whether GHF had requested and received necessary approvals to engage private military services, the use of which is tightly regulated under Swiss law for organizations registered in the country.",
      "In response to CBS News' request for clarity, GHF said Wednesday that \"the only GHF entity that is in use today is the foundation established in the United States by Loik Henderson in February 2025. That is the only entity through which GHF is operating and will operate moving forward. Swiss entity was created as a contingency; is not operational; and is being wound down.\"",
      "James Smith, a doctor who has worked inside Gaza, told CBS News that both the presence of armed contractors at aid distribution centers and the locations of GHF's hubs in the south of Gaza raise red flags for humanitarian workers. He said the location of the hubs could potentially serve as a way to forcibly displace the population of Gaza to the south of the Strip.",
      "\"They are undignified. They are inhumane. We've seen people being corralled into cages in the baking heat,\" Smith said.",
      "Smith pointed out concerns raised by the United Nations, which has declined to work with the organization, about the methods of GHF and even \"some of the people that, until the last couple of days, worked for GHF and have since resigned, saying that they cannot adhere to the humanitarian principles if they continue to work for this entity.\"",
      "\"The risks posed by armed military actors, particularly those who are parties to a conflict, also providing humanitarian assistance should be and has been roundly condemned and is not something that any reputable humanitarian organization, academic of humanitarianism or humanitarian practitioner should ever support,\" Smith said.",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that the de facto leader of Hamas, Mohammed Sinwar, has been killed. Netanyahu mentioned the killing in a speech to Israel's parliament as the U.S. seeks another temporary ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "During his speech, Netanyahu listed the names of top Hamas leaders killed during the war and included Sinwar. \"We have killed tens of thousands of terrorists. We killed (Mohammed) Deif, (Ismail) Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Sinwar,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu did not elaborate, and Israel's military did not immediately issue any new statement on Sinwar's apparent death.",
      "Sinwar was the latest leader of Hamas \u2014 which the U.S. and Israel have designated as a terrorist group \u2014 to be killed by Israeli forces. His older brother Yahya Sinwar, a top target for the Israeli military who previously led the group, was killed in October. Deif, who led Hamas' military wing, was killed by Israeli forces in July. Haniyeh, a former Hamas political leader, was assassinated in Iran last year, an incident Iran blamed on Israeli forces but Israel did not take responsibility for.",
      "Since Yahya Sinwar's death, Mohammed Sinwar had been widely described in Israeli and Arab media as one of Hamas' top leaders in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Top Hamas leaders based in Qatar didn't pick Mohammed Sinwar as the group's sole leader after his brother's death, but militants in the Gaza Strip have largely followed him, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year, citing Arab negotiators. The younger Sinwar \u2014 a longtime Hamas member \u2014 has helped lead the group as it recruits new fighters, replacing some of the thousands of Hamas terrorists Israel says it has killed, according to the newspaper.",
      "\"Mohammed Sinwar is managing everything,\" retired Israeli Brig. Gen. Amir Avivi told the Journal.",
      "Mohammed Sinwar's reported death comes after nearly 20 months of war between Israel and Hamas, which began after Hamas-led militants launched an attack on southern Israel in October 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 as hostages back into Gaza.",
      "At the White House, President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff told reporters Wednesday he had \"very good feelings\" about getting to a temporary ceasefire and a long-term resolution to the conflict.",
      "A two-month ceasefire between the two sides ended in March after Israel resumed intense strikes on the Gaza Strip and enforced a blockade on all aid supplies entering the Palestinian territory, leading to widespread reports of shortages and hunger. Israel blames all the suffering in Gaza on Hamas, calling the blockade a tactic to pressure the terrorist group into releasing the 58 remaining hostages, although it is unclear how many are alive.",
      "In recent weeks, Israeli officials have vowed to push ahead with the war to capture and control the entire Gaza Strip and to dismantle Hamas, though Israel has allowed limited aid to enter Gaza this week.",
      "Over 54,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the Israeli offensive began more than a year and a half ago, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilian and combatant casualties.",
      "Earlier this month, Hamas released Eden Alexander, believed to have been the last living American citizen held hostage in Gaza.",
      "The families of the remaining hostages have led large protests demanding that Netanyahu make a deal to bring their loved ones home and end the war. In a statement shared by his office following the release of Alexander, Netanyahu insisted that while there could be a temporary ceasefire to allow for more hostages to be freed, there is \"no way we will stop the war \u2026 we're going to the end.\"",

      "Zelenskyy's Berlin visit comes days after Russia launched some of its heaviest missile and drone attacks of the conflict on Ukraine, and as President Trump voices growing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "The Ukrainian president accused Russia of stalling peace talks and said Moscow did not want to halt its three-year invasion, adding that \"they will constantly look for reasons not to end the war.\"",
      "Ongoing Russian strikes are war crimes, U.N. experts conclude",

      "Russia's military has committed \"crimes against humanity\" and \"war crimes\" in its drone attacks on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine's Kherson region in particular, a panel of United Nations experts concludes in a report published Wednesday. The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, established by the U.N. Human Rights Council, said Russian armed forces were \"systematically\" hitting civilians.",
      "\"Russian armed forces have committed the crimes against humanity of murder and the war crimes of attacking civilians, through a months-long pattern of drone attacks targeting civilians on the right bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson Province,\" the inquiry said in its atypically blunt assessment. \"These acts were committed with the primary purpose to spread terror among the civilian population, in violation of international humanitarian law.\"",

      "\"This means that Ukraine can now defend itself, for example, by attacking military positions in Russia... With very few exceptions, it didn't do that until recently. It can now do that.\"",
      "Indeed, Ukraine has stepped up attacks on what it claims are military and military-industrial sites deep inside Russia, including a wave of almost 300 drones that Russia's military claimed to have intercepted overnight. Ukrainian military bloggers said the drones had targeted drone, missile and explosive manufacturing facilities, including one north of Moscow, and other sites near the capital itself.",

      "He said the American leader failed to \"fully understand that the Russian Federation is striking exclusively at military infrastructure facilities or the military-industrial complex of Ukraine.\"",

    "story": [
      "The State Department has ordered U.S. embassies to temporarily stop scheduling new student visa appointments, as the Trump administration works to expand social media screenings for applicants, the latest in a series of restrictions on international students.",
      "In a cable dated Tuesday and obtained by CBS News, Secretary of State Marco Rubio instructed diplomatic posts not to add any more appointments for student and foreign exchange visas in preparation for the expanded vetting, and to take any unfilled appointments off their calendars. If students have already scheduled their visa interviews, those can still go forward.",
      "The pause will last \"until further guidance is issued\" in the next few days.",
      "The State Department is preparing for an \"expansion of required social media screening and vetting,\" and all student visa applicants could be subject to social media checks, according to the cable. This extra screening would have \"significant implications\" for embassies and consulates' operations, making a pause on new appointments necessary, the cable said.",
      "A senior State Department official confirmed the cable's accuracy to CBS News.",
      "The memo was first reported by Politico.",
      "When asked about student visas, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters Tuesday, \"We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country, and we're going to continue to do that.\"",
      "A State Department official said Wednesday that while the department does not comment on internal communications, the scheduling of nonimmigrant visa interview appointments is \"dynamic.\" The official said that an embassy or consulate's capacity reflects the time required for consular officers to adjudicate the cases before them in full compliance with U.S. law, including to ensure applicants do not pose a security or safety risk to the United States.",
      "\"Every visa adjudication is a national security decision,\" the State Department official said, adding that every prospective traveler to the United States undergoes interagency security vetting. \"Prohibiting entry to the United States by those who might pose a threat to U.S. national security or public safety is key to protecting U.S. citizens at home.\"",
      "International students who want to study in the U.S. are typically required to schedule interviews at an American embassy or consulate, usually in their home country, as part of the visa application process. Wait times vary widely: At most embassies, appointments for student visa interviews can be scheduled less than two months in advance, though some diplomatic posts have longer waits.",
      "Last month, the Department of Homeland Security said it would screen some visa applicants, including people seeking student visas, for what it called \"antisemitic activity on social media and the physical harassment of Jewish individuals.\"",
      "The screenings are part of a wider slate of controls aimed at international students \u2014 some of which have run into pushback from the court system.",
      "Last week, DHS told Harvard University it can no longer enroll international students, escalating a monthslong battle between the administration and the Ivy League school. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said the administration is \"holding Harvard accountable for fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus,\" but Harvard said the move was illegal. A judge quickly blocked the policy.",
      "The government has sought to deport a handful of students based on their pro-Palestinian activism \u2014 some of whom have green cards, including Columbia University's Mohsen Mahdawi and Mahmoud Khalil \u2014 citing a law that allows visas to be revoked if somebody poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\" Lawyers argue these visa revocations violate students' First Amendment rights, though the government says it has the right to do so. Some students, including Mahdawi, have been released on bail.",

    "summary": "A U.S. and Israeli-backed humanitarian aid effort for Gaza says it's started distributing desperately needed food. The U.N. calls it a \"distraction from what is actually needed.\"",
    "story": [
      "A controversial new U.S. and Israel-backed aid group says it began operating in the war-torn Gaza Strip on Monday, despite objections from the United Nations, other humanitarian groups, and the recent, sudden resignation of its American executive director, who said it couldn't operate independently. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) said it opened its first aid distribution hubs in the enclave on Monday and that truckloads of food had been delivered.",
      "The GHF said in a statement that about 8,000 food boxes had been distributed by Tuesday afternoon, each one containing enough to feed \"5.5 people for 3.5 days, totaling 462,000 meals.\"",
      "\"More trucks with aid will be delivered tomorrow, with the flow of aid increasing each day,\" GHF said in a statement.",
      "There were unconfirmed reports by Israeli and Palestinian media outlets that one of the aid hubs was abandoned by the security personnel in charge of securing the operation after thousands of people clambering for food overran the location. The Israel Hayom newspaper said the security forces withdrew to helicopters amid gunfire.",
      "In a statement, the GHF said there was a \"moment in the late afternoon\" at one of its Secure Distribution Sites when the number of people seeking aid \"was such that the GHF team fell back to allow a small number of Gazans to take aid safely and dissipate. This was done in accordance with GHF protocol to avoid casualties. Normal operations have resumed.\"",
      "The group said some Palestinians endured \"several hour delays in accessing the site due to blockades imposed by Hamas.\"",
      "In a separate statement, the Israeli military said troops had \"fired warning shots in the area outside the compound. Control over the situation was established, food distribution operations are expected to continue as planned, and the safety of IDF troops was not compromised.\"",
      "The GHF \u2014 the leadership and funding of which have remained unclear \u2014 was created as Israel and its closest ally, the U.S., faced a growing outcry over Palestinians in Gaza starving amid Israel's nearly three-month blockade of the territory. Under intense pressure from the international community, Israel began letting some food into Gaza last week, but aid organizations have called it a \"drop in the bucket\" given the level of need.",
      "\"As part of the gradual opening of the distribution centers, two of the centers, located in Tel al-Sultan and the Morag Corridor in the Rafah area, began operating today (Tuesday) and are distributing food packages to thousands of families in the Gaza Strip,\" the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement. \"The establishment of the distribution centers took place over the last few months, facilitated by the Israeli political echelon and in coordination with the US government. This process coincided with an ongoing dialogue and cooperation with the IDF.\"",
      "The IDF said the new aid system was \"operated by International Aid Organizations, and Secured by an American Civilian Security Company,\" but neither the military nor the GHF itself has named any global non-profit organizations involved in the effort, and it was unclear what security firm from the U.S. was helping secure the hubs.",
      "U.N. calls new aid operation a \"distraction\"",
      "On Tuesday, a spokesperson for the United Nations humanitarian office called the work of GHF a \"distraction from what is actually needed,\" which the spokesperson said was the reopening of crossings into Gaza and the end of Israeli restrictions on the kind of aid entering the territory.",
      "The GHF has been tasked by Israel with taking over the handling of aid in Gaza despite objections from the U.N., which, along with other aid groups, has pushed back against the new system. They assert that Israel is trying to use food as a weapon and say a new system won't be effective.",
      "Israel has pushed for an alternative aid delivery plan because it says it must stop Hamas from seizing aid. The U.N. has denied that Hamas has diverted large amounts of aid. Hamas, long designated a terrorist organization by Israel, the U.S. and the European Union, also denies the allegations.",
      "The GHF began operations just a day after its executive director, American Jake Wood, announced his resignation and said it had become clear the foundation would not be allowed to operate independently. GHF said it had appointed an interim leader, John Acree, to replace Wood.",
      "The organization, said to be made up of former humanitarian, government and military officials, has said its distribution points will provide aid for a million Palestinians \u2014 around half of Gaza's population \u2014 by the end of the week.",
      "Under pressure from allies, Israel began allowing a trickle of humanitarian aid into Gaza last week after blocking all food, medicine, fuel or other goods from entering since early March. Aid groups had issued multiple warnings of a looming famine in Gaza.",
      "Hamas tells Palestinians not to use new aid system",
      "Hamas warned Palestinians on Monday not to cooperate with the new aid system, saying it is part of Israel's plans to transfer much of Gaza's population to other countries or to force people out of the north into the southern part of Gaza.",
      "Israel says it plans to facilitate what it describes as the voluntary migration of much of Gaza's population of 2 million, a plan rejected by Palestinians and much of the international community.",
      "Israel's military campaign has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and internally displaced some 90% of its population, many people multiple times.",
      "Deadly Israeli strikes in Gaza continue",
      "The desperately needed supplies started flowing into Gaza, according to the GHF, on Monday as Israeli strikes kill at least 52 people in the Palestinian territory.",
      "The airstrikes killed at least 36 people in a school-turned-shelter that was hit as people slept, setting their belongings ablaze, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health. The Israeli military   said it targeted militants operating from the school, but CBS News met a young girl who said her mother and all of her sisters were killed in the strike as they slept in the building in the dead of the night.",
      "Israel renewed its offensive in March after ending a ceasefire with Hamas. It has vowed to seize control of Gaza and keep fighting until Hamas is destroyed or disarmed, and until it returns the remaining 58 hostages, a third of them believed to be alive, from the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack that ignited the war.",
      "Hamas and allied militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people in the 2023 attack. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed around 54,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health. It says more than half the dead are women and children, but it does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count.",

    "story": [
      "Wellington, New Zealand\u00a0\u2014 A 19-year-old New Zealand man has died after taking part in a new tackling game that's trending on social media  in which competitors run at each other and collide while wearing no protective equipment. Police confirmed Ryan Satterthwaite suffered a head injury on Sunday while playing a backyard game with friends in the North Island city of Palmerston North. He died on Monday as a result of his injuries.",
      "Area police commander Inspector Ross Grantham described Satterthwaite's death as \"a huge tragedy\" and urged others to \"consider the significant safety and injury risks\" of the game that is known as RUNIT or RUNIT Straight.",
      "\"A young man lost his life as a result of participating in what I understand to be a social media frenzy,\" Grantham said. \"While this is not a criminal matter, police will continue to undertake inquiries on behalf of the coroner.\"",
      "Grantham said \"the tackle game played by the group of friends was based on a social media-driven trend where participants compete in full-contact collisions without protective gear.",
      "\"While this was an impromptu game among friends, not a planned event, this tragic outcome does highlight the inherent safety concerns with such an activity.\"",
      "RUNIT is based loosely on the contact elements of rugby union, rugby league or the NFL and involves two competitors, a runner and a tackler, running at each other and colliding on a 65 foot by 13 foot area known as a battlefield.",
      "The game has grown in social media popularity through the Australian RUNIT Championship League, which offers cash prizes to competitors. Organizers promote the event as \"the world's fiercest new collision sport.\"",
      "Two trial events in Auckland in recent weeks saw eight men compete for 20,000 New Zealand dollars ($12,000) in front of more than 1,000 spectators. Winners were expected to go into a championship event next month with prize money of up to 250,000 New Zealand dollars ($150,000).",
      "Two other events in Auckland were canceled when organizers were unable to obtain permits.",
      "The RUNIT Championship League released a statement to the New Zealand news website Stuff on Tuesday, saying it \"does not encourage any copying of the sport as it should only be done under the strict conditions.\"",
      "\"This is tragic news and our hearts go out to the family and friends of Ryan. Any contact sport like boxing, martial arts or combat-style activities should only be held in highly controlled environments which include professional medical supervision and support.\"",
      "RUNIT has been strongly condemned by experts in head injuries who say competitors run a high risk of a serious brain injury.",
      "It is by no means the first social media-fueled trend to draw safety warnings after a tragedy. Medical experts have been forced to warn people, and young people in particular, about the risks of everything from inhaling solvents to abusing over-the-counter medications and even snorting condoms.",

      "The lawsuit alleges that the accusations made by women against Robinson were \"fabricated in support of their extortionate scheme.\" The documents further stated that \"Mr. and Ms. Robinson did not view, or treat, people in their employ as just employees. They treated them as extended family.\"",

      "According to the cross-complaint, the Robinsons had vacationed with the accusers, exchanged gifts and celebrated holidays and birthdays together. The lawsuit stated that \"Plaintiffs asked for and accepted help from the Robinsons, including several thousands of dollars, monetary support for members of at least one Plaintiff\u2019s family, clothes, dental surgery, and even a car.\"",
      "The documents claimed that the accusers had asked for and received concert tickets to the Motown legend's concerts for themselves and their families. The lawsuit included displays of text messages that were allegedly sent by the accusers to the Robinsons. The texts featured birthday wishes, expressions of love and an invitation to a son's graduation.",
      "\"The Robinsons did not abuse, harm, or take advantage of Plaintiffs; they treated Plaintiffs with the utmost kindness and generosity,\" the lawsuit stated. \"Unfortunately, the depths of Plaintiffs\u2019 avarice and greed knows no bounds.\"",
      "Smokey Robinson's second wife, Frances Robinson, was also accused in the original lawsuit. (Frazer Harrison)",
      "The lawsuit alleges that the accusers, with the assistance of their law firm Harris & Hayden, had initially sought $100 million from the Robinsons prior to filing their lawsuit. After the accusers' demands were not met, they filed the lawsuit and \"created a media circus and made a public spectacle of themselves,\" the lawsuit stated.",
      "The documents referenced a press conference that was given by the accusers' attorneys on May 6 and attended by three of the four Jane Does.",
      "\"With the assistance of their legal counsel, they paraded themselves in front of the media, wearing sunglasses and face masks for full dramatic effect,\" the lawsuit read. \"Their counsel, John Harris, with no firsthand knowledge and without reference to the Complaint they had filed, went on to claim publicly that Mr. Robinson was a 'serial and sick rapist' and a 'serial assaulter.'\"",
      "\"Plaintiffs are hiding their identities, hoping to convince the general public of a half story,\" the lawsuit alleged.",
      "The Robinsons' team claimed that one accuser \"took Ms. Robinson\u2019s cell phone and deleted all their text exchanges, photos, and identifying information.\"",
      "Earlier in May, the accusers filed a $50 million sexual misconduct lawsuit against Smokey Robinson and his wife. (Michael Buckner)",
      "The lawsuit also suggested that the accusers could have potentially stolen from the musician and his wife during their employment.",
      "\"Doe Plaintiffs had the ideal access to take advantage of the Robinsons,\" the documents read. \"As a result of their roles as household staff, they had particular knowledge of where the Robinsons\u2019 valuables were kept, including a hidden safe and gold Krugerrands. That safe and the valuables it contained and several gold Kruggerands were later stolen by someone who knew precisely where they were located. The Robinsons reported the theft to the police.\"",
      "Additionally, the Robinsons' lawyers state that Frances had discovered that she was missing financial records, including bank statements, and noted \"at least one Plaintiff had access to and knew exactly where these records were kept.\"",
      "The cross-complaint argued that the accusers \"said nothing about the Robinsons that would suggest any abuse or harm.\"",
      "\"At least one Plaintiff left the employment of the Robinsons and returned, undercutting their claims that Plaintiffs were too afraid to report any alleged abuse,\" the documents stated.",
      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "In addition to the cross complaint, the Robinsons' lawyers filed a separate motion on Wednesday to have the accusers' lawsuit dismissed, arguing that it violated the California Code of Civic Procedure because it was filed under fictitious names.",

      "The cross-complaint claimed that the Robinsons treated their employees as \"extended family.' (Denise Truscello/Getty Images for Keep Memory Alive)",
      "\"The cross-complaint filed by Mr. Christopher Frost on behalf of William \u2018Smokey\u2019 Robinson and Frances Robinson, is nothing more than an attempt to silence and intimidate the survivors of Mr. Robinson's sexual \u00a0battery and assault,\" they said. \"It is a baseless and vindictive legal maneuver designed to re-victimize, shift blame and discourage others from coming forward. This type of retaliatory litigation is precisely what California\u2019s anti-SLAPP laws were enacted to prevent.",
      "\"Jane Does 1-4 exercised their fundamental constitutional right to seek redress through the courts by filing a civil action to expose and hold accountable behavior that no one should have to endure,\" they continued. \"In response, Mr. Robinson, filed a cross-complaint that mischaracterizes the facts and seeks to punish his victims for speaking out.\"",
      "\"This cross-complaint will not stand,\" Harris and Hayden added. \"We are filing an anti-SLAPP motion to strike it in its entirety and will seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs for having to defend against this abusive tactic.\"",
      "\"Jane Does 1-4 remain committed to seeking justice\u2014not only for themselves but for all survivors who have been silenced by fear of retaliation. This case is about accountability, transparency, and ensuring that power is not used to harm or suppress others.\"",

She was unwilling to report the incidents due to \"her fear of losing her livelihood, familial reprisal, public embarrassment, shame and humiliation to her and her family, the possible adverse effect on her immigration status, as well as being threatened and intimidated by Defendant Smokey Robinson\u2019s well-recognized celebrity status and his influential friends and associates,\" documents stated.",

      "JD2 also claimed Robinson assaulted her at least 23 times and would \"threaten her that if she refused to have sex with him, he would make Defendant Frances Robinson be \u2018mean\u2019 to her,\" the lawsuit states.",

I learned so much and thank you again. I\u2019m really happy it worked out the way it did to. Have a great rest of the shoot and yes talk soon!\"",

      "\"We're like, well, what? Why is that? Well, because all the retirement paperwork is manual on paper,\" Musk said. \"It's manually calculated and written down on a piece of paper. Then it goes down to mine and like, what do you mean, a mine?\"",

Stick to reputable websites, avoid opening unsolicited email attachments and use a browser with built-in security features (like Microsoft Edge or Chrome with Safe Browsing enabled).",

      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA on all your accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal services: Even with strong device security, your personal information may still be exposed online through data brokers and people-finder sites. These services collect and publish details like your name, address and phone number, making you an easier target for identity theft or phishing. Automated data removal services track down these sites and submit removal requests on your behalf, helping to reduce your digital footprint and increase your online anonymity. While they can't erase every trace of your information, they make it significantly harder for attackers to find and exploit your personal data, which saves you time and reduces unwanted spam in the process.",

      "Defendnot points to a bigger issue with how Windows handles security. It takes a feature meant to prevent software conflicts and turns it into a way to completely disable protection. The system assumes any registered antivirus is legitimate, so if attackers can fake that, they get in without much resistance.",

The top speed is an impressive 28 mph, and you can travel up to 25 miles on a single charge. The Hydroflyer Sport's modular design lets you swap out parts or customize your setup.

      "ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) have become amazing helpers for everyday tasks. Whether it's summarizing complex ideas, designing a birthday card or even planning your apartment's layout, you can get impressive results with just a simple prompt. But as helpful as these AI tools are, their convenience comes with hidden risks, especially when it comes to your personal privacy.",

      "How these tools work and why that matters",
      "If you haven't tried an LLM like ChatGPT before, here's the gist: They're advanced language processors that chat with you through text. No special commands or coding needed, just type what you want to know or do, and they respond. For example, asking \"Why is the conclave kept secret?\" will get you a detailed explanation in seconds.",
      "This simplicity is what makes LLMs so useful, but it also opens the door to risks. Instead of harmless questions, someone could ask for a detailed profile on a person, and the model might generate a surprisingly thorough report. While these tools have safeguards and often refuse certain requests, clever phrasing can sometimes bypass those limits.",

Each people-search site is a little different. Opting out of every people-search site that exposes your personal information is a mammoth task. I\u2019ve discussed it in more detail\u00a0here. Alternatively, you can automate this process.",

With this small initial effort, you may save yourself from privacy-related risks, including scams and even\u00a0identity theft. But what if your data is exposed on a people-search site not covered by any data removal service?",
      "Every removal service out there has limitations on the number of data brokers it supports. It\u2019s not about a lack of effort; it\u2019s mostly because brokers are generally unwilling to cooperate, to put it mildly. But there\u2019s a way to address this issue without going back to manual opt-outs. The top names in the data removal industry now offer custom removals. In simple terms, this means you can ask them to remove your personal information from websites not currently covered by their standard plans.",
      "The catch is that you\u2019ll need to do the research yourself and point out which sites are exposing your data. It\u2019s not as convenient as having everything done automatically, but it\u2019s a relatively minor inconvenience for the sake of your online privacy.",

      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, known for creating ChatGPT, has launched World, a project that uses an eye scan to prove you are a real person online. The idea is to help people stand out from bots and AI by creating a digital ID with a quick scan from a device called the Orb.",

      "How World ID works",
      "World ID relies on a device called the Orb, a spherical scanner that captures a person's iris pattern to generate a unique IrisCode. It stores the code on a blockchain-based platform, ensuring that users can verify their identity without revealing personal details.",
      "Once scanned, individuals receive their World ID, which can be used for authentication across various platforms where the World ID protocol has been integrated, including Reddit, Telegram and Shopify.",
      "Additionally, those who sign up are rewarded with WLD cryptocurrency as an incentive. They get the equivalent of $40 worth of tokens, which they can spend, exchange or share with other World ID holders.",

      "World ID has ambitious goals, but despite this, the project has faced significant backlash. Many people worry that storing eye scan data in a worldwide database could put their personal information at risk. Adding to the controversy, critics point out the irony of Sam Altman, whose company, OpenAI, contributes to the very AI challenges World ID aims to solve, being at the helm of this project.",
      "Governments in Spain, Argentina, Kenya and Hong Kong have either suspended or investigated the project due to concerns over excessive data collection. Furthermore, cybersecurity experts warn that once biometric data is linked to an identity system, it becomes irreversible, raising fears of potential surveillance.",

In this AI-driven world, it can be an essential security measure to ensure the internet is a safer and more trustworthy place. Since the system is integrated with blockchain technology, it can definitely provide secure authentication across multiple platforms.

    "summary": "The 2025 AI Security Report details how criminals are harnessing artificial intelligence to impersonate people, automate scams, and attack security systems on a massive scale.",
    "story": [
      "Cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright breaks down the dangers of deepfake video technology on 'Unfiltered.'",
      "Imagine your phone rings and the voice on the other end sounds just like your boss, a close friend, or even a government official. They urgently ask for sensitive information, except it's not really them. It's a deepfake, powered by AI, and you're the target of a sophisticated scam. These kinds of attacks are happening right now, and they're getting more convincing every day.",
      "That's the warning sounded by the 2025 AI Security Report, unveiled at the RSA Conference (RSAC), one of the world's biggest gatherings for cybersecurity experts, companies, and law enforcement. The report details how criminals are harnessing artificial intelligence to impersonate people, automate scams, and attack security systems on a massive scale.",
      "From hijacked AI accounts and manipulated models to live video scams and data poisoning, the report paints a picture of a rapidly evolving threat landscape, one that's touching more lives than ever before.",

      "Illustration of cybersecurity risks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AI tools are leaking sensitive data",
      "One of the biggest risks of using AI tools is what users accidentally share with them. A recent analysis by cybersecurity firm Check Point found that\u00a01 in every 80 AI prompts includes high-risk data, and about 1 in 13 contains sensitive information that could expose users or organizations to security or compliance risks.",
      "This data can include passwords, internal business plans, client information, or proprietary code. When shared with AI tools that are not secured, this information can be logged, intercepted, or even leaked later.",
      "Deepfake scams are now real-time and multilingual",
      "AI-powered impersonation is getting more advanced every month. Criminals can now fake voices and faces convincingly in real time. In early 2024, a British engineering firm lost 20 million pounds after scammers used live deepfake video to impersonate company executives during a Zoom call. The attackers looked and sounded like trusted leaders and convinced an employee to transfer funds.",
      "Real-time video manipulation tools are now being sold on criminal forums. These tools can swap faces and mimic speech during video calls in multiple languages, making it easier for attackers to run scams across borders.",
      "Illustration of a person video conferencing on their laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AI is running phishing and scam operations at scale",
      "Social engineering has always been a part of cybercrime. Now, AI is automating it. Attackers no longer need to speak a victim\u2019s language, stay online constantly, or manually write convincing messages.",
      "Tools like GoMailPro use ChatGPT to create phishing and spam emails with perfect grammar and native-sounding tone. These messages are far more convincing than the sloppy scams of the past. GoMailPro can generate thousands of unique emails, each slightly different in language and urgency, which helps them slip past spam filters. It is actively marketed on underground forums for around $500 per month, making it widely accessible to bad actors.",
      "Another tool, the X137 Telegram Console, leverages Gemini AI to monitor and respond to chat messages automatically. It can impersonate customer support agents or known contacts, carrying out real-time conversations with multiple targets at once. The replies are uncensored, fast, and customized based on the victim\u2019s responses, giving the illusion of a human behind the screen.",
      "AI is also powering large-scale\u00a0sextortion scams. These are emails that falsely claim to have compromising videos or photos and demand payment to prevent them from being shared. Instead of using the same message repeatedly, scammers now rely on AI to rewrite the threat in dozens of ways. For example, a basic line like \"Time is running out\" might be reworded as \"The hourglass is nearly empty for you,\" making the message feel more personal and urgent while also avoiding detection.",
      "By removing the need for language fluency and manual effort, these AI tools allow attackers to scale their phishing operations dramatically. Even inexperienced scammers can now run large, personalized campaigns with almost no effort.",
      "Stolen AI accounts are sold on the dark web",
      "With AI tools becoming more popular, criminals are now targeting the accounts that use them. Hackers are stealing ChatGPT logins, OpenAI API keys, and other platform credentials to bypass usage limits and hide their identity. These accounts are often stolen through malware, phishing, or credential stuffing attacks. The stolen credentials are then sold in bulk on Telegram channels and underground forums. Some attackers are even using tools that can bypass multi-factor authentication and session-based security protections. These stolen accounts allow criminals to access powerful AI tools and use them for phishing, malware generation, and scam automation.",

      "MALWARE STEALS BANK CARDS AND PASSWORDS FROM MILLIONS OF DEVICES",
      "Jailbreaking AI is now a common tactic",
      "Criminals are finding ways to bypass the safety rules built into AI models. On the dark web, attackers share techniques for jailbreaking AI so it will respond to requests that would normally be blocked. Common methods include:",
      "Telling the AI to pretend it is a fictional character that has no rules or limitationsPhrasing dangerous questions as academic or research-related scenariosAsking for technical instructions using less obvious wording so the request doesn\u2019t get flagged",
      "Telling the AI to pretend it is a fictional character that has no rules or limitations",
      "Phrasing dangerous questions as academic or research-related scenarios",
      "Asking for technical instructions using less obvious wording so the request doesn\u2019t get flagged",
      "Some AI models can even be tricked into jailbreaking themselves. Attackers prompt the model to create input that causes it to override its own restrictions. This shows how AI systems can be manipulated in unexpected and dangerous ways.",
      "AI-generated malware is entering the mainstream",
      "AI is now being used to build malware, phishing kits, ransomware scripts, and more. Recently, a group called\u00a0FunkSac was identified as the leading ransomware gang using AI. Its leader admitted that at least 20% of their attacks are powered by AI. FunkSec has also used AI to help launch attacks that flood websites or services with fake traffic, making them crash or go offline. These are known as denial-of-service attacks. The group even created its own AI-powered chatbot to promote its activities and communicate with victims on its public website..",
      "Some cybercriminals are even using AI to help with marketing and data analysis after an attack. One tool called\u00a0Rhadamanthys Stealer 0.7 claimed to use AI for \"text recognition\" to sound more advanced, but researchers later found it was using older technology instead. This shows how attackers use AI buzzwords to make their tools seem more advanced or trustworthy to buyers.",
      "Other tools are more advanced. One example is DarkGPT, a chatbot built specifically to sort through huge databases of stolen information. After a successful attack, scammers often end up with logs full of usernames, passwords, and other private details. Instead of sifting through this data manually, they use AI to quickly find valuable accounts they can break into, sell, or use for more targeted attacks like ransomware.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "Poisoned AI models are spreading misinformation",
      "Sometimes, attackers do not need to hack an AI system. Instead, they trick it by feeding it false or misleading information. This tactic is called AI poisoning, and it can cause the AI to give biased, harmful, or completely inaccurate answers. There are two main ways this happens:",
      "Training poisoning: Attackers sneak false or harmful data into the model during developmentRetrieval poisoning: Misleading content online gets planted, which the AI later picks up when generating answers",
      "Training poisoning: Attackers sneak false or harmful data into the model during development",
      "Retrieval poisoning: Misleading content online gets planted, which the AI later picks up when generating answers",
      "In 2024, attackers uploaded 100 tampered AI models to the open-source platform Hugging Face. These poisoned models looked like helpful tools, but when people used them, they could spread false information or output malicious code.",
      "A large-scale example came from a Russian propaganda group called Pravda, which published more than 3.6 million fake articles online. These articles were designed to trick AI chatbots into repeating their messages. In tests, researchers found that major AI systems echoed these false claims about 33% of the time.",

      "HOW SCAMMERS USE AI TOOLS TO FILE PERFECT-LOOKING TAX RETURNS IN YOUR NAME",
      "How to protect yourself from AI-driven cyber threats",
      "AI-powered cybercrime blends realism, speed, and scale. These scams are not just harder to detect. They are also easier to launch. Here\u2019s how to stay protected:",
      "1) Avoid entering sensitive data into public AI tools:\u00a0Never share passwords, personal details, or confidential business information in any AI chat, even if it seems private. These inputs can sometimes be logged or misused.",
      "2) Use strong antivirus software: AI-generated phishing emails and malware can slip past outdated security tools. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "3) Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of protection to your accounts, including AI platforms. It makes it much harder for attackers to break in using stolen passwords.",
      "4) Be extra cautious with unexpected video calls or voice messages: If something feels off, even if the person seems familiar, verify before taking action. Deepfake audio and video can sound and look very real.",
      "5) Use a personal data removal service: With AI-powered scams and deepfake attacks on the rise, criminals are increasingly relying on publicly available personal information to craft convincing impersonations or target victims with personalized phishing. By using a reputable personal data removal service, you can reduce your digital footprint on data broker sites and public databases. This makes it much harder for scammers to gather the details they need to convincingly mimic your identity or launch targeted AI-driven attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap - and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Consider identity theft protection: If your data is leaked through a scam, early detection is key. Identity protection services can monitor your information and alert you to suspicious activity. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "7) Regularly monitor your financial accounts: AI-generated phishing, malware, and account takeover attacks are now more sophisticated and widespread than ever, as highlighted in the 2025 AI Security Report. By frequently reviewing your bank and credit card statements for suspicious activity, you can catch unauthorized transactions early, often before major damage is done. Quick detection is crucial, especially since stolen credentials and financial information are now being traded and exploited at scale by cybercriminals using AI.",
      "8) Use a secure password manager: Stolen AI accounts and credential stuffing attacks are a growing threat, with hackers using automated tools to break into accounts and sell access on the dark web. A secure\u00a0password manager helps you create and store strong, unique passwords for every account, making it far more difficult for attackers to compromise your logins, even if some of your information is leaked or targeted by AI-driven attacks. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "9) Keep your software updated: AI-generated malware and advanced phishing kits are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software. To stay ahead of these evolving threats, ensure all your devices, browsers, and applications are updated with the latest security patches.\u00a0Regular updates close security gaps that AI-powered malware and cybercriminals are actively seeking to exploit.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Cybercriminals are now using AI to power some of the most convincing and scalable attacks we\u2019ve ever seen. From deepfake video calls and AI-generated phishing emails to stolen AI accounts and malware written by chatbots, these scams are becoming harder to detect and easier to launch. Attackers are even poisoning AI models with false information and creating fake tools that look legitimate but are designed to do harm. To stay safe, it\u2019s more important than ever to use strong antivirus protection, enable multi-factor authentication, and avoid sharing sensitive data with AI tools you do not fully trust.",

      "Have you ever wished your daily commute could be as easy and comfortable as driving a car, but as fun and eco-friendly as riding a bike? You are not alone. That is exactly the kind of thinking that inspired the Acticycle. This four-wheeled electric vehicle is shaking up city transportation by blending the best parts of both worlds. With the Acticycle, you get the comfort, weather protection, and storage you would expect from a car, but with the agility, efficiency, and low cost of a bike.",

      "Acticycle specs: What you need to know",
      "Let's start with the numbers, since they really set the\u00a0Acticycle apart. The vehicle measures about 93 inches long, 36 inches wide, and 60 inches tall, making it compact enough for bike lanes and city streets, but roomy enough for two adults or one adult and two small children. It weighs just 220 pounds, about one-fifth the weight of a typical electric car, and can carry up to 660 pounds of passengers and cargo.",
      "The Acticycle rides on four 20-inch reinforced wheels with puncture-resistant tires, and it uses hydraulic disc brakes for reliable stopping power. Depending on the model, you can choose from a 250-watt, 750-watt, or dual 2000-watt motor setup. Top speeds range from 16 miles per hour with the 250-watt motor to 28 miles per hour with the more powerful versions. The removable lithium-ion batteries provide a range of up to 62 miles per charge, and you can double that by adding a second battery. The Acticycle also features a total of 6 cubic feet of cargo space, divided between a secure hard trunk and a flexible soft compartment, so you can haul groceries, gear, or whatever your day demands.",

      "The Acticycle is not just about impressive specs, though. It is about reimagining how we move through our cities. Unlike most bikes, the Acticycle is built for companionship and comfort. The two ergonomic seats are designed to make even long rides enjoyable, so you and a friend can chat and relax on your way to work or out on the town. The seating is plush and supportive, which means you can say goodbye to the aches and pains that come with traditional cycling.",

The Acticycle takes care of that with a full canopy, roof, and windshield that keep you dry and protected from rain and splashes. Mudguards help keep the mess off your clothes, so you can show up at your destination looking as fresh as when you left home. This weather protection means you do not have to worry about rain gear or last-minute wardrobe changes, making the Acticycle a true year-round solution.",

Its tight steering angle and low center of gravity let you weave through traffic, navigate narrow bike lanes, and handle sharp corners with ease. Even when you are carrying a full load of passengers or cargo, the Acticycle maintains stable and responsive handling, so you always feel in control.",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "Power and range",
      "Range anxiety is a thing of the past with the Acticycle. The removable batteries can be charged at home with a standard outlet, and swapping them out is quick and simple. With up to 62 miles of range per battery, most daily commutes are easily covered, and you can add a second battery for longer trips. The powerful motor delivers up to 133 pound-feet of torque, which means you can climb hills and accelerate into traffic without breaking a sweat. This kind of performance is usually reserved for much heavier and more expensive electric vehicles, but the Acticycle brings it to a whole new category.",

      "City living often means making tough choices about what you can carry with you. The Acticycle makes that a non-issue. With about 6 cubic feet of storage, split between a lockable hard trunk and a roomy soft compartment, you can carry everything from groceries and work supplies to picnic gear and gym bags. The storage is designed to keep your cargo secure and balanced, so you never have to worry about tipping or losing control.",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "Eco-friendly and budget-smart",
      "The Acticycle is not just good for your commute, it is good for the planet and your wallet. Its lightweight frame and efficient battery system mean it uses far less energy than a car, and its maintenance needs are similar to a cargo bike rather than a car. You will save money on fuel, parking, insurance, and repairs, all while reducing your environmental impact. It is a win-win for anyone looking to make smarter choices in the city.",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "What does the Acticycle cost?",
      "When it comes to price, the Acticycle is designed to be a smart investment for urban commuters who want all the benefits of a car and a bike, but without the hefty price tag. While official U.S. pricing has not been widely announced yet, early European versions start at around $8,000 to $10,000, depending on the motor and battery configuration you choose. This puts it in a unique spot, since it is much less expensive than most electric cars, but does cost more than a high-end electric bike or cargo bike.",

      "Many recent infections stem from devices with remote administration exposed to the internet. Attackers scan for such routers, exploiting known firmware flaws without needing passwords. A single crafted web request can trick an older device into running malicious code. Once inside, malware often alters settings, opening ports or disabling security features, to maintain control and connect to external command-and-control servers.",
      "One prominent threat is\u00a0TheMoon, a malware strain first seen in 2014 that exploited flaws in Linksys routers. It has since evolved into a stealthy botnet builder, transforming infected routers into proxy nodes. Instead of launching direct attacks, TheMoon reroutes third-party traffic, masking hackers' identities behind everyday home networks. Cybercrime platforms like Faceless sell access to these infected routers as \"residential proxies,\" making them valuable assets in the digital underground.",
      "For users, a compromised router means slower connections, exposure to phishing and spyware, and potential legal trouble if criminals abuse their IP address. For businesses, the risk is even higher: Outdated routers can be exploited for deeper network intrusions, data theft and ransomware attacks. In critical sectors, the consequences can be severe, affecting safety and compliance.",

      "6 ways to stay safe from router hackers",
      "Given the serious threats posed by outdated and compromised routers, taking proactive measures is essential. Here are six practical steps you can follow to protect your network and keep hackers at bay.",
      "1) Replace your old router if it's no longer supported:\u00a0If your router is more than five to seven years old, or if you can't find any recent updates for it on the manufacturer's website, it might be time to upgrade. Older routers often stop getting security fixes, which makes them an easy target for hackers. To check, look at the label on your router for the model number, then search online for \"[model number] firmware update.\" If the last update was years ago, consider replacing it with a newer model from a trusted brand.",
      "If you're not sure which router to get, check out my list of\u00a0top routers for the best security. It includes models with strong security features and compatibility with\u00a0VPN services.",
      "2) Keep your router's firmware updated:\u00a0Your router runs software called firmware, which needs to be updated just like your phone or computer. To do this, open a web browser and type your router's IP address (often 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1), then log in using the username and password (usually found on a sticker on the router). Once inside, look for a section called \"Firmware Update,\" \"System\" or \"Administration,\" and check if an update is available. Apply it if there is one. Some newer routers also have apps that make this even easier.",
      "3) Turn off remote access:\u00a0Remote access lets you control your router from outside your home network, but it also opens the door for hackers. You can turn this off by logging into your router's settings (using the same steps as above), then finding a setting called \"Remote Management,\" \"Remote Access\" or \"WAN Access.\" Make sure this feature is\u00a0disabled, then save the changes and restart your router.",
      "4) Use a strong password for your router settings:\u00a0Don't leave your router using the default login, like \"admin\" and \"password.\" That's the first thing hackers try. Change it to a long, strong password with a mix of letters, numbers and symbols. A good example would be something like\u00a0T#8r2k!sG91xm4vL. Try to avoid using the same password you use elsewhere. You can usually change the login password in the \"Administration\" or \"Security\" section of the router settings. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Look out for strange behavior and act quickly:\u00a0If your internet feels unusually slow, your devices randomly disconnect or your streaming buffers more than usual, it could mean something is wrong. Go into your router settings and check the list of connected devices. If you see something you don't recognize, it could be a sign of a breach. In that case, update the firmware, change your passwords and restart the router. If you're not comfortable doing this yourself, call your internet provider for help.",
      "6) Reporting to authorities:\u00a0The FBI asks that victims or those who suspect a compromise report incidents to the\u00a0Internet Crime Complaint Center, which can help authorities track and mitigate broader threats.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This isn't just about asking everyone to upgrade their old gear. It's about the bigger issue of who's actually responsible when outdated devices turn into security risks. Most people don't think twice about the router sitting in a corner, quietly doing its job years past its prime. But attackers do. They see forgotten hardware as easy targets.

      "A smartphone on a table\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5 ways bad actors can bypass fingerprint scanners",
      "There are multiple ways hackers use to bypass fingerprint scanners. Below, I will discuss five of the more prominent methods.",
      "Hackers exploit the concept of \"masterprints,\" which are fingerprints engineered to match multiple individuals' prints. Researchers at\u00a0NYU Tandon developed \"DeepMasterPrints\" using machine learning to generate synthetic fingerprints that can deceive sensors by mimicking common fingerprint features. These artificial prints can match with a significant percentage of stored fingerprints, especially on devices with less stringent security settings.",
      "Another trick hackers use is making fake fingerprints. They can lift prints off things you\u2019ve touched and then use stuff like fabric glue or even 3D printers to make molds. For example,\u00a0researchers at Cisco Talos tried out a bunch of different ways to do this using 3D printing and tested them on phones like the iPhone 8 and Samsung S10; laptops like the Samsung Note 9, Lenovo Yoga and HP Pavilion X360; and even smart gadgets like padlocks.",
      "On average, the fake fingerprints worked about 80% of the time. They were able to fool the sensors at least once. Interestingly, they couldn\u2019t crack the biometric systems on Windows 10 devices, but they pointed out that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean those are more secure. It just means this particular method didn\u2019t work on them.",
      "19 BILLION PASSWORDS HAVE LEAKED ONLINE: HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF",
      "Attackers have found a cheap way to break into smartphones by brute force fingerprint authentication. The method, called BrutePrint, lets attackers get around the usual limits that stop too many failed fingerprint attempts. It works by taking advantage of two previously unknown flaws in the fingerprint system. These flaws, named Cancel-After-Match-Fail (CAMF) and Match-After-Lock (MAL), exist because of weak protection for fingerprint data on a part of the hardware called the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI).",
      "Basically, BrutePrint uses a hardware-based man-in-the-middle attack to hijack fingerprint data. It sits between the fingerprint sensor and the phone\u2019s secure area (called the Trusted Execution Environment) and tries as many fingerprint images as needed until it finds a match. The relieving part is that the attacker needs to have physical access to the phone for this method to work.",
      "PrintListener is a side-channel attack that captures the sound of a finger swiping on a screen to extract fingerprint features. It might sound like something out of a sci-fi movie, but researchers have already built a proof of concept. By analyzing the friction sounds, attackers can reconstruct fingerprint patterns, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of masterprint attacks.",
      "Some devices store fingerprint data without adequate encryption. If attackers gain access to this unprotected data, they can replicate fingerprints to bypass authentication. For example, in 2024, a misconfigured server exposed nearly 500 GB of sensitive biometric data, including fingerprints, facial scans and personal details of law enforcement applicants.",

      "So, can you trust fingerprint scanners?",
      "Fingerprint scanners make it easy and fairly secure to unlock your devices. Since everyone has unique fingerprints, you don\u2019t need to remember complicated passwords. Just a quick touch and you are in. Most modern devices store your fingerprint data in secure parts of the system, and they use things like liveness detection to make sure someone is not trying to trick the scanner with a fake finger.",
      "Still, no security method is perfect. Skilled attackers have found ways to get past fingerprint scanners using high-resolution photos or 3D-printed fingers or by taking advantage of flaws in how the scanner communicates with the rest of the device. The risk really depends on how well the scanner is designed and how much effort someone puts into breaking it. For most people, fingerprint authentication is quick, easy and secure enough. However, if you are dealing with very sensitive information, relying only on biometrics might not be the best idea.",

      "1. Choose trusted phone brands:\u00a0If you're buying a phone, stick with well-known brands like Apple, Samsung or Google. These companies take extra steps to protect your fingerprint data by storing it in secure areas of the phone that are harder to access. Cheaper or lesser-known brands may not have these protections, which makes it easier for attackers to steal your data.",
      "2. Keep your phone updated:\u00a0Phone updates are not just about new features. They fix security problems that hackers might use to break into your device. If your phone asks you to install an update, do it. Most phones also let you turn on automatic updates, so you don\u2019t have to worry about remembering. Keeping your software updated is one of the easiest and most important ways to stay protected.",

      "4. Don\u2019t rely only on your fingerprint:\u00a0Using a fingerprint to unlock your phone is convenient, but it shouldn\u2019t be your only line of defense, especially for sensitive apps like banking or email. Always set up a PIN, password or pattern as a backup on your\u00a0iPhone and\u00a0Android. This way, even if someone manages to copy your fingerprint, they still need another piece of information to get in.",
      "5. Be careful about who handles your phone:\u00a0If someone else uses your phone, especially a stranger or someone you don\u2019t know well, they might be able to copy your fingerprint from the screen. It\u2019s rare, but it happens. To reduce this risk, avoid handing your phone to people unnecessarily and wipe your screen occasionally to remove any clear fingerprints.",
      "6. Only use fingerprint login with trusted apps:\u00a0Not every app that asks for your fingerprint is trustworthy. It\u2019s safest to use fingerprint login only with apps from known and reliable companies, like your bank, phone manufacturer or email provider. If an unfamiliar app asks for fingerprint access, it\u2019s better to skip it and use your password instead.",
      "7. Consider using a personal data removal service: Even fingerprint scanners can be bypassed, and large amounts of personal and biometric data have been exposed in breaches. Using a personal data removal service helps reduce your risk by removing your sensitive information from public databases and data broker sites, making it harder for hackers to piece together details that could be used to steal your identity.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Passwords are generally easier to hack than biometric data like fingerprints or facial recognition. However, the key difference is that passwords can be changed if they\u2019re compromised. Your biometrics cannot. Most modern devices allow both options, and biometrics can offer an extra layer of security by making it harder for someone else to access your phone or apps. They're also fast and convenient, since you don\u2019t need to remember or type anything. That said, in most cases, your device still falls back on a password or PIN when biometric identification doesn\u2019t work, so both systems often go hand in hand.",

    "story": [
      "From face recognition to dynamic lock, there are options you may be unfamiliar with.",
      "Passwords are outdated, and it's time for both tech companies and users to move on. There, I said it. Like it or not, the weakest link in cybersecurity is anything that relies on human input. While organizations continue to invest in firewalls and endpoint security, the most persistent vulnerability remains the human password.",
      "The internet has long struggled with poor password practices, but a recent discovery highlights just how serious the problem is.",
      "Security researchers have uncovered more than 19 billion newly leaked passwords, collected from hundreds of breaches between April 2024 and April 2025. An astonishing 94% of these passwords were either reused, predictable or both.",

      "What you need to know",
      "Between April 2024 and April 2025, data from nearly 200 separate cybersecurity incidents became publicly available, as discovered by\u00a0Cybernews. These were not isolated events. They involved massive leak repositories including combolists, stealer logs and compromised databases. In total, over 3 terabytes of raw leaked data were analyzed, comprising more than 19 billion passwords. Only 6 percent of these, just over 1.1 billion, were unique.",
      "Among the most used passwords, \"123456\" appeared in over 338 million instances. Words like \"Password\" and \"admin\" followed close behind, despite years of public warnings. Such defaults often originate from devices like routers or enterprise tools, where they are rarely changed and frequently reused elsewhere.",
      "1.7 BILLION PASSWORDS LEAKED ON DARK WEB AND WHY YOURS IS AT RISK",
      "Personal names remain a common pattern as well. The name \"Ana\" appeared in nearly 179 million passwords, followed by countless other first names and name-based combinations. Pop culture, food, cities and even swear words were frequent themes. Words like \"Mario,\" \"love,\" \"pizza,\" \"Rome\" and various profanities were not just creative choices. They are now security liabilities.",
      "Even worse, attackers do not need to guess anymore. They have automation. Credential stuffing tools now run through billions of known passwords across hundreds of platforms, breaching accounts at success rates as high as two percent. That equates to thousands of compromised profiles, bank accounts, emails and cloud tools every single day.",

      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "The bigger problem",
      "According to CyberNews researcher Neringa Macijauskaite, the core issue is not just weak passwords but how often they are reused. Only six percent of passwords are unique. For most users, security depends entirely on\u00a0two-factor authentication, if it is enabled at all.",
      "Most passwords fall between eight to 10 characters, with eight being the most common. Around 27 percent of them contain only lowercase letters and digits, making them highly vulnerable to brute force attacks. Less than 20 percent use a mix of cases and numbers, and only a small fraction includes symbols.",
      "HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT",
      "Despite widespread education efforts, user habits remain stagnant, but one positive trend has emerged. In 2022, only one percent of passwords used a mix of lowercase, uppercase, numbers and symbols. Now that figure has grown to 19 percent, likely driven by stricter password requirements across platforms.",

      "Four ways to stay safe from password-stealing scammers",
      "Protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are four effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your password is stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "2. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links:\u00a0Infostealer malware is the root cause of why your password is out there. It often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources, and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers, and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible, and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "4. Consider a personal data removal service:\u00a0These services can help remove your personal information from data broker sites, reducing your risk of identity theft, spam and targeted scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "When it comes down to it, passwords just aren't cutting it anymore. The sheer number of leaked passwords and the fact that so few are unique show how vulnerable we really are. Cybercriminals are getting smarter and faster, but we don't have to make it easy for them. By using password managers, enabling two-factor authentication, keeping our software updated and considering extra privacy tools, we can take back some control over this situation. It might take a little effort to change old habits, but the peace of mind you get is worth it.",

      "Wandercraft's Personal Exoskeleton is about helping people stand tall, connect with others and live life on their own terms.",
      "For Caroline Laubach, being a Wandercraft test pilot is about more than just trying out new technology. It's about reclaiming a sense of freedom and connection that many wheelchair users miss. Laubach, a spinal stroke survivor and full-time wheelchair user, has played a key role in\u00a0demonstrating the personal AI-powered prototype exoskeleton's development, and her experience highlights just how life-changing this device can be.",
      "\"When I'm in the exoskeleton, I feel more free than I do in my daily life,\" said Laubach. \"It gives me the opportunity to walk around and talk to people at eye level. I don't have to look up at people all the time.",
      "\"It makes me feel more visible and able to connect with others. One thing I noticed right away, was how inclusive the exoskeleton would be to a wide variety of disabilities. The goal is to have disabled people able to use this exoskeleton to live their daily life out in the world; I can definitely see that happening in the future.\"",
      "Laubach's story is at the heart of Wandercraft's mission: to help people move through the world with greater walking independence and upright mobility.",

      "A personal mission becomes a global vision",
      "Wandercraft's journey began with a personal challenge. Nicolas Simon, the company's co-founder, saw his own family members struggle with mobility due to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a genetic condition. As a student and robotics enthusiast, Simon wanted to create something that could help his brother and others like him walk again. Alongside Matthieu Masselin and Jean-Louis Constanza, who also had a personal connection to the cause, Simon founded Wandercraft in 2012.",

This device, cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and approved in Europe, helps patients take over a million steps each month as part of their rehabilitation. It has already helped hundreds regain some mobility and independence.",
      "But Wandercraft wanted to go further. The new Personal Exoskeleton protoype, now in clinical trials in New York and New Jersey, is designed for daily life, at home, at work, and out in the community. It uses NVIDIA AI to adapt instantly to each user's movements, providing smooth, stable walking on all sorts of surfaces, from sidewalks to carpets. Users control the exoskeleton with a joystick, making it accessible to people with a wide range of abilities.",

The team uses Nvidia Isaac Sim, a powerful simulation tool, to test and improve the exoskeleton in virtual environments before real-world trials. They're also exploring Nvidia's healthcare robotics and edge computing platforms to make the device smarter and more responsive.",
      "This technology means the exoskeleton can someday keep up with everyday life, walking at a normal pace, crossing streets, and even handling stairs. As Simon puts it, \"It's essential for the exoskeleton to be fast enough that it can be used in the real world. By integrating NVIDIA AI into the device, we can someday enable users to walk at an average pace, cross the road, and go up and down stairs.\"",

      "The U.N. Human Rights Office claimed some 47 people were injured during the gunfire, while the Hamas-run health ministry said one person was killed and 48 others were wounded, reported the BBC, though Fox News Digital could not independently verify the casualty count.",

      "\"Hamas had significant influence over aid flows, which it used not only for governance but also as leverage to reinforce loyalty, reward patronage networks, and maintain internal control,\" the expert explained. \"The erosion of this influence poses both a symbolic and operational threat to the group.",
      "\"With Hamas becoming sidelined from the aid process, the group is facing a legitimacy crisis,\" Truzman added.",

      "\"If the new aid mechanism succeeds in improving living conditions for Palestinians, surpassing what Hamas has been able to provide during wartime, it is unlikely to reverse the growing public dissatisfaction with the group,\" Truzman told Fox News Digital. \"Even an imperfect but externally managed aid system may further expose Hamas\u2019s governance failures, particularly its prioritization of power retention over the welfare of the population.",
      "\"While tangible improvements will take time to materialize, the mere perception that life can improve without Hamas may be enough to shift public attitudes further against the group,\" he added.",

      "After more than a year and a half of war, Israel has found itself in an \"impossible dilemma\" as it tries to defeat Hamas and bring home the remaining hostages, former Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy says.",
      "In an interview with Fox News Digital, Levy said that it is crucial that Hamas not remain in power \u2014 and that it is also vital to save the hostages languishing in tunnels under Gaza.",
      "\"If this war ends with the Hamas regime that perpetrated October 7th still in power, it won't end, it will just pause, and the next war will be a matter of time,\" Levy said. \"Israelis don\u2019t want war. We need this war to be over, but we need this war to be over with the total defeat of the Hamas regime, or else this won't be the last Gaza war.\"",

      "PARENTS OF HAMAS HOSTAGES URGE TRUMP TO BE 'TOUGH WITH ENEMIES AND FRIENDS' AMID ISRAELI SIEGE IN GAZA",
      "Israel has faced international criticism over its handling of the war in Gaza, with the U.K., France and Canada releasing a joint statement earlier this month demanding that Jerusalem end its military operations in the Gaza Strip. The U.K. also suspended trade talks with Israel because of London\u2019s objections to the war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney of being \"on the wrong side of humanity.\"",
      "\"I think anyone criticizing Israel needs to come up with a better plan for how you remove Hamas from power, because otherwise they're just giving it political power and trying to save [it] from the war that it started,\" Levy told Fox News Digital.",
      "The international community has been pressuring Israel regarding hostage swaps. Jerusalem has been pressured to free Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the release of hostages taken on Oct. 7. Levy acknowledged that while Israel cannot leave the hostages behind, there are valid concerns about these releases.",
      "\"Israel is facing the impossible dilemma because Hamas is demanding the hostage-takers of tomorrow for the hostages of today,\" Levy said.",

      "Levy also called out the international community, saying that most countries would not \"pay ransoms to terrorist hostage-takers.\"",
      "\"Here's the absurdity of international pressure on Israel to pay a ransom. Most countries don't pay ransoms to terrorist hostage takers because they understand it only incentivizes more hostage taking, it rewards it, it encourages more of it,\" Levy told Fox News Digital. \"Israel has paid a ransom to get hostages out in two cease-fires because we say we know the dangers, we know it's risky, but we've got to get out these poor people who are being starved and tortured and even executed in the dungeons.\"",
      "Levy believes Israel \"found itself stymied along the way\" as countries that initially backed efforts to defeat Hamas \"got cold feet very quickly\" as they understood what removing the terror group from power would entail.",
      "Looking at the broader picture, Levy wonders if Israel had taken on a different strategy from day one, whether the war would have ended sooner, though he admits it would have meant \"defying international pressure.\"",

      "\"I do wonder if that had been the strategy from the beginning\u2014defying international pressure\u2014then it's possible the war might have ended sooner,\" Levy said. \"But again, Israel is caught in this impossible bind because there are still hostages who are trapped in Gaza, whom Hamas is threatening to execute if the Israeli army gets anywhere near them to try to rescue them.\"",
      "This is not a new or empty threat. Several former hostages reported being threatened and said they were told that their captors would execute them if Israeli forces got close. Six other former hostages, including American-Israeli Hersh Goldberg-Polin, met this fate when they were fatally shot just before the IDF could reach them.",
      "Not all of Israel\u2019s international counterparts have turned on the Jewish state. America\u2019s approach to Netanyahu shifted as President Donald Trump returned to the White House. While the Biden administration put more pressure on Netanyahu, Trump appears to support Israel doing what it must to end the war.",
      "Levy told Fox News Digital that \"Israelis definitely got the impression that the Trump administration has Israel's back and is willing to endorse any military strategy that it wants to implement, but there are also signs the Trump administration, you know, may want to wrap this up very quickly.\"",

      "Rubio said Wednesday that Chinese students \u201cwith connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields\u201d would be targeted.",
      "Chinese students who spoke to NBC News on Thursday said that they came to the U.S. for freedoms that they felt they did not have back in China but that now the Trump administration is starting to resemble the strict regime they left behind.",
      "\u201cUSA stands for freedom. It stands for democracy. \u2026 That\u2019s why we come here to chase our dreams,\u201d said one Chinese Ph.D. student at a New Jersey university, who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation. \u201cIn China, the government can control education, high schools, colleges, universities. We thought that the USA could be different.\u201d",
      "The State Department referred NBC News to comments by spokesperson Tammy Bruce during a press briefing Thursday in which Bruce said that the department does not discuss the details of its visa process due to privacy concerns.",

      "The Chinese Embassy referred NBC News to comments made by Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the Foreign Affairs Ministry. Mao harshly criticized Rubio\u2019s announcement Thursday at a regular briefing in Beijing.",
      "\u201cThis politically discriminatory move exposes the hypocrisy of America\u2019s long-proclaimed values of freedom and openness, and will only further damage the United States\u2019 international image and credibility,\u201d Mao said.",
      "Questions swirl around the new directive, including what \u201ccritical fields\u201d the administration will be looking into and what types of connections to the CCP are under scrutiny. But it\u2019s already prompted panic among many Chinese scholars, who make up the second-largest international student group in the U.S.",
      "While a temporary nationwide injunction issued last week blocks the Trump administration from revoking international students\u2019 legal statuses amid its mass termination of records, attorneys say that it may not protect Chinese international students. Jath Shao, a Cleveland-based immigration attorney, said that while the restraining order keeps international students from being arrested or detained, or from losing their legal status, they can still have their visas revoked. Without a visa, Shao said, students can\u2019t return to the U.S. once they\u2019ve left, among a host of other issues.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to get a job or a study ... that means you\u2019re pretty much out of luck,\u201d Shao said. \u201cYou\u2019re stuck here. They\u2019re basically trying to take away all your options.\u201d",
      "Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst with the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, also mentioned that the Trump administration could argue that Chinese students fall under a completely different circumstance compared to those protected by the injunction.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing in various cases that the administration is saying that it\u2019s doing individualized determinations,\u201d Bush-Joseph said. \u201cEven if they\u2019re focusing on a particular nationality, in any given case, they might say this is based on an individual person\u2019s circumstances.\u201d",
      "One Chinese student who\u2019s studying economics at an Ivy League institution said that he felt the tactics used by the Trump administration, including harsh, pointed rhetoric and intimidation, smack of those used by the Chinese government. The student said that it wasn\u2019t uncommon for Beijing to withhold funding for certain political research, much like Trump has threatened Harvard University, or use other methods of repression.",
      "\u201cIn China, we\u2019re all Chinese, so they cannot revoke our citizenship, but they can revoke the student record,\u201d he said. \u201cThat happens when it comes to people involved in political activities.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re just using the CCP to evoke a \u2018Red Scare.\u2019 They don\u2019t really care about ideals,\u201d the economics student said, referring to the historical periods of fear in the U.S. around the potential rise of communism and socialism. \u201cWe just keep joking that it seems like Trump is learning from the Xi Jinping playbook.\u201d",
      "The Ph.D. student said that at this point, he and his peers are considering either moving back to China or another Asian country \u2014 a plan that he said was not in the books before. He mentioned that before coming to America, he envisioned a country that was welcoming of diversity and inclusive of all backgrounds and a place he would put down roots. His thoughts on the U.S. have evolved drastically.",
      "\u201cMy family and my best friends, they had a phone call with me to say, \u2018Hey, I think maybe you should come back. We think that there\u2019s no reason for you to stay in the U.S,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Gisela Perez Kusakawa, executive director of the nonprofit Asian American Scholar Forum, said that the new policy would only serve to harm the U.S. and its own research ambitions.",
      "\u201cWe know that many of our best and brightest talents are prominent scientists that have gone on to develop so many innovations that have changed the daily lives of so many Americans,\u201d she said. \u201cThey started out as international students. They walked these campuses.\u201d",
      "She also noted that it\u2019s likely policymakers are guided by misconceptions around Chinese nationals. While there\u2019s been a longstanding belief that Chinese international students would take intelligence back to China, research shows that most hope to start their lives in America. From 2005 to 2015, 87% of Chinese Ph.D. students said that they intended to stay in the U.S. A separate survey of more than 1,300 Chinese American researchers found that 89% \u201caimed to help advance U.S. leadership in science and technology.\u201d",
      "As disappointing as the Rubio announcement was, Kusakawa underscored that it isn\u2019t necessarily surprising. In March, Republican lawmakers introduced a bill that would halt the issuance of student visas to Chinese nationals looking to study at U.S. universities or take part in exchange programs.",
      "\u201cIn many ways, there was already this existing fear that this could potentially become a reality,\u201d Kusakawa said. \u201cBut perhaps what is surprising is the speed in which it\u2019s happening.\u201d",
      "So far, the announcement has drawn mass criticism from many high-profile Chinese American lawmakers and leaders, including Gary Locke, a former U.S. ambassador to China and the chair of the Chinese American nonprofit Committee of 100, and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.",
      "\u201cThe wholesale revocation of student visas based on national origin \u2014 and without an investigation \u2014 is xenophobic and wrong,\u201d the lawmakers said on social media. \u201cTurning these students away \u2014 many of whom simply wish to learn in a free and democratic society \u2014 is not just shortsighted but a betrayal of our values.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "More than 150 years after their heads were severed from their bodies and shipped to Germany for \u201cresearch,\u201d the craniums of 19 Black people, which were recently returned, will be memorialized Saturday during a sacred ceremony in New Orleans.",
      "Dillard University President Monique Guillory said at a news conference Wednesday that the memorial will be \u201cabout confronting a dark chapter in medical and scientific history while choosing a path of justice, honor and remembrance.\u201d",
      "Those who will be honored died in the city\u2019s Charity Hospital in 1872. Their heads were severed and shipped to Leipzig University in Germany to be studied \u2014 a common practice at the time, as researchers sought to confirm their unfounded theory that Black people\u2019s brains were smaller than those of other races, therefore making them inferior.",
      "\u201cThey were stripped of their dignity,\u201d Guillory said, over \u201ca practice rooted in racism and exploitation. They were people with names. They were people with stories and histories. Some of them had families, mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, human beings.\u201d They were not specimens, she continued, \u201cnot numbers.\u201d",
      "The heads were returned to New Orleans about a week ago after a two-year journey, said Eva Baham, a retired Dillard professor. Representatives from Leipzig contacted the city in 2023 about their existence in Germany, where the university houses a skull collection dating to the 1800s. The school is in the process of repatriating or sending back skulls to their original locations. That initial call set in motion the creation of the Cultural Repatriation Committee, led by Baham.",
      "\u201cWe are not talking about them as if they are skeletal remains,\u201d Baham said at the news conference. \u201cWe want to honor them by calling them the individuals that they are.\u201d",
      "Dillard, one of two historically Black universities in New Orleans, along with Xavier University of Louisiana, welcomed the opportunity to be part of \u201cthis very sensitive acknowledgment of our people, that they are here,\u201d Guillory told NBC News. A visitation will take place Saturday at Dillard\u2019s Lawless Memorial Chapel with a service. Laid to rest will be the remains of Adam Grant, Isaak Bell, Hiram Smith, William Pierson, Henry Williams, John Brown, Hiram Malone, William Roberts, Alice Brown, Prescilla Hatchet, Marie Louise, Mahala, Samuel Prince, John Tolman, Henry Allen, Moses Willis and Henry Anderson.",
      "The two other people could not be identified.",
      "The committee tried in vain for two years to contact descendants of the victims but had no success. They did learn some information, Baham said, and found their names listed in municipal death records almost in succession.",
      "\u201cIn those records list what they died from, how long they had been in New Orleans,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have people who were here in New Orleans from one hour in 1871, one day, a week, two months. And that\u2019s all very important.\u201d",
      "Guillory said the service will be a New Orleans expression of respect.",
      "\u201cWe will do so in the most sacred way that we know how in our beloved city, in a true New Orleans fashion, with a jazz funeral that shows the world that these people mattered,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a very different relationship with death here and a very different relationship with what we believe is the spirit and our ancestors. And now they are home. And so, this is particularly poignant for people in New Orleans.\u201d",
      "When the opportunity arose, there were questions from people in the academic and local community, Guillory said, about why the parties involved would welcome their return. But the city, University Medical Center New Orleans, Dillard University and other entities did not blink.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s certain sensitivity to the material, to the macabre, somber nature of what we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Guillory said. \u201cThere was also a lot of uncertainty about whether we could actually bring them here. Should we bring them here? Who should be responsible for bringing them here? Why bring them back? And I think the committee itself had been very confident and convinced that this was the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "The remains will be stored at the Hurricane Katrina Memorial.",
      "\u201cWe want that day to be not only of remembrance but of reckoning and renewal,\u201d Guillory said, \u201cand may we never forget them.\u201d"

      "\"Harvard\u2019s refusal to comply with SEVP oversight was the latest evidence that it disdains the American people and takes for granted U.S. taxpayer benefits,\" Noem wrote, referring to the foreign student program. \"Following our letter to Harvard, the school attempted to claim it now wishes to comply with SEVP standards.\"",
      "\"We continue to reject Harvard\u2019s repeated pattern of endangering its students and spreading American hate \u2014 it must change its ways in order to participate in American programs,\" she added.",
      "A spokesperson for Harvard, Sarah Kennedy-O\u2019Reilly, said the judge's decision will allow it to \"continue enrolling international students and scholars while the case moves forward.\"",
      "\"Harvard will continue to take steps to protect the rights of our international students and scholars, members of our community who are vital to the University\u2019s academic mission and community \u2014 and whose presence here benefits our country immeasurably,\" she said.",
      "Burroughs said she would leave the temporary order in place until it can be replaced by a preliminary injunction. No date or timeline was discussed Thursday for when a formal injunction might be issued.",
      "Burroughs extended the order on the day of the university\u2019s 347th graduation ceremony.",
      "If the revocation is successful, foreign students studying at Harvard will lose their ability to stay in the U.S. unless they transfer schools. International students make up roughly one-fourth of the university\u2019s student body.",
      "The Trump administration is also battling the nation\u2019s oldest \u2014 and arguably most prestigious \u2014 university in court over the funding from the federal government that gives Harvard the ability to conduct state-of-the-art research. Last month, the administration stripped Harvard of $2 billion in federal research grants, prompting Harvard to sue.",
      "On Monday, Trump said on his social media website, Truth Social, that he was considering taking $3 billion in grant money away from Harvard and giving it to trade schools instead.",
      "Harvard President Alan Garber, in an interview Tuesday with NPR, said he was \"less concerned about whether it goes to a trade school or if it goes to some other project, like working on highways.\"",
      "\"What the real question is, how much value does the federal government get from its expenditures on research?\" Garber said.",
      "The legal battles came shortly after Harvard refused to comply with a list of sweeping demands from the Trump administration\u2019s Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism last month.",
      "The task force wanted to oversee who Harvard admits and hires and subject its faculty to a government audit.",
      "The confrontation with Harvard is among the Trump administration's broader efforts to determine who has access to higher education in the U.S.",
      "On Tuesday, the administration stopped scheduling new interviews for international students seeking visas to study in the U.S., according to an internal cable seen by NBC News. The State Department will also expand its screening of visa applicants' social media use, according to the cable."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/tv/the-rehearsal-nathan-fielder-cnn-interview-faa-rcna209782",
    "published": "Thu, 29 May 2025 19:10:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Comedian and pilot Nathan Fielder appeared on CNN, where he discussed his experience flying a Boeing 737 during the season 2 finale of HBO's \"The Rehearsal.\"",
    "story": [
      "Comedian/pilot Nathan Fielder criticized the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday, calling the agency \"dumb\" for its response to his show \"The Rehearsal.\"",
      "Wearing a hat that read \"737\" (yes, like the plane) and a suit, Fielder and aviation safety expert John Goglia joined CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer and Pamela Brown to discuss the reaction to his HBO show. (CNN and HBO are both owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.)",
      "In the second season of the docu-comedy, which aired its finale on Sunday, Fielder investigates a theory that suggests many plane crashes are caused by pilots and co-pilots miscommunicating with each other. Viewers learn that Fielder had spent two years obtaining his commercial pilot license, so that he could fly a full plane of passengers (all actors) on a Boeing 737. While Fielder is known on the show to make fake scenarios look realistic, viewers were shocked to realize he was, in fact, flying the plane. Some fans on Reddit also said they found Fielder in the FAA database and looked up his flight.",
      "Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member, also appears on \u201cThe Rehearsal\" and provided Fielder with expertise on flying. Together, they advocated for including role playing in pilot training.",
      "During the CNN segment, Brown read a statement from the FAA, in which a spokesperson said the agency \u201crequires all airline crewmembers (pilots and flight attendants) and dispatchers to complete Crew Resource Management training. They must complete this training before they begin working in their official positions and complete it on a recurring basis afterward.\u201d",
      "Brown said the agency also told CNN that it isn\u2019t seeing the data that supports the show's \"claim that pilot communications is to blame for airline disasters.\"",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s dumb. They\u2019re dumb,\u201d Fielder said of the FAA after Brown read the statement. \u201cHere\u2019s the issue: I trained to be a pilot. I\u2019m a 737 pilot. I went through the training. The training is someone shows you a PowerPoint slide saying, \u2018If you are a co-pilot and the captain does something wrong, you need to speak up about it.\u2019 That\u2019s all. That\u2019s the training, and they talk about some crashes that happen, but they don\u2019t do anything that makes it stick emotionally.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the FAA sent NBC News the statement Brown read on air and added that \"the Federal Aviation Administration analyzes data from a variety of sources such as an airline's Safety Management System, Aviation Safety Action Program, and Voluntary Disclosure Reporting Program.\"",
      "\"If these programs identify elevated risks, appropriate action is taken by both the airline and the FAA to mitigate the risk and ensure safety,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The agency declined to comment further.",
      "Fielder's interview, like his show, quickly gained traction online, with many viewers praising him for committing to the bit.",
      "The comedian is known for his socially awkward humor, which is on full display in \"The Rehearsal.\" The show has drawn both praise (with some calling Fielder a comedic genius) as well as criticism (with others claiming he can sometimes take things too far).",
      "In another episode from season two, for example, the comedian depicts Paramount+ as Nazis after the streamer removed an episode of his show \"Nathan for You\" from its platform due to \"sensitivities\" around antisemitism, according to Variety. The show, which debuted in 2013, ran for four seasons on Paramount's Comedy Central.",
      "For Fielder, \u201cThe Rehearsal\" \"is still comedy, but also this is a serious thing,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been just interested in commercial airline crashes just for a while, as a hobby, I just read about them.\u201d",
      "When asked if he\u2019s concerned about airline safety, Fielder said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to die. I mean I\u2019m concerned the same as everyone.\u201d",
      "He said he was interested in exploring the topic of aviation safety when he started to notice that \u201cthey can always solve the technical stuff when a crash happens, they work really hard to make sure that type of accident doesn\u2019t happen again. But for the human factor \u2014 communication \u2014 the thing keeps happening where there\u2019s miscommunication between pilots.\u201d"

      "The same week FEMA was moving to keep those key employees in place, the White House was suddenly approving disaster recovery reimbursement requests from 10 states, including some that had been stalled for months, accounting for 20% of all such approvals in Trump\u2019s second term, according to FEMA disaster approval data online.",
      "Three sources familiar with Noem\u2019s recent actions say she has taken an outsized role compared with previous secretaries in pushing the White House to support FEMA and reimburse states.",
      "State and local governments are entitled by statute to have 75% of their costs for disasters reimbursed by the federal government. Anything above that is determined by a fixed formula or, if the formula's requirements are not met, by the president. In the past, the White House generally approved what FEMA officials determined was appropriate based on those formulas, leaving the homeland security secretary to function largely as a rubber stamp, according to two sources familiar with the disaster approval process. But with the White House pushing to downsize FEMA\u2019s role and encourage more states to bail themselves out, at least as of last week, the White House had repeatedly pushed back against FEMA\u2019s recommendations, according to one of the sources familiar with Noem\u2019s recent actions. And Noem had gotten involved.",
      "Asked for comment on this article, McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, said in a statement: \u201cThis is a sad attempt by the mainstream media to drive a false narrative that there is daylight between President Trump and Secretary Noem. To the media\u2019s chagrin, there\u2019s not. Secretary Noem has been implementing President Trump\u2019s vision for the future of FEMA to shift it away from a bloated, DC-centric bureaucracy that has let down the American people.\u201d",
      "Because previous administrations typically approved reimbursements that FEMA determined should be made, states might not have the ability to shoulder the burden without having planned for it years in advance.",
      "\u201cFor a state like North Carolina, it\u2019s significant. And in a state like Alabama or Mississippi, it would bankrupt the state,\u201d said Michael Cohen, who was chief of staff at FEMA during the Biden administration. \u201cThey would have to take out a bond. They would have to look at how they increase tax revenue. For some of these states, it might be twice what their annual budget is for the year. So when the DHS secretary or White House is saying states are going to have to own the problem ... these states are going to need to have a different mindset for how they budget.\u201d",
      "Though the CORE employees are being kept on, a large number of FEMA\u2019s senior executives have left this year, largely voluntarily, raising concerns internally and among outside observers and members of Congress about its ability to respond during hurricane season. Sixteen senior officials whose departures were announced in an internal email last week had a combined 228 years of experience at FEMA. Four additional senior executive departures were announced Wednesday in an email from the acting chief of staff at FEMA, who is herself set to step down.",

      "While the theory put forward by special prosecutor Hank Brennan was the same as that offered by the assistant district attorney who previously tried the case \u2014 Read, drunk and angry, struck John O\u2019Keefe with her Lexus SUV and left him for dead on Jan. 29, 2022 \u2014 there were some notable changes from Read's first trial, which ended with a hung jury last summer.",
      "Absent were two high-profile witnesses who were key to the defense\u2019s claims that Read was framed. Also missing was the former Massachusetts state trooper who led the investigation into O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death and was fired after revelations of misconduct emerged in the first trial.",

      "Another notable change was the role of Read, who has maintained her innocence, herself. In addition to speaking to reporters outside the courtroom, her words have been a regular presence in Brennan\u2019s presentation, which has featured a series of interview clips that show what Brennan has described as Read's \u201ccampaign\u201d of public statements.",
      "Read\u2019s lawyers are expected to begin making their case Friday.",
      "A key witness tries to re-create the scene",
      "The prosecution\u2019s final witness was one of its most important. No cameras captured the events that led to O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death, nor have any witnesses claimed to have seen what happened at 34 Fairview Road \u2014 the home in Canton, just south of Boston, where O\u2019Keefe, 46, was found unresponsive in the front yard shortly after 6 a.m. on Jan. 29.",
      "But Judson Welcher, a biomechanical engineer and accident reconstruction expert, testified that data from Read\u2019s 2021 Lexus showed that at 12:32 a.m., outside 34 Fairview, the vehicle drove forward 34 feet, then reversed 53 feet. The SUV was traveling at nearly 24 mph, he said, with a throttle of 74 percent.",
      "While there was no vehicle data to support Brennan\u2019s allegation of a collision, Welcher testified that lacerations on O\u2019Keefe\u2019s right arm were \u201cconsistent\u201d with injuries caused by a broken rear right tail light on the SUV.",
      "Welcher testified that his height and weight approximated O\u2019Keefe\u2019s \u2014 around 6 feet tall and 220 pounds \u2014 and he conducted re-enactments showing what such a collision might look like. In one video, Welcher wore similar clothes as O\u2019Keefe from Jan. 29 \u2014 jeans, t-shirt, baseball cap \u2014 while a Lexus that was the same model and year as Read\u2019s backed into him at 2 mph.",
      "Welcher also knocked down the defense\u2019s claim that the broken tail light came from a different collision on Jan. 29. As Read left her home around 5 a.m. to look for O\u2019Keefe, she was in a panic, she has said, and she backed her Lexus into his Chevrolet Traverse. Ring camera video played in court captured the incident.",
      "But Welcher testified that an analysis of the video showed Read was driving less than 1 mph at the time and there was no evidence of any damage to either vehicle.",
      "\u201cThat impact did not break or crack that tail light,\" Welcher said.",
      "Who didn\u2019t they call to testify?",
      "Michael Proctor, the ex-trooper and case agent who managed the investigation into O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death, was included on the prosecution\u2019s list of possible witnesses. In the first trial, Proctor spent hours on the stand and acknowledged that comments he made to friends, family and supervisors about Read were unprofessional and \u201cdehumanized\u201d her. But, prosecutors did not call him to testify in the retrial.",
      "The Massachusetts State Police dishonorably discharged Proctor in March after an internal investigation found that he violated agency rules by sending derogatory messages and sharing confidential investigative details with non-law enforcement personnel.",
      "Proctor testified that his conduct did not harm the investigation. He has not publicly commented on his termination, but his family has criticized his former employer, saying he was unfairly scapegoated. His former supervisor testified this month that Proctor had acted with \u201chonor and integrity.\u201d",
      "\u201cI believe human beings all have biases,\u201d Sgt. Yuri Bukhenik told the jury. \u201cEspecially in this case, they did not affect the outcome of the investigation.\u201d",
      "Bukhenik acknowledged that he was disciplined in part for failing to adequately supervise Proctor and lost five vacation days.",
      "Proctor is listed as a possible witness for the defense, which has accused him of bias and manipulating evidence.",
      "Two other figures who played an outsized role in the first trial \u2014 Brian Albert and Brian Higgins \u2014 were also included on the prosecution\u2019s witness list but were not called to testify.",
      "Albert, a retired Boston police sergeant, lived with his family at 34 Fairview at the time of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death and had a gathering at his home on Jan. 29 that O\u2019Keefe planned on attending. Prosecutors \u2014 and Albert \u2014 have said that O\u2019Keefe never made it to the party and no one who was there that morning saw him inside.",
      "But the defense has alleged that O\u2019Keefe entered Albert\u2019s home, and was beaten, bitten by the family\u2019s German Shepherd and dragged outside, where he died. They\u2019ve pointed to Higgins, an agent with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives who was at the gathering, as a possible conspirator in this alternative theory of the case.",
      "In the weeks before O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death, a series of text messages introduced as evidence showed Higgins flirting with Read and appearing frustrated when she does not speak more candidly about what she wants from him. This tension likely prompted the fight that led to O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death, the lawyers have said. (Through their attorneys, both men have denied involvement.)",
      "Albert and Higgins are both included on the defense\u2019s list of possible witnesses.",
      "What does Karen Read say?",
      "Read has been unusually candid with journalists, and Brennan has shown a series of clips from interviews she has given to reinforce the prosecution\u2019s theory of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s death.",
      "In one clip, shown during opening statements on April 22, Read was captured telling \u201cDateline\u201d that she could have \u201ctagged\u201d O\u2019Keefe in the knee \u201cand incapacitated him.

      "DETROIT \u2014 Jeep on Thursday revealed the first details and image of its new Cherokee SUV, which the company expects to assist in the brand\u2019s turnaround when it arrives later this year.",
      "The Stellantis brand said the new midsize SUV will feature a hybrid powertrain option but declined to specify if it would be a traditional hybrid or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), which the company currently offers on several SUVs.",
      "\u201cThe all-new Jeep Cherokee headlines our efforts to deliver more product, innovation, choice and standard content to customers than ever before,\u201d Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf said in a statement. \u201cJeep Cherokee will boast competitive pricing that strikes at the core of the largest vehicle segment and sits perfectly between Jeep Compass and Jeep Grand Cherokee to bolster our winning mainstream lineup.\u201d",
      "Affordability has been a problem for Jeep sales amid price increases in recent years. An entry-level model of the Cherokee started around $30,000 for the 2022 model year, according to Cars.com. That is close to the current Jeep Compass at about $27,000. The 2025 Grand Cherokee starts at roughly $36,500.",
      "The company declined to release other details of the vehicle, including its production location. Analysts and union officials have said the new SUV is expected to be produced at a plant in Mexico \u2014 a decision that was made prior to President Donald Trump\u2019s election and ongoing automotive tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles into the U.S.",
      "The last generation of the Cherokee was produced at a plant in Illinois, which has been idled since the vehicles was discontinued in early 2023 amid cost-cutting efforts and production realignments.",
      "The cancellation of the Cherokee and a smaller SUV called the Renegade after the 2023 model-year contributed to ongoing sales declines for the brand.",
      "Jeep, a coveted brand in the automotive industry, has reported six consecutive years of U.S. annual sales declines, with a 10% decline through the first quarter of this year.",
      "The SUV brand is expected to be a priority for incoming Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, who was leading Jeep\u2019s turnaround before being promoted last year to lead the company\u2019s Americas region.",

      "Tariffs were a defining promise of President Donald Trump's campaign, and they have been a defining feature of his second term in office. But just over five months in, many of his tariff proclamations haven\u2019t turned into reality.",
      "While Trump has imposed a number of sweeping tariffs that have been driving up costs for American businesses and consumers buying goods from overseas, he has threatened far more tariffs than he has carried through on.",
      "That has created a climate of uncertainty that has caused some businesses to lay off workers and delay investments, as well as led to volatility in the stock market. Some financial analysts have taken to calling Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again moves TACO trade or the TACO theory \u2014 an acronym for \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\" (Asked by a reporter about the phrase, Trump called the question \"nasty\" and said, \"It\u2019s called negotiation.\")",
      "Here are 10 times Trump has threatened, then backtracked on, tariffs since he took office. Notably, in some cases, like threatened tariffs against Colombia, the administration did win policy concessions in other areas after it wielded the threat. But other tariffs threats have come and gone without other tangible results.",
      "In one of his latest tariff moves, Trump threatened last Friday to impose a 50% tariff on goods shipped into the United States from the European Union, saying the European countries weren\u2019t taking ongoing trade talks seriously enough.",
      "Trump said the tariff would go into effect on June 1, but two days later, he delayed it until July 9, after he said he had spoken with E.U. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Trump said she asked for the delay.",
      "Trump had threatened Europe with a 20% tariff as part of his \"reciprocal\" tariffs announced April 2. But hours after those tariffs were scheduled to go into effect, Trump reduced tariffs on Europe and most other countries to 10% for 90 days to give his administration time to work out individual trade deals. The tariff on European imports remains at 10%.",
      "Aside from the wider tariffs on the E.U., Trump announced March 13 on social media that he would impose a 200% tariff on wine imported into the United States from the E.U. after the E.U. threatened a 50% tariff on American whiskey. That threat came in response to Trump\u2019s earlier tariffs on European steel and aluminum.",
      "The tit-for-tat over alcohol never came to fruition, with European officials saying a week later that they would delay the threatened whiskey tariff until mid-April, pending negotiations with the United States. There have been no tariffs on European wines aside from Trump\u2019s blanket 10% tariff on all imports.",
      "Among Trump\u2019s first tariff targets were the United States' neighbors, Canada and Mexico. Just weeks into office, he signed an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on goods imported from Canada and Mexico, saying they weren\u2019t doing enough to stem the flow of fentanyl across the border.",
      "In response, Canada and Mexico announced their own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, and Canadians began to boycott American brands.",
      "A day before the tariffs were set to be collected, Trump said he was pausing them for 30 days. He said he was making the pause because of actions Canada and Mexico said they were taking at their borders, though a number of those steps were already underway when Trump first announced his tariffs.",
      "Once the 30-day pause was up, Trump said March 4 that the 25% tariffs on Canada would go into effect. But two days after he implemented the tariffs on Canada and Mexico, he said he would pause them again until April 2 for most goods. When Trump announced wider tariffs for nearly all countries on April 2, Canada and Mexico were excluded.",
      "Despite the back-and-forth, there are no tariffs on most goods from Canada and Mexico that fall under the North American trade deal signed during Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Trump said May 4 on social media that he was directing his administration to start collecting a 100% tariff \u201con any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands,\u201d without giving any details about when or how it would be collected.",
      "A few hours later, the White House said that no final decisions had been made and that the administration was \u201cexploring its options.\u201d By the afternoon, Trump said he would meet with industry officials to make sure they were \u201chappy\u201d with his plan. The administration hasn\u2019t taken any action since the initial social media post.",
      "Trump announced a variety of tariffs on nearly every country in the world as part of his so-called reciprocal tariffs in an event dubbed \u201cliberation day.\u201d Trump said it would \u201cforever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America\u2019s destiny was reclaimed and the day that we began to make America wealthy again.\u201d",
      "Those tariffs ranged from a baseline of 10% to a high of 49%.",
      "But on April 9, the day those tariffs were set to go into effect, Trump said he was pausing them until July 2 to have time to negotiate individual trade deals with the more than 90 countries that had reached out to his administration. In the interim, he said, he would put a blanket 10% tariff on nearly all countries.",
      "Since the \"reciprocal\" tariff pause, Trump has announced just one outline of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom.",
      "A trade court ruled Wednesday that Trump exceeded his authority to impose those tariffs. The Trump administration is appealing that ruling, and for now, the tariffs remain in place.",
      "Tariffs against China have been one of Trump\u2019s most consistent threats \u2014 he has accused it repeatedly of \u201cripping off\u201d the United States with unfair trade practices. Trump had ratcheted up his tariffs on China over several months to more than 145% in April, a level that caused businesses to halt shipments coming from China and pause future orders.",
      "But just as the last of the pre-tariff imports from China had arrived in U.S. ports and shipments from China were on track to tumble, Trump said he was lowering the tariffs to 10% for 90 days, giving U.S. and Chinese officials time to begin trade discussions after an initial meeting between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart. Trump left a separate 20% tariff in place related to the country's production of the ingredients in fentanyl.",
      "The trade court ruling Wednesday struck down both the 10% and the 20% fentanyl tariffs, though they remain, for now, while the appeals process continues.",
      "Days after he increased tariffs on China to at least 145%, Trump created a carve-out for iPhones and some other electronics made in China, lowering the tariff rate for them to 20%.",
      "Still, Trump has continued to push for iPhones to be made in the United States, not other lower-cost countries, like India, where Apple has said it is increasingly shifting manufacturing. Trump said last Friday that he would impose a 25% tariff on iPhones and other smartphones, regardless of where they were made, starting at the end of June.",
      "But senior administration officials seemed to walk back Trump\u2019s demands that iPhones be made in the United States, as well as the scope of any potential tariffs. Bessent said it was the chips in the phones, not necessarily the phones themselves, that Trump wanted to see made in the United States.",
      "National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said a few days later that the administration doesn\u2019t want to \u201charm Apple,\u201d and he referred to the move as \u201ca tiny little tariff on them right now, to try to negotiate down the tariffs.\u201d",
      "On Trump\u2019s sixth day back in office, he ignited a trade spat with Colombia that lasted less than 24 hours. Trump threatened Colombia with a 25% tariff after its president barred two U.S. military aircraft carrying migrants from landing in the country. The United States is a major importer of coffee, flowers and produce from Colombia.",
      "Colombia responded with its own 25% tariff on U.S. products. But it soon said it would allow the flights, and the two countries backed down on their trade war threats.",
      "Trump said he would impose steep tariffs on toymaker Mattel \u2014 even if it moves its overseas production out of China \u2014 after its CEO said it was looking to shift more production out of China but didn\u2019t see it moving to the United States.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s OK, let him go, and we\u2019ll put a 100% tariff on his toys, and he won\u2019t sell one toy in the United States, and that\u2019s their biggest market,\u201d Trump said in the Oval Office on May 8. Trump had said children in the United States would simply have fewer dolls if the cost of the toys increased because of tariffs.",
      "Trump has since suggested that the United States is more interested in bringing higher-skilled manufacturing with a national security element to the country rather than lower-cost consumer goods.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not looking to make T-shirts, to be honest. I\u2019m not looking to make socks. We can do that very well in other locations,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cWe are looking to do chips and computers and lots of other things, and tanks and ships.\u201d",
      "Trump announced a 25% tariff on all auto imports effective April 3 that would apply to any vehicle not assembled in the United States, which would account for nearly half of all vehicles sold in the country.",
      "About a month later, he signed an executive order easing some of those tariffs, addressing concerns that they would drive up the cost of cars assembled in the United States with parts imported from other countries.",
      "Trump later said he would reduce tariffs for cars made in the U.K., such as those by Land Rover and Aston Martin, to 10% under a tentative trade agreement between the United States and the U.K. that officials on both sides continue to negotiate."

    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court Thursday temporarily paused rulings by a panel of judges that halted several of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on international trading partners.",
      "The \u201cjudgments and the permanent injunctions entered by the Court of International Trade in these cases are temporarily stayed until further notice,\u201d the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in a brief ruling.",
      "The decision pauses the lower court\u2019s decision until at least June 9, when both sides will have submitted legal arguments about whether the case should remain paused while the appeal proceeds.",
      "An attorney for the plaintiffs, Jeffrey Schwab of the Liberty Justice Center, said in a statement that the ruling is \u201cmerely a procedural step as the court considers the government\u2019s request for a longer stay pending appeal.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are confident the Federal Circuit will ultimately deny the government\u2019s motion,\u201d Schwab said.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told Fox News that \"this is a big victory for the president.\" \"We're very pleased with the ruling,\" he said.",
      "Peter Navarro, the White House senior counsel for trade and manufacturing, predicted the administration would find a way to institute the tariffs even if it's eventually unsuccessful in this case.",
      "\u201cEven if we lose, we will do it another way,\u201d Navarro said, because Trump has multiple options to keep the tariffs in place. He said U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer would lay out how the administration will respond within the next two days.",
      "The judgment Wednesday was from the U.S. Court of International Trade, which typically hears cases that originate from around the country involving tariff classifications, import transactions and customs law issues.",
      "The administration had been trying to have challenges to the tariffs heard in that court, but after the ruling, senior White House adviser Stephen Miller accused the New York City-based court of engaging in a \"judicial coup.\"",
      "In its decision, a panel of three judges \u2014 made up of Reagan, Obama and Trump appointees \u2014 found that the decades-old International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a federal law that Trump cited in many of his executive orders, didn\u2019t \u201cdelegate an unbounded tariff authority to the President.\u201d",
      "Earlier Thursday, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., issued a similar ruling, finding a number of Trump's tariffs \u201cunlawful.\u201d",
      "The decision by U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras, however, affects only a pair of educational toy makers who\u2019d filed suit arguing the president didn't have the authority to impose sanctions and that his shifting tariffs were threatening to sink their small businesses.",
      "Contreras said the main question in the case is whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) \u201cenables the President to unilaterally impose, revoke, pause, reinstate, and adjust tariffs to reorder the global economy. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that it does not.\u201d",
      "He noted that no other president has ever used the IEEPA to impose tariffs and said allowing Trump to do so would mean congressional limitations on his powers \u201cwould be eviscerated if the President could invoke a virtually unrestricted tariffing power.\u201d",
      "Trump has used tariffs and the threat of tariffs to kick-start trade negotiations with scores of countries he has accused of \"ripping off\" the United States with unfair trade practices.",
      "In court filings, the administration had urged Contreras not to block the tariffs, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio saying in a declaration that doing so \u201cwould cause significant and irreparable harm to U.S. foreign policy and national security\u201d because negotiations with trading partners are \u201cin a delicate state.\u201d",
      "\"The Cabinet officials claim that were a court to enjoin the tariffs announced in the Challenged Orders, U.S. trading partners could retaliate against the tariffs.; the U.S. would be embarrassed on the global stage; and the U.S.\u2019s manufacturing position may be so weakened that the country may 'not be able to produce the weapons and other resources necessary to defend itself,'\u201d Contreras wrote in his decision.",
      "He said the \"consequences described by the government officials in their declarations will flow, if at all,\" from the trade court's order Wednesday, not his much narrower one, but he also suggested the administration had only itself to blame.",
      "\"The President cannot act unlawfully and then use the effects of having that action declared unlawful as a putative shield from judicial review,\" he wrote.",
      "The administration is appealing Contreras' ruling, as well."

    "story": [
      "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.",
      "In today\u2019s edition, Jonathan Allen reviews Elon Musk\u2019s stint in the White House as he prepares to leave Washington. Plus, we have the latest on the back-and-forth in the courts over President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff regime.",

      "Elon Musk\u2019s missed opportunity",
      "Elon Musk rocketed out of the Beltway this week having blown a golden opportunity to make bigger, better and more beautiful changes to the way the American people are served by their government.",
      "The megabillionaire misjudged his own popularity and that of his mission, alienated key stakeholders in both parties, overpromised and underdelivered. The shame of it for those who believe in deficit reduction and government efficiency is that Musk might have found more utility in a scalpel than his famous faux chainsaw.",
      "It\u2019s not shocking that someone who is accustomed to making unilateral decisions about corporate strategies, budgets and functions would fail to live up to his own expectations about retrofitting a government in which power is diffuse and the shareholders \u2014 American citizens \u2014 have concerns that go beyond the bottom line.",
      "If voters cared only about profit and loss, the nation would not be $36 trillion in debt, with more deficits lined up on the horizon.",
      "Surely, Musk can claim success in having cut some federal programs, reduced the workforce and canceled contracts. But it\u2019s a drop in the bucket. Even his DOGE website claims only $175 billion in savings \u2014 a far cry from his target of \u201cat least $2 trillion.\u201d And he and his team misrepresented their work over and over and over and over again.",
      "DOGE\u2019s most important legacy may be in catalyzing a modernization of government systems \u2014 though critics have raised concerns about his team\u2019s access to Americans\u2019 personal data. And it remains unclear how various lawsuits against DOGE actions will turn out.",
      "Musk could have come into Washington with the modest promise to make the government run more smoothly at a lower cost to the public. He could have taken bipartisan congressional interest in his plans as an invitation to work with lawmakers \u2014 the people who authorize and fund the executive branch \u2014 to make lasting changes. Instead of reading Donald Trump\u2019s election as a blank check from the citizenry, he could have marketed his plans through a national campaign to build public support.",
      "But Musk chose to see everyone outside his insular group of advisers as an enemy, and he tried to vanquish them all with a shock-and-awe strategy more suited to corporate warfare than governance.",
      "By the time the White House quietly acknowledged his departure Wednesday night, Musk had become a lightning rod in Washington. He emerged as a leading political boogeyman for the Democrats while angering some congressional Republicans by slashing programs they like and forcing them to try to fill the budgetary hole left by his unmet goals.",
      "By one measure, his national approval rating is slightly below 40% \u2014 making him a drag on Trump. Tesla, his car company, has recovered from bottoming out earlier this year, but its stock is still down about 5% for the year. And while SpaceX hasn\u2019t disintegrated without him at the helm full time, some of its projectiles have.",
      "Musk whisked into Washington with a mandate from the man in charge and he\u2019s walking away having failed to achieve it.",
      "A blast from the past: Musk isn\u2019t the first case of one of the world\u2019s richest men taking an influential position in Washington that didn\u2019t quite go as planned. As Scott Bland writes, his story has some key similarities to that of Andrew Mellon, who served as treasury secretary to three GOP presidents in the 1920s and \u201830s.",
      "Whiplash: Appeals court temporarily allows Trump's tariffs to move forward",
      "This time, it was the courts that were responsible for a round of off-again, on-again tariffs.",
      "On Thursday afternoon, an appeals court reversed a federal trade panel\u2019s ruling some 24 hours earlier that struck down a slew of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs targeting other countries, Rob Wile and Steve Kopack report. A second court ruling earlier Thursday by a U.S. district court came to a similar conclusion as the trade court.",
      "By granting the Trump administration\u2019s request for a stay, the appeals court put those tariffs back into effect while it weighs the case.",
      "The trade court\u2019s ruling would have the effect of lowering the U.S.\u2019s average effective tariff rate from 15% to 6.5%, according to Capital Economics consultancy. The ruling did not affect import duties on automobiles, auto parts, and steel and aluminum.",
      "How the markets responded: Markets initially cheered the possible elimination of some import taxes. But by Thursday afternoon, most gains had dwindled. Experts said the courts\u2019 decisions ultimately add another layer of uncertainty to Trump\u2019s trade war effort.",
      "How the White House responded: Trump administration officials said that they were considering alternative ways of reimposing the affected tariffs, but were confident that their original directives would be reinstated.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to see what happens on appeal, and we\u2019re very confident in our success there,\u201d National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett told Fox Business. \u201cBut the fact is that there are things, measures ... that we could start right now.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut we\u2019re not planning to pursue those right now because we\u2019re very, very confident that this really is incorrect,\u201d Hassett added.",

      "Chinese students say they\u2019re questioning their decision to study in the U.S. after Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the federal government will attempt to \u201caggressively\u201d revoke their visas.",
      "Rubio said Wednesday that Chinese students \u201cwith connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields\u201d would be targeted.",
      "Chinese students who spoke to NBC News on Thursday said that they came to the U.S. for freedoms that they felt they did not have back in China but that now the Trump administration is starting to resemble the strict regime they left behind.",
      "\u201cUSA stands for freedom. It stands for democracy. \u2026 That\u2019s why we come here to chase our dreams,\u201d said one Chinese Ph.D. student at a New Jersey university, who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation. \u201cIn China, the government can control education, high schools, colleges, universities. We thought that the USA could be different.\u201d",
      "The State Department referred NBC News to comments by spokesperson Tammy Bruce during a press briefing Thursday in which Bruce said that the department does not discuss the details of its visa process due to privacy concerns.",
      "\u201cWe use every tool that we have to vet and to make sure we know who\u2019s coming in,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cIn this particular case, the United States is putting America first by beginning to revoke visas of Chinese students as warranted.\u201d",
      "The Chinese Embassy referred NBC News to comments made by Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the Foreign Affairs Ministry. Mao harshly criticized Rubio\u2019s announcement Thursday at a regular briefing in Beijing.",
      "\u201cThis politically discriminatory move exposes the hypocrisy of America\u2019s long-proclaimed values of freedom and openness, and will only further damage the United States\u2019 international image and credibility,\u201d Mao said.",
      "Questions swirl around the new directive, including what \u201ccritical fields\u201d the administration will be looking into and what types of connections to the CCP are under scrutiny. But it\u2019s already prompted panic among many Chinese scholars, who make up the second-largest international student group in the U.S.",
      "While a temporary nationwide injunction issued last week blocks the Trump administration from revoking international students\u2019 legal statuses amid its mass termination of records, attorneys say that it may not protect Chinese international students. Jath Shao, a Cleveland-based immigration attorney, said that while the restraining order keeps international students from being arrested or detained, or from losing their legal status, they can still have their visas revoked. Without a visa, Shao said, students can\u2019t return to the U.S. once they\u2019ve left, among a host of other issues.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to get a job or a study ... that means you\u2019re pretty much out of luck,\u201d Shao said. \u201cYou\u2019re stuck here. They\u2019re basically trying to take away all your options.\u201d",
      "Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst with the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, also mentioned that the Trump administration could argue that Chinese students fall under a completely different circumstance compared to those protected by the injunction.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing in various cases that the administration is saying that it\u2019s doing individualized determinations,\u201d Bush-Joseph said. \u201cEven if they\u2019re focusing on a particular nationality, in any given case, they might say this is based on an individual person\u2019s circumstances.\u201d",
      "One Chinese student who\u2019s studying economics at an Ivy League institution said that he felt the tactics used by the Trump administration, including harsh, pointed rhetoric and intimidation, smack of those used by the Chinese government. The student said that it wasn\u2019t uncommon for Beijing to withhold funding for certain political research, much like Trump has threatened Harvard University, or use other methods of repression.",
      "\u201cIn China, we\u2019re all Chinese, so they cannot revoke our citizenship, but they can revoke the student record,\u201d he said. \u201cThat happens when it comes to people involved in political activities.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re just using the CCP to evoke a \u2018Red Scare.\u2019 They don\u2019t really care about ideals,\u201d the economics student said, referring to the historical periods of fear in the U.S. around the potential rise of communism and socialism. \u201cWe just keep joking that it seems like Trump is learning from the Xi Jinping playbook.\u201d",
      "The Ph.D. student said that at this point, he and his peers are considering either moving back to China or another Asian country \u2014 a plan that he said was not in the books before. He mentioned that before coming to America, he envisioned a country that was welcoming of diversity and inclusive of all backgrounds and a place he would put down roots. His thoughts on the U.S. have evolved drastically.",
      "\u201cMy family and my best friends, they had a phone call with me to say, \u2018Hey, I think maybe you should come back. We think that there\u2019s no reason for you to stay in the U.S,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Gisela Perez Kusakawa, executive director of the nonprofit Asian American Scholar Forum, said that the new policy would only serve to harm the U.S. and its own research ambitions.",
      "\u201cWe know that many of our best and brightest talents are prominent scientists that have gone on to develop so many innovations that have changed the daily lives of so many Americans,\u201d she said. \u201cThey started out as international students. They walked these campuses.\u201d",
      "She also noted that it\u2019s likely policymakers are guided by misconceptions around Chinese nationals. While there\u2019s been a longstanding belief that Chinese international students would take intelligence back to China, research shows that most hope to start their lives in America. From 2005 to 2015, 87% of Chinese Ph.D. students said that they intended to stay in the U.S. A separate survey of more than 1,300 Chinese American researchers found that 89% \u201caimed to help advance U.S. leadership in science and technology.\u201d",
      "As disappointing as the Rubio announcement was, Kusakawa underscored that it isn\u2019t necessarily surprising. In March, Republican lawmakers introduced a bill that would halt the issuance of student visas to Chinese nationals looking to study at U.S. universities or take part in exchange programs.",
      "\u201cIn many ways, there was already this existing fear that this could potentially become a reality,\u201d Kusakawa said. \u201cBut perhaps what is surprising is the speed in which it\u2019s happening.\u201d",
      "So far, the announcement has drawn mass criticism from many high-profile Chinese American lawmakers and leaders, including Gary Locke, a former U.S. ambassador to China and the chair of the Chinese American nonprofit Committee of 100, and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.",
      "\u201cThe wholesale revocation of student visas based on national origin \u2014 and without an investigation \u2014 is xenophobic and wrong,\u201d the lawmakers said on social media. \u201cTurning these students away \u2014 many of whom simply wish to learn in a free and democratic society \u2014 is not just shortsighted but a betrayal of our values.\u201d"

      "Sources familiar with the case say NYPD brass learned the detective assigned to protect Adams had provided security at the Prince Street townhouse in the Nolita neighborhood, where crypto businessmen John Woeltz and William Duplessie allegedly tortured and held captive an Italian tourist for 17 days.

      "On May 6, they allegedly lured the man \u2014 whose name has not been released by officials \u2014 to the posh townhouse by threatening to kill his family.",
      "The man said he was then held captive for 17 days, as the two investors tormented him with electrical wires, forced him to smoke from a crack pipe and at one point dangled him from a staircase five stories high.",
      "He eventually agreed to hand over his computer password Friday morning, then managed to flee the home as his captors went to retrieve the device. The victim made it onto the street, bloodied and shoeless, according to police.",

      "Who is John Woeltz?",
      "Authorities believe Woeltz is a big-name cryptocurrency trader from Kentucky with an estimated worth around $100 million; sources said the victim is worth an estimated $30 million. Woeltz had reportedly been renting out the Nolita residence at a monthly rate of at least $30,000.",
      "The six-story pad has an elevator and was described by sources as a \u201chigh-end frat house\u201d with bottles of liquor strewn about and stripper poles in the basement. Neighbors said they could hear loud partying at all hours of the night, but they had no idea of the alleged torture going on within its walls.",
      "Sources told NBC New York that Woeltz and Duplessie roughed up the victim in the past, but not to the same extent. Sources described the relationship among the three as complex, with a \u201cWolf of Wall Street/frat guys gone wild\u201d element to it."

      "\u201cThey were stripped of their dignity,\u201d Guillory said, over \u201ca practice rooted in racism and exploitation. They were people with names. They were people with stories and histories. Some of them had families, mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, human beings.\u201d They were not specimens, she continued, \u201cnot numbers.\u201d",
      "The heads were returned to New Orleans about a week ago after a two-year journey, said Eva Baham, a retired Dillard professor. Representatives from Leipzig contacted the city in 2023 about their existence in Germany, where the university houses a skull collection dating to the 1800s. The school is in the process of repatriating or sending back skulls to their original locations. That initial call set in motion the creation of the Cultural Repatriation Committee, led by Baham.",
      "\u201cWe are not talking about them as if they are skeletal remains,\u201d Baham said at the news conference. \u201cWe want to honor them by calling them the individuals that they are.\u201d",
      "Dillard, one of two historically Black universities in New Orleans, along with Xavier University of Louisiana, welcomed the opportunity to be part of \u201cthis very sensitive acknowledgment of our people, that they are here,\u201d Guillory told NBC News. A visitation will take place Saturday at Dillard\u2019s Lawless Memorial Chapel with a service. Laid to rest will be the remains of Adam Grant, Isaak Bell, Hiram Smith, William Pierson, Henry Williams, John Brown, Hiram Malone, William Roberts, Alice Brown, Prescilla Hatchet, Marie Louise, Mahala, Samuel Prince, John Tolman, Henry Allen, Moses Willis and Henry Anderson.",
      "The two other people could not be identified.",
      "The committee tried in vain for two years to contact descendants of the victims but had no success. They did learn some information, Baham said, and found their names listed in municipal death records almost in succession.",
      "\u201cIn those records list what they died from, how long they had been in New Orleans,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have people who were here in New Orleans from one hour in 1871, one day, a week, two months. And that\u2019s all very important.\u201d",
      "Guillory said the service will be a New Orleans expression of respect.",
      "\u201cWe will do so in the most sacred way that we know how in our beloved city, in a true New Orleans fashion, with a jazz funeral that shows the world that these people mattered,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a very different relationship with death here and a very different relationship with what we believe is the spirit and our ancestors. And now they are home. And so, this is particularly poignant for people in New Orleans.\u201d",
      "When the opportunity arose, there were questions from people in the academic and local community, Guillory said, about why the parties involved would welcome their return. But the city, University Medical Center New Orleans, Dillard University and other entities did not blink.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s certain sensitivity to the material, to the macabre, somber nature of what we\u2019re talking about,\u201d Guillory said. \u201cThere was also a lot of uncertainty about whether we could actually bring them here. Should we bring them here? Who should be responsible for bringing them here? Why bring them back? And I think the committee itself had been very confident and convinced that this was the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "The remains will be stored at the Hurricane Katrina Memorial.",
      "\u201cWe want that day to be not only of remembrance but of reckoning and renewal,\u201d Guillory said, \u201cand may we never forget them.\u201d"

      "When the Arizona Supreme Court handed down its ruling in a pair of arson and DUI cases this month, the announcement on its website wasn\u2019t delivered by a judge or spokesperson, but instead by two AI avatars that are virtually indistinguishable from real people.",
      "Daniel and Victoria are the newest computer-generated faces of the Arizona Supreme Court as part of an effort to innovate how justice is communicated to the public.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s just an efficient way for us to get news out,\u201d Communications Director Alberto Rodriguez said. \u201cIt\u2019s really an opportunity for us to meet the public where they\u2019re consuming their media.\u201d",
      "Rodriguez is the man behind the machine who helped design the voice and appearance of his virtual co-workers. He says the artificial intelligence technology has allowed his team to shrink the production time for a video news release from up to six hours down to a few minutes.",
      "Though the process has become more efficient, Rodriguez isn\u2019t worried about becoming obsolete, pointing out that every upload still requires a human touch.",
      "\u201cAs far as taking the job of a public information officer, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an issue because it still takes manpower,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still have to work with the bench to make sure that we\u2019re getting accurate information.\u201d",
      "Arizona Supreme Court Chief Justice Ann Timmer assures that every word the public hears from the avatars was written by the justices themselves. She hopes the added attention will help improve public confidence in the court.",
      "\u201cFor years, we took it for granted that, \u2018Of course you trust the courts, of course you trust judges.\u2019 We\u2019re doing our best and these are hardworking people,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut if people don\u2019t believe that, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d",
      "While Daniel and Victoria might become the most forward-facing examples of AI in the legal system, Timmer points out that the law profession is already using AI every day to assist with legal research, document reviews and data analysis.",
      "Still, the use of AI in the legal system is not without controversy. One plaintiff in New York tried to use an AI attorney to argue his case before he was shut down by the appeals panel. Across the country, in California, the state bar faced heavy criticism from the legal community after disclosing that some questions on the state\u2019s February exam were written using AI.",
      "As the use of AI in law continues to grow, so do concerns over instances of AI hallucinations and citations of cases that never existed popping up in legal filings.",
      "Timmer maintains that while these concerns are valid, the Arizona Supreme Court knows where to draw the line.",
      "\u201cThis AI, at least that we\u2019re using, is not generative,\u201d Timmer said. If the public is concerned \u201cthat we\u2019ll use AI to start substituting for judgment, I don\u2019t think that will ever happen,\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "LGBTQ people in the U.S. see lower social acceptance for transgender people than those who are lesbian, gay or bisexual, a new Pew Research Center poll found.",
      "Pew found that about 6 in 10 LGBTQ adults said there is \"a great deal\" or \"a fair amount\" of social acceptance in the U.S. for gay and lesbian people. Only about 1 in 10 said the same for nonbinary and transgender people \u2014 and about half said there was \"not much\" or no acceptance at all for transgender people.",
      "Giovonni Santiago, a 39-year-old transgender man and Air Force veteran who lives in Northeast Ohio and was not a participant in the survey, said he feels that acceptance for transgender people has declined in the last few years \u2013 roughly in step with the rise of state laws banning gender-affirming care for transgender minors, regulating which school and public bathrooms transgender people can use and which sports they can play.",
      "He said he's seen acceptance get worse nationally, following the lead of some places that were early adopters of restrictions.",
      "\"They were like the anomaly for ignorance and in hatred, especially towards trans people,\" Santiago said. \"But now we see that it's just kind of sweeping the nation, unfortunately.\"",
      "Still, Santiago said he doesn't fear for his own personal safety \u2014 a contrast with most transgender people, who said they have feared for their safety at some point.",
      "\"I guess I don't feel it as much because I live a life that most people don't know that I'm trans unless I specifically tell them,\" said Santiago, who runs a nonprofit dedicated to supporting transgender youth.",
      "The survey of 3,959 LGBTQ adults was conducted in January, after President Donald Trump was elected but just before he returned to office and set into motion a series of policies that question the existence of transgender people.",
      "On his first day, Trump signed an executive order calling on the government to recognize people as male or female based on the \"biological truth\" of their future cells at conception, rather than accept scientific evidence that gender is a spectrum. Since then, he's begun ousting transgender service members from the military, and tried to bar transgender women and girls from sports competitions for females and block federal funding for gender-affirming care for transgender people under 19, among other orders.",
      "A poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research conducted in May found that about half of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling transgender issues, with a range of views on specific actions.",
      "According to the Pew poll, about two-thirds of LGBTQ adults said the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationally 10 years ago boosted acceptance of same-sex couples \"a lot more\" or \"somewhat more.\" The Supreme Court is expected to rule in coming weeks on a major case regarding transgender people \u2014 deciding whether Tennessee can enforce a ban on gender-affirming care for minors.",
      "Transgender people are less likely than gay or lesbian adults to say they're accepted by all their family members. The majority of LGBTQ said their siblings and friends accepted them, though the rates were slightly higher among gay or lesbian people. About half of gay and lesbian people said their parents did, compared with about one-third of transgender people. Only about 1 in 10 transgender people reported feeling accepted by their extended family, compared with about 3 in 10 gay or lesbian people.",
      "Transgender people are more likely than gay, lesbian or bisexual people to say they feel \"extremely\" or \"very\" connected to a broader LGBTQ+ community and to say that all or most of their friends are also LGBTQ.",
      "Some elements of the experience are similar. About one-third of transgender and lesbian or gay adults said they first felt they might be LGBTQ by the time they were 10 and most did by age 13. About half waited until they were at least 18 to first tell someone.",
      "Aubrey Campos, 41, runs a taco truck near a hub of LGBTQ bars in Fort Worth, Texas, and also serves as a community organizer. She says her parents were supportive when she came out as transgender at about age 12. But the younger trans people she works with often have very different experiences \u2014 including some who were kicked out of their homes.",
      "\"Now the times are a little bit dark,\" she said. \"This is a time that we to come together and make it brighter and make it known that we aren't going to just disappear.\""

The head of a projection mapping startup called Lightform that Amazon acquired is helping lead the group.",
      "While Amazon is expanding this particular corner of its devices group, the company is scaling back other areas of the sprawling devices and services division.",

The job cuts included staffers working on Alexa and Amazon Kids, which develops services for children, as well as Lab126, according to public filings and people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named due to confidentiality. More than 50 employees were laid off at Amazon\u2019s Lab126 facilities in Sunnyvale, according to Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) filings in California.",

    "story": [
      "Nonalcoholic beer is on track to overtake ale as the second-largest beer category by volume worldwide this year, according to a new projections from industry tracker IWSR.",
      "While overall beer volume fell roughly 1% in 2024, volume for its nonalcoholic counterpart grew 9% worldwide, according to IWSR. The category\u2019s growth accelerated in 2018 and has continued to outstrip the broader beer market since then.",
      "IWSR is projecting that no-alcohol beer will grow by 8% annually through 2029, while ale\u2019s volume is expected to slide 2% annually in that same period.",
      "Despite recent growth, no-alcohol beer is far from becoming the top-selling beer category globally and only holds about 2% of worldwide beer market share. With 92% market share, lager is far and away the largest beer category and still growing, albeit at a slower pace than nonalcoholic beer.",
      "No-alcohol beer has gained popularity as more consumers cut back on their alcohol consumption, prompting brewers to invest in zero-proof alternatives. The trend is particularly striking across younger age cohorts; Gen Z drinks less than prior generations at the same age, and millennials hold the largest share of no-alcohol drinkers, according to IWSR. Younger drinkers use buzzwords like \u201csober curious\u201d and \u201cdamp lifestyle\u201d to describe moderating their alcoholic intake, rather than abstaining entirely.",
      "Additional fuel for the trend comes from the companies making nonalcoholic beers, which have gotten better at mimicking the taste of their alcoholic twins. Practically every major beer brand, from Diageo\u2019s Guinness to Heineken and Anheuser-Busch InBev\u2019s Budweiser, has rolled out a zero-proof version over the last five years.",
      "Nonalcoholic beer\u2019s worldwide retail sales surpassed $17 billion in 2023, according to Bernstein. Looking at global markets, Germany, Spain and Japan bought the most nonalcoholic beer that year. The U.S. landed in sixth place for its no-alcohol beer sales, although its ranking falls much further when measured by overall sales penetration.",
      "Much of the growth in the U.S. is fueled by Athletic Brewing, now the top-selling no-alcohol beer brand. The upstart, which was founded in 2018, holds 17% of the category\u2019s volume share, edging out AB InBev\u2019s Bud Zero and Heineken\u2019s 0.0 version. Just three years earlier, Athletic held only a 4% share. The company was reportedly valued at roughly $800 million in its latest funding round in 2024.",
      "Even nonalcoholic beer hasn\u2019t been immune from the rash of celebrity-backed alcohol brands. Actor Tom Holland launched Bero, retired basketball star Dwyane Wade co-founded Budweiser Zero with AB InBev, and podcast host and actor Dax Shepherd created Ted Segers.",

The image offers a glimpse of the couple's first physical interaction since they reported to different prisons in Florida and Kentucky in January 2023 following their convictions related to financial crimes.",

      "\"I respect the love you have for your family, but love doesn\u2019t erase facts,\" one user commented. \"Your parents weren\u2019t wrongfully imprisoned, they were convicted by a jury of falsifying documents, defrauding banks of over $30 million, evading taxes, obstructing justice, and lying to the government while living a lavish lifestyle on TV. That\u2019s not a political vendetta, it\u2019s financial crime. Real families have lost homes, savings, and stability because people like your parents game the system.\"",

      "When the New Yorker reporter asked LuPone what she thought of McDonald earning a record 11th Tony nomination for her role as Rose in the current revival of \u201cGypsy,\u201d LuPone reportedly stared at him \"in silence\" for fifteen seconds.",
      "\"Then she turned to the window and sighed, \u2018What a beautiful day,'\" the reporter wrote.",
      "What did LuPone say about Lewis' video about her noise complaints?",
      "As for the sound problems between the two theaters, LuPone told The New Yorker that she was advised by the stage manager of \u201cThe Roommate\u201d to ask the theater company for help to stop the noise from \u201cHell\u2019s Kitchen\u201d from bleeding through the walls.",
      "When the noise issue was resolved, she said, she sent flowers to thank the company.",
      "\u201cThis is not unusual on Broadway. This happens all the time when walls are shared,\u201d she explained.",
      "While speaking to The New Yorker, LuPone objected to Lewis saying in her video that she was speaking as one theater \u201cveteran\u201d to another.",
      "\u201cHere\u2019s the problem. She calls herself a veteran? Let\u2019s find out how many Broadway shows Kecia Lewis has done, because she doesn\u2019t know what the f--- she\u2019s talking about,\" said LuPone.",
      "How did McDonald respond to LuPone?",
      "McDonald responded to LuPone's comments about the alleged beef between them during an interview with Gayle King that will air on the June 1 edition of \u201cCBS Sunday Mornings.\"",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s a rift between us, I don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d McDonald said in a preview video shared on Instagram.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s something you\u2019d have to ask Patti about. You know, I haven\u2019t seen her in about 11 years just because we\u2019ve been busy just with life. So I don\u2019t know what rift she\u2019s talking about, but you\u2019d have to ask her,\" she added."

    "summary": "98 Degrees speak to TODAY.com about rerecording their hits for their new album, \"Full Circle,\" including how they took inspiration from Taylor Swift.",
    "story": [
      "For nearly 30 years, 98 Degrees have been creating romantic pop and R&B ballads that have stood the test of time.",
      "Whether it was their 1997 debut single, \u201cInvisible Man,\u201d their first major hit, \u201cBecause of You,\u201d or their sultry Spanglish single, \u201cGive Me Just One Night (Una Noche),\u201d Jeff Timmons, Justin Jeffre and brothers Drew and Nick Lachey have stayed true to their boy band\u2019s DNA.",
      "The singers are back with new music and rerecordings of their classics with \u201cFull Circle,\u201d their first non-Christmas album in 12 years. The 11-track record includes five new songs and six rerecordings, including \u201cI Do (Cherish You)\u201d and \u201cThe Hardest Thing.\u201d",
      "The group tells TODAY.com about the importance of reclaiming their catalog and their career by taking ownership of their work, as well at the meticulous process of finding the exact sounds they used in the originals.",
      "When taking a fresh yet faithful approach to their hits, 98 Degrees had one thing in mind: maintaining the original essence of the song.",
      "\u201cWhen you rerecord known songs that we\u2019ve had over the years, I think there\u2019s two approaches, right? You can go for a completely different interpretation of that song, or try and keep it as close to the original as you can \u2014 and that was our goal,\u201d Nick Lachey tells TODAY.com. \u201cIt was to keep it as close to the original.\u201d",
      "However, during the remaking process, they experienced some challenges, including the advancement of technology and their vocals.",
      "\u201cIt was a little harder to rerecord the hits than we thought it would be and to find the right sounds,\u201d Jeffre says, before further explaining the process. \u201cFor instance, some of the sounds, they\u2019re hard to find or to identify (because of the advancement in technology).\u201d",
      "Timmons adds that some of the tools they used back in the day have been re-created in digital versions, \u201cbut they sound a little bit different.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe worked with some really talented young producers that really scoured the internet trying to find those exact sounds,\u201d Timmons says.",
      "The singers also had to factor in the change in their voices from when they were young adults to now. Nick Lachey says his voice is \u201ctotally different\u201d now than it was back in the \u201890s, when he first recorded \u201cInvisible Man.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou change the way you sing it, the lines, the melody, you\u2019ve changed those in concerts over the years,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it\u2019s tricky to go back and actually match, or try and match, what happened 20-some years ago. I think it was actually easier to record the originals than it was to rerecord for that reason.\u201d",
      "The group credits Taylor Swift and Prince as inspiration for the rerecording process and ownership of their music. Swift has famously been rerecording her music after Scooter Braun purchased her former record label, Big Machine Records, in 2019 and became the owner of the master recordings of her first six albums. To reclaim her music catalog, she rerecorded her albums as \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d and included never-released tracks.",
      "Prince also had a careerlong battle with record labels to own his own music and release what and when he wanted.",
      "\u201c(Swift) took control of those masters and the ownership of those. So for us, it was the same situation where we want to take ownership of the songs, but we still want those songs to be accessed for different projects,\u201d Drew Lachey says. \u201cPeople might want the original, but now they have the \u201898 Degrees' Version,\u2019 which we have control of. We can say where it\u2019s used, where it\u2019s not used.\u201d",
      "Nick Lachey adds, \u201cThese songs defined our career, they\u2019re a part of us, and to have the feeling you can\u2019t control your own identity just seems ridiculous. So we jumped at the chance to do this.\u201d",
      "Their goal isn\u2019t to \u201cre-create the wheel\u201d with the \u201c98 Degrees' Version.\u201d Instead, it\u2019s the ability to say \u201cwe own our own music,\u201d Timmons says. \u201cAnd we hope that it inspires other artists to go out there and do the same.\u201d",
      "The group adds that they can change the way they perform the songs and can \u201cflip it a little bit onstage to keep it fresh.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut the fans fell in love with the song sounding a certain way,\u201d Timmons points out. \u201cSo we wanted to keep the integrity intact of those songs the way they were.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "HBO Max's \"The Pitt\" opens on a sleepy Steel City as Dr. Robby Robinavitch (Noah Wyle) makes his way to work at a Pittsburgh emergency room. He's met with a waiting room overflowing with patients and only makes it a couple of feet onto the ER floor before two people bombard him with questions.",
      "\"Is it true? Simi told Hector that Dr. Deranjian said the hospital was up for sale,\" nurse Perlah, played by Amielynn Abellera, says, marking the series' first line of dialogue.",
      "\"They might turn it into an ortho center, with no ER,\" Kristin Villanueva's character, Princess, chimes in.",
      "Robby diplomatically denies the rumors, but Princess and Perlah don't buy it. Still flanking the senior attending physician, Princess asks Perlah in Tagalog, \"Do you believe him?\"",
      "\"I never trust the doctors,\" she responds.",
      "The exchange \u2014\u00a0featuring one of the primary languages spoken in the Philippines \u2014\u00a0takes place less than three minutes into the show, establishing Princess and Perlah as two of the emergency room's most beloved figures. Throughout \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d Abellera and Villanueva\u2019s characters, who make appearances in every episode, provide both comedic relief and constant life-saving assistance to keep the place running.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such an honor. I\u2019m so excited and to be a part of \u2018The Pitt\u2019 where there\u2019s three of us \u2014 there\u2019s three (Filipino women) in the whole main ensemble of the storytelling,\u201d Abellera tells TODAY.com, referring to herself, Villanueva and Isa Briones, who plays Dr. Trinity Santos. \u201cI\u2019m still pinching myself that that\u2019s even happening \u2014 that specifically Filipino stories are being told through these three characters.\u201d",
      "Filipino nurses are a critical part of the nursing workforce in the U.S. While Abellera was raised by a nurse and doctor, she says she didn\u2019t know how much of an impact Filipino nurses had on the American health care system until she was an adult, citing a lack of representation in Hollywood.",
      "\"In a way, that makes me really melancholic of how I didn't have that growing up,\" she says. \"But cut to today, there just seems to be this sort of cultural tectonic shift of Filipino and Filipino American stories and experiences being able to make their way into these mainstream media spaces.\"",
      "In the U.S., 4% of the nursing workforce is made up of Filipinos, despite the demographic only making up 1% of the total U.S. population, according to a 2024 article written for the National Institutes of Health's official newsletter. The prevalence of nurses who are Filipino in the U.S. stems from colonization of the Philippines, per the NIH. Starting in the 1900s, Filipinos could immigrate to the U.S. through their work as nurses, and \"they embedded themselves as an integral part of the American healthcare system,\" the NIH article states.",
      "But despite the prevalence of Filipino nurses in the workforce, in the medical subgenre of TV dramas, they haven't always been represented until recently. \"Grey's Anatomy\" featured a Filipino nurse in the Season 17 finale. The 2024 ER-set mockumentary \"St. Denis Medical\" spotlighted the cool nurses on the floor \u2014\u00a0a \"clique\" of Filipino nurses \u2014\u00a0in its fourth episode, titled, \"Salamat You Too.\" (Salamat means \"thank you\" in Tagalog.)",
      "And then there's \"The Pitt,\" which Abellera and Villaneuva say celebrates the importance of a community that has long been overlooked in Hollywood.",
      "A spotlight on Tagalog",
      "In \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d Princess and Perlah often converse in Tagalog \u2014 occasionally to discuss the other doctors. There's even one scene in Episode 11 where Dr. Santos (Isa Briones) overhears Princess and Perlah's conversation and chimes in in Tagalog, surprising Princess and Perlah.",
      "\"I told you she was Filipina,\" Perlah whispers to Princess after.",
      "Villaneuva says she's \"usually the Isa\" in that kind of situation. She calls filming the scene \"so fun,\" adding that they improvised several takes.",
      "\"It's very gratifying,\" she says. \"And for it to happen towards the later part of the season, it's just brilliant.\"",
      "Abellera says she isn\u2019t a native speaker of Tagalog, but when the show began, she was about five years into lessons in an effort to \u201cembrace this side\u201d of her culture.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re so proud of our language, we\u2019re so proud to meet other Filipinos in our workspaces and out in the community,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd so, for that to be just a part of the storytelling is just an incredible thing.\u201d",
      "Abellera adds that some of Perlah's habits and mannerisms \u2014 from the way she charts to the Post-it notes littering her workspace \u2014 were inspired by watching her parents at work. Abellera\u2019s dad is a doctor, while her mom is a nurse.",
      "\u201cI always got to see my dad interact with patients and with nurses, and then I also got to see my mom interact with her nurse friends and speak Tagalog with them,\u201d she says. \u201cHow it\u2019s just a joyous experience for them to be able to bond over their Tagalog and also bringing food and being able to celebrate their culture in that way.\u201d",
      "More than background characters",
      "In a show that's so serious Abellera won't let her daughter watch it, Princess and Perlah often lighten the mood, from commenting on doctor's love lives to theorizing why two people might be fighting. But Villanueva wants to make it clear that their characters are much more than just a duo gossiping in the background.",
      "Villanueva says she previously told her agent that she wanted to limit the amount of nursing roles she auditioned for as she found the characters were often there in the background to \u201ccheck a box.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want to perpetuate that kind of lack of focus on nurses\u2019 personality,\u201d Villanueva says. \u201cThey have points of view, they have humor, they have feelings. So, I just could feel that there\u2019s a lot more progress that we can do.\u201d",
      "But she says from the moment she got \u201cThe Pitt\u201d casting call, she knew Princess was more than a background character.",
      "The name tipped her off first.",
      "\u201cI saw Princess\u2019 name, like somebody did a lot of research. ... You wouldn\u2019t blink twice if you meet a Filipino that\u2019s named Princess, but to the whole world, it\u2019s kind of like, \u2018Huh, that\u2019s an odd, special name,\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "Villanueva also recalls reviewing a complex description accompanying the character, giving Princess a decided amount of depth.",
      "Princess isn't just a \u201cyes, doctor\u201d figure, Villanueva says. Instead, she was described as a \u201cforce not to messed with.\u201d Other details included that she speaks six languages and has a personality both \u201canimated and spunky\u201d and \u201cwhip smart with a dose of sarcasm.\u201d",
      "Villanueva admits that it was \u201ca little bit scary at first,\u201d knowing that strides toward representation come with a pressure to get it right. But she calls the chance to add to that representation in Hollywood an \u201cabsolute honor.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like getting to play a real-life superhero in scrubs,\u201d she says.",
      "Perlah and Princess are also established leaders in the ER. After charge nurse Dana (Katherine LaNasa) is punched by an unsatisfied patient, Perlah steps in to run the floor, after Princess volunteers on her behalf.",
      "\u201cI think all of us are ready to go whenever Dana needs assistance,\u201d Abellera says.",
      "Much of the inspiration for Abellera's portrayal of Perlah came from her mom, but she adds she had to do a lot of research to understand the character. Abellera grew up Catholic, while Perlah is Muslim.",
      "Perlah is written as a practicing, hijab-wearing Muslim woman, but she isn\u2019t defined by her religion, Abellera says.",
      "\u201cI think that is so important that that\u2019s just her and there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not emphasized in a way that we have to think about it, and it\u2019s not written into any dramatic or funny character storyline. And I think that\u2019s what I love about all the characters and the specific nature of what they represent in the world, because that is exactly what the world is.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe all have different backgrounds, we all have different faiths, we all have different things that are visible or not visible,\u201d she adds. \u201cAnd it doesn\u2019t have to change anything \u2014 like we don\u2019t have to pay attention to it. And I think that\u2019s something that I find the Filipino American Muslim community has really reached out and told me about is that it\u2019s a big deal that it\u2019s not a big deal. You\u2019re just you and you\u2019re just Muslim.\u201d",
      "Fan-favorite status",
      "Villanueva says she\u2019s \u201cvery happy that a lot of Filipino nurses feel very, very seen\u201d by her and Abellera\u2019s characters.",
      "Audiences have also taken note of Princess and Perlah, with viewers on social media swiftly giving them fan-favorite treatment and praising their depiction.",
      "\"princess and perlah remind me of my auntie emmy,\" one X user wrote in part, accompanied by a heart emoji-filled meme and the text, \"i love you.\"",
      "\"They kill me! That\u2019s what makes The Pitt so realistic,\" one Redditor wrote about the duo. \"Filipinas make up a sizeable portion of hospital care but you rarely see them in TV hospital dramas.\"",
      "Another Reddit user pointed out that during a particularly tense scene, when a gun is found strapped to a patient's leg, everyone ducks \u2014 except Perlah, who throws herself over the patient on the gurney in front of her.",
      "\"Not all heroes wear capes, some rock scrubs and a hijab,\" the commenter wrote.",
      "Abellera says that moment wasn't scripted.",
      "\"I just remember hearing the word gun, and I heard the patient actress breathe \u2014 and it was almost this strange, fear, scared whimper \u2014 and I just instinctually jumped on her,\" Abellera says. \"It was not written in the script at all, but I, for whatever reason, I felt the need to protect this person, and as a nurse, that\u2019s all I wanted to do, because she was terrified.\"",
      "She jokes that when she first dove across the patient, it shocked everyone, even herself. But then the room burst into applause, and the director decided to keep it in.",
      "What's next for Princess and Perlah?",
      "As \u201cThe Pitt\u201d only documented one shift in Princess and Perlah\u2019s life, both Abellera and Villaneuva have dreams for how their characters could grow in the show's already renewed Season Two.",
      "Villanueva hopes to showcase more of Princess\u2019s spirit in future episodes and see how she interacts with more of the wide cast of characters.",
      "\"The possibilities are endless, right?\" she says. \"I guess I'd love to see more patient interaction. It would be nice to see how she gets along with the residents \u2014 the new residents that we met last season. That'd be exciting.\"",
      "Abellera says she used small details from the show as well as her imagination to create background for Perlah. She believes that Perlah worked through COVID-19 alongside Dr. Robby, and outside of the hospital, she says her character is a single mom, identifies as queer and grew into her faith and culture as an adult.",
      "\u201cI wish that gets written in. I want that to happen,\u201d Abellera says. \u201cWhatever that means for the story, I would love that.\u201d"

In between shots, she mouths the words to different hits from Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cRenaissance\u201d album and shows off her dance moves before sliding into a booth to chat about Season 7.",
      "So, how will \u201cLove Island USA\u201d attempt to once again catch lightning in a bottle for a new season? Madix, a self-described \u201chuge fan\u201d of the dating franchise, doesn\u2019t hesitate with her answer: \u201cCompletely throw out the playbook from last time.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that if we go into it trying to replicate or trying to re-create, you get stuck in a comparison mindset, and then that never gives you that freedom to be yourself, or to kind of create new moments,\u201d she says.",

That season has led to an upcoming spinoff series \u2014 \u201cLove Island: Beyond the Villa,\u201d arriving later this summer \u2014 which will follow multiple couples from the franchise who are still together, as well as other fan favorites.",
      "Madix, a veteran of reality TV for more than a decade, has not yet met the cast. But she hopes they will be their most authentic selves when the cameras start rolling.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s the magic of why last season was so amazing \u2014 because all of these cast members, everything felt so true to them,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt never felt like they were trying to be anything else that they had seen before. So hopefully this season is the same.\u201d",
      "Before she became a television personality with over 3 million followers across social media platforms, Madix was an aspiring Broadway star. Raised in Melbourne, Florida by mother Tanya Madix and late father James Madix, she spent her childhood being a competitive equestrian and acting in plays. After graduating high school, she attended Flagler College in St. Augustine, Florida and later made her way to New York City, according to Glamour, where she hoped to achieve her dreams. But after hostessing and bartending in the Big Apple for about five years, she relocated across the country to Los Angeles, where she eventually landed a spot on \u201cVanderpump Rules,\u201d a series comprised of people in the service industry.",
      "Madix gained fans during her time on the show, but her amount of supporters grew when viewers watched her overcome a scandal involving a past relationship. Soon, she was competing on Season 32 of \u201cDancing With the Stars,\u201d placing third, and in 2024, it was announced that was taking over as host for Season 6 of \u201cLove Island USA\u201d following actor Sarah Hyland\u2019s departure.",
      "Last season, she prepared for her hosting debut by watching the islanders\u2019 intro videos and reading their bios. Now, she\u2019s looking forward to getting to know the new contestants and predicting who will couple up on Day 1, though she admits to being dead wrong about potential matches last year.",
      "But that\u2019s part of the thrill of hosting, she says. Not knowing what\u2019s going to happen allows her to think on her feet, improvise and have a genuine reaction to the unexpected eliminations.",
      "While the \u201cLove Island USA\u201d producers have surely already chosen the group of OG islanders who will enter the villa and, hopefully, deliver must-see moments (who can forget Rob Rausch\u2019s tearful reaction to Andrea Carmona\u2019s being dumped from the villa last year?) Madix is one of the last people on the team who will meet the contestants.",
      "For these new islanders who are about to wander into the world of television, as a reality veteran herself, she has some advice.",
      "\u201cI think that last year had so many viral sayings, phrases, moments. But if they go into it trying to come up with viral phrases and sayings, it won\u2019t work,\u201d she cautions. \u201cAudiences are very smart, and they can always sense and feel when things are genuine and people are being authentic. That is what\u2019s always going to resonate with people. They can always suss out when people are being a little bit performative.\u201d"

      "Julie Chrisley's sentence was entirely thrown out in June 2024, when judges in the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the judge from the original trial miscalculated her prison term.This vacated her sentence, prompting a lower court to resentence the reality television star.",
      "During the resentencing hearing in September 2024, a judge subsequently declined to reduce Julie Chrisley's prison sentence. Instead, she was resentenced to 84 months (seven years) in prison and five years of supervised release. She was thus expected to be released on April 22, 2028 prior to the pardon."

      "White originally competed on \"Survivor\" Season 37, \"David vs. Goliath,\" which aired in the fall of 2018.",
      "Inspired by the Biblical story, Season 37 split castaways into two tribes: the \u201cDavids,\" or underdogs, and \u201cGoliaths,\" or people perceived as successful in society. White started out in the Goliath tribe due to his success as a screenwriter, known for Hollywood hits like \"School of Rock\" and \"Chuck & Buck.\"",

      "Besides his relatable lines, White was a stellar competitor, proving his love for the game through strong social moves. After initially aiming to appear non-threatening, toward the end of the season, he went on the offensive, organizing multiple blindsides, including the eliminations of Davie Rickenbacker, Gabby Pascuzzi and Hubicki.",
      "White then had to compete in a fire-making challenge to make it to the final three. He successfully beat Kara Kay, winning a spot in the finale, alongside original David tribe member Nick Wilson and fellow Goliath Keeley.",
      "During the Final Tribal Council, White made his case for winning, claiming he purposefully tried to appear weak at the beginning before attacking at the end, while maintaining a strong social game throughout.",
      "However, he did not win Season 37. Wilson won with seven votes, and White came in second after receiving three.",
      "What has Mike White said about his time on 'Survivor'?",
      "Fans of White shouldn't be shocked by his return. After all, he's never been shy about his love for the game, even shouting out the show in one of his Emmy acceptance speeches in 2022.",
      "\u201cI just want to say, I was on 'Survivor,' and on 'Survivor,' the way to stay in the game is you lower your threat level,\u201d he said while accepting the Emmy for writing for a limited or anthology series or movie. \u201cNow, I feel like I\u2019ve raised my threat level. I just want to stay in the game. Awards are great. I love writing. I love doing what I do. Don\u2019t come for me. Don\u2019t vote me off the island, please!\u201d",
      "In 2018, he told IndieWire that he actually begged the \"Survivor\" producers for years for a chance to be on the show.",
      "\"The truth is I was a 'Survivor' fanatic from the beginning,\" he said at the time. \"'The Amazing Race' always looked more fun to me, you\u2019re traveling. 'Survivor,' in a way, is a more fun show to watch, but it looked like it would be more hellish to do. However, after watching around 35 seasons, my philosophy is, don\u2019t just be a spectator \u2014 be a participant. It took a while for me to convince them. But I was down to do it for years.\"",
      "After coming in second, White told Entertainment Weekly that he was \"happy\" with his results. He said that he \"did want to win\" and he \"played to win,\" but during the finale, he realized others may have had better reasons for winning and believed \"it all worked out for the best.\""

      "In her new memoir, \u201cMaybe This Will Save Me,\u201d the actor, 33, recalled how the relationship started. Flynn, one night, hosted the cast of the Netflix show at his place. While others were \u201ccasually drinking,\u201d Dorfman said she opted to smoke a cigarette on the balcony.",
      "\u201cWithin a few puffs, I looked over to find that Brandon had joined me,\u201d Dorfman wrote. \u201cHis boyish tipsy charm was intoxicating, he carried confidence with ease, and his blue eyes sparkled, perhaps this is what people meant when they said star quality. Whatever it was, Brandon embodied it.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 Israel said Thursday it would establish 22 Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, including the legalization of outposts already built without government authorization.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war and the Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. Most of the international community views settlements as illegal and an obstacle to resolving the decades-old conflict.",
      "Defense Minister Israel Katz said the settlement decision \u201cstrengthens our hold on Judea and Samaria,\u201d using the biblical term for the West Bank, \u201canchors our historical right in the Land of Israel, and constitutes a crushing response to Palestinian terrorism.\u201d",
      "He added it was also \u201ca strategic move that prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger Israel.\u201d",
      "Israel has already built well over 100 settlements across the territory that are home to some 500,000 settlers. The settlements range from small hilltop outposts to fully developed communities with apartment blocks, shopping malls, factories and public parks.",
      "The West Bank is home to 3 million Palestinians, who live under Israeli military rule with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers. The settlers have Israeli citizenship.",
      "Israel has accelerated settlement construction in recent years \u2014 long before Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack ignited the war in Gaza \u2014 confining Palestinians to smaller and smaller areas of the West Bank and making the prospect of establishing a viable, independent state even more remote.",
      "During his first term, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration broke with decades of U.S. foreign policy by supporting Israel\u2019s claims to territory seized by force and taking steps to legitimize the settlements. Former President Joe Biden, like most of his predecessors, opposed the settlements but applied little pressure to Israel to curb their growth."

      "Mohammed Sinwar's older brother masterminded the Hamas terror attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, that triggered the war with Israel that has ground on for 600 days. He was later named the militant group's overall leader after Israel killed his predecessor, Ismail Haniyeh, and Hamas military wing leader and fellow Oct. 7 architect Mohammad Deif.",
      "\u201cWe eliminated Mohammad Deif, Haniyeh, Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Sinwar,\u201d Netanyahu said when confirming the death to Israel's parliament, known as the Knesset.",
      "\u201cIn the last two days, we have been in a dramatic turn towards a complete defeat of Hamas,\u201d he added.",
      "Netanyahu has vowed to keep fighting in the Gaza Strip until Hamas is destroyed and until it returns the remaining 58 hostages seized during the Oct. 7 attack, in which 1,200 people were killed.",
      "Nearly 54,000 people, including thousands of children, have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to Palestinian health officials.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s comments came after the Israeli military said in a statement that it had struck \u201cdozens of targets throughout the Gaza strip\u201d over the past 48 hours, including anti-tank missile posts and weapons storage facilities.",
      "Hamas has yet to publicly comment on Mohammed Sinwar, and it was not immediately clear what his death would mean for its leadership.",
      "Reuters reported that Sinwar's close associate Izz al-Din Haddad,  leader of Hamas' northern Gaza armed wing, would most likely step into any power vacuum.",
      "What that means for the ability of Hamas' exiled political leadership council to exert influence over military policy and ceasefire negotiations would only be discernible in the coming weeks.",

      "Thousands of hungry Palestinians flooded the aid center Tuesday and made off with boxes of food before Israeli soldiers fired live rounds into the air to disperse the crowds.",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation facility near the southern city of Rafah is the first of four food distribution sites set up by the U.S.-backed organization and the Israeli military to control the flow of humanitarian aid into the crowded Palestinian territory. Its opening came after Israel began to ease its three-month aid blockade earlier this week."

      "LIVERPOOL, England \u2014 Images of a car plowing into a large crowd of soccer fans celebrating their team's English Premier League title win had barely made it to national newscasts when notorious right-wing voices started to call the incident a \"suspected terrorist attack\" on social media.",
      "The X account of Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster who is well known as the leader of the English far right, retweeted video of the vehicle knocking down people dressed in Liverpool Football Club\u2019s ketchup-red strip, writing that it looked \"very intentional.\" (The posts were labeled \"admin,\" a probable reference to the fact that Robinson did not write them himself since he was in prison at the time.)",
      "Others swiftly followed suit, opining that the driver had been motivated by Islamic extremism.",
      "Within a couple of hours, Merseyside Police released details on a suspect detained at the scene, describing him as a 53-year-old white British male from the Liverpool area. Officials also urged the public \u201cnot to speculate on the circumstances\u201d surrounding the incident. Within five hours, police had described the incident as \u201cisolated\u201d and not being investigated as terrorism-related.",
      "The release of these details by the British police, most notably the suspect\u2019s race, was remarkably fast.",
      "For many, it was a sign of lessons learned after the 2024 Southport stabbing attack, in which the same police force was pilloried for not sharing enough information soon enough and allowing rumors to run rampant. In this vacuum, speculation turned into calls for action, which soon bloomed into racist riots that rocked Britain in the aftermath of the deadly assault that killed three young girls, with more injured.",
      "In Southport, violent riots erupted last summer after false information shared on social media claimed the suspect in the stabbings was a radical Islamist migrant. Police were accused of failing to share accurate information on the suspect quickly enough, allowing rumors to circulate unchallenged.",
      "On Tuesday, Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram praised Merseyside Police for having \u201chandled the situation fantastically\u201d in an interview with Sky News.",

      "\u201cI think that was to dampen down some of the speculation from the far-right that sort of continues on X even as we speak,\u201d he said, adding that it appeared to be a lesson learned as a direct result of what happened after the Southport attack.",
      "In that case, he noted rumors swelled of the suspect being \u201can asylum seeker who arrived on a boat and it was a Muslim extremist \u2014 and that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d",
      "In a news conference Tuesday, Detective Chief Superintendent Karen Jaundrill said the suspect had been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, dangerous driving and driving while unfit through drugs.",
      "Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims separately said police believed the man arrested had been able to follow an ambulance responding to reports of a member of the public having a heart attack, after a road block was temporarily lifted.",
      "More than 50 people were initially taken to or showed up at hospitals for treatment, with children among those hurt. Eleven people remained in the hospital for ongoing treatment, but all appeared to be in \u201cstable condition\u201d and \u201crecovering well,\u201d police said.",
      "Lessons learned",
      "Darrin Hooper, who traveled with his wife from Maidstone, Kent, just over 30 miles southeast of London, to celebrate Liverpool's win, praised the police\u2019s quick response on the scene as well as on social media.",
      "\u201cIt was a good thing that they announced it straight away,\u201d he said  Tuesday as he stood among a crowd gathered on the edges of scene of Monday's incident, which had been cordoned off.",

      "Recalling the grim events of last year in the eastern German city of Magdeburg, in which a 9-year-old child and four adults were killed after a car was driven into a crowd at a Christmas market,  Venket, 39, said she wasn\u2019t surprised to see speculation swirl in the aftermath of Monday\u2019s incident. In that case too, Europe\u2019s far right was quick to tap into fears around the deadly attack.",
      "Venket, who is studying screenwriting, said it was important to allow police to investigate before jumping to conclusions, but, she said, \u201cnowadays, it looks like society is more polarized than ever, every society.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Britain\u2019s King Charles III outlined new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney\u2019s government priorities at the country's Parliament on Tuesday in what is being seen as a show of support in the face of President Donald Trump's threats to annex America's neighbor.",
      "\"Many Canadians are feeling anxious and worried about the drastically changing world around them. Fundamental change is always unsettling,\" he said in the speech, switching between English and French.",
      "The country faces another \"critical moment,\" he said.",
      "\"Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination and freedom are values that Canadians hold dear and one which the government is determined to protect,\" Charles said. \"The system of open global trade that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades, is changing. Canada\u2019s relationships with partners is also changing.\"",
      "Charles said Carney and Trump \"have begun defining a new economic and security relationship,\u201d adding that it was \"rooted in mutual respect and founded on common interests to deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations.\"",
      "Charles, still undergoing cancer treatment, is the nonpartisan head of state in Canada \u2014 a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies \u2014 but he did not write the speech. Instead, he read what was presented to him by Canada\u2019s government in the country\u2019s capital, Ottawa.",
      "Among them was former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who wore green and orange sneakers with his suit.",
      "\"Every time I come to Canada, a little more of Canada seeps into my bloodstream and from there straight to my heart,\" Charles said. \"I\u2019ve always had the greatest admiration for Canada\u2019s unique identity, which is recognized across the world for bravery and sacrifice in defense of national values and for the diversity and kindness of Canadians.\"",
      "Concluding his speech, Charles praised Canada as a \"force for good\" in the world.",
      "\"As the anthem reminds us: The true north is indeed strong and free,\" he said, earning a round of applause from lawmakers.",
      "Before the speech, Charles was taken to the Senate of Canada Building in a horse-drawn carriage with Queen Camilla. There, he received the Royal Salute from the 100-person guard of honor from the 3rd Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment before he entered the chamber.",
      "Charles also met Monday with Carney and Mary Simon, Canada's first Indigenous governor general, who is the king\u2019s representative to the country.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the royal family, and it is rare for the monarch to deliver what is known as the Speech from the Throne. The last time was in 1977, when Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, read it for only the second time in her 70-year reign.",
      "But Carney, who won a party race to become prime minister in March before he secured victory in Canada\u2019s election last month by vowing to stand up Trump, said in a statement Monday that Charles\u2019 visit spoke \u201cto the vitality of our constitutional monarchy and our distinct identity, and to the historic ties that crises only fortify.\u201d",
      "It was a change in tone from earlier this month, when he criticized Britain\u2019s invitation to Trump for a second state visit, saying it undermined his government\u2019s effort to project a united front against Trump\u2019s talk of annexing Canada.",
      "Since he took office in January, Trump has repeatedly said he wants Canada to become the 51st U.S. state, a suggestion that has angered Canadians and left the U.K. trying to tread a fine line between the two North American countries.",
      "Charles has also made a number of symbolic gestures in recent months, wearing Canadian medals, planting a maple tree and referring to himself as the king of Canada.",
      "Even so, Carney this month told British broadcaster Sky News, NBC News\u2019 international partner, that Canadians \u201cweren\u2019t impressed\u201d by Trump\u2019s invitation to the palace.",
      "\u201cIt was at a time when we were being quite clear about the issues around sovereignty,\u201d he said.",
      "Charles will return to the U.K. later Tuesday, after the speech and a visit to Canada\u2019s National War Memorial."

      "Refusing to believe he was a civilian, Ali said they started \u201cbeating me like crazy.\u201d Accusing him of being in the military, he said they \u201cwere just pointing guns at my face, shooting it next to my ears, next to my feet\u201d and threatening to kill him.",
      "Transferred to a nearby gas station that had been turned into a makeshift prison, he said he was hit with \u201cso many hands, so many punches, so many slaps and the kicking and kicking.\u201d",
      "He said he could smell \u201cweed and alcohol\u201d on the breath of the fighters who hit him with pipes and sticks and threatened to shoot him in mock executions. The beatings only stopped at night after other RSF fighters complained about the screaming because they were trying to sleep, Ali added.",
      "After 10 days, Ali said he was allowed to contact his family who provided evidence that he was a civilian. This, he said, led to a complete change in attitude from his captors, who took him somewhere for a shower and gave him new clothes. Over a large meal, he said an RSF member apologized for his mistreatment.",
      "\u201cI was just confused. We\u2019d gone from beating and \u2018We will kill you\u2019 and \u2018We will destroy you\u2019, to \u2018Sorry, we will take care of you,\u2019\u201d Ali said.",
      "After he was released on Oct. 31, he said he immediately sought medical treatment. His hand had to be re-broken so it could heal properly, he added.",
      "Then he fled Sudan for Egypt, where he is waiting to be resettled by the U.N. Asked whether he accepted the RSF\u2019s apology, he said, \u201cAbsolutely not. They ruined my country.\u201d",
      "\u2018We had to find a way out\u2019",
      "Just across the River Nile in the city of Omdurman, Natasha, a British mother of four, said the \u201cbombing became so bad\u201d they had to leave her home where the army had set up positions on the roof. NBC News agreed not to use her last name because she fears for her safety.",
      "With her husband back in the U.K., she said she moved in with her mother-in-law, Asmaa, 70, and over the course of 18 months watched as law and order broke down and armed gangs roamed the neighborhood \u201cstealing from houses and people were getting killed.\u201d",
      "A 12-year-old friend of her son \u201cwas shot by a sniper,\u201d Natasha, 47, tearfully recalled, adding that the bullet \u201cwent through him and it went through his sister.\u201d",
      "His death was the catalyst in her decision to leave her home, she said, adding that electricity and water had begun to cut out and food had become scarce.",
      "With kidnapping common in Sudan, she said she knew her status as a foreigner with white skin made things \u201cvery, very dangerous\u201d for her, so she donned sunglasses and wrapped herself from head to toe before they made their escape in a rickshaw in September.",
      "\u201cI thought: \u2018OK, I might die on my way out. You know, if I don\u2019t do this I\u2019m going to die. I can\u2019t just sit here like this. One of us is going to get shot.\u2019 So it was just a numb feeling,\u201d Natasha said.",
      "She said that her driver cleared RSF checkpoints without stopping, before dropping her off near a military checkpoint.",
      "As they neared, Natasha said soldiers fired above their heads and she quickly waved a piece of white clothing. The shooting stopped and they were allowed across the checkpoint.",
      "\u201cI just remember when my husband\u2019s mum said to me, \u2018That\u2019s it. It\u2019s over. You can take off your shades,\u2019\u201d Natasha said, starting to cry.",
      "After the military regained control of Omdurman, she said she was planning to move to a nicer part of the city and open another kindergarten.",
      "War crimes and hunger",
      "Sudan\u2019s military said Tuesday it had taken full control of the Greater Khartoum region, but the RSF still controls most of the western region of Darfur and some other areas where battles continue to rage.",
      "The fighting has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in Darfur, according to the U.N. and international rights groups. In March the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund reported that armed men have raped hundreds of children, including some as young as 1.",
      "On Thursday, the United States said it would impose sanctions on\u00a0Sudan's government after it determined that Sudan used chemical weapons last year. They will include limits on U.S. exports and government lines of credit, and they will take effect around June 6, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement.",
      "Sudan rejected the move and described the allegations as false in a statement.",
      "Nonetheless, 24.6 million people, or around half the population, face acute hunger, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification \u2014 an organization that sets a scale the United Nations and governments use to assess hunger.",
      "\u201cI did my very best not to leave Sudan, but yeah, the situation just wasn\u2019t really helping,\u201d Ali, the photographer, said. \u201cIt\u2019s not getting better. It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d"

      "HONG KONG \u2014 The sky was apparently not the limit for a Chinese paraglider who climbed to a near record-breaking altitude of more than 28,000 feet Wednesday.",
      "The only problem? He hadn't even intended to fly.",
      "In what acrophobes \u2014 those with a fear of heights \u2014 could only imagine in their worst nightmares, 55-year-old Peng Yujian was just conducting a routine equipment test in the northern province of Gansu when a powerful updraft lifted him off the ground.",
      "\u201cI had just bought a secondhand paragliding harness and wanted to test it. So I was conducting ground parachute shaking,\u201d Peng told state-run broadcaster CCTV News on Wednesday. \u201cThe wind suddenly picked up and lifted me into the air.\u201d",
      "\u201cI tried to land as soon as possible, but I failed,\u201d he added, explaining that he was then carried even higher by a wind and ended up trapped in the cloud system, ascending as high as 5 miles above the ground to heights usually the preserve of commercial airliners.",
      "According to a statement from the Aero Sports Association of Gansu Province, Peng is a licensed paraglider with two years of experience that appeared to come in handy on the video captured by a camera attached to his equipment.",
      "NBC News could not independently verify the footage, released by CCTV, which showed Peng\u2019s face and gear coated in ice as he said: \u201cI can\u2019t get out now. I\u2019m totally lost.\u201d",
      "Peng said he started to panic when he reached the cloud base.",
      "\u201cEverything ahead [was] a vast expanse of whiteness,\u201d he told CCTV, adding that he had no directional awareness without a compass.",
      "Even with a compass, it would have been too difficult to maintain direction because of poor visibility inside the clouds, Peng said. \u201cI thought I was flying straight, but in fact, I kept spinning around.\u201d",
      "Peng said the scariest moment of his ordeal was when his parachute plunged headfirst toward the earth. But he managed to right himself before emerging from the cloud system heading northeast.",
      "\u201cI looked around and thought: \u2018Ah, I\u2019m saved this time!\u201d he said.",
      "In the Aero Sports Association statement, Peng, who was not wearing an oxygen mask, said that he gasped for air after landing and that he might have lost consciousness for about three minutes due to hypoxia and low temperatures.",
      "Peng's adventure almost saw him break the world record, itself also set accidentally in 2007 when a German paraglider was encased in ice after being sucked into a tornadolike thunderstorm in Australia and carried to a height greater than Mount Everest.",
      "Along with another pilot who published the video \u201cwithout permission,\u201d Peng was initially handed a six-month flight suspension, Chinese air sports authorities said.",
      "Under China\u2019s national paragliding regulations, pilots are required to have a valid license issued by the Aero Sports Federation of China, and a flight plan must be approved before any activity. Individuals who violate the rules are penalized based on the seriousness of the incident.",
      "But the ban sparked a backlash on Chinese social media.",
      "\u201cHe barely made it out alive. It\u2019s not like he wanted to fly that high,\u201d one user wrote on the Chinese social media platform Weibo.",
      "While local media reported that the association withdrew the statement the same day, it is unclear whether Peng's suspension is still in place.",
      "Peng said the swelling in his body has \u201cgone down a lot,\u201d but that his hands and face still felt numb.",
      "\u201cMy fear hasn\u2019t completely faded,\u201d Peng told CCTV News. \u201cI still feel uneasy when I think about it now.\u201d",

      "The announcement is the latest move in the Trump administration\u2019s campaign against U.S. universities and international students in particular, after it revoked thousands of students\u2019 visas, detained or deported other students over political activism and sought to bar international students from enrolling at Harvard University.",
      "Rubio said in a statement that visa criteria would also be revised to \u201cenhance scrutiny\u201d of all future visa applications from the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.",

    "summary": "Covid-19 cases are rising again as a new variant begins to circulate in some parts of the world.",
    "story": [
      "A new Covid variant that\u2019s gaining momentum globally has landed in the U.S.",
      "The World Health Organization announced last week that it was monitoring the variant, NB.1.8.1, following a rise in cases in several parts of the world, including Europe, Southeast Asia and North and South America.",
      "The variant appears to be more transmissible than the dominant strain worldwide, LP.8.1, meaning it has the potential to drive up cases this summer.",
      "But it does not seem to be much better than LP.8.1 at evading protection from vaccines or a prior infection. And the WHO has found no evidence that it leads to more severe illness, so the agency has determined that it doesn\u2019t pose an added health risk.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an important one to track, but it doesn\u2019t show any signs so far of being able to drive a large surge in Covid-19 cases \u2014 at least in the U.S.,\u201d said Andrew Pekosz, a virologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.",
      "Federal and state health officials regularly monitor Covid strains to identify potential changes in how the virus behaves and help inform vaccine updates. The strains that have been dominant in the U.S. since late 2021 are versions of the omicron variant and generally produce similar symptoms. NB.1.8.1 is part of that lineage.",
      "Covid vaccines are updated each fall to better match the circulating strains, but eligibility will likely be limited this year to older adults and young people with medical conditions.",
      "Infectious disease doctors said NB.1.8.1 could potentially lead to a small surge of infections for two reasons: The U.S. hasn\u2019t seen a Covid wave in awhile and less than a quarter of adults have received the latest booster, meaning population immunity has likely waned.",
      "\u201cIt may unfortunately come back with a little bit of vengeance on us. Let\u2019s hope that doesn\u2019t happen, but I am concerned that we may be setting ourselves up for that with this combination of factors,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Russo, chief of infectious diseases at the University at Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences.",
      "Covid cases typically rise twice a year \u2014 in the summer and winter \u2014 regardless of what variant is circulating, said Dr. Scott Roberts, associate medical director of infection prevention at the Yale School of Medicine.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to go ahead and guess that it\u2019s going to lead to an uptick in the summer \u2014 probably a mild to moderate one,\u201d he said of NB.1.8.1.",
      "A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there have been fewer than 20 sequences of NB.1.8.1 reported in the U.S. to date. That means the variant is not prevalent enough to appear on the CDC\u2019s dashboard, which lists variants that make up more than 1% of national Covid cases over a two-week period.",
      "The Arizona Department of Health Services said it identified three samples of the variant in late April and early May through routine surveillance. NB.1.8.1 has also been detected in Rhode Island, according to the state\u2019s health department. The Cleveland Clinic said it had detected a few cases in Ohio.",
      "\u201cWhether it gets a foothold in this country and it becomes our new dominant variant or not remains to be seen,\u201d Russo said.",
      "The variant is now dominant in China, where it has spread rapidly since the start of the year. By late April, it made up nearly 11% of genetic sequences submitted to a global virus database called GISAID, up from 2.5% earlier that month.",
      "Meanwhile, LP.8.1 has become less prevalent since mid-April, according to the WHO.",
      "A preprint study, which has not been peer-reviewed, found that NB.1.8.1 had the \u201cpotential for future dominance\u201d over other circulating variants due to additional mutations that could make it more transmissible.",
      "People who haven\u2019t been vaccinated or had Covid in awhile should get a booster now if they\u2019re eligible, Roberts said. NB.1.8.1 is a cousin of JN.1 (the variant targeted by the current booster), so the vaccine should protect against it to some degree.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration has asked drugmakers to update Covid vaccines to target the LP.8.1 variant this fall. Data from Pfizer and Moderna suggest the updated vaccines would offer protection against NB.1.8.1 as well.",
      "But the FDA has said it will limit its approval of updated Covid shots to older adults and younger people with a medical condition that puts them at risk of severe illness.

    "summary": "The Trump administration has emerged as a staunch defender of Alternative for Germany, known as AfD, a party with Nazi echoes that has risen in popularity.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has emerged as a staunch defender of Alternative for Germany, a political party with Nazi echoes that has risen in popularity \u2014 and that German intelligence officials recently classified as a \u201cproven right-wing extremist organization.\u201d",
      "The party is known by its German initialism, AfD, and it has included leaders who have embraced old Nazi slogans and minimized the atrocities of Adolf Hitler and the Holocaust.",
      "Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have criticized the German government\u2019s efforts to isolate and investigate AfD, arguing that such actions amount to undemocratic persecution of a rival political group.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say that a particular set of views is gross ... or somehow outside the Overton window, outside the bounds of reasonable discourse,\u201d Vance said in an interview last week in Rome, where he attended Pope Leo XIV\u2019s inaugural Mass. \u201cI think that it is very, very dangerous to use the neutral institutions of state \u2014 the military, the police forces ... the intel services \u2014 to try to delegitimize another competing political party. I think that\u2019s especially true when that political party just got second in an election and is, depending on which poll you believe, either the [most] popular or the second-most popular party.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, billionaire Elon Musk, a Trump confidant who has wielded significant White House power, has gone further than Vance and Rubio, having campaigned with AfD ahead of elections in February, when the party finished in second place and further established its popularity.",
      "\u201cOnly the AfD can save Germany,\u201d Musk posted on X, his social media site, in December.",
      "The Rubio-led State Department reinforced the Trump administration\u2019s line Tuesday.",
      "In a post on Substack, Samuel Samson, a senior adviser in the department\u2019s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, wrote that the German government \u201chas established elaborate systems to monitor and censor online speech under the guise of combating disinformation and preventing offense.\u201d",
      "Samson specifically cited the recent decision to label AfD as extremist. He also raised concerns about the treatment of far-right parties and leaders in other European countries, including Marine Le Pen, whose recent embezzlement conviction in France could prevent her from running for president in a 2027 race she had been favored to win.",
      "\u201cAmericans are familiar with these tactics. Indeed, a similar strategy of censorship, demonization, and bureaucratic weaponization was utilized against President Trump and his supporters,\u201d Samson wrote. \u201cWhat this reveals is that the global liberal project is not enabling the flourishing of democracy. Rather, it is trampling democracy, and Western heritage along with it, in the name of a decadent governing class afraid of its own people.\u201d",
      "Samson added that \u201cEurope\u2019s democratic backsliding not only impacts European citizens but increasingly affects American security and economic ties, along with the free speech rights of American citizens and companies.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur hope,\u201d he continued, \u201cis that both Europe and the United States can recommit to our Western heritage, and that European nations will end the weaponization of government against those seeking to defend it.\u201d",
      "Vance emphasized similar themes in a speech in February at the Munich Security Conference, where he chastised German leaders for, among other things, refusing to include AfD in the country\u2019s governing coalition despite its electoral gains. While he was in Germany, Vance met with Friedrich Merz, now the chancellor, and with Alice Weidel, a co-chair of the AfD.",
      "An AfD spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. The party has long denied the charge that it is an extremist group, and it sued Germany\u2019s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution over the intelligence agency\u2019s recent classification. A spokesperson for the agency, citing the lawsuit, declined to comment.",
      "During last week\u2019s interview, Vance emphasized that he has not endorsed AfD or encouraged Germans to support it. He described his and Rubio\u2019s advocacy as a matter of democratic principles.",
      "Trump\u2019s first campaign for president in 2016 fed on chants by his supporters to \u201clock her up!\u201d \u2014 a reference to his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, who had not been charged with any crime. More recently, he and his allies accused former President Joe Biden, who beat Trump in his 2020 re-election bid, of weaponizing the Justice Department against Trump and other Republicans.",
      "The Trump administration launched an investigation this month of former FBI Director James Comey, a Trump critic who had shared on social media a photo of seashells arranged to spell out \u201c8647.\u201d",
      "Trump allies interpreted the message as an assassination threat, noting that \u201c86\u201d can be a slang term for getting rid of something and that Trump is the 47th president. Trump\u2019s director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, has called for Comey to be imprisoned over the post. But the number 86 does not always have violent connotations; it\u2019s use in the hospitality industry can refer to removing or refusing service to a customer.",
      "Asked how his and Rubio\u2019s concerns square with such Trump administration actions and rhetoric, Vance argued that there is a \u201creasonable\u201d question about whether Comey had advocated for Trump\u2019s assassination.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a pretty big believer in free speech,\u201d Vance said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that saying you should kill Donald Trump is an acceptable part of public debate. Everybody\u2019s going to draw their line. I think where I draw the line is encouraging violence against political opponents. If there\u2019s a determination that Comey encouraged violence against a political opponent, then that\u2019s a problem. And if there\u2019s a determination that he didn\u2019t, then that\u2019s a different question.\u201d",
      "While Vance has not endorsed AfD, he described a pro-AfD piece Musk wrote in December as \u201cinteresting.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlso interesting; American media slanders AfD as Nazi-lite,\u201d Vance wrote in his Jan. 2 social media post that called attention to Musk\u2019s piece. \u201cBut AfD is most popular in the same areas of Germany that were most resistant to the Nazis.\u201d",
      "AfD was founded in 2013, its early messaging geared toward anti-European Union voters. In subsequent years, the party became known for its strident anti-immigrant rhetoric. In 2017, an AfD ad criticized as Islamophobic asked: \u201cBurkas? We prefer bikinis.\u201d Another, featuring the image of a pregnant woman, asked: \u201cNew Germans? We\u2019ll make them ourselves.\u201d",
      "The party has grown in popularity, coinciding with a rise of right-wing voter sentiment across the United States and Europe. Last year, AfD became the first far-right party to win a state election in Germany since the Nazis.",
      "Meanwhile, links and comparisons between AfD and the Nazis have been inescapable.",
      "At an AfD rally in 2017, attendees chanted that they would \u201cbuild a subway\u201d to Auschwitz for their political opponents. A founding AfD member, Alexander Gauland, once described the Nazi era as a mere \u201cspeck\u201d of bird excrement in German history. A party leader, Bj\u00f6rne H\u00f6cke, has twice been found guilty by a German court of purposefully employing Nazi rhetoric. (He has appealed the rulings.) Another AfD politician, Maximilian Krah, resigned his party leadership post under pressure and suspended campaign activities last year after he said the SS, the Nazis\u2019 main paramilitary force, were \u201cnot all criminals.\u201d",
      "When Musk appeared virtually at an AfD campaign event in January, he leaned into a talking point consistent with the party\u2019s desire to move beyond the guilt over Nazi-era atrocities, lamenting that \u201cthere is too much focus on past guilt.\u201d The same week, Musk faced criticism after he offered a gesture many found similar to a Nazi salute at a Trump rally in Washington.",
      "In its designation of AfD as an extremist organization on May 2, the German intelligence agency asserted that the party \u201caims to exclude certain population groups from equal participation in society.\u201d AfD also does not consider German nationals with histories of migration from Muslim countries as equal to German people, the agency added at the time.",
      "The report drew a quick rebuke from Rubio, who is also Trump\u2019s national security adviser.",
      "\u201cGermany just gave its spy agency new powers to surveil the opposition,\u201d Rubio wrote on X. \u201cThat\u2019s not democracy \u2014 it\u2019s tyranny in disguise.\u201d",
      "Vance then piggybacked on Rubio\u2019s post with a Cold War analogy.",
      "\u201cThe AfD is the most popular party in Germany, and by far the most representative of East Germany. Now the bureaucrats try to destroy it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe West tore down the Berlin Wall together. And it has been rebuilt \u2014 not by the Soviets or the Russians, but by the German establishment.\u201d",
      "Vance contended in last week\u2019s interview that holding down a rival political party because of its beliefs allows its beliefs to \u201ctake on an almost mystical power\u201d by removing them from the public dialogue.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t like Nazism, and I don\u2019t like people who are sympathetic with Nazis,\u201d Vance said. \u201cBut I think the way to beat back against it is to debate it and defeat it and not believe that you can, kind of, like, bury this thing underground, because you can\u2019t.\u201d"

      "Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, the former surgeon at the center of France\u2019s largest child sexual abuse case, was handed a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison Wednesday as his three-month-long trial reached its end.",
      "French courts convicted Le Scouarnec, 74, of sexually assaulting 299 victims over three decades, most of them girls and boys whose average age was 11. Many were assaulted while they were under the effects of anesthesia or recovering from surgery, prosecutors said.",
      "Himself a father of three, Le Scouarnec confessed to committing \u201chideous acts\u201d during the trial in the northwestern town of Vannes in the region of Brittany, where he admitted to all of the charges.",
      "\u201cI am not asking the court for leniency,\u201d Le Scouarnec said in his closing statement, adding, \u201cSimply grant me the right to become a better person.\u201d",
      "His sentence will run concurrently with the 15 years he is serving after he was found guilty in 2020 of raping a young neighbor and three others when they were children.",
      "The court said Le Scouarnec's sentence cannot be adjusted until he has served two-thirds of it, in order to prevent recidivism, according to the French newspaper Le Monde. The judges also followed the public prosecutor\u2019s recommendations about the sentence.",
      "After lawyers for some of the victims complained that he could be released by 2030 if his pretrial detention and parole eligibility were taken into account, the prosecution made a rare request that he be held in a treatment center under supervision even after his release. It was not clear whether the court granted the request.",
      "Hundreds of witnesses testified at the trial, including Le Scouarnec\u2019s niece and a family friend. Now in their 40s, both said he assaulted them in the early 1980s. However, French law did not allow him to be prosecuted for their alleged abuse because it happened too long ago.",
      "Many victims have said they do not remember being assaulted, but police were able to build a case against Le Scouarnec because he meticulously cataloged his abuse in digital diaries.",
      "In France it is illegal for an adult to have sex with a minor under age 15, though child advocates say many adults are never charged.",
      "The case has put a spotlight on the French medical system, which allowed Le Scouarnec, a once-respected local doctor, to continue working despite many warning signs, including a 2005 conviction for possessing images depicting child abuse.",
      "Lawyers for some of the victims said Le Scouarnec should have been stripped of his medical privileges after that case. Instead, he worked across nine public hospitals and private clinics in five regions of France, where he specialized in appendectomies, abdominal and gynecological surgery.",
      "Victims\u2019 advocates also hope the case will prompt a hard look at what they call the lax pursuit of child abuse allegations, particularly when doctors \u2014 who are in short supply in many areas \u2014 are accused of misconduct.",
      "\u201cThere were warnings over 30 years,\u201d Francesca Satta, a lawyer who represented 10 victims and families, said previously, adding, \u201cThis man benefited from a system that opened the door for him to have his own hunting ground.\u201d",
      "During the trial, many victims watched the proceedings through a video link in a 450-seat auditorium, a short walk from the courthouse, which was too small to cope with the number of people who wanted to watch the case unfold. Two other transmission rooms in a former law school broadcast the trial to the media and spectators."

      "Researchers in Spain say they have found evidence that Neanderthals were capable of creating art \u2014 challenging the idea that art began with the modern humans who succeeded them.",
      "The canvas was a quartz-rich granite pebble that was excavated from a rock shelter in central Spain in 2022, in a layer dating back 42,000 to 43,000 years. Measuring more than 8 inches long, the pebble has curves and indentations that make it resemble a human face.",
      "In the middle of its surface is a single red dot, right where a nose would be, researchers said in a study published Saturday in the journal Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences, adding that it appeared to be a nonutilitarian object rather than a tool.",
      "\u201cFrom the outset we could tell it was peculiar,\u201d said David \u00c1lvarez-Alonso, lead author of the paper.",
      "Analysis showed that the red dot consisted of ocher, a natural earth pigment. The next step was to determine how it got there.",
      "While not visible to the naked eye, the red dot was confirmed by Spanish forensic police to be a fingerprint, leaving \u201cno doubt\u201d that it was applied to the stone intentionally by a finger dipped in ocher, \u00c1lvarez-Alonso, an archaeologist at Complutense University in Madrid, said in an email Tuesday.",
      "The researchers postulate that the Neanderthal, who, based on the fingerprint, was possibly an adult male, perceived the pebble as resembling a face \u2014 a psychological phenomenon known as pareidolia \u2014 and was inspired to complete the depiction, creating \u201cone of the oldest known abstractions of a human face in the prehistoric record.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt would be a clear act of symbolization \u2014 apparently very simple, yet meaningful,\u201d \u00c1lvarez-Alonso said.",
      "The discovery is \u201cdoubly exceptional\u201d since it\u2019s the \u201cmost complete\u201d Neanderthal fingerprint identified to date, apart from a partial one previously found in Germany, the researchers said.",
      "Neanderthals, a distinct species that went extinct around 40,000 years ago, lived alongside early modern humans in Europe, Asia and the Middle East for at least part of their existence. Characterized by a large nose and relatively short and stocky bodies, the species is very closely related to humans, or Homo sapiens.",
      "The remains of Neanderthals do not show clear evidence of lower intelligence than modern humans, some scientists have argued.",
      "The stone is \u201cone of a small but growing number of discoveries that point to the existence of symbolic behavior among Neanderthals,\u201d \u00c1lvarez-Alonso said.",
      "However, it\u2019s \u201cclearly an isolated object, with no known parallels\u201d that can be used for comparison, he added.",
      "\u201cWe should not try to draw direct analogies between the Neanderthal and sapiens worlds,\u201d \u00c1lvarez-Alonso said, as Neanderthals did not create a visual symbolic system as complex and diverse as the one developed by Homo sapiens.",
      "\u201cThis pebble doesn\u2019t solve the mystery, but it offers one more clue suggesting the presence of a complex mind \u2014 one capable of producing symbols,\u201d he said."
