      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Fifty seasons of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d sketches, songs and special guests will be celebrated Sunday as the variety show celebrates its landmark anniversary.",
      "The pop culture juggernaut has launched the careers of generations of comedians, from Bill Murray to Eddie Murphy and Tina Fey to Kristen Wiig.",
      "Many of those stars will be on hand for \u201cSNL50: The Anniversary Celebration,\u201d airing live from New York on Sunday beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern and 5 p.m. Pacific.",
      "The three-hour extravaganza comes after months of celebrations of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d which premiered Oct. 11, 1975, with an original cast that included John Belushi, Chevy Chase and Gilda Radner.",
      "It\u2019s become appointment television over the years as the show has skewered presidents, politics and pop culture and been a platform for the biggest musical stars of the moment. As streaming has altered television viewing, \u201cSNL\u201d sketches, host monologues and short comedy films remain popular on social media and routinely rack up millions of views on YouTube.",
      "Each \u201cSNL\u201d episode holds at least some surprises, and Sunday\u2019s special is no different. While NBC has revealed some of the stars who are expected to appear, many of the special's moments, cameos and music performances remain a surprise.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know ahead of \u201cSNL50: The Anniversary Celebration.\u201d",
      "NBC will air \u201cSNL50: The Anniversary Celebration\u201d on Sunday beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern and 5 p.m. Pacific. The anniversary show will also stream on Peacock.",

Current cast member Kenan Thompson\u2019s appearance was also touted.",
      "Some members of the first \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d cast, known as the Not Ready for Prime Time Players, will appear, including Chase, Laraine Newman, Garrett Morris and Jane Curtin. A publicist for Dan Aykroyd, the lone remaining surviving member, did not respond to a request for comment on whether he would attend.",
      "Steve Martin, who has left an indelible comedic mark on \u201cSNL\u201d over the years, will be among the many successful hosts returning for the show\u2019s 50th celebration.",
      "Other prolific and returning hosts range from actors like Tom Hanks, Martin Short and Scarlett Johansson (who is married to current \u201cSNL\u201d cast member Colin Jost) to athletes like Peyton Manning. Former \u201cSNL\u201d writer John Mulaney will appear, as will Adam Driver, Ayo Edebiri, Kim Kardashian, Paul Simon, Pedro Pascal, Quinta Brunson, Robert De Niro and Woody Harrelson.",

      "Sunday\u2019s special will include appearances by Paul McCartney, Sabrina Carpenter, Bad Bunny, Cyrus and other music stars, though the show hasn\u2019t said whether all will perform. McCartney has used New York\u2019s Bowery Ballroom as a warm-up spot, hosting three surprise shows this week.",
      "The musical legacy of \u201cSNL\u201d is also explored in the documentary \u201cLadies and Gentlemen ... 50 Years of SNL Music,\u201d from the Oscar-winning Questlove. It\u2019s currently streaming on Peacock.",

I wanted to write that!\u2019\" King said in a statement issued through HarperCollins.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The Golden State Warriors are known for their electrifying plays and superstar Stephen Curry, but now the team is pioneering a fresh gameplan: blending sports and entertainment in a way no NBA franchise has before.",
      "As the first and only NBA team with its own record label, Golden State Entertainment, the Warriors are expanding their reach with \u201cFor the Soil,\u201d a new album released this week. The project featuring the Bay Area\u2019s top music artists \u2014 from E-40, Too Short, Saweetie, G-Eazy, Goapele, LaRussell and Larry June \u2014 arrives just in time for the league's All-Star Game weekend in San Francisco.",
      "\u201cA basketball team with a record label is unheard of until now, which is a testament to the Warriors and the Bay,\u201d said P-Lo, a Filipino-American rapper who produced \u201cFor the Soil,\u201d a collaborative release between Golden State Entertainment and EMPIRE, a distribution and publishing company. He will perform live during an NBA All-Star tipoff party on Thursday at Thrive City, a 11-acre community gathering space surrounding the Chase Center.",
      "\u201cThis is about innovation, bringing a new idea to the table,\u201d said P-Lo, a lifelong Warriors fan who has worked with artists such as Yo Gotti, Saweetie and Kehlani. He's no stranger to the franchise, riding his convertible car as part of the Warriors championship parade, celebrating the team's title in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe're here to break barriers while I'm trying to process it all,\" he added. \"I'm grateful for this opportunity.\u201d",

I know there\u2019s a lot of talented Bay Area artists behind it, so it\u2019s something to look forward to and be excited about.\u201d",
      "P-Lo played a key role in bringing together the Bay Area\u2019s top artists, contributing to all nine tracks on the album. He began the process late last summer, collaborating with local talent to craft a well-rounded project.",
      "\u201cP-Lo can produce, rap and bring all these artists who are like family to him,\u201d said David Kelly, an executive with the Warriors. He spearheaded the launch of Golden State Entertainment in 2022 before the team won the championship that year.",
      "Several NBA teams have partnered with artists over the years: Drake as the Toronto Raptors\u2019 global ambassador, Jay-Z as a former minority owner of the Brooklyn Nets, and the Miami Heat collaborating with DJ Khaled, who performed at games. The Atlanta Hawks have also embraced their city\u2019s rap scene, working with T.I., 2 Chainz, and Quavo.",
      "But an NBA team with its own record label and entertainment division? That\u2019s where Kelly saw an opportunity for the Warriors to break new ground. He said creating a label, intersecting hip-hop and basketball made sense.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just kind of authentic and natural to the culture,\u201d said Kelly, who joined the organization in 2011 and currently is the chief business officer of Golden State Entertainment. \u201cIt seems like a lot of times people try to force them apart or mesh them together that don\u2019t make sense. But if you grew up a part of both, they naturally intertwine.\u201d",
      "Kelly first pitched the idea of the Warriors having a record label to then-president Rick Welts before bringing it to the team\u2019s owner, Joe Lacob, and co-executive chairman Peter Guber. He said the Warriors' leadership embraced his vision, and he hopes more pro teams will follow suit.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s seeing the culture being presented in a way that\u2019s true and reflective on a grand international scale,\u201d said Kelly, a former Chicago-based rapper, whose stage name was Capital D. \u201cHopefully this is the first of many for Golden State and the culture.\u201d",

      "Lawyers will give their closing arguments at the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky, who is accused of two felony counts of assault with a semi-automatic firearm",
      "LOS ANGELES -- There's one essential difference between arguments at rapper A$AP Rocky 's trial: Prosecutors will say Thursday that the hip-hop star fired two shots at a former friend from a handgun, while defense lawyers will say he fired blanks from a gun that wasn't real.",
      "Jurors should begin deliberations by the afternoon on two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm for the 2021 shooting. If they convict Rocky of both, he could get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "The Grammy-nominated music star, fashion mogul and actor is the longtime partner of singing superstar Rihanna, with whom he has two toddler sons. She may appear in court for closing arguments after showing up sporadically \u2014 most recently last week, when they left the courthouse together for the first time, walking arm-in-arm.",
      "Testimony at the trial ended Tuesday, when Rocky and his lawyers told a judge he would not take the stand.",
      "The prosecution's case rests largely on the credibility of the man Rocky is alleged to have fired on. A$AP Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron, became friends with Rocky, born Rakim Mayers, in high school in New York, where both were members of a crew of creative types called the A$AP Mob.",
      "Their friendship continued after Rocky first gained global fame with a pair of No. 1 albums in 2012 and 2013, but by Nov. 6, 2021 their bond had become a beef.",
      "They met up outside a Hollywood hotel, and scuffled as soon as they saw each other. In a second confrontation moments later, Rocky fired the shots. Relli said his knuckles were grazed by one of them. The fights were partially captured on surveillance videos that are not clear enough for easy interpretation.",
      "A$AP Twelvyy, another member of the crew who was with Rocky, testified that Relli had been the aggressor, and that Rocky fired the shots as a warning to stop him from attacking another member of their crew.",
      "Twelvyy testified that Rocky fired blanks from a starter pistol that the rapper had been carrying for security since a music video shoot months earlier, and that everyone involved in the incident knew it. Rocky's tour manager also testified that he carried the phony gun.",
      "Neither gun was found or presented as evidence.",
      "Police who searched the area after a report of a shooting found no physical evidence, but Relli himself went to a police department two days later with two shell casings he said he'd picked up after returning to the scene.",
      "In closing arguments, the defense will contend that video evidence and text messages can't be trusted, nor can Relli. He also filed a civil suit in the case, and Rocky's attorneys will cast him as a jealous opportunist out for the money of a former friend who became famous. Relli vowed to do just that in text messages and in phone calls recorded by a mutual friend who gave the recordings to Rocky. Relli said in his testimony that the calls were faked.",
      "The prosecution will argue that Relli is justly seeking money after a genuine wrong was done to him. They point out that Relli's communications around the incident tell a consistent story \u2014 and never does he mention making anything up or knowing Rocky carried a prop gun. Prosecutors are likely to argue that the whole idea of the starter pistol \u2014 which only fires blanks \u2014 is a preposterous lie coordinated by Rocky's inner circle.",
      "In one of a series of arguments between lawyers that grew so nasty and personal during the trial that the judge began threatening fines, Deputy District Attorney John Lewin called the prop gun argument \u201cgarbage.\u201d",

      "Onlookers stare and point. Drivers pull over for better looks, snapping pictures, recording videos and trying to line up the perfect selfie. For some, it\u2019s nostalgic. For others, it\u2019s a glimpse at a larger-than-life advertising icon.",
      "At 100 years old, the blimp is an ageless star in the sky. And the 246-foot-long airship will be in the background of the Daytona 500 on Sunday \u2014 roughly 1,500 feet above Daytona International Speedway, actually \u2014 to celebrate its latest and greatest anniversary tour.",
      "Even though remote camera technologies \u2014 drones, mostly \u2014 are improving regularly and changing the landscape of aerial footage, the blimp continues to carve out a niche. At Daytona, with the usual 40-car field racing around a 2\u00bd-mile superspeedway, views from the blimp aptly provide the scope of the event.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great to show the pack racing,\u201d Fox Sports director Artie Kempner said, adding that he expected to use aerial shots from the blimp about 50 times during Sunday\u2019s race.",
      "The Goodyear Blimp has been a regular at major sporting events since flying above the 1955 Rose Bowl. A few years later, it became a service vehicle for television coverage while simultaneously functioning as a highly visible advertising platform. It\u2019s been at every Daytona 500 since 1962.",
      "During that streak, blimps have undergone wholesale changes and improved dramatically: steering technology, safety innovations, high-definition cameras, gyro-stabilized aerial views and much quieter rides thanks to relocated engines and propellers.",
      "Nowadays, riding on the blimp isn\u2019t much different from traveling on a small plane. The 12-seater comes with reclining seats, tray tables, seatbelts, a safety briefing and a bathroom with amazing views. A few windows serve as the only air conditioning onboard. The blimp offers a smooth ride even at top speed, creeping along at 73 mph \u2014 well below the cars pushing 200 mph on the track.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an iconic symbol for our nation, a floating piece of Americana,\u201d blimp pilot Jensen Kervern said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like it in the world.\u201d",
      "The blimp has covered more than 2,500 events and taken more than 500,000 passengers for rides, according to Goodyear. Former President Ronald Reagan might be the most famous passenger, and rapper Ice Cube raised the blimp\u2019s street cred when he included a line about it in his 1992 song titled \u201cIt Was A Good Day.\u201d",
      "But not just anyone can climb aboard. Rides are invitation only even though phones at blimp headquarters \u2014 the three U.S.-based airships are housed in California, Florida and Ohio \u2014 ring off the hook with people inquiring about buying a ride.",
      "As part of the blimp\u2019s 100-year anniversary celebration, however, Goodyear is giving three U.S. residents a chance to join the exclusive club and win a ride. The sweepstakes will provide each winner a certificate for two to fly on the blimp. The prize also includes $3,000 for travel expenses to one of Goodyear\u2019s airship hangars.",
      "It would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, no doubt.",
      "The blimp flies low enough to spot pods of dolphins or flotillas of sea turtles in the Atlantic Ocean. The view over Daytona International Speedway is equally stunning, with the ability to see every inch of the famed track while watching (and hearing) race cars turning laps.",
      "Already in 2025, the Goodyear fleet has flown over the Rose Bowl, the Orange Bowl, the Pro Bowl and Pebble Beach. Its upcoming schedule includes the Academy Awards, Coachella and WrestleMania.",
      "But will the blimp survive another 100 years?",
      "Drone imagery and resolution continue to improve along with maneuverability, stability and flight longevity. And where drones can be flown by one person, the Goodyear Blimp crew at Daytona tops 20 staffers.",
      "But given the blimp\u2019s longevity, adaptability and celebrity, no one should bet against it sticking around for generations to come.",
      "\u201cDespite changes in technology and our environment, people still get so excited to see the blimp,\" Kervern said. \u201cIt's just an iconic symbol for our nation.\u201d",

      "The discovery of hundreds of unmarked graves at an Indian residential school in Canada in 2021 was just the catalyst for \u201cSugarcane.\"",
      "The discovery of hundreds of unmarked graves at an Indian residential school in Canada in 2021 was just the catalyst for \u201cSugarcane.\u201d",
      "Julian Brave NoiseCat and Emily Kassie, the filmmakers behind the Oscar-nominated documentary, spent years investigating the truth behind just one of the institutions. \u201cSugarcane,\u201d now streaming on Hulu, paints a horrifying picture of the systemic abuses inflicted by the state-funded school and exposes for the first time a pattern of infanticide and babies born to Indigenous girls and fathered by priests.",
      "In the year since it debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, \u201cSugarcane\u201d has screened at the White House, for Canadian Parliament and for over a dozen indigenous communities in North America, sparking a grassroots movement and reckoning to find the truth about the other schools. It also marks the first time that an Indigenous North American filmmaker has received an Oscar nomination.",
      "From the 19th century until the 1970s, more than 150,000 First Nations children were required to attend state-funded Christian schools as part of a program to assimilate them into Canadian society. They were forced to convert to Christianity and not allowed to speak their native languages. Many were beaten and verbally abused, and up to 6,000 are said to have died. Nearly three-quarters of the 130 residential schools were run by Roman Catholic missionary congregations",
      "Canada\u2019s residential schools were based on similar facilities in the United States, where Catholic and Protestant denominations operated more than 150 boarding schools between the 19th and 20th centuries, according to researchers, that also were home to rampant abuse.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too often that we look everywhere else in the world to horrors and abuses happening, and that\u2019s important, but Native issues are rarely the issue of the day, and we believe that they deserve to be,\u201d Kassie said. \u201cThis story is the genocide that happened across North America, and we\u2019ve never grappled with it. Native people have rarely been the focal point of that kind of countrywide dialogue. We hope that \u2019Sugarcane\u201d helps to change that.\u201d",
      "As an investigative journalist and documentarian, Kassie had spent a decade making films about human rights abuses all over the world, from Afghanistan to Niger, but she\u2019d never turned her lens to her own country. When the news broke about the unmarked graves, she felt drawn to the story and reached out to NoiseCat to see if he\u2019d want to help. They became friends as cub reporters in New York who just happened to share neighboring desks.",
      "\u201cIn the years since, Julian had gone on to become an incredible writer and thinker and journalist focusing on indigenous life in North America. It felt like the natural fit,\u201d she said.",
      "While he was mulling it over, she went looking for a group to focus on and landed on St. Joseph\u2019s Mission near the Sugarcane Reservation of Williams Lake in British Columbia. Unbeknownst to her, that was the school NoiseCat's family attended. He\u2019d heard stories about his father being born nearby and found in a dumpster. Over the course of making the film they\u2019d discover that he was actually born in a dormitory and found in the school\u2019s incinerator.",
      "\u201cIt was a process for me to ultimately decide to tell the story in a personal and familial way,\u201d said NoiseCat, who during the making of the film lived with his father for the first time since he was around 6 years old.",
      "\u201cIt became very clear that he had these unaddressed questions from his birth and upbringing, and that I was in a position to help him ask those questions and in so doing, to address some of my own enduring pains and complications from his abandonment of me,\u201d NoiseCat said. \u201cThe big thing, though, was going to the Vatican with the late Chief Rick Gilbert and witnessing his incredible bravery.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve just been incredibly fortunate that this film has had real impact,\u201d NoiseCat said. \u201cI was really scared that telling such a personal and sometimes painful story might be a harmful thing. But really, thankfully, it\u2019s been a healing thing, not just for my family and our participants, but for Indian Country more broadly.\u201d",
      "Over the last year as the film has played at various festivals and for Indigenous communities on reservations, Kassie said that more survivors have been coming forward with their stories.",
      "In October, former President Joe Biden also formally apologized to Native Americans for the \u201csin\u201d of a government-run boarding school system that for decades forcibly separated children from their parents, calling it a \u201cblot on American history.\"",
      "\u201cThis is the origin story of North America,\u201d Kassie said. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of how the land was taken by separating six generations of kids, indigenous kids from their families... (and) most people don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Kassie noted that while \u201cSugarcane\u201d is inspiring conversations within communities, it comes at a political moment where governments are not actively supporting continued investigation and accountability.",
      "In a film industry with deep roots in the Western genre and problematic, racist depictions of Native Americans as impediments to westward expansion, authentic representation of indigenous stories on screen is still in the early days. In 97 years of the Oscars, no Native American person has ever won a competitive acting prize. Lily Gladstone, who is an executive producer on \u201cSugarcane,\u201d was passed over last year for best actress.",
      "When the Oscar nomination came through for \u201cSugarcane,\u201d they made sure they had their facts right before touting its own historic nature: NoiseCat was indeed the first indigenous North American filmmaker to get one.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really special,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd at the same time, it\u2019s kind of shocking.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe hope the film shows that there\u2019s still so much about this foundational story in North America that needs to be known and therefore needs to be investigated,\u201d NoiseCat said. \u201cThis film should be seen not as an ending, but a beginning to a real grappling with this story.\u201d",
      "He added: \"More broadly, there are so many painful, important, beautiful and sometimes even triumphant stories that come from Native people that come from Indian Country. It\u2019s my hope that more Native stories and storytellers and films get recognized moving forward and get made.\u201d",
      "If \u201cSugarcane\u201d is named the winner at the Oscars on March 2, NoiseCat promised it will be an acceptance speech to watch.",
      "\u201cWe will make it a moment,\u201d NoiseCat said. \u201cIf we win, I\u2019m going to get up there, I\u2019m going to say something, and we\u2019re going to do it well too.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Kris Bowers embraced a new challenge with his first animated film, turning his signature storytelling through music into an Oscar-nominated masterpiece.",
      "Bowers\u2019 work on \u201c The Wild Robot \u201d continues to solidify his place as one of Hollywood\u2019s most sought-after composers, earning him a nomination for best original score. His score complements the film\u2019s stunning visuals and emotional depth, capturing the journey of Roz, an out-of-place robot striving to connect with animals who struggle to understand it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about being really clear with each story, understanding what the emotions is and what\u2019s stirring inside of me,\u201d said Bowers, 35, a Grammy and Emmy-nominated composer who won an Academy Award for the short documentary \u201cThe Last Repair Shop.\u201d He\u2019s also worked on Oscar-winning films such as \u201cKing Richard\u201d and \u201c Green Book.\u201d",
      "For \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d Bowers first studied the early black-and-white sketches, where he uncovered his emotions toward the characters, before capturing those feelings at his piano, crafting a musical narrative filled with heart. Bowers said tapping into his emotions has never come easily, but he found inspiration in his journey as a father, watching his wife sacrifice her body during pregnancy, to help craft sounds that capture the essence of parenthood.",
      "In a recent interview with The Associated Press, Bowers reflects on what the Oscar nomination means to him, the challenges of composing for animated films, the lasting influence of five-time Oscar winner John Williams and why Kobe Bryant \u2019s advice continues to resonate with him.",
      "The Oscars will air March 2.",
      "____",
      "BOWERS: It means a lot. As a kid, that's how I found a lot of composers. I was looking at that (Oscar noms) list. I would look at who's nominated then go listen to those scores, so it became a way to expand my collection of CDs. It means something to be a part of this history. No matter what happens in my career from here on out, somebody's going to look at this year's list and see my name. To be nominated, you are chosen by the music branch of the academy ... filled with composers who I've been a fan of since I was a kid. ... It makes me feel like I've done something meaningful.",
      "BOWERS: Yeah, he was the master of memorable melody. If there's a piece of score in a move that you can sing, it's probably John Williams. One thing I took from him is that he came up in a time of composers who were storytellers and made sure the music was also developing the story. When those themes come back at the most pivotal point in the movie, we feel something emotional. I remember for \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d I studied the last 30 minutes of \u201cStar Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,\u201d primarily because the last 20-30 minutes of \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d is all action. I thought, \u201cHow did John Williams approach this?\" Because \u201cStar Wars\u201d was so iconic with its themes.",
      "BOWERS: The only moment was when I played the main theme. I was kind of just wanting to see if it triggered that complexity. I do this often with my wife where I\u2019ll have a theme that I\u2019m playing it and ask her \u201cWhat does this remind of, or what does this make you feel? I remember when I played her that sequence, which was a work in progress, and she got emotional. She cried watching just that three-minute sequence, having no idea of what the movie was about. I felt like I was on the right track. ... It\u2019s reminding her of all the complex emotions she feels as a mom. I struck a nerve in a way that could be valuable.",
      "BOWERS: It\u2019s definitely more challenging. If you talk to any composer, they\u2019ll talk about the fact that animation is its own challenge. Most animated films have almost wall-to-wall music where music kind of doesn\u2019t ever stop. Whereas, a lot of live action, you can sit for five minutes and not have any music and be OK.",
      "BOWERS: I did a lot of work for Kobe. He talked about John Williams being my Michael Jordan. He was all about obsessing enough about your craft, so that you are ready for anything. The stuff I wrote for \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d I learned from when he would challenge me to write. I wrote this audiobook for him, and he was like \u201cYou know this has to be better than the music for \u2018E.T.\u2019?",
      "I laughed. And he was like \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not (expletive) kidding with you, right?\u201d",
      "He was always telling me, \u201cIf you\u2019re not taking on something that\u2019s going to make you a better artist by the time you finish it, then you are wasting your time.\u201d",
      "That kind of mentality is the way I approach everything. I want to take on as many things as possible. If that opportunity came, I\u2019d be prepared for it.",
      "BOWERS: I feel like my parents put me on this track from the very beginning. They wanted me to play piano before I was born. They gave me lessons and like found teachers for me. There\u2019s kind of like this debt I owe to them. I have to be as great as I possibly can. But it\u2019s also just me trying to live up to the steps my parents already got started for me.",

      "Security at the stadium detained the performer shortly after waving the flag atop a car used as a prop in the performance. It's unclear if the performer, as of yet unnamed by authorities, would face any charges. The NFL said the person would be banned for life from NFL stadiums and events, while the company behind the halftime show said it was not part of the planned performance.",
      "But what's happening in Gaza and Sudan? And how does it affect the wider world?",
      "The Associated Press explains what's going on.",
      "The Gaza Strip is an enclave along the Mediterranean Sea bordered by both Egypt and Israel. It's some 360 square kilometers (140 square miles) \u2014 about the twice the size of Washington and 3\u00bd times the size of Paris. But it's incredibly densely populated and was home to 2.3 million Palestinians before the start of the 2023 Israel-Hamas war.",
      "That war began when Hamas, a militant group that's ruled Gaza since 2007, stormed across the border into Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking another 250 hostage. Israel responded with a devastating ground and air campaign striking across Gaza, killing more than 47,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not differentiate between fighters and noncombatants in their count. Much of the territory has been obliterated.",
      "A ceasefire in the war began Jan. 19 and is still holding. Palestinian militants have freed hostages while Israel has released Palestinians held in prisons there. However, worries remains over whether the peace will hold. Comments by President Donald Trump, who was on hand Sunday night for the Super Bowl, suggesting the U.S. was \u201ccommitted to buying and owning Gaza,\u201d also have upended discussions about the enclave's future.",
      "The Palestinians want the Gaza Strip and the West Bank for a future state of their own, with east Jerusalem as its capital. That long-sought, two-state solution for the decadeslong conflict is backed by Mideast nations and much of the international community. Israel has expressed openness to the idea of resettling Gaza\u2019s population, with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu on Sunday calling it \u201da revolutionary, creative vision.\" Hamas, the Palestinians and much of the world have rejected it.",
      "Sudan, a nation in East Africa, has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when army chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces led a military coup in 2021.",
      "The RSF and Sudan\u2019s military began fighting each other in 2023. Their conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country. Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll in the civil war.",
      "In recent weeks, Burhan's forces including Sudan's military and allied militias have advanced against the RSF. They retook a key refinery north of Khartoum, Sudan's capital. They've also pushed in on RSF positions around Khartoum itself. That fighting has led to an increase in civilian casualties. From Jan. 31 until Feb. 5, the U.N.s' Human Rights Office documented at least 275 civilian deaths from artillery, airstrikes and drone assaults.",
      "\u201cIndiscriminate attacks, as well as threats and attacks directed against civilians must cease immediately,\u201d said Seif Magango, a spokesperson for the Human Rights Office. \u201cThe Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces \u2014 and their allied movements and militias \u2014 must respect their international law obligations and take concrete steps to protect civilians from harm, including humanitarian workers and human rights defenders.\u201d",
      "Online, activists have sought to draw attention to both the Gaza Strip and Sudan, though the conflicts have different roots and participants. However, the idea of the two conflicts being linked by their devastation has been made by celebrities.",
      "In August, American rapper Macklemore said he canceled a concert in Dubai over the United Arab Emirates\u2019 role \u201cin the ongoing genocide and humanitarian crisis\u201d in Sudan through its reported support of the paramilitary force that\u2019s been fighting government troops there. While the UAE repeatedly has denied arming the RSF, U.N. experts reported \u201ccredible\u201d evidence last year showed that the Emirates sent weapons to the RSF several times a week from northern Chad.",
      "Macklemore at the time said he reconsidered the show in part over his recent, public support of Palestinians over the Israel-Hamas war. He has been performing a song called \u201cHind\u2019s Hall,\u201d in honor of a young girl named Hind Rajab killed in Gaza in a shooting Palestinians have blamed on Israeli forces opening fire on a civilian car."

      "The USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, which also released its annual study Tuesday, found that 54% of the top 100 films at the box office in 2024 featured girls and women as protagonists. That's a massive jump from just the year prior, when 30% of films featured women in lead roles. In 2007, when the USC annual study began, that figure was just 20%.",
      "\"This is the first time we can say that gender equality has been reached in top-grossing films,\u201d Stacy L. Smith, founder of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cIn 2024, three of the top five films had a girl or woman in a leading role, as did five of the top 10 films \u2014 including the number one film of the year, Disney\u2019s \u2018Inside Out 2,\u2019\" added Smith. \"We have always known that female-identified leads would make money. This is not the result of an economic awakening but is due to a number of different constituencies and efforts \u2014 at advocacy groups, at studios, through DEI initiatives \u2014 to assert the need for equality on screen.\u201d",
      "Other metrics suggested the gains in leading roles masked still-endemic disparity throughout Hollywood. The percentage of female characters in speaking roles increased from 35% to 37% in 2024, according to the San Diego State study. Major female characters rose from 38% in 2023 to 39% in 2024.",
      "\u201cFilms such as \u2018The Substance\u2019 pushed back hard against a culture that considers women disposable,\u201d Lauzen stated. \u201cWhile the number of films with female protagonists rose to a historic high in 2024 after a dismally lean 2023, the percentages of women in the more stable categories of major and speaking roles reflected only minor gains.\u201d",
      "Universal Studios, which is led by Donna Langley, was the studio with the best record for female representation. In 2024, 66.7% of Universal releases centered on girls and women, according to the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative.",
      "Neither study captures the large number of films released directly on streaming platforms or films that fall outside the top 100 movies in theaters. But for decades, those top box-office films have offered a snapshot of a film industry that has long failed to come close to reflecting the demographics of American society.",
      "That remains the case for underrepresented racial or ethnic groups, who account for roughly 42% of the U.S. population.",
      "In the top 2024 films in 2024, 25% included an underrepresented lead or co-lead, according to Annenberg. In those 25 movies, the lead or co-leads were 38.% Black, 15.4% Asian or Asian American and 3.9% Hispanic.",
      "That was a substantial decrease from 2023, when 37 leads or co-leads were people of color.",
      "\u201cThe progress we saw for female-identified leads was not matched by the findings for underrepresented leads,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThis downturn signifies a lack of investment in storytelling that reflects the audience as a whole. The reality is that audiences want to see stories about women and people of color \u2014 studios and filmmakers do not have to choose between the two.\u201d"

      "A federal appeals court has upheld singer R. Kelly's racketeering convictions and a 30-year prison sentence, finding he exploited his fame for over a quarter century to sexually abuse girls and young women",
      "NEW YORK -- R. Kelly\u2019s racketeering and sex trafficking convictions, along with a 30-year prison sentence, were upheld Wednesday by a federal appeals court that concluded the singer exploited his fame for over a quarter century to sexually abuse girls and young women.",
      "The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled Wednesday after hearing arguments last March.",
      "The Grammy-winning, multiplatinum-selling R&B songwriter was convicted in 2021 in Brooklyn federal court of multiple charges, including racketeering and sex trafficking.",
      "Attorney Jennifer Bonjean, representing R. Kelly, said in a statement that she believed the Supreme Court will agree to hear an appeal. She called the 2nd Circuit ruling \u201cunprecedented,\" saying it gives prosecutors limitless discretion to apply the racketeering law \u201cto situations absurdly remote\u201d from the statute's intent.",
      "Last year, the high court declined to hear an appeal of a 20-year sentence Kelly received after he was convicted in 2022 of child sex charges including charges of producing images of child sexual abuse in Chicago.",
      "The 2nd Circuit rejected Kelly's arguments that the trial evidence was inadequate, the constitutionality of some state laws used against him were questionable, four jurors were biased, the trial judge made some improper rulings and a racketeering charge more commonly used in organized crime cases was improper.",
      "\u201cEnabled by a constellation of managers, assistants, and other staff for over twenty-five years, Kelly exploited his fame to lure girls and young women into his grasp,\u201d the appeals court said, noting members of his entourage helped introduce him to underage girls.",
      "\u201cEvidence at trial showed that he would isolate them from friends and family, control nearly every aspect of their lives, and abuse them verbally, physically, and sexually,\u201d the three-judge panel said.",
      "The appeals court said it was \u201cneither arbitrary nor irrational\u201d that several accusers were permitted to testify at trial that Kelly gave them herpes without disclosing he had an STD, and it was not unduly prejudicial or cumulative that seven witnesses who were not yet adults when Kelly began to abuse them were allowed to testify.",
      "\u201cNone of the testimony was more inflammatory than the charged acts,\u201d the appeals court said.",
      "The 2nd Circuit also said it was not unfairly prejudicial for the trial judge to let jurors view graphic videos. The videos, the appeals court said, \u201cwere properly admitted to show the means and methods of the enterprise, including the level of control and dominance Kelly had over his victims.\u201d",
      "Bonjean, in her statement on R. Kelly's behalf, also cited a partial dissent in which one 2nd Circuit judge, Richard J. Sullivan, concurred with what he described as the majority's \u201cexcellent opinion,\u201d but dissented in part over a restitution award given one victim for a lifetime supply of a suppressive regime of herpes medication. The award was based on the cost of the brand-name drug when a generic drug is available.",
      "\u201cThis was not restitution. This was an effort by the government to unfairly enrich government witnesses for their testimony,\u201d Bonjean said.",
      "Kelly, born Robert Sylvester Kelly, is known for work including the 1996 hit \u201cI Believe I Can Fly\u201d and the cult classic \u201cTrapped in the Closet,\u201d a multipart tale of sexual betrayal and intrigue.",
      "Kelly sold millions of albums and remained in demand even after allegations about his abuse of young girls began circulating publicly in the 1990s. He was acquitted of child sexual abuse image charges in Chicago in 2008, but a second trial in Chicago in 2022 ended with his conviction on charges of producing images of child sexual abuse and enticing girls for sex.",
      "Widespread outrage over Kelly\u2019s sexual misconduct did not emerge until the #MeToo reckoning, reaching a crescendo after the release of the documentary \u201cSurviving R. Kelly.\u201d",

      "Tom Robbins, the literary prankster-philosopher who charmed, enlightened and addled millions of readers with such adventures as \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" and \"Jitterbug Perfume,\" has died",
      "NEW YORK -- Tom Robbins, the novelist and prankster-philosopher who charmed and addled millions of readers with such screwball adventures as \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" and \"Jitterbug Perfume,\" has died. He was 92.",
      "Robbins\u2019 death was confirmed by his friend, the publishing executive Craig Popelars, who said the author died Sunday morning.",
      "Pronouncing himself blessed with \"crazy wisdom,\" Robbins published eight novels and the memoir \"Tibetan Peach Pie\" and looked fondly upon his world of deadpan absurdity, authorial commentary and zig zag story lines. No one had a wilder imagination, whether giving us a wayward heroine with elongated thumbs in \"Cowgirls\" or landing the corpse of Jesus in a makeshift zoo in \"Another Roadside Attraction.\" And no one told odder jokes on himself: Robbins once described his light, scratchy drawl as sounding \"as if it's been strained through Davy Crockett's underwear.\"",
      "He could fathom almost anything except growing up. People magazine would label Robbins \"the perennial flower child and wild blooming Peter Pan of American letters,\" who \"dips history's pigtails in weird ink and splatters his graffiti over the face of modern fiction.\"",
      "A native of Blowing Rock, North Carolina who moved to Virginia and was named \"Most Mischievous Boy\" by his high school, Robbins could match any narrative in his books with one about his life. There was the time he had to see a proctologist and showed up wearing a duck mask. (The doctor and Robbins became friends). He liked to recall the food server in Texas who unbuttoned her top and revealed a faded autograph, his autograph.",
      "Or that odd moment in the 1990s when the FBI sought clues to the Unabomber's identity by reading Robbins' novel \"Still Life with Woodpecker.\" Robbins would allege that two federal agents, both attractive women, were sent to interview him.",
      "\"The FBI is not stupid!\" he liked to say. \"They knew my weakness!\"",
      "He also managed to meet a few celebrities, thanks in part to the film adaptation of \"Even Cowgirls,\" which starred Uma Thurman and Keanu Reeves, and to appearances in such movies as \"Breakfast of Champions\" and \"Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle.\" He wrote of being Debra Winger's date to the 1991 Academy Awards ceremony and nearly killing himself at an Oscars after-party when \u2014 hoping to impress Al Pacino \u2014 he swallowed a glass of cologne. He had happier memories of checking into a hotel and being recognized by a young, pretty clerk, who raved about his work and ignored the man standing next to him, Neil Young.",
      "In Robbins\u2019 novels, the quest was all and he helped capture the wide open spirit of the 1960s in part because he knew the life so well. He dropped acid, hitchhiked coast to coast, traveled from Tanzania to the Himalayas and carried on with friends and strangers in ways he had no right to survive. He didn't rely on topical references to mark time, but on understanding the era from the inside.",
      "\"Faulkner had his inbred Southern gothic freak show, Hemingway his European battlefields and cafes, Melville his New England with its tall ships,\" he wrote in his memoir, published in 2014. \"I had, it finally dawned on me, a cultural phenomenon such as the world had not quite seen before, has not seen since; a psychic upheaval, a paradigm shift, a widespread if ultimately unsustainable egalitarian leap in consciousness. And it was all very up close and personal.\"",
      "His path to fiction writing had its own rambling, hallucinatory quality. He was a dropout from Washington and Lee University (Tom Wolfe was a classmate) who joined the Air Force because he didn't know what else to do. He moved to the Pacific Northwest in the early '60s and somehow was assigned to review an opera for the Seattle Times, becoming the first classical music critic to liken Rossini to Robert Mitchum. Robbins would soon find himself in a farcical meeting with conductor Milton Katims, making conversation by pretending he was working on his own libretto, \"The Gypsy of Issaquah,\" named for a Seattle suburb.",
      "\"You must admit it had an operatic ring,\" Robbins insisted.",
      "By the late 1960s, publishers were hearing about his antics and thought he might have a book in him. A Doubleday editor met with Robbins and agreed to pay $2,500 for what became \"Another Roadside Attraction.\" Published in 1971, Robbins' debut novel sold little in hardcover despite praise from Graham Greene and Lawrence Ferlinghetti among others, but became a hit in paperback. \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\" came out in 1976 and eventually sold more than 1 million copies.",
      "\"Read solemnly, with expectations of conventional coherence, \u2018Even Cowgirls Get the Blues\u2019 will disappoint,\" Thomas LeClair wrote in The New York Times. \"Entered like a garage sale, poked through and picked over, \u2018Cowgirls\u2019 is entertaining and, like the rippled mirror over there by the lawn mower, often instructive. Tom Robbins is one of our best practitioners of high foolishness.\u201d",
      "Domestic stability was another prolonged adventure; one ex-girlfriend complained \u201cThe trouble with you, Tom, is that you have too much fun.\u201d He was married and divorced twice, and had three children, before settling down with his third wife, Alexa d'Avalon, who appeared in the film version of \u201cEven Cowgirls Get the Blues.\u201d",
      "Robbins' other books included \"Half Asleep in Frogs Pajamas,\" \"Fierce Invalids Home from Home Climates,\" \u201cVilla Incognito.\u201d His honors included the Bumbershoot Golden Umbrella Award for Lifetime Achievement and being named by Writer's Digest as among the 100 best authors of the 20th century. But he cherished no praise more than a letter received from an unnamed woman.",
      "\"Your books make me laugh, they make think, they make me horny,\" his fan informed him, \u201cand they make me aware of all the wonder in the world.\u201d"

      "As Batiste performed the national anthem Sunday, the multi-talented musician played a piano adorned with a colorful butterfly painting by his wife, Suleika Jaouad, who came up with the idea while making their documentary \u201cAmerican Symphony.\u201d Her artwork, the city\u2019s resilience after the New Year\u2019s attack, and the memory of his late veteran grandfather all fueled his performance.",
      "\u201cThis was powerful. The spirit came over me,\u201d Batiste told The Associated Press after his performance at the Caesars Superdome. On Monday he unveiled \u201cMy United State,\u201d a two-track project featuring \u201cStar-Spangled Blues\u201d and \u201cNotes from My Future Self.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first time in the history of the anthem that had samples included in it,\u201d said Batiste, a Louisiana native who is a Grammy and Oscar winner and former bandleader for the \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\u201d \u201cWe almost couldn\u2019t clear the main sample that I wanted until the night before.\u201d",
      "Batiste, 38, said his reinvented national anthem draws from \u201cDrag Rap\u201d by The Showboys \u2014 better known as the Triggerman beat \u2014 a staple of New Orleans bounce and hip-hop culture. He aimed to showcase the city's rich culture and heritage while putting his own stamp on a song that was first echoed at the Super Bowl in 1967, performed by The Pride of Arizona, the Michigan Marching Band and the UCLA Choir.",
      "Over the years, the anthem has been reimagined by music legends like Whitney Houston, Diana Ross, Billy Joel, Beyonc\u00e9 and Lady Gaga.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of pieces to the puzzle,\u201d he said. \u201cThey all come in different tempos and melodies. It\u2019s a whole lot of things that wouldn\u2019t never work together unless it was framed by the American ideal. I wanted to capture it in an arrangement. Just in the sound.\u201d",
      "In an AP interview, Batiste reflected on his wife\u2019s resilience, new songs, an upcoming tour and his festival this weekend that will leave a lasting musical impact on New Orleans.",
      "During the filming of \u201cAmerican Symphony,\u201d inspiration struck \u2014 not just in the documentary, but on canvas. As Jaouad painted, one creation that took flight was a vivid butterfly, embodying what he calls the \u201cpower of resilience, delicate beauty, and grace.\u201d",
      "Jaouad's painting was on the piano and bench Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt's the balance of this duality,\u201d he said about watching his wife creatively express herself during \u201cAmerican Symphony,\u201d which won a Grammy for best music film. \u201cIt Never Went Away\u201d from the documentary also won best song written for visual media.

      "\u201cShe's a one of a kind human being, like a person who has so much light from within,\u201d Batiste said. \u201cYou look into her eyes and you see the work. I'm very glad that she was able to not only survive, but have this alchemizing process of it all to lift it into something that's even more than just a way of making lemonade out of lemons.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThis is more than just taking a bad thing and making it good. It's almost a blessing, as wild as it is to think about it like that.\u201d",
      "While crafting \u201cNotes from My Future Self,\u201d Batiste had three things on his mind: returning home, the national anthem and the wide-eyed wonder of him at 6 years old.",
      "\u201cIt really brought together so many things in my subconscious,\u201d said the seven-time Grammy winner. \"It brought them together, like all these stories, notes. What would the young me think about what\u2019s happening now and how to really connect to this moment from their inner child plays in this song? It just came out of that.\u201d",
      "Batiste called the upbeat song an anthem that represents self-empowerment for himself and others too. He said making the song was a profound journey of artistic realization.",
      "\u201cWhen you hear the song and you\u2019re listening, it\u2019s me talking to my younger me,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it could also be you, talking to young you. In a moment like this, it\u2019s important for us to heal, to really thrive and be rooted in who we are. We have to go back to that kid.\u201d",
      "Batiste said the musical foundation came while talking to director Alan Ferguson, his frequent collaborator. He said they had a vision of using spoken word, poetry and hip-hop within the context of \u201cradical cause, positivity and openness.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a celebration of life,\u201d he said. \u201dIt's a natural intuition and the visual possibility and the evolution of me as an artist is just me going into this new zone. ... When it aligns like that, that's how I know it's the right direction.\"",
      "After Batiste's Super Bowl performance, his next goal is creating visuals for \u201cNotes from My Future Self\" and hitting the road for a concert tour.",
      "Full details have to yet been released, but he's looking to perform new music and songs from Beethoven Blues (Batiste Piano Series, Vol. 1),\u201d which reimagined the iconic German pianist\u2019s work.",
      "\u201cYou really get a twofer on this next run,\u201d Batiste said.",
      "Before delivering the national anthem, Jon Batiste brought his signature energy to New Orleans\u2019 9th Ward, turning a neighborhood into a stage for joy and community.",
      "His He Gets Us Presents Jon Batiste\u2019s Love Riot Festival transformed the grounds of George Washington Carver High School into a celebration of music, hope, and action. The event also highlighted plans for a future sports field to serve local schools.",
      "\u201cI wanted to make something where we go to the places that are forgotten but are the foundation,\u201d Batiste said. \u201cThey are the foundation of why we want to come to New Orleans in the first place and go to those communities.\u201d",
      "Batiste, alongside Sing for Hope, led 10 New Orleans artists in creating hand-painted pianos, scattered throughout the 9th Ward as an open invitation to the festival. After the event, these vibrant instruments will find permanent homes in schools and community centers, keeping the music alive long after the final note.",
      "\u201cThey greatest thing we can do is serve and not take it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a holistic view. ... Yes, I\u2019m honored to sing at the Super Bowl. I also want to leave something that impacts the community, my hometown.\u201d",

Planned Parenthood said most of its facilities could not comply with some of the licensing rules, including \u201cmedically irrelevant\u201d size requirements for hallways, rooms and doors.",
      "Planned Parenthood argued that the licensing law required providers to give \u201cmedically unnecessary and invasive\u201d pelvic exams to anyone receiving an abortion, including medication abortions, according to court documents.

      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision affirms what we\u2019ve already long known \u2014 the state\u2019s abortion facility licensing requirements were not about patient safety, but rather another politically motivated barrier to prevent patients seeking abortion from getting the care they need,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "The ruling is a temporary order pending the outcome of the lawsuit by abortion-rights advocates.",

      "Utah students as early as kindergarten would be required to learn about firearm safety in the classroom under a bill that passed the state House",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah students in as early as kindergarten would be required to learn about firearm safety in the classroom under a bill that passed the state House with overwhelming support Friday.",
      "The Republican-controlled chamber approved the measure in a 59-10 vote and sent it to the Senate, despite concerns from some gun violence prevention advocates that it places an unnecessary burden on children.",
      "Under the proposal, public school students would receive mandatory instruction throughout their K-12 years on how to respond if they encounter a gun. The lessons, which could be presented in a video or by an instructor displaying an actual firearm, would demonstrate best practices for safely handling and storing a gun to prevent accidents.",
      "Elementary age children would learn about gun safety on at least three occasions by the time they reach sixth grade, with the possibility for that instruction to begin in kindergarten, when kids are around five years old.",
      "The bill\u2019s Republican sponsor, Rep. Rex Shipp of Cedar City, said it's aimed at preventing accidental shootings by and of young children. The lessons, he said, will be age-appropriate for each grade level, with younger students learning to avoid touching a gun and alert an adult immediately.",
      "\u201cA lot of times when they don't have any firearms in their homes or don't do any hunting and shooting, then these kids are not taught what to do when they come in contact with a firearm,\u201d Shipp said.",
      "One other state, Tennessee, has a law on the books requiring firearm safety training in public schools, but it lets education officials determine in which grade they think it's appropriate for students to start receiving that instruction. The lessons, set to begin next school year, will be annual and cannot include live firearms or ammunition.",
      "A Utah statute already allows firearm safety to be taught in schools, but Shipp said teachers don't currently do so. His bill makes it mandatory but allows parents to opt their kids out of the instruction.",
      "If it passes the similarly Republican-led Senate and is signed into law, the lessons would begin next school year.",
      "Gun violence prevention advocates have applauded Utah Republicans for pushing for more gun safety education, but some argue those lessons should be aimed at adults.",
      "The proposal unfairly places the responsibility of gun safety on children rather than their parents, said Barbara Gentry of the Gun Violence Prevention Center of Utah.",
      "\u201cGuns and gun safety are the responsibility of the adult gun owner, not school children,\" Gentry said. \"We support schools sending home materials to parents outlining the importance of safe storage in keeping our families and schools safe from gun violence.\"",
      "Jaden Christensen, a volunteer with the Utah chapter of Moms Demand Action, said lawmakers should instead look to grow programs that teach parents the importance of keeping firearms away from children.",
      "\u201cThe burden should always be on adults,\u201d Christensen said.",

      "Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes the accumulation of long-term injuries experienced by some clubs is an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d because of the increased demands on players in a busy soccer calendar",
      "LONDON -- Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes the accumulation of long-term injuries experienced by some clubs is an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d because of the increased demands on players in a congested soccer calendar.",
      "Arteta said he felt a \u201cbig pain in the tummy\u201d after seeing Kai Havertz pick up a serious hamstring injury at the end of a light training session in Dubai that will rule the Germany forward out for the rest of the season.",
      "It further stretches Arsenal\u2019s resources up front, with Gabriel Jesus having ruptured his ACL, winger Bukayo Saka having not played since December because of a hamstring issue and another wide player, Gabriel Martinelli, set to miss the next month also with a hamstring injury.",
      "Two more games per team were added to the first stage of this season's Champions League, while Arsenal also went deep in the English League Cup \u2014 it was eliminated by Newcastle in the two-legged semifinals \u2014 and is in a title race with Liverpool in the Premier League.",
      "An expanded and revamped Club World Cup, which takes place in the United States at the end of the season and lasts a month, also extends the schedule for many teams, though not Arsenal this year. Some players have openly complained that it is detrimental to their performance and health and the busy match schedule is facing legal challenges and the possibility of strike action.",
      "For Arteta, it\u2019s no surprise to see injury rates soar at Arsenal because of the extra load on players and what he perceives to be an increased intensity in modern-day soccer.",
      "\u201cYou cannot prove it and the evidence we can provide is very limited in many aspects and every case is very different but already some of them (injuries) we know are based on load and minutes. It's inevitable,\u201d Arteta said Friday. \u201cWe have players who have been injured who have played 130 games over the last two seasons. In the end, it\u2019s an accident waiting to happen if you continue to load and load and load.",
      "\u201cIs this season an accumulation of that? Is it the stress of that? Is it luck? Is it preparation? Is it methodology? There are a lot of factors. It\u2019s very difficult to point at something but the schedule that's planned is super-demanding and for certain players, especially explosive players, it\u2019s a real issue.\u201d",
      "Havertz appears to have been unlucky in picking up his injury, with Arteta explaining how the German stretched his leg to stop a shot at a set-piece and \u201cfelt his hamstring go.\u201d",
      "Given the number of injuries sustained by Arsenal players this season \u2014 others to have had long spells out include Ben White, Martin Odegaard, Riccardo Calafiori and Takehiro Tomiyasu \u2014 some have questioned whether Arteta\u2019s training methods are to blame.",
      "Maybe that was the reason why Arteta was eager to point out that Arsenal\u2019s players now \u201ctrain less than ever\u201d and go into a deeper explanation about how too many games \u2014 and, as a result, not enough training \u2014 affects players\u2019 recovery.",
      "\u201cThe muscle is undertrained and then you expose the muscle and the tendon to an exposure that they cannot absorb because the tendon needs 72 hours to recover,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cA lot of people talk about what we're doing outside. It\u2019s not outside, it\u2019s inside.",
      "\u201cWhen you have to load that muscle for two or three or six or eight weeks that you haven\u2019t in training, the risk of injury is much bigger \u2014 one, because the tendon is not recovered, and then it\u2019s not prepared to absorb the load and stress you are going to put it under every three days.\u201d",

      "The Senate is expected to vote Thursday on the confirmation of Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate is expected to vote Thursday on the confirmation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent lawyer and vocal vaccine critic, as the nation's health secretary, controlling $1.7 trillion in spending for vaccines, food safety and health insurance programs for roughly half the country.",
      "Despite several Republicans expressing deep skepticism about his views on vaccines, Kennedy is expected to win confirmation, absent any last-minute changes.",
      "Kennedy, 71, whose famous name and family tragedies have put him in the national spotlight since he was a child, has earned a formidable following with his populist \u2014 and sometimes extreme \u2014 views on food, chemicals and vaccines.",
      "His audience only grew during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Kennedy devoted much of his time to a nonprofit that sued vaccine makers and harnessed social media campaigns to erode trust in vaccines as well as the government agencies that promote them.",
      "With the backing of Republican President Donald Trump, Kennedy believes he is \u201cuniquely positioned\u201d to revive trust in those public health agencies, which include the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes for Health.",
      "Republican senators have largely embraced Kennedy's vision, reciting his newly hatched slogan to \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d in speeches.",
      "Last week, North Carolina GOP Sen. Thom Tillis said he hopes Kennedy \u201cgoes wild\u201d on reigning in health care costs and improving Americans' health. But one holdout \u2014 GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana doctor \u2014 required assurances that Kennedy would not make changes to existing vaccine recommendations before agreeing to back him.",
      "Democrats have remained skeptical, unsuccessfully prodding Kennedy during hearings to deny a long discredited theory that vaccines cause autism. And some have raised alarms about Kennedy financially benefiting from changing vaccine guidelines or weakening federal lawsuit protections against vaccine makers.",
      "Kennedy made more than $850,000 last year from an arrangement referring clients to a law firm that has sued the makers of Gardasil, a human papillomavirus vaccine that protects against cervical cancer. While serving as health secretary, he has promised to reroute fees collected from the arrangement to his son.",
      "Kennedy is expected to take over the agency in the midst of a massive federal government shakeup, led by billionaire Elon Musk, that has shut off \u2014 even if temporarily \u2014 billions of taxpayer dollars in public health funding and left thousands of federal workers unsure about their jobs.",
      "On Friday, the NIH announced it would cap billions of dollars in medical research given to universities and cancer being used to develop treatments for diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's.",
      "Kennedy, too, has called for a staffing overhaul at the NIH, FDA and CDC. Last year, he vowed to fire 600 employees at the NIH, the nation's largest funder of biomedical research."

      "PARIS -- Those Valentine flowers might come with a bit more than vivid colors and a nice scent. France\u2019s oldest consumer group is reminding people that any imported cut flower likely also contains pesticides -- even those banned in Europe.",
      "The flower industry points to studies saying that cut flowers pose no health risk to consumers, though some advocates say there hasn't been enough study on whether the contamination could endanger florists who touch them daily.",
      "Paris-based UFC-Que Choisir chose Valentine\u2019s Day to release results of what it said were tests of roses, gerberas and chrysanthemums sold at florists, shops, supermarkets and online. It said it found potentially harmful residues of pesticides in every bouquet.",
      "In the Netherlands \u2014 which produces roughly 60% of the global trade \u2014 a similar study came to similar conclusions.",
      "Unlike for produce that is consumed, regulations in Europe on cut flowers place no limits on the level of pesticides, UFC-Que Choisir notes.",
      "The group is calling on authorities to introduce maximum levels of pesticide residues, a ban on imports of flowers treated with pesticides that are banned in Europe, and mandatory labelling of the origin and treatment of flowers.",
      "The group bought 15 bouquets of flowers. In each one, between seven and up to 46 different pesticide residues were identified, of which an average of almost 12 were deemed hazardous because they are possibly carcinogenic or endocrine disrupting, the group said. Residues of pesticides banned in the EU were found in two-thirds of the bouquets.",
      "Valhor, the French inter-trade organization for horticulture, floristry and landscaping, however pointed to a study in Germany that concluded there were no risks for consumers who buy cut flowers.",
      "\u201cThe entire industry is compliant and transparent,\u201d it said. \u201cWith regard to European and particularly French flower production, the industry complies with a strict and demanding legislative and regulatory framework for the use of plant protection products.\"",
      "Valhor added that it promotes health and safety practices in the flower industry workplace to limit exposure, including the use of gloves.",
      "Pierre Lebailly, a pesticide expert at University of Caen, regrets that there have been only a small number of studies on the impact of pesticides on florists\u2019 health. Among those, a study in Belgium showed that pesticides could be absorbed through the skin when handling contaminated flowers, with a potential damaging effect on health.",
      "The Dutch branch of the Pesticide Action Network \u2014 a network of European NGOs promoting sustainable alternatives to pesticides \u2014- tested 13 bouquets of tulips, roses, and mixed bouquets in a certified laboratory. Residues of pesticides were found in all bouquets.",
      "According to PAN, Valentine\u2019s roses are typically sourced from Dutch growers with greenhouses or fields in Kenya and Ethiopia.",
      "A total of 71 different active substances were found in the bouquets, of which 28 are banned in the EU. The study found that, on average, each bouquet contained 25 toxic substances."

      "This is what it looks like after the Trump administration halted U.S. foreign assistance last month. The U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, issued stop-work orders during a 90-day review for what the administration has alleged is wasteful spending.",
      "Fares had been working in three clinics run by M\u00e9decins du Monde, or Doctors of the World, offering free health care to the displaced population in northern Syria, which until the fall of former President Bashar Assad in December had been the country's main rebel-held enclave. It sheltered millions of people who had fled years of civil war.",
      "Their already grim camps swelled again in 2023 after a deadly magnitude 7.8 earthquake hit Turkey and northern Syria. Since the fall of Assad, some displaced Syrians have begun to return home, but many have no homes left.",
      "Fares\u2019 clinic in Sarmada used to support 16 camps in the region, assisting approximately 35,000 people. Since the aid freeze, 10 such clinics receiving USAID funding had to close, and Doctors of the World had to lay off 184 people, officials with the organization said.",
      "\u201cIf the support is not resumed, there will be a major disaster and serious harm to vulnerable groups,\u201d said Fares, who heads the organization\u2019s medical programs. \u201cOperating costs of clinics are much lower than those of hospitals. The cessation of work in these clinics will put increased pressure on emergency hospitals and other healthcare facilities\"",
      "This part of Syria lacks centralized government healthcare, leaving people reliant on nonprofit providers and making the impact of the sudden U.S. cuts especially dire, aid workers and experts said.",
      "\"Our analysis shows that withdrawing all of USAID\u2019s support in Syria would be equivalent to a devastating shock of 5% to its already struggling economy. This is among the largest impacts on any recipient.\" said Ian Mitchell, senior policy fellow at the Washington based Center for Global Development.",
      "The U.S. had been providing 25 cents in foreign aid for every $100 of U.S. income, Mitchell said, but that relatively small contribution had outsized impact: \u201cWithout U.S. support in places like Gaza and Syria, the world will become a more dangerous place.\"",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has issued a waiver to exempt emergency food aid and \u201clife-saving\u201d programs. But Hamadeh and others said funding has not resumed to a point that would allow them to fully restore services.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to shut down some of these hospitals and shrink,\u201d Hamadeh said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be providing free services anymore.\"",

      "\u201cWe have a grant that supports survivors of torture and sexual assault,\u201d Hamadeh said. \u201cAre these services life-saving or not? Likely they will be shut down.\u201d",
      "USAID and the U.S. government did not respond to questions. Elsewhere, USAID workers and aid officials have said funding hasn't resumed despite waivers, or USAID staffers who would process them are now gone.",

HIV can rebound to detectable levels in people\u2019s blood in just a few weeks, putting sexual partners at risk. Babies born to mothers with HIV can escape infection only if the woman was properly treated during pregnancy or the infant is treated immediately after birth.",
      "If the drugs are not taken, a body is heading toward AIDS, the final stage of infection.",
      "\u201cWithout HIV treatment, people with AIDS typically survive about three years,\u201d the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.",
      "For a long time, there may be no noticeable symptoms. But a person can easily spread HIV to others, and the immune system becomes vulnerable to what are called opportunistic diseases.",
      "The National Institutes of Health says opportunistic diseases include fungal infections, pneumonia, salmonella and tuberculosis. For a country like South Africa, with the world\u2019s highest number of HIV cases and one of the largest numbers of TB cases, the toll could be immense.",
      "Unchecked by HIV treatment, the damage continues. The immune system is increasingly unable to fight off diseases. Every action, from eating to travel, must consider the potential exposure to germs.",
      "For years, the importance of taking the drugs every day, even at the same time of day, has been emphasized to people with HIV. Now the ability to follow that essential rule has been shaken.",
      "Already, hundreds or thousands of U.S.-funded health partners in countries such as Kenya and Ethiopia have been laid off, causing widespread gaps in HIV testing, messaging, care and support on the continent most helped by PEPFAR. At some African clinics, people with HIV have been turned away.",
      "Restoring the effects caused by the Trump administration's foreign aid freeze during a 90-day review period, and understanding what\u2019s allowed under the waiver for PEPFAR, will take time that health experts say many people don't have.",
      "Meanwhile, the head of the U.N. AIDS agency, Winnie Byanyima, told the AP that more resistant strains of the disease could emerge.",
      "And an additional 3.4 million children could be made orphans \u2014 another echo of the time when the world raced to confront AIDS with few tools at hand.",

      "Lawmakers in Alabama's House have passed a bill expediting Medicaid for pregnant women in a state with one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the country",
      "MONTOGMERY, Ala. -- A bill that would expedite Medicaid coverage and prenatal health care for low-income pregnant women in Alabama has advanced as lawmakers across the South try to address rising maternal and infant mortality rates.",
      "The \u201cpresumptive eligibility\u201d legislation states that Medicaid will pay for a pregnant woman\u2019s outpatient medical care for up to 60 days while her application for the government-funded insurance program is being considered.",
      "\u201cThis way we cut out some of the red tape, we get them in as quickly as possible,\u201d said Rep. Marilyn Lands, the Democrat representing Huntsville who introduced the bill.",
      "Processing Medicaid applications can take weeks, Lands said, and physicians say early prenatal care is vital.",
      "Last year, nearly 1 in 5 pregnant Alabama women received prenatal care after five months of pregnancy, or otherwise received less than 50% of the appropriate number of the recommended visits throughout her pregnancy, according to The March of Dimes.",
      "The bill passed in the Alabama House of Representatives unanimously. It will now be considered by the Senate. Republicans celebrated the bill as a \u201cpro-life\u201d measure.",
      "Alabama\u2019s delivery health outcomes currently lag far behind the rest of the country.",
      "One study found Alabama had a maternal mortality rate of 64.63 deaths per 100,000 births between 2018 and 2021, nearly double the national rate of 34.09 per 100,000 births. That jumps to 100.07 deaths for Black women in the state.",
      "Other states have adopted a similar strategy for addressing some of the highest infant and maternal mortality rates across the country. Legislators in both Mississippi and Arkansas have introduced bills that would offer similar coverage to expectant mothers. Mississippi passed a law last year that was nearly identical to the Alabama legislation, but it was never implemented after negotiations with the federal Medicaid agency stalled, according to Mississippi Today.",
      "Alabama and Mississippi are among 10 states nationwide that have not expanded Medicaid, which means many low-income women are only eligible for Medicaid once they become pregnant.",
      "In Alabama, 1 in 6 women of childbearing age fall within the coverage gap, making too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to afford private insurance, according to Alabama Arise, an advocacy group for low-income families.",
      "A pregnant woman in Alabama with no dependents can qualify for Medicaid if she makes $21,996 or less, or up to $37,704 if she is part of a household of three.",
      "Medicaid was used to pay for 45% of all births in Alabama in 2023, according to the most recent report published by the Alabama Department of Public Health. More than half of all infant deaths were to mothers who used Medicaid.",
      "Dr. Max Rogers, an obstetrician-gynecologist who works with many low-income pregnant women in rural communities, said medical care during the first trimester is essential for ensuring a woman is in a safe environment for carrying a pregnancy and identifying potentially lethal threats early on.",
      "\u201cThe longer you have to get blood pressure under control, or get diabetes under control, the long-term outcomes are going to be much, much better,\u201d Rogers said.",
      "Rogers\u2019 rural office was the fourth labor and delivery unit to close statewide in 2024. He was able to relocate an hour and a half south where he has continued seeing some of his patients \u2014 but the closures have left huge swaths of women in the state without access to prenatal care.",
      "Rogers says he supports the bill but that it will only be effective if other measures are taken to increase access to care.",
      "\u201cIf we don't make sure that a patient can get there and take advantage of services, it doesn't really have an impact, right?\u201d he said."

      "Most won't make the deadline. The U.N. says that's OK as long as they are working on them.",
      "So far only a dozen of the 195 nations that signed the 2015 Paris climate agreement have filed their national plans for cutting emissions by 2035. Those nations account for only 16.2% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 the chief human-caused heat-trapping gas \u2014 and almost all of that is from the United States, where President Donald Trump has already discarded the plan submitted by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "Aside from the U.S., the only major emitters to submit 2035 targets are Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. The Marshall Islands, Singapore, Ecuador, Saint Lucia, Andorra, New Zealand, Switzerland and Uruguay have filed their plans, but they all produce less than 0.2% of the world's carbon dioxide.",
      "U.N. Climate Secretary Simon Stiell said that more than 170 countries have told his office they are working on their national plans, so he\u2019s not worried. He emphasized quality over timeliness.",
      "\u201cTaking a bit more time to ensure these plans are first-rate makes sense,\u201d Stiell said last week in a policy speech in Brazil. \u201cThese will be the most comprehensive climate plans ever developed.\u201d",

      "The latest versions are supposed to be compatible with the Paris agreement's goal of limiting long-term warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. The world is now at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s and on pace to warm another 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.2 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the U.N.",

Brazil in its plan gave a range of emission cuts of 59% to 67% by 2035 when compared to 2005 emissions, talking heavily about an emphasis on climate justice, repeatedly mentioning efforts to combat deforestation.",

      "Lawyers for South Carolina and Planned Parenthood are returning to the state\u2019s highest court to argue how restrictive the state's abortion ban should be",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- With a heartbeat abortion ban solidly in place in South Carolina, lawyers for the state and Planned Parenthood return to the state's highest court Wednesday to argue how restrictive the ban should be.",
      "The law is being enforced in South Carolina as a ban on almost all abortions around six weeks after conception, setting that mark as the time cardiac activity starts.",
      "But Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights groups are arguing the 2023 law includes alternative definitions about the timing of a fetal heart forming and a \u201cheartbeat\u201d starting and the true ban should start around nine or 10 weeks.",
      "Both sides are set to argue for just over an hour at the South Carolina Supreme Court in Columbia. The justices likely will take several months to decide the case. In the meantime, the abortion ban around six weeks likely will remain in place after a lower court upheld it.",
      "The 2023 law says abortions cannot be performed after an ultrasound can detect \u201ccardiac activity, or the steady and repetitive rhythmic contraction of the fetal heart, within the gestational sac.\u201d",
      "South Carolina and several other states place that at six weeks into development. But what follows the \u201cor\u201d in the sentence could require that a heart has formed, and medical experts say that doesn\u2019t happen until around nine weeks.",
      "The legal fight has been brewing since the state Supreme Court reversed itself after overturning a similar ban in 2021. The Republican-dominated General Assembly then made small changes and a justice who voted in the majority in the 3-2 decision to overturn the ban reached retirement age and was replaced.",
      "In the decision upholding the new ban, the state Supreme Court itself noted the different definitions saying resolving them would be a question \u201cfor another day.\u201d",
      "That day is Wednesday. Since then, more inconsistencies in the law\u2019s language have been brought up. The law refers to a fetal heartbeat, but most experts consider a fertilized egg to be an embryo for about 10 weeks after conception before transitioning into a fetus.",
      "Lawyers for the state said the parsing of the language ignores the intent of the Legislature. Both supporters and opponents of the bill called it nearly exclusively a six-week ban during debate in the House and Senate.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a nationwide right to abortion, most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions and most Democrat-dominated ones have sought to protect abortion access.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and South Carolina and three others have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy -- often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant.",
      "The latest lawsuit was filed by South Carolina resident Taylor Shelton, who said she had sought medical attention for pain from her intrauterine device and was stunned to find out, just two days after missing her regularly-tracked period, that she was pregnant.",
      "She ended up in North Carolina, driving for hours to several appointments to undergo an abortion because doctors in South Carolina were unsure how to define a heartbeat. Shelton couldn\u2019t be completely sure she was within six weeks.",
      "Some Republicans in South Carolina are also pushing for an outright abortion ban, but while legislation was introduced this January when the General Assembly started its two-year session, no hearings have been held."

      "For nine weeks, everyone kept track of their drinking habits and their desire for alcohol. A lab visit with their favorite alcohol was repeated at the end of the study.",
      "During the last weeks of the study, nearly 40% in the semaglutide group reported no heavy drinking days compared with 20% in the placebo group. And in the final lab test, the semaglutide group drank roughly half the amount, on average, compared to those who got the placebo.",
      "Everyone in the study was overweight. It's unclear how safe the drugs would be for a person of normal weight, Klein said.",
      "Smokers in the study who got the semaglutide also cut back on cigarettes, noted Luba Yammine of UTHealth Houston, who is leading other research on GLP-1 drugs for people who want to quit smoking. The finding is promising but more data is needed, Yammine said.",
      "The study \u201cprovides additional important information on the potential role of this new class of medications\u201d in treating certain addictions, said Dr. Lorenzo Leggio, an NIH researcher who is leading a 20-week trial of semaglutide for alcohol use disorder now underway in Baltimore.",
      "\u201cIt is important to keep in mind that we need larger randomized clinical trials to confirm these findings,\u201d Leggio said.",

      "Families and activists in Bangui, the capital of the Central African Republic, have protested over the government\u2019s closure of a critical unit at the main public hospital following two sudden deaths",
      "BANGUI, Central African Republic -- The sudden closure in the Central African Republic of the orthopedic trauma surgery unit at the capital 's main hospital following the deaths of two people, including a government minister's niece, has sparked concern among patients and relatives.",
      "The unit at Bangui Community University Hospital was closed by the health ministry on Feb. 3 following the deaths, which are being investigated. The inquiry panel is also assessing the quality of service delivery at the hospital.",
      "The hospital has faced problems operating smoothly due to frequent power cuts, said Joseph Bindoum, head of the Central African Republic\u2019s League for Human Rights, which investigated the deaths.",
      "Patients' families and some activists have criticised the closure and accused the government of \u201cpunishing\u201d patients who have been left without proper care.",
      "In a protest at the hospital on Tuesday, families called for the reopening of the unit, which is one of the few such facilities in the mineral-rich country of about 6 million people.",
      "\u201cThe closure of the operating unit violates the patients\u2019 right to health,\u201d Bindoum said, echoing concerns from worried families. \u201cDoctors ... do not have the means (to work well),\u201d he added.",
      "Ir\u00e8ne Gassengue\u2019s son has been lying with fractured limbs in a hospital bed with no medical attention for a week even though she already paid for his surgery.",
      "\u201cI am angry because the minister of health decided on his own to close the surgical unit,\u201d Gassengue said. She fears the delayed surgery is causing his health to deteriorate. \u201cIt is scandalous,\u201d she said.",
      "The two patients who died included Larissa Yagasso Nguianbga, whose uncle is Energy Minister Arthur Bertrand Piri and an ally of President Faustin Archange Touad\u00e9ra.",
      "Although no official reason has been given for the deaths, a doctor at the surgery unit said Nguianbga died after a power cut that led to the breakdown of some equipment. The doctor spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to talk about the issue publicly.",
      "The authorities are asking French medical charity Doctors Without Borders, or MSF, if it can help in treating patients requiring urgent care. \u201cAn arrangement has been put in place,\u201d Health Minister Dr. Pierre Somse said.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 03:50:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Lawmakers in some states are pushing measures to crack down on abortion pills or penalize women who obtain abortions",
    "story": [
      "Lawmakers in some states are pushing measures to crack down on abortion pills or penalize women who obtain abortions",
      "Lawmakers in some states where abortion is already banned are seeking to explicitly bar abortion pills or take a step that most leading anti-abortion groups oppose: punish women who seek to end their pregnancies.",
      "It's too early in some legislative sessions to know whether the measures will get serious consideration. But it does show that the policy debate continues to evolve following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to state bans on abortion.",
      "Here's a look at where things stand:",
      "Lawmakers in several states have introduced measures to classify the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 which are used together in the majority of U.S. abortions \u2014 as controlled dangerous substances, making it a crime to possess them without prescriptions.",
      "Louisiana last year became the first state to adopt such a law, despite concerns from doctors who contended that the restrictions would make it harder for them to access the drugs to perform life-saving procedures.",
      "The measures have been introduced in states where Republicans control the government and where there are bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions.",
      "The legislation has died or appears unlikely to advance in Indiana and Mississippi.",
      "Elsewhere \u2014 including Idaho, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas \u2014 it's too early to know whether they have a chance.",
      "In Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt, a staunch opponent of abortion, has vowed to sign any anti-abortion measure that comes to his desk.",
      "And one scholar who follows abortion policy said that the bills can affect the debate even if they don't pick up momentum.",
      "\u201cThe more often that they\u2019re introduced, the more normalized these sorts of bills and these sorts of concepts that they\u2019re pushing become,\u201d said Laura Hermer, a professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minnesota.",
      "Authorities in two states with stringent abortion laws have targeted a New York doctor for allegedly sending abortion pills to patients in those states.",
      "Last month, a Louisiana grand jury indicted Dr. Maggie Carpenter on charges of criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs, a felony. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Carpenter in civil court under similar circumstances.",
      "The legal actions set up a test of laws in some Democratic-controlled states, including New York, that seek to protect health care providers who use telehealth to prescribe and then mail abortion pills to patients in states where they're banned. New York officials say they will not extradite the doctor to Louisiana.",
      "Since Carpenter's indictment, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a law that allows doctors to leave their names off prescription bottles for abortion pills as a way to further insulate them. Similar legislation has been introduced in Maine.",
      "The attorneys general of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri are also suing in federal court to roll back federal approvals for mifepristone and bar prescriptions for it by telehealth.",
      "Some advocates are calling on President Donald Trump to enforce an 1873 law to ban mailing medication or instruments used in abortion, but he has not done so.",
      "While critics say the drugs are unsafe, some major medical groups disagree. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says there is decades of evidence that mifepristone and misoprostol are safe and effective. The group cited a study showing that major adverse events such as significant infection and excessive blood loss occur in less than 0.32% of patients taking mifepristone for a medication abortion. Medical organizations say mifepristone\u2019s safety compares to that of the over-the-counter pain medication ibuprofen.",
      "Bills in several states would open the door to criminal charges against women who seek or obtain abortions on charges including murder.",
      "That's a step no state has taken so far, and which leading anti-abortion groups such as Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America and the National Right to Life Committee oppose.",
      "Still, such bills have been introduced in Idaho and Indiana, where they're unlikely to advance, and Oklahoma, North Dakota and South Carolina, where they're all early in the legislative process.",
      "Reached by phone, South Carolina Rep. Luke Rankin, a Republican who added his name to a list of bill sponsors last week, said, \u201cI've always been pro-life.\u201d When asked about the provision to allow prosecution of women seeking abortion, he said: \u201cI can't help you there\u201d and declined to answer questions.",

      "The 24-year-old-company wants to make the testing common at birth. The goal: Identify potential diseases or conditions so doctors can begin treating them before symptoms appear in some cases.",
      "GeneDx specializes in whole genome sequencing. That involves looking at about 20,000 genes that make up a genome, the instructions to build and sustain a human.",

      "A: That\u2019s exactly right. We\u2019re only delivering information to say, you know, we\u2019ve diagnosed your child with a form of epilepsy and we\u2019re able to intervene now before your child has a seizure.",

    "story": [
      "Sweden is a trailblazer in hockey because it has allowed body checking in the women\u2019s game since 2022",
      "\u00d6RNSK\u00d6LDSVIK, Sweden -- Lauren Bellefontaine came off the ice after a game in Sweden\u2019s top women\u2019s hockey league and detailed the toll her body had just taken.",
      "\u201cI got a stick to the collarbone tonight and also a hit to the head. Definitely some bumps and bruises,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cBut I\u2019m feeling fine.\u201d",
      "Growing up in Canada, Bellefontaine kept hearing people ask why there was no hitting in women\u2019s hockey. It has taken a move to northern Sweden for her to discover the more physical side of the sport.",
      "In 2022, Sweden became the first country to introduce body checking to its premier women\u2019s league, bringing its rule book closer to men\u2019s hockey even though hockey\u2019s world governing body does not formally allow the practice because of safety concerns. It has opened up a new world for women's players, who say they feel more empowered playing the game the way it was intended.",
      "Swedish hockey officials say the results have been overwhelmingly positive: The women\u2019s game has become faster and more entertaining while concussions, which have been a scourge for the sport, have decreased.",
      "Other countries are now looking to follow suit, with the PWHL \u2014 the professional women\u2019s league in North America with some of the world's top players \u2014 putting checking in the rules for its inaugural season last year.",
      "\u201cIt has given us the opportunity to prove we\u2019re physical, we\u2019re strong and we can play just like the men\u2019s players,\u201d Bellefontaine said. \u201cIt allows us to show we can \u2014 and we will.\u201d",
      "Bellefontaine joined MoDo for the start of the 2023-24 season. It\u2019s a title-contending team from \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, a sleepy coastal town some 530 kilometers (330 miles) north of Stockholm \u2014 and not far from the Arctic Circle \u2014 whose population of 30,000 lives and breathes hockey and whose most famous alumni include NHL greats Peter Forsberg, Henrik and Daniel Sedin, and Markus Naslund.",
      "Initially it was something of a culture shock to her.",
      "\u201cI had no prior experience of hitting at all,\u201d the 25-year-old Bellefontaine said, \u201cand we went right into the season so it took me a while to get into it \u2026 it was tough but now it\u2019s just fun.\u201d",
      "Safer, too.",
      "Statistics supplied by the Swedish women\u2019s league show the number of concussions sustained by players has dropped since 2018, when its \u201cProject Zero Vision\u201d was launched. There were 35 reported concussions in the 2018-19 regular season, 10 in 2022-23 and 15 in 2023-24. By Jan. 8 this year, which was approaching the end of the regular season, there had been six.",
      "Preventing concussions was the main driver behind the introduction of checking, as counterintuitive as that may seem. It has forced players to skate with their heads up, increasing their ice awareness.",
      "There have been other benefits of bringing back checking, which was part of the game in women\u2019s hockey in Europe and North America until the mid-1980s but isn\u2019t in the International Ice Hockey Federation\u2019s current rule book. Coaches, league officials and fans say the speed of the Swedish game has gotten quicker, as players make smarter and faster decisions.",
      "For many, it restores the balance between skill and physicality that is important in making the sport an entertaining watch.",
      "\u201cIt creates some tension in the game that you otherwise don\u2019t get,\u201d said Luc de Keijzer, a 27-year-old student who is a regular at MoDo games.",
      "One big hope is that increased physical play makes Sweden more competitive at the international level against traditional hockey powers like the United States, Canada and Finland. Sweden's women's team regularly goes deep in world championships and Olympic Games but hasn't won the gold medal at either tournament.",
      "For some female players, the biggest effect has been to make them feel more empowered. That\u2019s because they are essentially following the same rules as the men, except for one key difference: hits on open ice \u2014 when players are skating freely away from the boards \u2014 are forbidden in women\u2019s hockey.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to close the gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s hockey, so this is one way we are doing it \u2014 to have similar rules as they do,\u201d said Alexie Guay, another Canadian playing for MoDo. \u201cIt\u2019s not as intense and there are different rules still \u2014 I don\u2019t know if there will be fighting in women\u2019s hockey in the future \u2014 but we\u2019re definitely closing the gap and I think it\u2019s a cool thing.\u201d",
      "According to research by Lund University in Sweden, 88% of the 159 players from the league who responded to a questionnaire said they were in favor of checking.",
      "Jared Cipparone, the coach of MoDo\u2019s women\u2019s team, said he hasn\u2019t encountered any resistance from his players about checking.",
      "\u201cEveryone was excited about it,\u201d said Cipparone, who is also from Canada. \u201cThe first year was trial and fire for many, but last year and this year you see the significance it\u2019s made in the game and I\u2019ve only heard good things about it.\u201d",
      "At MoDo\u2019s home game against HV71 at Hagglunds Arena in early January, a MoDo player was almost knocked off her skates by a full-body hit. Many others were smashed into the boards but went on with the game. There were no roughing penalties and certainly no brawling.",
      "The 5-foot-7 Bellefontaine, who describes herself as \u201cpretty small,\u201d has had to adapt her game. She said she trains harder, watches what she eats to \u201cbulk up a little bit\u201d and is making use of the sauna in her apartment for post-match recovery.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely squeezing my core a little more,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore, I wouldn\u2019t even expect to be hit so now it\u2019s head on a swivel, always looking, always watching, and just being ready to take a hit. You have to make sure you\u2019re not in a position to jeopardize yourself.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely changed the way we play and made us better players.\u201d",
      "USA Hockey and Hockey Canada do not allow checking in girls and women's hockey. In Sweden, body checking is part of the rules for boys and girls starting at the age of 12. League officials say being educated so early prepares players for when they are older.",
      "MoDo fan Marie Johansson said her 18-year-old daughter, Amanda, started with checking from age 12, initially while playing with boys.",
      "\u201cAll parents are worried about their children getting injured,\u201d Johansson said, \u201cbut when they learn to do the checking, they train a lot, they learn how to hold their heads up high, and she learnt how to avoid injuries. I don\u2019t think because she\u2019s a girl I\u2019ve been more worried than if she\u2019d been a boy.\u201d",
      "Morgan Johansson, an official who helped to launch the Zero Vision project, said he has shared information with the IIHF and the PWHL about the effects the rule change has had on the Swedish league. Norwegian and Danish leagues have also contacted him.",
      "Last year, the IIHF had PWHL officials in North America outline the league\u2019s rules on checking and officiating in a potential first step to modify its rulebook and provide a new standard at international competitions, league vice president of hockey operations Jayna Hefford said.",
      "Contacted by the AP, the IIHF said its rulebook \u201cdoes not prohibit competitive body contact between players\u201d but noted its staff was working with its membership \"to clarify the interpretation of this part in women\u2019s hockey.\u201d",
      "As for the Swedes, they are happy to have made the bold step that others are starting to follow.",
      "\u201cWe are kind of a trailblazer when it comes to women\u2019s hockey in challenging the old structures that said, \u2018Women can\u2019t,\u2019\u201d said Angelica Lindeberg, operations manager for the Swedish league. \u201cNow we say, of course they can. We are very proud of that.\u201d",

      "The German leader spoke with just eight days before crucial elections in Germany, with polls showing the far-right Alternative for Germany party currently in second.",
      "Vance said Friday at the Munich Security Conference that he fears free speech is \u201cin retreat\u201d across the continent.",
      "\u201cGermany is a very strong democracy, and as a strong democracy, we are absolutely clear that the extreme right should be out of political control and out of political decision making processes, and that there will be no cooperation with them,\" Scholz said. \"We really reject any idea of cooperation between parties, other parties and this extreme right parties.\u201d",
      "A day earlier, Vance said that many Americans saw in Europe \"entrenched interests hiding behind ugly Soviet-era words like misinformation and disinformation, who simply don\u2019t like the idea that somebody with an alternative viewpoint might express a different opinion or, God forbid, vote a different way, or even worse, win an election.\u201d",

      "Trump has threatened 25% tariffs on most Canadian imports, with another 10% on Canadian oil, natural gas and electricity. They were put on hold for a month early this month. He also has said Canada \u201cwould be much better off\u201d being the 51st U.S. state.",

      "Canada's current maple leaf flag, with the ensign of the United Kingdom removed, officially appeared on Feb. 15, 1965.",
      "Miller said its simple design makes it easily acceptable to Canadians of various backgrounds.",
      "\u201cThe fact the flag isn\u2019t littered with symbols and references to our past ... has made it adaptable across a really dynamic period in our history,\u201d he said."

      "The competition to name the twin cubs, born Aug. 15, launched Saturday following a celebratory ceremony attended by Hong Kong leader John Lee and other officials at Ocean Park, the theme park that houses the twins, their parents and two other giant pandas that arrived from mainland China last year.

      "The trio were abducted from one of the hardest-hit communities in southern Israel during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 attack that ignited the devastating war.",
      "The Hamas-linked Prisoners\u2019 Information Office said Friday that 369 Palestinians were set to be released from Israeli prisons on Saturday. It said 36 of those were serving life sentences.",
      "It will be the sixth swap since the ceasefire took effect on Jan. 19. So far, 21 hostages and over 730 Palestinian prisoners have been freed during the first phase of the truce.",
      "Horn, Dekel Chen and Troufanov were abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz, where some 80 of roughly 400 residents were taken hostage during the Oct. 7 attack.",

      "Among the most prominent Palestinian prisoners set to be released is Ahmed Barghouti, 48, a close aide of Marwan Barghouti, a militant leader and iconic Palestinian political figure.",
      "Israel sentenced Ahmed Barghouti to life on charges that he dispatched suicide bombers during the Second Intifada, or Palestinian uprising, in the early 2000s to carry out attacks that killed Israeli civilians. He was arrested alongside Marwan Barghouti in 2002.",
      "Of the 251 people abducted, 73 remain in Gaza, around half of whom are believed to be dead. Nearly all the remaining hostages are men, including Israeli soldiers.",
      "Concern has been growing about the remaining hostages\u2019 condition, particularly after the release of three last Saturday, who emerged looking emaciated and frail.",
      "One of them, 65-year-old Keith Siegel, said Friday in a video message addressed to Trump that his captors treated him worse as the 15-month war intensified, kicking him, spitting on him and holding him without water or light.",
      "The ceasefire appeared dangerously close to collapse in recent days.",
      "Hamas had said it would delay the release of the hostages after accusing Israel of not adhering to their agreement by not allowing in enough shelters, medical supplies, fuel and heavy equipment for clearing rubble. Israel said it would resume fighting Saturday unless hostages were freed.",
      "While the immediate crisis may have been averted, the truce faces a much bigger challenge with the deal\u2019s first phase set to conclude in early March. There have not yet been substantive negotiations over the second phase, in which Hamas would release all remaining hostages in return for an end to the war.",
      "At its height, the fighting displaced 90% of Gaza\u2019s population of 2.3 million. Hundreds of thousands have since returned to their homes as the ceasefire took hold, though many found only rubble, buried human remains and unexploded ordnance.",
      "The war has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "Trump\u2019s proposal to remove some 2 million Palestinians from Gaza and settle them elsewhere in the region has thrown the truce\u2019s future into further doubt.",
      "The idea has been welcomed by Israel\u2019s government. But it has been strongly rejected by Palestinians and Arab countries. Human rights groups say it could amount to a war crime under international law.",
      "Trump has proposed that once the fighting ends, Israel would transfer control of Gaza to the United States, which would then redevelop it as the \u201cRiviera of the Middle East.\u201d",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s far-right allies are already calling for a resumption of the war after the first phase with the goal of destroying Hamas and implementing Trump\u2019s plan. The militant group remains in control of the territory after surviving one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history.",
      "Hamas may be unwilling to release any more hostages if it believes the war will resume. The captives are among the only bargaining chips it has left."

      "Serbia\u2019s striking students and supporters of populist President Aleksandar Vucic have planned parallel rallies as both mark the country\u2019s Statehood Day with notably contrasting messages",
      "KRAGUJEVAC, Serbia -- Serbia\u2019s striking students and supporters of populist President Aleksandar Vucic have planned parallel rallies on Saturday as both mark the country's Statehood Day with notably contrasting messages.",
      "The student-led protest is the latest in a nationwide anti-graft movement that reflects mounting calls for fundamental political changes in the Balkan state, triggered after a concrete canopy on a railway station in the northern city of Novi Sad collapsed on Nov. 1, killing 15 people.",
      "The rally, in the central industrial city of Kragujevac, is set to draw tens of thousands of people who, bedsides demanding justice over a fatal accident, have been asking to root out rampant endemic corruption and respect for the rule of law.",
      "Students chose Kragujevac for Saturday's rally because of its history; In 1835, Serbia was still part of the Ottoman Empire. People in Kragujevac announced a new constitution that sought to limit the powers of the then-rulers. The date is now celebrated as the Statehood Day.",
      "The students arrived at the city on Friday and were met with cheers and support by the residents. Ahead of Saturday's protest, they organized marches in various parts of the country, encouraging people to converge in Kragujevac. Some walked, others ran or cycled. Along their journey, people greeted them with food and refreshments and offered accommodation, many crying and expressing hope for change.",
      "Meanwhile, in Sremska Mitrovica, a small town northwest of Belgrade, Vucic is expected to recycle a traditional nationalist theme, warning that the West wants to unseat him by force and that this could lead to the breakup of the country.",
      "Serbian authorities are expected to bus in thousands of their supporters from throughout Serbia as well as Bosnia to Sremska Mitrovica on Saturday. Some opposition activists have said they will try to prevent their arrival.",
      "The anti-graft movement is Vucic's biggest challenge in recent years. The president \u2014 who has ruled Serbia with a firm grip on power for more than a decade\u2014 and his right-wing Serbian Progressive Party have been previously accused of stifling democratic freedoms, publicly discrediting opponents and rigging elections, according to international vote observers.",
      "The canopy disaster, widely believed to have happened due to government corruption, has become a flashpoint for wider discontent with the authoritarian rule, with university students at the forefront of the anti-graft uprising. Their determination, youth and creativity have struck a cord among people widely disillusioned with politicians.",
      "Prosecutors have charged 13 people over the canopy fall, and protests have forced the resignation of Serbia\u2019s prime minister. But students have said their protests will continue until their demands for full accountability are met.",
      "In the past three months, the president has shifted between accusing the students of working for foreign powers to offering concessions and claiming he has fulfilled each of their demands. But during a trip to the Serb-controlled part of neighboring Bosnia this week, Vucic has reiterated claims about an alleged plot from abroad to overthrow him and his government.",
      "The authorities, Vucic said, \u201ccouldn\u2019t believe how much money has been invested to bring down the government in Serbia.\u201d He offered no proof for the claims.",
      "Vucic's trip to the Serb-controlled part of Bosnia was apparently designed to stress Serbian unity with the Serbs in Bosnia, where a bid to create a pan-Serb state in the 1990s\u2019 was widely blamed for triggering a bloody war that left more than 100,000 people killed and millions displaced.",

However, little progress has been made since the government dismissed a ceasefire that M23 declared last wee unilaterally as false.",

The U.N. refugee agency has said that shelling and looting have already destroyed 70,000 emergency shelters, leaving those displaced with few places to go.",

      "As Navalny aspired to public office, authorities responded by bringing multiple criminal charges against him, his allies and even relatives. Regularly jailed, he was physically attacked by Kremlin supporters, one of whom threw green dye in his face that nearly cost him the vision in one eye.",
      "He finished second in the race for Moscow mayor in 2013 amid allegations of vote rigging. In 2017, he announced plans to run for president and set up a sprawling network of regional offices across the country, recruiting local activists. When he was eventually barred from running, he kept those offices open, extending his reach across Russia\u2019s 11 time zones.",
      "In 2020, Navalny was poisoned with a nerve agent attack he blamed on the Kremlin, which always denied involvement. His family and allies fought to have him flown to Germany for treatment and recovery. Five months later, he returned to Russia, where he was immediately arrested and imprisoned for the last three years of his life.",
      "But even behind bars, in incredibly harsh conditions of constant pressure and surveillance, Navalny found a way to relay messages. His popular social media accounts were regularly updated with sarcastic vignettes about prison life and political statements.",
      "Authorities blamed Navalny's death, announced Feb. 16, 2024, on natural causes \u2014 a sudden spike in blood pressure and chronic diseases. His family and allies reject that and insist he was killed on orders from the Kremlin \u2014 accusations its officials deny.",
      "Tens of thousands of people attended his funeral in Moscow on March 1 in a rare show of defiance in a country where any street rally or even single pickets often result in immediate arrest. For days afterward, people brought flowers to his grave.",
      "Longtime ally Vladimir Ashurkov described Navalny as \u201ca political figure that basically defined the generation of Russians over the last 15 years.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile he was alive, even from prison, he was raising his voice against the war and against Putin\u2019s tyranny,\u201d Ashurkov told AP in London.",
      "His widow, Yulia Navalnaya, has vowed to continue his fight. She has recorded regular video addresses to her supporters and has met Western leaders and top officials, advocating for Russians who oppose Putin and his war in Ukraine.",
      "Navalny\u2019s Anti-Corruption Foundation continues to expose corruption in Russia in colorful videos and organizes occasional protests abroad, condemning Putin and the war in Ukraine.",
      "A landmark East-West prisoner swap in August freed other key dissidents like Ilya Yashin and Vladimir Kara-Murza, promising to reinvigorate the opposition movement unmoored by Navalny\u2019s death. So far, however, they haven\u2019t gone beyond meetings with Western officials and supporters in exile, or a few rallies -\u2013 actions unlikely to dent Putin\u2019s war effort or his ever-growing crackdowns that sweep up remaining dissidents and ordinary Russians alike.",
      "Ashurkov describes the situation in Russia and Ukraine now as \u201cdark times\u201d and \u201cdifficult times.\u201d",
      "But he notes that Navalny went through many difficulties and pressure in his life.",
      "\"His advice and his motivation to all of us has been, \u2018Don\u2019t sit still. Try to do something to change the situation, and be prepared for change\u2019,\u201d he said.",

      "The home of Albania\u2019s late communist dictator Enver Hoxha is hosting international artists fascinated by the long-ruling leader\u2019s library, the country\u2019s history of isolation and its unique traditions",
      "TIRANA, Albania -- In a historical twist, the home of Albania\u2019s late communist dictator Enver Hoxha is hosting international artists fascinated by the long-ruling leader\u2019s library, the country\u2019s history of isolation and its unique traditions.",
      "The metamorphosis of Villa 31 \u2014 where the Hoxha family lived for decades until his regime was toppled in 1990, five years after his death \u2014 encapsulates Albania\u2019s radical transformation from one of the world\u2019s most hermetic countries into the modern society it is today.",
      "The sprawling, 4,000 square meter (43,000 square foot) house with more than 100 rooms, built in the 1970s in the capital of Tirana, was a heavily guarded place of power where Hoxha both ruled and feared his own people. Albania's ruler was known for his paranoid behavior and saw enemies everywhere.",
      "Now surrounded by high-rises, trendy bars, posh restaurants and pulsating nightclubs, the villa itself has undergone a transformation, complete with a fresh coat of paint \u2014 though the ostentatious downstairs hall with marble floors is still there.",
      "Gone are the heavy curtains that blocked sunlight. Long silent walls will from now on echo with poetry readings, experimental theater, film screenings and contemporary art exhibits. The rooms offer workshops and shared areas for 23 artists from 15 countries.",
      "The villa's rebirth stems from a pledge by Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama to visiting French President Emmanuel Macron in October 2023 to turn it into an artists\u2019 center \u2014 \u201csomething that would make Enver Hoxha roll in his grave.\u201d",
      "Closed off to the public until now, the villa has welcomed artists, residing there since late January, and hopes to soon see tourists too.",
      "\u201cThis is what I believe is the power of art, to deal with a past and a painful past, like the one that this villa symbolizes,\u201d said Nita Deda, manager of Art Explora, a French-based foundation that spearheaded the building's transformation.",
      "Inside the studios that replaced once labyrinthine apartments, visiting artists have the freedom to \u201cexpress everything, from fury to anger, to betrayal, to ambivalence, to the absurd ... exactly his (Hoxha's) worst nightmare,\u201d said Ukrainian artist Stanislava Pinchuk.",
      "Pinchuk, 37, says she is happy to come to Albania, the \u201clast puzzle piece\u201d of former communist countries, though she finds it difficult to sleep at the villa.",
      "She is baffled by Hoxha's library, which holds books by his communist idols \u2014 Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Joseph Stalin and Vladimir Lenin \u2014 to books about the French Revolution and students\u2019 protests in the former Czechoslovakia and Hungary in the 1950s and 1960s. There are also books on sex, which ordinary Albanians were banned from reading at the time.",
      "The library was a testament to \u201can ideology refusing to die,\" Pinchuk said.",
      "Reading \u201cKanun,\u201d a book on Albanian customs, Italian artist Genny Petrotta, 34, marveled at the practice of sworn virgins \u2014 a centuries-old tradition in which women declared themselves to be men so they could enjoy the same rights within the society that men enjoyed, though they did not considering themselves transgender.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a story about power,\" Petrotta said, adding that she was \u201cimpressed by the analytical way\u201d the book described the phenomenon.",
      "The villa\u2019s underground tunnels, built as shelters in case of an attack, also fascinated the visiting artists. Their exhibit will open in April, and Albanians, no longer fearful of the late dictator, will be able to view the art.",
      "Under Hoxha's repressive regime, some 100,000 Albanians were imprisoned, sent to internment camps or executed during the 46 years of his repressive regime.",
      "Albania today has seen its economy and society develop rapidly, and 10 million tourists visited the country last year.",
      "Some, however, disagree with Villa 31's transformation, and say it should have stayed untouched, a history lesson for the tourists and generations born long after Hoxha's regime collapsed.",
      "Xhevdet Lani, a taxi driver and an older resident of Tirana, said the villa is \u201chistoric evidence of what the dictatorship once was.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt would have been better if it had remained for generations so that our children and grandchildren could learn from it,\u201d he said."

      "Many were from the Afrikaner community that Trump focused on in an executive order a week ago that cut aid and assistance to the Black-led South African government. In the order, Trump said South Africa's Afrikaners, who are descendants of mainly Dutch colonial settlers, were being targeted by a new law that allows the government to expropriate private land.",
      "The South African government has denied its new law is tied to race and says Trump's claims over the country and the law have been full of misinformation and distortions.",
      "Trump said land was being expropriated from Afrikaners \u2014 which the order referred to as \"racially disfavored landowners\" \u2014 when no land has been taken under the law. Trump also announced a plan to offer Afrikaners refugee status in the U.S. They are only one part of South Africa's white minority.",
      "In a speech to Parliament this week, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the forced removal of any people from their land will never be allowed in South Africa again after millions of Blacks were dispossessed of property under the apartheid system of white minority rule and hundreds of years of colonialism before that.",
      "\u201cThe people of this country know the pain of forced removals,\" Ramaphosa said. He said the land law does not allow any arbitrary taking of land and only refers to land that can be redistributed for the public good.",

      "White protesters on Saturday held banners referencing the expropriation law but also other affirmative action policies put in place by the government since the end of apartheid in 1994 to advance opportunities for Blacks. Those laws, known as Black Economic Empowerment, have been a source of frustration for some white people.",
      "Influential Trump adviser Elon Musk \u2014 who was raised in South Africa \u2014 has also criticized South Africa\u2019s government and claimed it is anti-white for years, although some have questioned his motivations.

      "Associated Press journalists witnessed scores of residents cheering on the M23 rebels in central Bukavu on Sunday morning as they walked and drove around the city center after a dayslong march from the region's major city of Goma 63 miles (101 kilometers) away, which they captured late last month. Several parts of the city, however, remained deserted with residents indoors.",

      "It was not clear if the rebels had taken decisive control of the city of about 1.3 million people. Their presence in central Bukavu is an unprecedented expansion of the rebels' reach in their yearslong fighting with Congolese forces. Unlike in 2012 when they only seized Goma in the fighting connected to ethnic tension, analysts have said the rebels this time are eyeing political power.",

      "The fighting in Congo has connections with a decadeslong ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda militia group.

The Kremlin has in recent years deepened ties with the gold- and diamond-rich country's military and government.",

      "\u201cWe searched without success for where they took them,\u201d he said, noting that supporters had inquired with both law enforcement and Russian security contractors about their whereabouts. \u201cThey said they had nothing to offer us and knew nothing of their situation.\u201d",
      "Mizedio, a member of one of Central African Republic's opposition parties, said there had been marches and protests decrying the arrests in the country's southeast.",
      "Neither Wagner nor the military responded to AP's requests for comment on the disappearance. However, a police officer, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said mercenaries were gradually vying for position and replacing officers on the ground in conflict zones.",
      "Before going missing, the two had come to the capital to open new bank accounts to access their earnings after being integrated into the army. The backlash against their disappearance comes as Russia expands its military and economic presence throughout Africa, using mercenaries to quell rebellion and fight extremists.",
      "Joseph Bindoumi, president of Central African Republic\u2019s League for Human Rights, denounced the disappearances, called them kidnappings and said even if the soldiers were accused of crimes, their whereabouts should be known.",
      "\u201cWe have the right to know if standard procedures are being followed. We have the right to see people to ensure their well-being and to ensure their parents, advocates and lawyers can visit them,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cWe are outraged to understand the Russians' idea to train the Azande Ani Kpi Gbe militiamen was to control their movement and decapitate them,\u201d said Robert Mboli, an Obo resident, referring to the disappeared soldiers' militia. \u201cWe will demonstrate until they explain what they blame them for.\u201d",
      "Central African Republic was one of the first places the mercenaries became active. Amid years of conflict between government forces and predominantly Muslim rebels, citizens and officials credited the Russian mercenaries with fighting back armed groups who tried to overtake Bangui in 2021.",
      "Yet they've been dogged by reports of recklessly disregarding human rights and civilian welfare. A 2023 investigation from the U.S.-based watchdog group The Sentry found that mercenaries train the army on torture tactics and as part of the fight against armed groups opposed to the government had carried out killings, torture and rape."

      "Utah\u2019s Republican governor has signed a collective bargaining ban that experts are calling one of the most restrictive labor laws in the country, despite overwhelming opposition from union members",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Utah's Republican governor on Friday signed a collective bargaining ban that experts are calling one of the most restrictive labor laws in the country, despite overwhelming opposition from union members.",
      "Beginning July 1, unions serving Utah teachers, firefighters, police officers, transit workers and other public employees will be banned from negotiating on their behalf for better wages and working conditions.",
      "Gov. Spencer Cox announced his decision Friday evening following a week of rallies outside his office in which thousands of union members from the public and private sector urged him to veto the bill. The Republican-controlled Legislature had narrowly approved it last week after its sponsors abandoned a proposed compromise that would have removed the outright ban.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m disappointed that, in this case, the process did not ultimately deliver the compromise that at one point was on the table and that some stakeholders had accepted,\" Cox said in a statement announcing he had signed the bill.",
      "The measure did not pass with veto-proof margins, meaning that if Cox had rejected it, Republican supporters would have needed to pull in more support to override his veto.",
      "Utah joins North Carolina and South Carolina as the most restrictive states for public sector unions, said John Logan, a labor expert at San Francisco State University.",
      "Many educators, who are the state\u2019s most frequent users of collective bargaining, view the new law as way for Republicans to curb the political influence of teachers unions and clear a path for their own education agenda.",
      "Its GOP sponsors argued it was needed to allow employers to engage directly with all employees, instead of communicating through a union representative.",
      "The Utah Education Association, the state\u2019s largest public education employees\u2019 union, criticized Cox for ignoring the many workers who urged him to issue a veto. The union is exploring a possible ballot referendum to try to overturn the law, though the effort would come with a high price tag.",
      "\u201cDespite overwhelming opposition, Governor Spencer Cox and the Legislature ignored the voices of thousands,\u201d the union said in a statement. \u201cThis is a blatant attack on public employees and our right to advocate for the success of our profession and students.\u201d",
      "Cox's decision comes as President Donald Trump is working to gut the U.S. Education Department to the greatest extent of his power by slashing spending and pressuring employees to quit.",
      "The governor signed another bill Friday prohibiting transgender college students from living in dorms consistent with their gender identity.",
      "Students at the state\u2019s public colleges and universities will only be allowed to enter or live in a gendered space, such as a dorm building, locker room or bathroom, that corresponds with their sex assigned at birth. It's the first transgender restriction explicitly aimed at university housing, though some states have broad bathroom laws that could be interpreted to apply to dorms."

      "It's the latest group of Amazon employees to side against union representation.",
      "Workers at an Amazon warehouse in North Carolina rejected a proposal to unionize, becoming the latest group of the company\u2019s employees to side against union representation.",
      "About three-quarters of employees at an Amazon fulfillment center in Garner, a town located near Raleigh, voted against joining a grassroots labor organization called Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment, the National Labor Relations Board announced Saturday.",
      "The federal labor agency said 2,447 workers cast ballots against union representation while 829 voted in favor of joining the independent union, which is made up of former and current Amazon workers. The NLRB had said 4,300 Amazon workers were eligible to cast ballots in the election, which took place Monday through Saturday.",
      "Rev. Ryan Brown, a former Amazon worker who co-founded the group, said Saturday, \u201cWe had already braced ourselves for a loss.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe knew that historically the tide was against us to have a win for several reasons,\u201d Brown said. \u201cOne, we\u2019re in the South. Two, the average worker that\u2019s in North Carolina knows nothing about a union and the benefits of a union and what a union could do for them.\u201d",
      "The outcome came just weeks after workers at a Whole Foods Market store in Pennsylvania voted to unionize, leading to the first successful entry of organized labor into the grocery chain, which Amazon owns. Following the union win, Whole Foods asked the NLRB to toss out the election results, arguing the voting process was tainted.",
      "In 2022, workers at an Amazon warehouse in the New York City borough of Staten Island unionized with Amazon Labor Union, which joined forces with the Teamsters last year. However, Amazon has objected to the election result and refused to negotiate over a contract.",
      "At the same time, the company has also been able to successfully fend off union victories at a second warehouse on Staten Island, as well as at facilities near Albany, New York, and in Bessemer, Alabama.",
      "In November, an NLRB administrative law judge ordered a third union election for Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer after determining that the company committed six violations leading up to a rerun election in March 2022. That rerun was held after the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which is seeking to represent Amazon workers in Bessemer, filed objections to the first election, which results in a union loss.",
      "Workers affiliated with Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment, or CAUSE, have been organizing at the North Carolina warehouse since January 2022. Co-founder Brown said in an interview last month he started organizing because he felt like Amazon was not providing workers adequate protections against COVID-19.",
      "The company said Saturday that Amazon already offers what many unions are requesting, such as safe and inclusive workplaces and competitive pay.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re glad that our team in Garner was able to have their voices heard, and that they chose to keep a direct relationship with Amazon,\" Amazon spokesperson Eileen Hards said in a written statement.",

The city's eventual goal, mandated by Beijing, is to eliminate subdivided apartments over the next 25 years.",
      "Officials are aiming to pass the rules into law within the year. After that, landlords will have a grace period to make their substandard flats meet the bar.

      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk met during Modi's visit to the U.S., where he spoke with Trump about trade and tariff concerns",
      "NEW DELHI -- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk during his visit to the U.S. to meet President Donald Trump. The exact nature of the meeting is unclear, although Modi said on X that the two men \u201cdiscussed various issues, including those he is passionate about such as space, mobility, technology and innovation.\u201d",
      "Musk was recently chosen by Trump to head a new U.S. Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",

      "Modi and Musk met each other on Thursday during the Indian prime minister\u2019s visit to the U.S. While Musk was accompanied by his three young children, Modi was notably flanked by his top advisers \u2014 including External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval.",
      "Later, at a joint press conference with Modi at the White House, Trump said he wasn\u2019t sure why Musk met the Indian prime minister but he assumed Musk \"wants to do business in India.\u201d",

      "India\u2019s foreign ministry in a statement said Modi and Musk \u201cdiscussed strengthening collaboration between Indian and U.S. entities in innovation, space exploration, artificial intelligence and sustainable development\u201d and on \u201centrepreneurship and good governance.\u201d",
      "Musk, who previously called himself a \u201cfan of Modi,\" has long wanted his Starlink satellite internet service to make an entry into the Indian market. Its launch, however, has been delayed due to regulatory challenges, security concerns and opposition from domestic telecom giants like Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio.",
      "Last November, India\u2019s telecoms minister, Jyotiraditya Scindia, said Starlink was yet to comply with security norms, and a license for satellite communications services will be issued only after the company meets all the requirements.",
      "Musk had earlier criticized India's policy of granting spectrum for satellite services through auctioning. The Indian government later changed the policy and said it will assign satellite spectrum and not auction it.",
      "India\u2019s satellite broadband service market is highly competitive. At least six companies control the market, led by Ambani\u2019s Reliance Jio.",
      "Apart from regulatory roadblocks, Musk's Starlink has also faced resistance by Reliance Jio, which last year said granting spectrum for satellite services through auctioning is necessary to ensure fair competition.",
      "Musk\u2019s Starlink has at least 6,900 active satellites orbiting Earth that provide low-latency broadband to some 4.6 million people. But if Musk wants to enter the Indian market, Starlink's high pricing could be a concern.",
      "Mobile data in India is among the cheapest globally, and Ambani's Jio once gave data for free on its mobile plans. And yet, at least 40% of the country\u2019s more than 1.4 billion people still don\u2019t have access to the internet. Cheap satellite broadband is needed to bridge this gap, particularly in India\u2019s vast remote and mountainous areas.",

      "Valentine's day and the whiff of chocolate and cocoa are in the air",
      "BRUGES, Belgium -- St. Valentine chocolates always seek to show how deep your love is. This year, it might just also show how deep your pockets are.",
      "With the price of cocoa beans setting unprecedented records on the commodities market, it will certainly turn the gift of love into a bigger financial commitment than it once was. Turns out that if love is reputed to be eternal, a low price for cocoa, the essential ingredient in chocolate, is not.",
      "\u201cThe price increase of cocoa is absolutely spectacular, now for 2, 2\u00bd years,\u201d said Philippe de Sellier, the head of both Leonidas and Belgian chocolate federation Choprabisco. When it stood at less than $2,000 a ton in the summer of 2022, it really took over early last year and peaked at well over $12,000 during the Christmas season and has been hovering around the $10,000 mark since.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing unprecedented prices. They haven't been this high for the last 50 years,\u201d said Bart Van Besien, policy adviser of the Oxfam fair trade group. And the impact can be felt deep in chocolate gourmet country Belgium, where some of its 280 chocolate companies are left with a bleeding heart during Valentine's week.",
      "Dominque Persoone, owner of the famed Chocolate Line brand, still has plenty of beans to grind in his workshop in Bruges, but considers himself lucky, partly because he also has his own cocoa plantation in Mexico.",
      "\u201cI have a lot of colleagues who are really in trouble, because the price is too high,\" he said. \u201cIf you don't have good contacts, they just don't deliver anymore.\u201d",
      "Some just close for Valentine, he said, turning one of the few financial bonanzas of the year into a forced vacation, hoping that Easter, with its eggs and bunnies, will bring better tidings. Many chocolatiers can't go for the usual profit margins and turn all the extra costs of the cocoa prices over to their customers. Persoone said that his chocolates increased in price by 20% over the last year alone while de Selliers said that it depends very much from producer to producer.",
      "The shock of cocoa prices pretty much is a metaphorical perfect storm, mixing climate, disease, commodity speculation, the plight of farmers and social ascendency around the world into one heady mix.",
      "\u201cThe drop that has happened now in production was directly linked to climate change,\u201d said Van Besien, blaming changes in annual rain and drought patterns in western Africa that weakened the sensitive trees in key production areas. Persoone also said that the temperature differences between night and day increased in the small strip of land around the equator where the trees can thrive. Compounded by disease, it made sure too many harvests failed.",
      "At the same time across the world, populations lifted themselves out of poverty, middle classes expanded in places like China and the craving for the delicacy increased.",
      "And making matters worse, the years of slumping prices for the beans simply drove farmers off the land to look for a better future in the cities and pushed production further down. De Selliers said that \u201c60 % of cocoa comes from Ivory Coast and Ghana and these farmers have to make a better living. It is extremely important.\u201d",
      "Persoone concurred: \u201cWe didn't pay enough to have an honest price for the farmers.\u201d",
      "So, strangely enough, low prices then, help cause high prices now.",
      "\u201cThe big irony in the cocoa industry is that farmers are now getting a fair price at the moment they are abandoning cocoa farming,\u201d Van Besien said. \u201cWith the price they are getting right now, they could have invested in sustainable practices. They could have sent their children to school.\u201d",
      "Does it mean a premier box of chocolates is a guilty pleasure on Valentine's Day?",
      "\u201cYeah, the guilt question .... It's one that always works,\u201d said Van Besien, the fair trade expert. \u201cWe could not survive if we would be thinking about these things all the time,\u201d arguing that legislation should trump consumer emotions.",
      "\u201cWe should have laws that make buying cocoa below the cost of the production something illegal. And it should not be up to the consumer to make this decision,\u201d he said. Both de Selliers and Persoone hope that if the prices drop down again, they stay around the $5,000 or $6,000 mark.",
      "\u201cI really, really hope the money goes to the farmers,\u201d Persoone said.",
      "So in the meantime, despite the price hikes, the chocolate shouldn't leave too bitter a taste.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a small luxury that most people still can afford,\u201d Persoone said. \"I hope it stays like this.\u201d",

      "In a video posted on X, Administrator Lee Zeldin said the EPA would revoke contracts for a still-emerging \u201cgreen bank\u201d that is set to fund tens of thousands of projects to fight climate change and promote environmental justice.",
      "The program, approved under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, is formally known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, but is more commonly called the green bank. Two initiatives, worth $14 billion and $6 billion respectively, are intended to offer competitive grants to nonprofits, community development banks and other groups for projects with a focus on disadvantaged communities.",
      "The program is a favorite of Democrats who passed President Joe Biden's signature climate law without a single Republican vote, and former EPA Administrator Michael Regan frequently cited it as one of his major accomplishments.",
      "Republicans in Congress have called the green bank a \u201cslush fund\u201d and voiced concern over how the money will be used and whether there will be sufficient accountability and transparency. The Republican-controlled House approved a bill last year to repeal the green bank and other parts of Biden\u2019s climate agenda. The bill was blocked in the Democratic-controlled Senate.",
      "Zeldin, in the video posted Wednesday night, said there will be \u201czero tolerance of any waste and abuse\u201d at the EPA under his administration. He cited \u201can extremely disturbing video\u201d on X that features a former EPA staffer stating that the Biden administration was \u201ctossing gold bars off the Titanic\u201d in order to spend billions of taxpayer dollars before President Donald Trump took office.",
      "\u201cThe days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cI\u2019ve directed my team to find your gold bars, and they found them. Now we will get them back inside of control of government as we pursue next steps.\"",
      "The video Zeldin cited was posted by Project Veritas, a right-wing organization that often uses hidden cameras to try to embarrass news outlets, labor organizations and Democratic officials. In this case, the Veritas video showed Brent Efron, a former EPA special adviser for implementation, speaking at a bar or restaurant with someone who turned out to be with the group. Efron has since left the EPA.",
      "Clean energy advocates denounced Zeldin's action as a political stunt and said he was illegally attempting to revoke spending approved by Congress for partisan reasons. They pledged to challenge the directive in court.",
      "\u201cThis is not just an attack on clean energy investments \u2014 it\u2019s a blatant violation of the Constitution,\" said Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen Action, an environmental group that supports the green bank. \u201cThe Trump team is once again trying to illegally slash programs meant to help American families to fund tax cuts for billionaires.\u201d",
      "The money has already been awarded to eight nonprofits, including the Coalition for Green Capital, Climate United Fund, Power Forward Communities, Opportunity Finance Network, Inclusiv and the Justice Climate Fund. Those organizations have partnered with a range of groups, including Rewiring America, Habitat for Humanity and the Community Preservation Corporation.",

      "Eggs Up Grill CEO Ricky Richardson said breakfast restaurants took off after the COVID pandemic because people longed for comfort and connection. As inflation made food more expensive, customers saw breakfast and lunch as more affordable options for eating out, he said.",
      "The growth in restaurant demand reverses a pattern that emerged during the pandemic, when consumers tried to stock up on eggs for home use but restaurants needed fewer of them, according to Brian Earnest, a lead economist for animal proteins at CoBank.",
      "Changing preferences since then have caused further market strain. Americans are increasingly looking for protein with few added ingredients, and eggs fit that bill.",
      "\u201cConsumers think eggs are really fresh, so if you\u2019re making something with eggs, you know it\u2019s fresh,\u201d Earnest said.",
      "To address animal rights concerns, McDonald\u2019s and some other companies have switched to 100% cage-free eggs, which limits the sources they will buy from. Ten states, including California and Colorado, have passed laws restricting egg sales to products from cage-free environments.",
      "\u201cIt makes the market much more complicated than it was 20 years ago,\u201d Earnest said.",
      "The higher prices are hitting restaurants hard. Wholesale egg prices hit a national average of $7.34 per dozen last week, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That was 51% higher than at the beginning of the year. Wholesale costs may be higher than retail prices since grocers use eggs as a loss leader to get customers in the door.",
      "Some chains, like Waffle House, have added a surcharge to help offset the cost of eggs. Others may turn to egg substitutes like tapioca starch for some recipes or cut egg dishes from the menu, said Phil Kafarakis, the president and CEO of the International Foodservice Manufacturers Association.",
      "First Watch President and CEO Chris Tomasso said eggs are critical for the chain's brand and are found in the majority of its offerings, whether at the center of the plate or as an ingredient in batters. So far, he said, the company has been able to obtain the eggs it needs and isn't charging extra for them.",
      "First Watch is also increasing portion sizes for non-egg items like meat and potatoes, Tomasso said.",
      "Richardson, of Eggs Up Grill, said he recently met with franchisees to discuss adding a surcharge but they decided against it.",
      "\u201cEggs have always been and will continue to be an important part of American diets,\u201d Richardson said.",

      "English cricket has generated more than 520 million pounds ($650 million) from the sale of stakes in franchises in its recently created competition The Hundred to big-business investors from India and the United States",
      "English cricket has generated around $650 million from the sale of stakes in franchises in The Hundred to big-business investors from India and the United States, including consortiums involving NFL great Tom Brady and Los Angeles Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly.",
      "Auctions held over the past two weeks drew bids that value the eight teams in The Hundred \u2014 a format similar to Twenty20 and launched in England only in 2021 \u2014 at more than $1.2 billion.",
      "English cricket officials confirmed the huge figures for the first time on Thursday and set out how they want the money spent. The priority? Safeguarding the future of the domestic game that has lurched into financial strife in recent years.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve reached a seminal moment for cricket in England and Wales,\u201d said Richard Thompson, chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board.",
      "The investors who secured stakes in the franchises range from Silicon Valley tech giants including Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, to four Indian conglomerates already owning teams in the widely popular Indian Premier League.",
      "Throw in the likes of Knighthead Capital Management, which includes Brady and already owns Birmingham City soccer club, and Cain International, a company co-funded by Boehly, and there's now a heavy dose of expertise in finance, technology and elite sport in a once-quaint sport that has been supercharged by money from around the world.",
      "It was 17 years ago when Allen Stanford, a Texan businessman, flew into Lord's \u2014 the so-called \u201chome of cricket\u201d in northwest London \u2014 aboard a private helicopter filled with fake dollar notes in a publicity stunt for a remarkable deal he reached with the ECB: A five-match T20 series between England and superstars from the Caribbean worth $100 million.",
      "The ECB were in raptures for a supposedly game-changing deal that quickly went wrong when Stanford was charged with \u2014 and later convicted of \u2014 fraud.",
      "So, has the ECB learnt its lessons after hitting the jackpot again?",
      "\u201cThis has probably been done in a different style \u2014 a bit more muted,\u201d ECB chief executive Richard Gould said on a video call. \u201cWe are very confident in the investor group we have got. ... We haven't been complacent.\u201d",
      "The ECB has done \u201cextensive due diligence\u201d and \u201call the checks to ensure it will be a different outcome\" to the Stanford debacle, director of business operations Vikram Banerjee said.",
      "The ECB seems open to that, yes.",
      "\u201cWe'd be foolish not to listen to the amazing set of investors that have got great ideas,\u201d Gould said. \u201cWe need to make sure we are a governing body that provides stability but also enables our investors and county clubs to drive forward.\u201d",
      "Gould made reference to the NFL taking games overseas and also the idea \u2014 floated around in 2008 but never adopted \u2014 of a 39th round of English Premier League games played abroad.",
      "No, the ECB insists.",
      "The governing body said it still owns The Hundred as a competition and felt it was important the \u201cstructure of the game is retained and owned by the ECB and our members (the counties).\u201d That means the schedule, the formats and the governance of English cricket.",
      "Expect, however, the new investors to make changes to their franchises when it comes to team names, colors and branding in The Hundred from 2026.",
      "Changing the times when matches are played \u2014 to potentially suit Indian audiences, for example \u2014 is \u201cnot on the agenda,\u201d Gould said, because securing strong attendances inside the stadiums is a priority.",
      "Banerjee said there was no intention to turn the Hundred \u2014 a format where each team receives a maximum of 100 balls \u2014 into a T20 competition but could envisage the competition having a second tier if there is enough growth.",
      "The ECB said the new investors have a \u201clock-in period\u201d of five years before they can sell their shares to other parties.",
      "The ECB said the deals, once finalized after an exclusivity period, will underpin \u201clong-term financial sustainability\u201d in the domestic game in England.",
      "Proceeds from the sales will be split 19 ways \u2014 between the 18 long-established county teams in the English and Welsh domestic game as well as the Marylebone Cricket Club, which owns Lord\u2019s and is regarded as the guardian of the laws of the game. The grassroots game is in line to receive around 50 million pounds ($62 million), the ECB said.",
      "\u201cOur three overarching principles as we look at what we want this investment to deliver should be strategic, ambitious and leaving a legacy,\u201d Thompson said in an open letter. \u201cWe may not get this chance again for at least a generation, and cannot afford to waste this golden opportunity.\u201d",
      "Thompson spoke of the money heading to \u201cthree core investment areas\u201d: Building reserves, revenue generation or debt reduction.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump says he\u2019ll sign an order that increases U.S. tariffs to the rates other countries charge on imports",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Thursday that he\u2019ll sign an order that increases U.S. tariffs to the rates other countries charge on imports.",
      "\u201cTODAY IS THE BIG ONE: RECIPROCAL TARIFFS!!!\u201d Trump posted on his social media site, Truth Social. \u201cMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\u201d",
      "The prospect of a dramatic hike on tariffs could send shockwaves through the world economy, possibly depressing growth while also causing inflation to intensify. Trump has maintained that such tariffs will help to create domestic factory jobs, but most economists say they would effectively be a tax increase on U.S. consumers that would add to inflationary pressures.",
      "The Republican president has openly antagonized multiple U.S. trading partners over the past several weeks, levying tariff threats and inviting them to retaliate with import taxes of their own that could send the economy hurtling into a trade war.",
      "Trump has put an additional 10% tariff on Chinese imports due that country's role in the production of the opioid fentanyl. He also has readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico, America's two largest trading partners, that could take effect in March after being suspended for 30 days. On top of that, on Monday, he removed the exemptions from his 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs. And he's mused about new tariffs on computer chips and pharmaceutical drugs.",
      "The European Union, Canada and Mexico have countermeasures ready to inflict economic pain on the United States in response to Trump's actions, while China has already taken retaliatory steps with its own tariffs on U.S. energy, agricultural machinery and large-engine autos as well as an antitrust investigation of Google.",
      "Trump has not specified how he defines the term \u201creciprocal\u201d and whether his order would apply only to matching tariffs or to including other foreign taxes that he views as a barrier to exporting American goods.",
      "The White House has argued that charging the same import taxes as other countries do would improve the fairness of trade, potentially raising revenues for the U.S. government while also enabling negotiations that could eventually improve trade.",
      "But Trump is also making a political wager that voters can tolerate higher inflation levels. Price spikes in 2021 and 2022 severely weakened the popularity of then-President Joe Biden, with voters so frustrated by inflation eroding their buying power that they chose last year to put Trump back in the White House to address the problem. Inflation has risen since November's election, with the government reporting on Wednesday that the consumer price index is running at an annual rate of 3%.",
      "The Trump team has decried criticism of its tariffs even as it has acknowledged the likelihood of some financial pain. It says that the tariffs have to be weighed against the possible extension and expansion of Trump's 2017 tax cuts as well as efforts to curb regulations and force savings through the spending freezes and staff reductions in billionaire adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency initiative.",
      "But an obstacle for this approach might be the sequencing of the various policies and the possibilities of a wider trade conflict stifling investment and hiring amid the greater inflationary pressures.",
      "Analysts at the bank Wells Fargo said in a Thursday report that the tariffs would likely hurt growth this year, just as the extended tax cuts could help growth recover in 2026.",
      "\u201cTariffs impart a modest stagflationary shock to an economy,\" the report said. \u201cThe U.S. economy entered 2025 with a fair amount of momentum, but we look for real GDP growth to downshift a bit over the next few quarters as the price-boosting effects of tariffs erode growth in real income, thereby weighing on growth in real consumer spending.\u201d"

      "Americans looking to buy a newly built home this spring are likely to get a helping hand with their mortgage rate and other costs",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Americans looking to buy a newly built home this spring are likely to get a helping hand with their mortgage rate and other costs.",
      "Many homebuilders are offering buyers valuable incentives like paying down their mortgage rate, covering closing costs or even throwing in \u201cflex dollars\u201d that home shoppers can put toward upgrades or other costs.",
      "While the sales strategy isn\u2019t new, builders are under pressure this year to ramp up such incentives because they\u2019re facing a tough spring homebuying season.",
      "Stubbornly high mortgage rates, more competition from existing homes on the market and the realization that years of rising home prices have pushed affordability to the limit for many prospective buyers gives builders little opportunity to ease off the costly incentives.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re running into more competition, fewer buyers and increased costs to sell a home,\u201d said Ali Wolf, chief economist at Zonda.",
      "And dialing back incentives may not be easy, as home shoppers have now come to expect them.",
      "\u201cWe should anticipate that builder incentives are here to stay,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a world where they don\u2019t need them, unless interest rates came down, and most signs point to higher-for-longer with interest rates.\u201d",
      "Elevated mortgage rates and rising prices have kept many prospective home shoppers on the sidelines, especially first-time buyers who don\u2019t have equity from an existing home to put toward a purchase. While mortgage rates have eased in recent weeks, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage has been hovering around 7% since November after climbing from a 2-year low of just over 6% in September, according to Freddie Mac.",
      "Builders have increasingly relied on buyer incentives to mitigate the impact of higher borrowing costs on home shoppers as the average rate on a 30-year mortgage more than doubled in recent years from its pandemic-era historic low of 2.65%. Many builders have also lowered prices.",
      "The share of homebuilders that offer sales incentives has ranged between 60% and 64% since June, while between 30% and 33% have lowered prices, according to surveys by the National Association of Home Builders.",
      "The use of buyer incentives helped drive sales of new homes higher last year, while the resale home market remained in a deep slump. Sales of newly built single-family homes rose 2.6% last year to around 1.02 million units, the highest level since 2021, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell in 2024 to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.",
      "While mortgage buydowns and other incentives can help builders entice buyers, their cost eats into their profit margins. The average operating margin for 12 of the largest homebuilders, including D.R. Horton, PulteGroup and Lennar, was 15.08% in the fourth-quarter, according to data compiled by FactSet. That\u2019s down from an average of 16.3% in the same period a year earlier.",
      "The concern now is that builders will have to maintain, if not boost, buyer incentives to continue mitigating the impact of high mortgage rates at a time when home shoppers have a wider selection to choose from. Last month, active listings \u2014 a tally that encompasses all homes on the market except those pending a finalized sale \u2014 were up 25% from a year earlier, according to Realtor.com.",
      "Rising construction costs and uncertainty over the impact that the Trump administration\u2019s trade and immigration policies may have on building materials and labor costs, respectively, are also fueling worries on Wall Street about how well builder profit margins will hold up this year.",
      "\u201cWe expect order growth to come at the expense of margins for homebuilders,\u201d analysts at BofA Securities wrote in a recent research note. They also said they expect a \u201cchallenging environment for homebuilders to persist\u201d through the first half of this year.",
      "Concern over builders\u2019 profit margins has weighed on the stocks, with many homebuilders off to a downbeat start this year after lagging the overall stock market in 2024.",
      "D.R. Horton, the nation\u2019s largest builder by closings, is down around 7.5% this year. Lennar is down 5.6% and NVR is off 10.2%.",
      "The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF, which tracks a variety of building products companies, is up 1.4%. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up about 4%.",

      "Retail sales dropped 0.9% in January from the previous month, the Commerce Department said, after two months of healthy gains. It was a much bigger drop than economists expected and the biggest decline since last January.",
      "The average temperature in January was the lowest since 1988, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics, and was particularly disruptive in the South. Devastating fires in Los Angeles may have also impacted spending.",
      "Sales plummeted 2.8% last month at auto dealers and slumped at furniture stores, home and garden centers, Even in the usually strong online retail sector saw a 1.9% decline. Sales rose at general merchandise stores, a category that includes big retailers like Walmart and Target, and at restaurants and bars.",
      "In addition to cold weather, the decline could reflect falling consumer confidence as reflected in recent surveys by the Conference Board and University of Michigan. Still, hiring and wage growth have been steady, suggesting the economy is still expanding. Last week the government reported that the unemployment rate fell for the second straight month to a low 4%.",
      "Yet inflation also ticked higher last month, underscoring its persistence despite the Federal Reserve's efforts to cool prices through higher interest rates. The cost of groceries jumped in January from the previous month, pushed higher by soaring egg prices. Rising costs could be exacting a toll on shoppers.",
      "President Donald Trump is also stepping up tariff threats, which could raise prices further. Trump said Thursday he would soon impose \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on countries that levy large duties on U.S. goods exports. Trump has already added 10% import taxes on goods from China, and has said he will place 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports.",

      "The White House barred a credentialed Associated Press reporter and photographer from boarding the presidential airplane Friday for a weekend trip with Donald Trump, saying the news agency\u2019s stance on how to refer to the Gulf of Mexico was to blame for the exclusion. It represented a significant escalation by the White House in a four-day dispute with the AP over access to the presidency.",
      "The administration has blocked the AP from covering a handful of events at the White House this week, including a news conference with India's leader and several times in the Oval Office. It\u2019s all because the news outlet has not followed Trump\u2019s lead in renaming the body of water, which lies partially outside U.S. territory, to the \u201cGulf of America.\u201d",
      "AP reporters and photographers travel with the president virtually everywhere as part of a press \u201cpool\u201d and have for decades. AP journalism serves millions of readers and thousands of news outlets around the world.",
      "Journalists consider the administration's move a violation of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment \u2014 a governmental attempt to dictate what a news company publishes under threat of retribution. The Trump administration says the AP has no special right of access to events where space is limited, particularly given the news service's \u201ccommitment to misinformation.\u201d",
      "AP calls that assertion entirely untrue.",
      "\u201cFreedom of speech is a pillar of American democracy and a core value of the American people. The White House has said it supports these principles,\u201d AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said Friday night. \u201cThe actions taken to restrict AP\u2019s coverage of presidential events because of how we refer to a geographic location chip away at this important right enshrined in the U.S. Constitution for all Americans.\u201d",
      "The body of water in question has been called the Gulf of Mexico for hundreds of years. AP, whose influential stylebook is used by news outlets as an arbiter of language and usage, advised that because of its broad set of global customers, it would both refer to the body of water as the Gulf of Mexico and also reference Trump\u2019s order changing the name to the Gulf of America within the United States.",
      "At the same time, the AP switched style last month from Denali to Mount McKinley for the mountain in Alaska that Trump ordered renamed. That location lies entirely within U.S. jurisdiction.",
      "Taylor Budowich, White House deputy chief of staff, said in a post to X Friday \u2014 one that was later released as a White House statement \u2014 that the AP \u201ccontinues to ignore the lawful geographic name change of the Gulf of America. This decision is not just divisive, but it also exposes The Associated Press\u2019 commitment to misinformation.\u201d",
      "While the First Amendment protects the AP\u2019s \u201cright to irresponsible and dishonest reporting,\u201d it doesn\u2019t ensure unfettered access to limited spaces like the Oval Office and Air Force One, Budowich said. He said AP would retain its credentials to the White House complex overall.",
      "On Friday, an AP reporter and photographer had traveled to Joint Base Andrews for their participation in the traveling press pool to Trump's Florida residence. But, after clearing security, neither was allowed to board Air Force One, a decision they were told was \u201coutlet-specific.\u201d Meanwhile, reporters in the press pool who were permitted on the plane sent the AP journalists pictures of cards with their names saying \u201cwelcome aboard\u201d on their empty seats.",
      "Other news organizations, like The New York Times and Washington Post, have also said they would primarily use Gulf of Mexico. Fox News said that it was switching to Gulf of America.",
      "The White House Correspondents Association has issued statements condemning the action against AP. Although there are talks going on behind the scenes, individual news outlets have been relatively quiet.",
      "The Times, through spokesman Charles Stadtlander, said on Friday that \"we stand by The Associated Press in condemning repeated acts of retribution by this administration for editorial decisions it disagrees with. Any move to limit access or impede reporters doing their jobs is at odds with the press freedoms enshrined in the Constitution.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the Washington Post said that the AP's \u201caccess to the administration is central for all journalistic organizations, including The Washington Post, in serving millions of Americans with fact-based, independent journalism each day.\u201d",
      "The issue was gaining some international attention.",
      "\u201cWe would never kick a news agency out of the press room of our Chancellery,\" said Friedrich Merz, the top opposition leader in Germany and front-runner in polls ahead of the country's Feb. 23 elections. He spoke Saturday at a security conference in Munich also attended by U.S. Vice President JD Vance and top Trump administration officials.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who on Wednesday used the word \u201clies\u201d in describing AP content, posted on X Friday afternoon about executive orders Trump had signed before his departure. She ended her post: \u201cThe @AP was not invited.\u201d",

      "Thailand's army says some 260 people believed to have been trafficked and trapped into working in online scam centers are to be repatriated after they were rescued from Myanmar",
      "BANGKOK -- Some 260 people believed to have been trafficked and trapped into working in online scam centers are to be repatriated after they were rescued from Myanmar, Thailand's army announced Thursday.",
      "In a fresh crackdown on scam centers operating from Southeast Asia, the Thai army announced Thursday it is coordinating an effort to repatriate some 260 people believed to have been victims of human trafficking after they were rescued and sent from Myanmar to Thailand.",
      "Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, which share borders with Thailand, have become known as havens for criminal syndicates who are estimated to have forced hundreds of thousands of people in Southeast Asia and elsewhere into helping run online scams including false romantic ploys, bogus investment pitches and illegal gambling schemes.",
      "Such scams have extracted tens of billions of dollars from victims around the world, according to U.N. experts, while the people recruited to carry them out have often been tricked into taking the jobs under false pretenses and trapped in virtual slavery.",
      "An earlier crackdown on scam centers in Myanmar was initiated in late 2023 after China expressed embarrassment and concern over illegal casinos and scam operations in Myanmar\u2019s northern Shan state along its border. Ethnic guerrilla groups with close ties to Beijing shut down many operations, and an estimated 45,000 Chinese nationals suspected of involvement were repatriated.",
      "The army said that those rescued in the most recent operation came from 20 nationalities \u2014 with significant numbers from Ethiopia, Kenya, the Philippines, Malaysia, Pakistan and China. There were also nationals of Indonesia, Nepal, Taiwan, Uganda, Laos, Brazil, Burundi, Tanzania, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Nigeria, Ghana and India. They were sent across the border from Myanmar\u2019s Myawaddy district to Thailand\u2019s Tak province on Wednesday.",
      "Reports in Thai media said a Myanmar ethnic militia that controls the area where they were held, the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, was responsible for freeing the workers and taking them to the border. Myanmar\u2019s military government exercises little control over frontier areas where ethnic minorities predominate.",
      "Several ethnic militias are believed to be involved in criminal activities, including drug trafficking and protecting call-center scam operations.",
      "The Thai army statement said the rescued people will undergo questioning, and if determined to be victims of human trafficking, will enter a process of protection while waiting to be sent back to their countries.",
      "Deputy Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai, who is also defense minister, said Wednesday that there might be many more scam workers waiting to be repatriated from Myanmar through Thailand, but that Thailand would only receive those that are ready to be taken back right away by their country of origin.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve made it clear that Thailand is not going to set up another shelter,\u201d he told reporters during a visit in Sa Kaeo province, which borders Cambodia. Thailand hosts nine refugee camps along the border holding more than 100,000 people, most from Myanmar\u2019s ethnic Karen minority.",
      "Phumtham added that Thailand would also need to question them before sending them back, first is to make sure that they are victims of human trafficking, and also to get information that would help the police investigate the trafficking and scam problems.",
      "On a visit to China in early February, Thailand\u2019s Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra vowed along with China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping to crack down on the scam networks that plague Southeast Asia.",
      "Many dramatic stories of Chinese people being lured to work in Bangkok only to be trafficked into a scam compound in Myanmar have surfaced. Chinese actor Wang Xing was a high-profile case but was quickly rescued after his tale spread on social media.",
      "Underlining Beijing\u2019s concern, Liu Zhongyi, China\u2019s Vice Minister of Public Security and Commissioner of its Criminal Investigation Bureau, made an official visit to Thailand last month and inspected the border area opposite where many of the Myanmar\u2019s scam centers are located.",
      "Just ahead of Paetongtarn\u2019s visit to China, the Thai government issued an order to cut off electricity, internet and gas supplies to several areas in Myanmar along the border with northern Thailand, citing national security and severe damage that the country has suffered from scam operations.",
      "Her government is considering expanding this measure to Thailand\u2019s northeastern areas bordering Cambodia, said Thai Defense Ministry spokesperson Thanathip Sawangsang, who explained that officials had already removed internet cables that were installed illegally in the areas."

      "Donald Trump promised as a candidate that he could easily conquer inflation, but the reality is proving tougher than he expected",
      "WASHINGTON -- As a candidate last year, Donald Trump suggested he could easily conquer inflation and ease voters' fears about the economy.",
      "\u201cI will very quickly deflate,\u201d he promised at a California rally. \u201cWe are going to take inflation, and we are going to deflate it. We are going to deflate inflation. We are going to defeat inflation. We\u2019re going to knock the hell out of inflation.\u201d",
      "Wednesday's consumer price index report showed that inflation is punching back \u2014 and President Trump could end up facing the same challenges that dragged down his predecessor, President Joe Biden.",
      "The annual inflation rate has risen in the three months since the November election to 3%, with gasoline prices climbing despite Trump's claims that his return to the White House would signal increased oil production that would lower energy costs.",
      "Trump frequently makes far-reaching assertions about his power to bring about change only to find that it is no match for market forces. It\u2019s a humbling reminder that even U.S. presidents are subject to the invisible hand of supply and demand, rather than the masters of it.",
      "Consumer sentiment measures suggest the public already sees Trump\u2019s plans to expand tariffs as increasing inflation. On Wednesday, the president called for interest rate cuts, even though rate hikes by the Federal Reserve helped lower inflation that spiked at a four-decade high in 2022.",
      "The latest consumer price figures have unnerved economists and the financial markets because they suggest that strong consumer spending, solid job gains and a falling unemployment rate could reignite inflation. Steady demand, particularly from wealthier consumers, makes it easier for companies to keep raising prices.",
      "The cost of goods \u2014 including toys and auto parts \u2014 rose last month even before the imposition of tariffs. Trump has placed 10% tariffs on China, in addition to announcing the removal of exemptions on his 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs. There are also potential tariff hikes on Canada and Mexico and a potential executive order that would increase tariffs to match the import taxes charged by other countries.",
      "All of this means that baseline inflationary pressures could be at their highest level in decades.",
      "\u201cDisinflation may be dead, and we may be looking at a higher rate of inflation than we observed for the 20 years prior to the pandemic,\u201d said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM, a tax and advisory firm.",
      "Trump's call for lower rates puts him in opposition to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.",
      "\u201cIf inflation goes up in general, we will use our tools, which is the interest rate, to bring it back down to 2% over time,\" Powell told a congressional committee on Wednesday. Powell also said that Trump's calls to lower rates wouldn't sway the Fed.",
      "So far, the Trump White House's main response to this challenge has been to blame Biden, an argument with a short lifespan as Trump is exerting more control over economic policy.",
      "\u201cThe Biden administration indeed left us with a mess to deal with,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at Wednesday's news briefing. \u201cIt\u2019s far worse than I think anybody anticipated.\u201d",
      "But Trump allies are also starting to float new ideas for tackling inflation. Standing in the Oval Office on Tuesday, billionaire Elon Musk, the head of the president's Department of Government Efficiency, proposed $1 trillion in spending cuts this year.",
      "Musk, the world's richest man who continues to control Tesla, X and SpaceX among other companies, wants to eliminate $1 out of every $7 spent by the federal government in order to bring the inflation rate to zero. It's not clear based on lawsuits and Congress' responsibility for government funding that Musk can deliver those savings.",
      "\u201cIf you cut the budget deficit by a trillion between now and next year, there is no inflation,\u201d Musk said. \u201cAnd if the government is not borrowing as much, it means that interest costs decline. So everyone\u2019s mortgage, their car payment, their credit card bills, anything, their student debt, the monthly payments drop. That\u2019s a fantastic scenario for the average American.\u201d",
      "Such a steep cut might bring lower prices but also the pain of a sharp economic downturn.",
      "\u201cThat would be a roughly 4% of GDP cut to federal spending, all in one year,\u201d said Michael Linden, a senior policy fellow at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \u201cIt would be an instant recession.\u201d",
      "For now, markets are anticipating more inflation as consumer demand stays strong and Trump has yet to show how exactly his policies would keep prices low, as he promised to voters.",
      "The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped Wednesday to 4.62% in response to the inflation report, a sign that investors expect interest rates, growth and inflation to be higher in the coming months.",
      "Consumers also say that inflation will rise. Americans' expectations of inflation over the next year have soared, according to the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey. The February survey said that inflation this year will be 4.3%, up sharply from 3.3% the previous month. Many respondents mentioned tariffs as a concern.",
      "When asked Wednesday why Trump\u2019s call for lower interest rates would temper inflation, Leavitt focused on what the president \u201cwants\u201d instead of what he would do.",
      "\u201cHe wants interest rates to be lower,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wants inflation to be lower. And he believes that the whole of government economic approach that this administration is taking will result in lower inflation.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Record high egg prices prompted Nevada lawmakers to unanimously back suspending their cage-free egg law, but the six other states with similar laws in effect have shown no sign of dropping them even if it might help lower grocery bills",
      "LAS VEGAS -- Back when egg prices remained securely under $2 a dozen in 2021, Nevada joined several other states concerned about animal welfare in requiring cage-free eggs.",
      "Now four years later, a dozen eggs costs an average of nearly $5 in the U.S. because of the lingering bird flu, so Nevada passed a law the governor signed Thursday that will allow the state to suspend that law temporarily in hopes of getting residents some relief at the checkout counter.",
      "But it is not quite that simple, which is why the other six states with the same laws are so far reticent to follow suit.",
      "By relaxing the rule, Nevada might get access to additional eggs, but the supply of all eggs remains tight because nearly 159 million birds have been slaughtered since the bird flu outbreak began in 2022 to help limit virus spread. The virus prompts the slaughter of entire flocks anytime it is found.",
      "It is not clear dropping cage-free laws will have a significant effect on egg prices that have peaked at an average of $4.95 per dozen because the farmers who collectively invested several billion dollars in making the switch can\u2019t easily go back to raising chickens packed together in massive barns that they already spent the money to convert.",
      "Even if all the cage-free laws went away, big corporations like McDonald\u2019s and Sodexo remain committed to buying only those kind of eggs, ensuring strong demand for cage-free eggs.",
      "University of Arkansas agricultural economist Jada Thompson said opening up Nevada to all kinds of eggs \u201ccould ease egg prices in Nevada very slightly,\u201d but that it might make prices worse elsewhere because supplies are so tight.",
      "But Nevada is going to give it a try even if California, Massachusetts, Washington, Oregon, Colorado and Michigan don't seem to be considering it. Arizona, Rhode Island and Utah also have cage-free laws on the books, but theirs won't take effect for at least a couple more years.",
      "Democratic Assemblymember Howard Watts III, who raises chickens in his Nevada backyard, advocated for the 2021 bill to promote the \u201cstandard of humane treatment\u201d of the animals. But the ongoing bird flu outbreak in the U.S. has caused egg prices to to hit a record high, and cage-free eggs are generally even more expensive.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that was not foreseen at that time was this major animal disease outbreak,\u201d Watts testified Tuesday. \u201cAs a result, there was no regulatory flexibility to suspend those requirements in the event of a major supply chain disruption.\u201d",
      "Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo approved the legislation Thursday. Nevada Department of Agriculture Director J.J. Goicoechea is expected to authorize the 120-day suspension of the cage-free egg requirements within a day, according to Goicoechea's spokesperson Ciara Ressel.",
      "\u201cWe anticipate 30 days before we can see an impact at the grocery stores,\u201d Ressel said.",
      "This month\u2019s jump in egg prices was the biggest since the nation\u2019s last bird flu outbreak in 2015. The previous high was set two years ago when eggs were selling for $4.82 per dozen on average.",
      "The average prices mask just how bad it is in some places. Some Californians these days are shelling out $12.99 for a dozen, or more than a buck an egg. Some New York shops even started selling bundles of three eggs to help people who can't afford a full dozen.",
      "Nevada resident Nancy Wong said she has been \u201coutraged\u201d by egg prices in the state. \u201cWe have gone to the store and eggs have been either rationed or completely out,\u201d she said.",
      "The concern with the cage-free requirements is that only about 121 million of the 304 million chickens laying eggs nationwide are raised on cage-free farms, so the supply is limited.",
      "Many of the eggs those hens produce are promised to restaurant chains like McDonald's and Panera, food service giants like Sodexo and Aramark and grocers under long-term contracts that help keep prices down. But even when they do have to pay a premium, grocers sometimes lose money on eggs by selling them cheaply to try to get shoppers in the door.",
      "The number of cage-free chickens has steadily increased in recent years because of the laws and the pressure from the companies buying eggs, increasing exponentially from just 38 million at the start of 2017. But the United Egg Producers trade group has estimated it would take at least 226 million cage-free hens to meet all the demand for those eggs, and more customers are clamoring for them, so the supply is tight.",
      "The total flock of chickens nationwide used to number above 330 million before the bird flu outbreak began.",
      "Even as more egg farmers were converting to cage-free setups over the past decade, prices stayed between $1.40 and $2 per dozen most of the time with only the normal seasonal price spikes around Easter and Thanksgiving until this current bird flu outbreak began in early 2022.",
      "If bird flu outbreaks happen to hit cage-free farms hard, there are fewer eggs out there that can replace the lost ones. For example, out of the nearly 47 million birds slaughtered just since the start of December, more than 3 million of them were on five cage-free farms in California.",
      "Anytime birds must be killed, it takes months for a farm to resume producing eggs because of the time required to dispose of the carcasses, sanitize the barns and raise new chickens until they are about 5 months old and capable of laying eggs.",
      "California won\u2019t consider dropping its cage-free law in part because the rule came from a measure voters passed in 2018, so voters would have to approve any major changes.",
      "But there doesn't seem to be much support for changes in other states either.",
      "Michigan state Rep. Jerry Neyer, a dairy farmer and chair of the state House Agriculture Committee, said the idea that new cage-free laws are driving up egg prices is a \u201cmisconception.\u201d The Republican added that most farms already adapted to comply with the law, so dropping the mandate wouldn't cut costs.",
      "A bill to repeal Colorado\u2019s cage-free requirements, which just took effect on Jan. 1, was killed in its first committee vote last month. The sponsor, Republican state Rep. Ryan Gonzalez, argued that while the avian flu was a major factor in prices, the cage-free rules played a significant role. But the majority of lawmakers on the panel appeared skeptical.",
      "Jonathan Kuester, who runs the small Historic Wagner Farm with about 200 Red Star hens in Illinois just outside Chicago, said he doesn't think cage-free practices are the cause of the egg shortages.",
      "He acknowledged his farm is more vulnerable to a bird flu infection than a traditional farm where chickens are confined inside a barn that can be better protected. Kuester's birds roam free, where they might interact with ducks and geese that are the main carriers of the disease.",
      "\u201cThe egg shortage that people are seeing is a result of some fairly large flocks being euthanized, and so fewer chickens are currently laying than were three or four months ago,\" Kuester said. \u201cThere\u2019s been a little bit of a panic, too. People are suddenly buying eggs as quickly as they can, and so you see that shortage.\"",

      "Since President Donald Trump began his second term last month, he has focused on bringing about a dramatic reduction in the federal workforce at a breakneck pace",
      "Since President Donald Trump began his second term last month, he has focused on dramatically reducing the federal workforce at a breakneck pace.",
      "From dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development to offering a mass deferred resignation plan, Trump's Republican administration has released executive orders and memos aimed at substantially reshaping the size of government and where its employees work.",
      "Here's what to know about the federal workforce, its job protections and the process of cutting back on its ranks.",
      "The civilian federal workforce, not including military personnel and postal workers, comprises about 2.4 million people.",
      "While a chunk of federal workers, about 20%, are in Washington, D.C., and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia, more than 80% are distributed outside the region.",
      "Civil servants are the vast majority of federal workers. They're generally hired through an application process and have strong protections once in their positions.",
      "Political appointees, who number roughly 4,000, serve at the discretion of the president and can be dismissed at will by the chief executive.",
      "\u201cCivil servants tend to be in their jobs as careers, some of them for decades,\u201d said Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who worked in President Bill Clinton\u2019s Democratic administration when about 426,000 federal jobs were cut over more than eight years in a deliberative effort aimed at reinventing government.",
      "It\u2019s not easy to fire the vast majority of federal workers \u2014 they have considerable job security with a long legal history.",
      "Federal employees who are not political appointees have strong protections designed to prevent political whims from clearing out the workforce. The protections have grown over time, under leadership of both major political parties.",
      "\u201cThe president definitely has his work cut out for him,\u201d said Donald Kettl, a professor emeritus and former dean of the University of Maryland School of Public Policy.",
      "Federal workers are entitled to due process, which means they can challenge disciplinary actions through a formal process. They have to be notified of the allegations against them and allowed to respond and present their side.",
      "\u201cYou have to build a record to fire somebody, and that doesn't often happen,\u201d Kamarck said.",
      "Federal employee protections started as a reform to the chaos caused by the 19th-century spoils system, in which federal jobs were awarded to a president's loyalists. It led to incompetence and corruption as well as massive turnover with new administrations that proved disruptive and prevented continuity of expertise.",
      "In 1881, President James Garfield was shot and killed by a man who believed Garfield owed him a job after campaigning for him. That led to the Pendleton Civil Service Act of 1883, which created a merit-based system for hiring federal employees.",
      "In 1978, Congress passed the Civil Service Reform Act, to shield the merit system with enforceable rights so that most federal workers can be fired only for a legitimate reason.",
      "\u201cThe idea is that we\u2019re not going to get the best people if their jobs are completely insecure and if they\u2019re going to lose their job every time a new party takes power, so to encourage quality people to apply for government service, we provide some security,\u201d said David Super, a professor who specializes in administrative law at Georgetown Law.",
      "No other U.S. leader has attempted sweeping and dramatic cuts like those Trump wants, said Max Stier, president and CEO of Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization focused on improving government.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in our history that has ever approximated what we\u2019re seeing right now,\u201d Stier said.",
      "Federal workers have union representation, but, unlike those of many industries, they do not have the power to strike. Federal workers also can't bargain over pay, because salaries are set in law.",
      "Federal unions can bargain over working conditions and basic protections for their members. Recently, unions have battled over remote working conditions, which they've successfully bargained for in the past and Trump is working to sharply reduce.",
      "\u201cThere also are some limits about what they can bargain over, so, for example, they can\u2019t bargain over what the policy of their agency is,\" Super said. \"That\u2019s a matter for the political process to work out, but they can bargain for things that affect workers on their jobs and their well-being.\u201d",
      "Federal employees have varying probationary periods, often a year or two, when they carry out tasks under a supervisor, who evaluates whether the worker is doing the job successfully. If not, workers can be dismissed; if so, they are brought on as full-time employees with protections.",
      "Employees on probation don\u2019t have the same appeal rights \u2014 it\u2019s an easier process to dismiss them.",

      "The State Department had been in talks with Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla company to buy armored electric vehicles, but the plans have been put on hold by the Trump administration after reports emerged about a potential $400 million purchase",
      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- The State Department had been in talks with Elon Musk's Tesla company to buy armored electric vehicles, but the plans have been put on hold by the Trump administration after reports emerged about a potential $400 million purchase.",
      "A State Department spokesperson said the electric car company owned by Musk, who has become President Donald Trump's billionaire adviser aiming to dismantle agencies and downsize the federal workforce, was the only one that expressed interest back in May 2024, when Joe Biden was president.",
      "While it was in its planning phases, the deal with Tesla was forecast to be the largest contract of the year. It shows how some of his wealth has come and was still expected to come from taxpayers before the plans were put on hold. His companies obtain hundreds of millions of dollars each year in contracts. SpaceX has secured nearly $20 billion in federal funds since 2008 to ferry astronauts and satellites into space. And Tesla had already received $41.9 million from the U.S. government, including payment for vehicles provided to some U.S. embassies.",
      "No government contract had been given to Tesla or any other manufacturer to produce armored electric vehicles for the Department of State, the agency said.",
      "The Biden administration had tasked the State Department to gather information from potential suppliers to buy these vehicles in September. An official request for bids was to be released in May, according to State Department data from December. But that solicitation is now on hold with no plans to issue it, the State Department said.",
      "After reports emerged about the plans to buy from Tesla, the State Department changed the data entry on its expected contracts forecast for fiscal year 2025 late Wednesday. The State Department said it should have been entered into the system as a generic \u201celectric vehicle manufacturer,\" but there is at least another entry for a different purchase that continues to list a company\u2014 German car manufacturer BMW."

      "The White House had blocked an Associated Press journalist from a news conference with two major world leaders",
      "The White House blocked an Associated Press journalist from covering a news conference with two major world leaders Thursday, upping the stakes in a disagreement between the news agency and the Trump administration over AP's style decision to stick with the name \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d for the body of water that the president rechristened the \u201cGulf of America.\u201d",
      "An AP reporter was prevented from entering a news conference where President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi answered questions, effectively shutting out thousands of global news outlets that rely on the news organization.",
      "Julie Pace, the AP's senior vice president and executive editor, called it a \u201cdeeply troubling escalation\" and \u201ca plain violation of the First Amendment\u201d to the U.S. Constitution.",
      "\u201cWe urge the Trump administration in the strongest terms to stop this practice,\u201d Pace, who also wrote to Trump's chief of staff on Wednesday, said in a statement. \u201cThis is now the third day AP reporters have been barred from covering the president \u2014 first as a member of the pool, and now from a formal press conference \u2014 an incredible disservice to the billions of people who rely on The Associated Press for nonpartisan news.\u201d",
      "Eugene Daniels, president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association, issued a statement Thursday supporting the AP.",
      "\u201cThe White House is seeking to curtail the press freedoms enshrined in our Constitution, and has admitted publicly they are restricting access to events to punish a news outlet for not advancing the government\u2019s preferred language,\" he said. \"Prohibiting journalists from access because of their editorial decisions is viewpoint discrimination.\u201d",
      "Questioned about the actions Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said media access decisions are up to the president and suggested that retaining references to the Gulf of Mexico constituted \u201clies\u201d for which news organizations would be held accountable.",
      "\u201cWe reserve the right to decide who gets to go into the Oval Office,\u201d Leavitt said.",
      "The White House had no immediate comment about Thursday's additional actions. Barring a credentialed reporter from a news conference with leaders of two of the world's most influential nations represents a step beyond preventing access to an Oval Office event.",
      "\u201cThis is a textbook violation of not only the First Amendment, but the president\u2019s own executive order on freedom of speech and ending federal censorship,\" Daniels said.",
      "AP reporters were first prevented from accessing Oval Office events on Tuesday after being warned it would happen. The policy continued for events Wednesday and Thursday in the office and other locations.",
      "Trump moved quickly upon taking office to rename two key landmarks, ordering the name of the mountain known as Denali changed back to its old moniker of Mt. McKinley and renaming the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. AP switched its style for the mountain because, being entirely inside the United States, it was subject to presidential authority. But the agency decided to stick with the Gulf of Mexico for a body that lies partially outside U.S. territory \u2014 while noting Trump's move.",
      "The agency's decision matters because many writers and publications follow the guidelines of the AP Stylebook.",
      "Both Google Maps and Apple Maps have switched to the term Gulf of America either entirely or in part. On Thursday, Mexico's president said she was considering suing Google over the move."

      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- The future of Indonesia\u2019s automobiles and motorbikes is electric \u2014 at least according to exhibitors at the Indonesia International Motor Show, which opened in the country's capital city of Jakarta on Thursday.",
      "That's despite the country's own slow uptake of electric vehicles and motorbikes, which only make up a small fraction of the vehicles in the world's fourth most populated country.",
      "Over 50 international and domestic brands were on display at the massive exhibition hall, with several brands staging Indonesian debuts for hybrid or electric vehicles. Chinese automaker BYD unveiled its Sealion 7 electric SUV, while Vietnamese automaker VinFast's electric-powered VF 3 mini SUV had its Indonesia debut.",
      "The event also welcomed a new automaker to Indonesia, with China's Honri bringing its five-passenger Boma EV.",

Indonesia\u2019s number of registered vehicles was reported at 24,646,825 units in 2023, according to the association.",

      "VinFast and other electric vehicle makers such as BYD are also building EV manufacturing plants in Indonesia. South Korea\u2019s Hyundai and China\u2019s Wuling have both had EV plants in the country since 2022.",
      "The Indonesia government has sought partnerships with makers as it is eager to turn the country into an international hub for EVs, leveraging its abundant reserves of critical materials needed to make batteries.",
      "The small percentage of sales matches the slow progress of Indonesia\u2019s energy transition: Despite receiving billions of dollars in funding to retire coal and transition to greener energy, the country's renewable energy mix was \u200b\u200bjust 14% in 2024, with a majority of energy coming from highly-polluting fossil fuels such as coal.",

      "The wrong type of history, that is.",
      "The San Antonio teammates were disqualified from the Skills Challenge on All-Star Saturday night because their shot attempts during the event were not \u201cvalid,\" as the rules required. And afterward, all everyone wanted to know was who came up with the plan.",
      "\u201cI did,\u201d Wembanyama said. \u201cI don't regret it. I think it was a good idea.\u201d",
      "The challenge included bounce passes, chest passes, shots from three different locations on the floor and dribbling. On the shots \u2014 from the corner over an automated defender, near the top of the arc and at the elbow \u2014 players had to either make one or shoot three, whichever came first.",

      "\u201cWe had the best time,\u201d Wembanyama said. \"Numbers speak for themselves.\"",
      "It was a most unconventional approach, but Wembanyama didn't surprise other competitors with his plan. Golden State's Draymond Green, who paired up with Warriors teammate Moses Moody in the event, said Wembanyama asked people beforehand if his plan was acceptable.",
      "\u201cIt definitely sucked to see them throwing the ball like that,\u201d Green said. \u201cBut what I will say is Wemby walked around the court asking everybody, \u2018Make one or three attempts?\u2019 And Wemby said, \u2018Oh, so I can get all three of them up there?\u2019 So, he asked. Now, he may not have asked the right people. But I will say, in Wemby's defense, he did ask a lot of people.\u201d",
      "Green and Moody lost to the Cleveland duo of Donovan Mitchell and Evan Mobley in the final of the skills event. Mitchell reacted by waving two-thumbs-down when Paul and Wembanyama finished, as some in the crowd booed.",
      "\u201cIf they weren\u2019t disqualified, I think we probably would have just did the same thing, to be honest with you,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cPlay to win, I guess.\u201d",
      "Mobley indicated that he had similar thinking as Wembanyama.",
      "\u201cI feel like my first round I tried to do a similar thing but made it look like a real shot,\u201d Mobley said. \u201cBut that didn\u2019t work really well, so I switched up my strategy.\u201d",
      "Paul also said Wembanyama asked about the strategy beforehand. He said he had a good time nonetheless.",
      "\u201cWe tried something that we thought could win,\u201d Paul said. \u201cTo see if we had the best time, so ... it was fun.\"",
      "Green said Paul warmed up taking conventional shots, presumably before Wembanyama \u2014 a second-year player and the league's reigning rookie of the year, who'll play in his first All-Star Game on Sunday \u2014 presented his time-saving plan.",
      "\u201cThe old man followed the rookie,\u201d Green said, \u201cright off the cliff.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Patrick Rodgers has a chance for his first PGA Tour victory after a wild day at the Genesis Invitational",
      "SAN DIEGO -- Patrick Rodgers is often mentioned alongside Tiger Woods because they share the Stanford record for most wins. What usually follows is the reminder that the 32-year-old Rodgers has yet to win on the PGA Tour.",
      "He has a chance to change that in the Genesis Invitational, with Woods presenting the trophy.",
      "Rodgers was at his best Saturday when golf's best were faltering on a tough day at Torrey Pines, playing mistake-free until dumping a gap wedge into the water on the par-5 18th for his only bogey. That gave him a 4-under 68 and a one-shot lead going into the final round.",
      "\u201cWhenever my name is mentioned, that\u2019s the first thing that everybody says professionally so it\u2019s something that I have to deal with,\u201d said Rodgers, who has played 283 times on the PGA Tour as a pro without winning.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve struggled with it for a long time, but I feel like I\u2019m viewing my career from a different vantage point now and I\u2019m excited about the opportunity to cross that finish line tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy have a longer road than they imagined to that line. Both were in contention early, and both faded in their own way with a series of mistakes, each with a three-putt from the 12-foot range. They were five behind.",
      "Rodgers was at 8-under 208, one shot ahead of Denny McCarty (71). Ludvig Aberg, who had an ace on the par-3 third hole, had a 70 and was another shot behind.",
      "Rodgers won 11 times at Stanford, same as Woods (and later Maverick McNealy). Now he is one round away from Woods, the tournament host who is likely to be at Torrey Pines on Sunday, presenting him the trophy. Woods withdrew when his mother died last week.",
      "But for Rodgers, 18 holes can feel like a marathon, especially on a beast like the South course at Torrey Pines.",
      "The course did a number on Scheffler and McIlroy.",
      "Scheffler, the world's No. 1 player, tied Davis Thompson for the lead with a birdie on the fifth and had the easily reachable par-5 sixth ahead of him. But he hit 7-wood from a fairway bunker into the crowd and then three-putted from just inside 15 feet for bogey.",
      "He also took two chips from thick rough near the par-5 ninth green and made bogey, took double bogey with a tee shot into the hazard on the 14th and wound up with a 76, his highest score in nearly three years.",
      "He was five shots behind with McIlroy, whose round of 74 was more of a slow bleed until he three-putted from 12 feet on the par-3 16th.",
      "Scheffler and McIlroy will be paired together in the final round, teeing off a lot earlier than both of them would have liked.",
      "The first day of full sunshine allowed for some good scoring early before a strong Pacific breeze kicked in. Tony Finau chipped in three times on his way to a 67. He started the day nine shots behind and will be in the penultimate group Sunday, four shots back.",
      "Also four back were Patrick Cantlay (68), Tommy Fleetwood (69) and Thompson, the 36-hole leader who was holding his own until a 40 on the back nine gave him a 76.",
      "McCarthy, steady through a roller coast day for so many others, also is going for his first PGA Tour win. But far more was expected from Rodgers, who grew up in amateur golf with Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas and has watched them pile up tour wins and majors.",
      "He has switched his thinking from playing with expectations to simply trying to perform.",
      "\u201cIt felt like early in my career with the amateur resume that I had, I felt like there was a lot expected of myself internally,\" he said. \"And it was something where when immediate success, immediate wins didn\u2019t come straight away, it was kind of fighting who I saw myself to be.",
      "\u201cSo instead of playing with a monkey on your back that gets bigger and bigger over time when it doesn\u2019t happen, I\u2019m trying to play from a perspective that feels fresh and new and exciting and full of opportunity. Because that\u2019s what this game is, and I have a great one tomorrow.\u201d",
      "The bogey on the 18th \u2014 his gap wedge came out softer than he imagined from the first cut and barely reached the green before rolling down the hill \u2014 was his only blemish. Still, he had a 54-hole lead for only the third time in his 11 years on tour.",
      "His best work came on the back nine, starting with a 4-iron he laced into 15 feet for birdie on the 504-yard 12th hole, and a 3-wood onto the green at the par-5 13th. Only three other players hit that green in two.",
      "Rodgers also holed a 40-foot birdie putt across the 17th before his bogey at the end.",
      "Aberg played alongside Rodgers and was impressed with what he saw.",
      "\u201cHe played amazing and he was great off the tee,\u201d Aberg said. \u201cYou can be rewarded and have a lot of good chances into the greens, but as soon as you start missing the fairways, it gets pretty difficult. It\u2019s a great golf course, it\u2019s a U.S. Open golf course, and it definitely played that way today.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Pittsburgh Pirates ace Paul Skenes is focused on becoming a more complete pitcher in 2024",
      "BRADENTON, Fla. -- Paul Skenes spent his rookie season dutifully following the Pittsburgh Pirates\u2019 plan to bring their young ace along as slowly and safely as possible.",
      "It worked. Maybe better than all involved imagined during an electrifying 2024 in which the towering right-hander started the All-Star Game and captured the National League Rookie of the Year award while becoming perhaps the game's hottest young star in a decade.",
      "It was an incredible ride to be sure. Yet when Skenes arrived this week for his second spring training, he did it with the kind of freedom he lacked a year ago.",
      "Oh, and a couple of new pitches, too.",
      "The 22-year-old is tinkering with adding a cutter and a running two-seam fastball to an arsenal that already includes a four-seamer that tops out north of 100 mph and a \u201csplinker\u201d that was one of the best put-away pitches in the majors in 2024.",
      "\u201cJust trying to create more swing decisions,\u201d Skenes said.",
      "Or, nondecisions.",
      "Veteran second baseman Adam Frazier, who reunited with the Pirates last month, volunteered to be the first batter to face Skenes during a live batting practice on Saturday. The first pitch the left-handed hitting Frazier saw was a splinker that darted down and away while catching the outside corner of the strike zone.",
      "Frazier's bat never moved as the ball whizzed by, a pitch \u201cnobody is going to do anything with,\u201d as the former All-Star put it.",
      "\u201cIf you hit it, you\u2019re hitting it straight in the ground,\u201d Frazier added. \u201cSo it\u2019s like, \u2018All right, strap it on and get ready.\u2019\u201d",
      "Frazier, second baseman Nick Gonzales and first baseman Darick Hall all failed to make solid contact off Skenes during a 25-pitch session in which a few dozen fans surrounded one of the practice fields at Pirates City, many of them with their phones raised to capture the first glimpse of Skenes in 2025.",
      "Skenes called the attention he commands \u201ca privilege.\" It's also, however, not a priority. The admitted perfectionist is too consumed with his craft to cultivate his celebrity. And for as dominant as he was at times last summer, Skenes knows he's hardly a finished product after 23 major league starts.",
      "Yes, his numbers as a rookie \u2014 an 11-3 record with a 1.96 ERA and 170 strikeouts in 133 innings \u2014 were dazzling. They were also just the beginning.",
      "While Skenes stressed he is not looking to get away from his identity as a strikeout pitcher, he is trying to find a way to get to strike three a little more quickly.",
      "\u201cGetting ahead, winning the 0-0, 0-1, 1-1 (pitches), winning those counts, that stuff is important,\u201d he said.",
      "That's where adding a couple of more options to a repertoire that already includes six different pitches comes in.",
      "\u201cAnything that looks like a fastball and doesn\u2019t end up being a fastball (helps),\u201d pitching coach Oscar Marin said. \u201cI think we all know how special his fastballs are. (More options are) just something that is going to really open up the zone for him as well.\u201d",
      "There is a sense of ease around Skenes that he didn't necessarily have when he arrived at spring training a year ago as a rookie just trying to make the team.",
      "He didn't initially, not because he wasn't good enough, but because it was part of the team's plan to methodically build him up rather than rush him to the majors.",
      "While Skenes admits that was \u201cfrustrating,\u201d he understands it was the right call.",
      "\u201cThey did a really good job with me last year,\" he said. \u201cI kind of knew, as much as I didn\u2019t want to believe it, that that was how it was going to be when I came into camp.\u201d",
      "Not this time. Skenes is a lock to be on the roster when the Pirates break camp. The questions now are whether he'll be the opening day starter \u2014 something Skenes thinks would be \u201creally cool\u201d \u2014 and if Pittsburgh is ready to take a step forward into contention despite a relatively quiet offseason.",
      "Skenes knows his performance at the top of the rotation is a vital part of that equation. He also knows it's hardly only up to him. It's one of the many reasons he plans to take on a more visible leadership role in 2025.",
      "There were small signs under a near-cloudless mid-February sky. Wearing long sleeves underneath his black No. 30 jersey, his gray pants pulled up to the knees to expose Pittsburgh-centric socks, Skenes dapped up support staff, chatted with video coordinator Kevin Roach and made it a point to wait for veteran pitcher Mitch Keller to finish before the two slowly walked off the practice fields together.",
      "The jitters he felt in 2024 are a rapidly fading memory. He has a little more experience to go with his ever-present swagger and the kind of stuff that few can match.",
      "Skenes wasn't sure how fast he was throwing on Saturday, though he smiled while noting that it was probably faster than 94 mph because if it wasn't \u201csome other people would have been concerned if it were.\u201d",

      "NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has a message to those Dallas Mavericks fans who are still angry, two weeks later: He feels your pain",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has a message to those Dallas Mavericks fans who are still angry, two weeks later: He feels your pain.",
      "That said, he's also sure that the Mavericks believe that their decision to trade Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers for Anthony Davis was \u2014 in their minds, at least \u2014 the best possible move for the franchise.",
      "Silver, in his annual address at All-Star weekend on Saturday, said he had no advance word that the trade was looming and that he was surprised like everyone else. He also said he wasn't going to second-guess Dallas' decision.",
      "\u201cI can say one thing for sure: Whether or not history will ultimately judge this as a smart trade, they did what they thought was in the best interest of their organization,\" Silver said. \"I have absolutely no knowledge or belief there were any ulterior motives, no doubt in my mind that the Dumont-Adelson families bought that team to keep it in Dallas. I have no doubt whatsoever that they\u2019re committed to the long-term success of that franchise.\u201d",
      "The Doncic-for-Davis trade sent shock waves across the NBA. It was the first midseason trade where All-NBA players were swapped for one another, and the angry fallout from fans in Dallas over trading a 25-year-old superstar and global icon hasn't exactly subsided.",
      "\u201cI'm empathetic,\u201d Silver said. \u201cI understand it.\u201d",
      "San Antonio star Victor Wembanyama also understands how some Mavericks fans feel, even though he plays for the in-state rival Spurs.",
      "\u201cWhat really strikes me is how the Mavs\u2019 fans are hurting, how they feel,\u201d Wembanyama said Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s really something that I think was a really strong emotion. But otherwise, I think the Mavs are still contenders. The Lakers are contenders. It\u2019s very competitive. They traded for very good players. ... But two weeks after, it\u2019s still the craziest trade I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d",
      "Further adding to the disappointment or frustration for some Dallas fans is the fact that Davis got hurt in his debut game with the Mavericks, one of many big-man injuries the team is currently grappling with.",
      "\u201cTime will tell whether it was a smart trade,\u201d Silver said. \u201cBut they should believe in their organization.\u201d",
      "In other topics covered by Silver on Saturday:",
      "All-Star Saturday last year was highlighted by the 3-point contest between Stephen Curry and Sabrina Ionescu.",
      "Everyone left that night indicating that it would come back in 2025. But it didn't happen \u2014 and Silver said the reason is simply that it might have been too good to do twice.",
      "\u201cLast year was so magical, that competition, that it started to feel forced. And I think there was concern from all of us that we just weren\u2019t feeling it,\" Silver said.",
      "A few days after an arbitration panel ruled that ownership transfer of the Minnesota Timberwolves to Marc Lore and Alex Rodriguez \u2014 who would get the majority stake for $1.5 billion \u2014 must continue as originally planned, Silver said the league is waiting to see what happens next.",
      "\u201cMy expectation is that will move forward. But first, Glen Taylor does have a decision to make as to whether to appeal that arbitration decision,\" Silver said. \"I mean, that\u2019s Glen\u2019s decision to make. I haven\u2019t talked to him directly about that. I think, though, that A-Rod, certainly Marc Lore, are well-known to the league at this point. They\u2019ve already been vetted and approved as minority owners. I think they understood that the league had no role in this arbitration. That was something they had agreed to as part of their purchase agreement.\u201d",
      "Silver said he sees no reason why the sale wouldn't be approved, but stopped short of speaking for the Board of Governors and the decision they would have to make to get the sale across the finish line.",
      "A week after a trade between Charlotte and the Lakers fell through because of the results of Hornets center Mark Williams' physical, Silver said the Hornets have not filed a formal appeal with the league.",
      "The Lakers rescinded the trade.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s see what Charlotte decides to do here,\" Silver said. \"But I think either way, it\u2019s gotten our attention. We understand that in the back and forth of teams and trades that the extent we can reduce uncertainty, that\u2019s a positive thing.\u201d",

      "The NBA also doesn't solely look at ratings. The league's footprint on social media is growing and is at \u201crecord popularity,\u201d Silver said, and he said that the TV numbers don't show the interest from podcasts and other forms of new media.",

      "For Oakland native Damian Lillard and Warriors star Stephen Curry, shining a light on Oakland's deep sports history and the legacies of so many Black athletes through the NBA HBCU Classic meant so much during All-Star Weekend",
      "OAKLAND, Calif. -- Damian Lillard's native Oakland hardly resembles the thriving sports city he has so cherished since his youth.",
      "Three major professional sports franchises, all gone in recent years.",
      "So when the Milwaukee Bucks star came back home for the All-Star Game, you bet he hoped the East Bay would have a big presence.",
      "The Golden State Warriors' former home arena hosted not only the All-Star practices Saturday but also the NBA HBCU Classic featuring Morehouse College and Tuskegee University, which beat its Division II conference opponent 68-55.",
      "\u201cIt was crazy. The NBA gave us an opportunity to come in on a big stage and play Morehouse,\u201d Tuskegee graduate student forward Trey Crawford said. \u201cIt was just exhilarating being out there, being in front of all these fans, all this Black culture around us.\u201d",
      "Having the game in his hometown meant so much to Lillard, who has been sad to see the Warriors, Athletics and Raiders depart the city.",
      "And it didn't just matter for Lillard but stood to honor all of the Black greats to come out of Oakland \u2014 from Gary Payton and Jason Kidd to the late Bill Russell and Rickey Henderson.",
      "\u201cGrowing up close by here, driving by and looking at the Coliseum and seeing Oracle and how dead it is, when there was so much energy in it when I was a kid with the Raiders, the A\u2019s, the Warriors being here, concerts, AND1 Mixtape tour coming through here, Globetrotters. I remember a lot about this parking lot,\u201d Lillard said after practice with his Shaq\u2019s OGs squad.",
      "\u201cOne of the first things I asked when I got here was, are they doing Saturday night at Oracle? Just because I would have loved to see that energy be here with the professional sports teams being taken away. So for us to be able to come here and do the practice, for the HBCU game being here ... especially with how rich our history is with African-American athletes, I\u2019m happy that they kind of took this stance and came this direction with it because I think the city needs this type of energy.\"",
      "This marked the fourth time incorporating a game between two schools representing HBCUs \u2014 Historically Black Colleges and Universities \u2014 during All-Star weekend in order to increase awareness for these student-athletes and develop more chances for their programs and schools.",
      "\u201cIt's always good to create an opportunity for the HBCU programs to get some shine, get some love,\u201d Curry said. \u201cIt's an amazing stage and I love the fact that the NBA is invested in it. That's part of what this weekend's about.\u201d",
      "Curry still feels connected to Oakland, where he and wife Ayesha do so much work through their Eat.Learn.Play. Foundation in the schools and community.",
      "Former Warriors and Kings coach Keith Smart just took over a high school program at Utah Prep Academy in Hurricane, Utah, last month and his team participated in a game here Friday. But Smart made sure everybody stuck around to see the All-Star practices Saturday followed by the HBCU game.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at the demographics of the teams, all these guys, you give them hope. That's what the NBA is doing is giving them hope,\" Smart said. \u201cPlayers that might have a chance or may not have a chance, but now they've got a big brother backing them with the NBA. So this event as well as now having a big brother for the most part behind you, it can only help.\u201d",
      "Veteran NBA writer and reporter David Aldridge so appreciates the efforts to put HBCU programs on the big stage during All-Star weekend.",
      "\u201cIt's been great,\u201d Aldridge said. \u201cFor the NBA to intentionally lean into the HBCUs and to give them really an equal platform with the rest of the things going on this weekend it's so affirming, and it's affirming to the kids. I've done a couple of the games over the years and they really feel empowered. And it gives them incredible confidence that their league gets this kind of attention and this kind of platform to really showcase the kids' skill level and their talent level and togetherness.\u201d",
      "Former Warriors forward Purvis Short traveled from Houston and proudly represented HBCUs \u2014 he attended Jackson State \u2014 at Saturday's game with a group of NBA Legends.",
      "\u201cOften times HBCUs are overlooked, so any time there's an opportunity for these kids and the universities to be on this type of stage, once they go back it changes their whole outlook,\" Short said. \u201cAnd so it expands their dreams if you will, so it's really great to see things like this happen. I'm so happy that I was able to attend it. This is wonderful.\u201d",

      "The man who led a NASA facility that shouldered much of the blame for the 1986 space shuttle Challenger explosion has died",
      "William Ray Lucas, who led the NASA facility that shouldered much of the blame for the 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, has died. Lucas was 102.",
      "Lucas died Monday at his home in Huntsville, Alabama, according to an obituary published Friday by Laughlin Service Funeral Home in Huntsville. A funeral service has been set for March 1 on what would have been his 103rd birthday, funeral director Bryan Peek said Saturday.",
      "Lucas was director of the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville when the Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, just 73 seconds after liftoff from Cape Canaveral, Florida. It was the deadliest U.S. space flight disaster at that time.",
      "The explosion killed all seven crew members, including schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe, who had been tapped to become the first U.S. civilian to travel to space. Her inclusion on the flight meant thousands of schoolchildren across the country were watching the Challenger's launch and witnessed the televised disaster in real time.",
      "A presidential commission charged with investigating the cause of the explosion pointed to the shuttle's solid-fuel booster rockets as the likely culprit and criticized NASA managers for not taking safety concerns surrounding the rockets more seriously. The Marshall center had supervised development of the rockets.",
      "Lucas pushed back on the criticism, telling reporters a month after the explosion that it was too soon to pinpoint the cause of the explosion, adding, \u201cI think it was a sound decision to launch.\"",
      "But within months he had resigned, just days ahead of the release of a commission report blaming faulty design of the booster rockets.",
      "The explosion and resulting shakeup within NASA overshadowed what was an otherwise stellar career for Lucas, who was born and raised in rural western Tennessee and graduated from high school in 1939 as the class valedictorian. He earned a bachelor of science degree from Memphis State College, served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and later earned a doctorate in metallurgy from Vanderbilt University.",
      "Lucas began his career in the guided missile development division of the U.S. Army's Redstone Arsenal near Huntsville. He became a charter member of the Marshall Space Flight Center when it was established in 1960 before rising through the ranks to become its director in 1974."

      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum says her government is not ruling out filing a civil lawsuit against Google if it maintains its stance of calling the stretch of sea between northeastern Mexico and the southeastern United States the \u201cGulf of America.\u201d",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday that her government wouldn't rule out filing a civil lawsuit against Google if it maintains its stance of calling the stretch of sea between northeastern Mexico and the southeastern United States the \u201cGulf of America.\u201d",
      "The area, long named the Gulf of Mexico across the the world, has gained a geopolitical spotlight in recent weeks after President Donald Trump declared he would change the Gulf's name.",
      "Sheinbaum, in her morning press conference on Thursday, said the president's decree is restricted to the \u201ccontinental shelf of the United States\" because Mexico still controls much of the Gulf. \u201cWe have sovereignty over our continental shelf,\" she said.",
      "Sheinbaum said that despite the fact that her government sent a letter to Google saying that the company was \u201cwrong\u201d and that \u201cthe entire Gulf of Mexico cannot be called the Gulf of America,\" the company has insisted on maintaining the nomenclature.",
      "It was not immediately clear where such a suit would be filed.",
      "Google reported last month on its X account, formerly Twitter, that it maintains a \u201clong-standing practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.\u201d",
      "An Associated Press analysis shows that as of Thursday, the user's location and other data was dependent on how the Gulf appeared on Google Maps. If the user is in the United States, the body of water appeared as Gulf of America. If the user was physically in Mexico, it would appear as the Gulf of Mexico. In many other countries across the world it appears as \u201cGulf of Mexico (Gulf of America).\u201d",
      "Sheinbaum has repeatedly defended the name Gulf of Mexico, saying its use dates to 1607 and is recognized by the United Nations.",
      "She has also mentioned that, according to the constitution of Apatzing\u00e1n, the antecedent to Mexico\u2019s first constitution, the North American territory was previously identified as \u201cMexican America\u201d. Sheinbaum has used the example to poke fun at Trump and underscore the international implications of changing the Gulf's name.",
      "In that sense, Sheinbaum said on Thursday that the Mexican government would ask Google to make \u201cMexican America\u201d pop up on the map when searched.",
      "This is not the first time Mexicans and Americans have disagreed on the names of key geographic areas, such as the border river between Texas and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Le\u00f3n and Tamaulipas. Mexico calls it Rio Bravo and for the United States it is the Rio Grande.",
      "This week, the White House barred AP reporters from several events, including some in the Oval Office, saying it was because of the news agency's policy on the name. AP is using \u201cGulf of Mexico\u201d but also acknowledging Trump's renaming of it as well, to ensure that names of geographical features are recognizable around the world."

    "summary": "Meteorologists warn that the coldest burst of Arctic air this season is coming to put an icy and prolonged exclamation point on America&rsquo;s winter of repeated polar vortex invasions starting this weekend",
    "story": [
      "Meteorologists warn that the coldest burst of Arctic air this season is coming to put an icy and prolonged exclamation point on America\u2019s winter of repeated polar vortex invasions starting this weekend",
      "The coldest burst of Arctic air this season is coming to put an icy exclamation point on America's winter of repeated polar vortex invasions, meteorologists warn. And it will stay frozen there all next week.",
      "Different weather forces in the Arctic are combining to push the chilly air that usually stays near the North Pole not just into the United States, but also Europe, several meteorologists tell The Associated Press.",
      "This will be the 10th time this winter that the polar vortex \u2014 which keeps the coldest of Arctic air penned in at the top of the world \u2014 stretches like a rubber band to send some of that big chill south, said Judah Cohen, seasonal forecast director at the private firm Atmospheric and Environmental Research. In a normal winter, it happens maybe two or three times.",
      "This winter, with record snow in New Orleans and drought and destructive wildfires in Southern California, has not been normal.",
      "The latest projected cold outbreak should first hit the northern Rockies and northern Plains Saturday and then stick around all next week. The cold will likely concentrate east of the Rockies with only the far American west and central and southern Florida exempted, meteorologists said.",
      "On Tuesday, expect the Lower 48 states to have an average low of 16.6 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 8.6 Celsius), and then plunge to 14 degrees (minus 10 Celsius) on Wednesday, calculated private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist.",
      "Sometime next week, 89% of the contiguous United States will be below the freezing mark and 27% of the Lower 48 will be below zero (minus 18 degrees Celsius), according to National Weather Service forecasts.",
      "Meteorologists expect strong winds to make the cold feel even worse. Every U.S. state but Hawaii, California and Florida have some or all parts forecast to have a good chance of windchills of 20 degrees or below sometime next week, the National Weather Service predicted.",
      "Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri and Iowa will have \u201cprobably the most impressive\u201d cold, with temperatures as much as 35 degrees (19 degrees Celsius) below what's normal for this time of year, said Zack Taylor, a meteorologist at the weather service's Weather Prediction Center. NOAA weather models predict Wednesday lows below zero in Oklahoma, Colorado, Nebraska, Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan.",
      "Some storms \u2014 with flooding, heavy snow or even a nor'easter \u2014 could hit during next week's prolonged cold outbreak, but details on those aren't certain yet, Taylor said.",
      "\u201cEverything, all the stars align, all the wind directions in the atmosphere are dragging the cold polar air out of the Canadian Arctic,\u201d Maue said. \u201cIt\u2019s the depths of winter. Everything signals extreme biting, winter cold. Obviously this isn\u2019t the first polar vortex episode of the winter, but it looks to be the most severe.\u201d",
      "A stretched polar vortex like this one happens lower in the atmosphere and is different than when the polar vortex has sudden warming, weakens and all the cold air escapes south and out of the poles, Cohen said. During stretching events, the polar vortex remains in place and strong, but it also just pulls and bends. Stretch outbreaks are usually slightly milder than the big polar escape events and often hit the United States, not Europe.",
      "Meteorologists are going to want to study why this stretching is happening so often this year, but it could just be natural randomness, said Laura Ciasto, a meteorologist at NOAA's Climate Prediction Center who specializes in the polar vortex.",
      "\u201cWhat we're observing right now is interesting, but not unprecedented,\u201d said Martin Stendel, a scientist at the National Center for Climate Research in Denmark.",
      "Another factor adding to the polar vortex stretching is a big blob of high pressure in the upper atmosphere over Greenland. It's moving west and will push the jet stream \u2014 the river of air that moves weather systems such as storms \u2014 into a pattern that causes polar air to plunge and stay there, Cohen said.",
      "Human-caused climate change may be making the jet stream wavier and more likely to be stuck in that wavy pattern, one of the factors involved, Stendel said.",
      "There haven't been many winters like this in the past to help meteorologists forecast what will happen next and when the cold will finally go away, Maue said.",
      "Despite the unusually cold winter across the U.S., the world remains in an overall warming pattern. Earth's average overall temperature set yet another monthly heat record in January. It was the 18th month of the last 19 that the world hit or passed the internationally agreed upon warming limit of 1.5 C (2.7 F) above pre-industrial times.",

      "Apart from getting AI involved in the strategic sectors in Poland, Google is also dedicating $5 million over the next five years to expand training programs and increase digital skills among young Poles. It is to reach about 1 million young Poles, Pichai said.",
      "Tusk said the plans will increase Poland\u2019s security and will contribute to the country\u2019s economic development. Earlier this week he said that Google and Microsoft will be among international businesses that will invest some 650 billion zlotys ($ 160 billion) in Poland in 2025.",
      "Tusk also invited Google to contribute to the deregulating efforts in Poland that aim to cut on red tape and regulations and give businesses more space for development."

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Ukraine has offered to strike a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump for continued American military aid in exchange for developing Ukraine\u2019s mineral industry, which could provide a valuable source of the rare earth elements that are essential for many kinds of technology.",
      "Trump said that he wanted such a deal earlier this month, and it was initially proposed last fall by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as part of his plan to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s hand in future negotiations with Moscow.",
      "\u201cWe really have this big potential in the territory which we control,\u201d Andrii Yermak, chief of staff to the Ukrainian president, said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe are interested to work, to develop, with our partners, first of all, with the United States.\u201d",

      "Rare earth elements are a set of 17 elements that are essential to many kinds of consumer technology, including cellphones, hard drives and electric and hybrid vehicles.",
      "It's unclear if Trump is seeking specific elements in Ukraine, which also has other minerals to offer.",

      "For Ukraine, such a deal would ensure that its biggest and most consequential ally doesn't freeze military support. That would be devastating for the country, which has been at war for nearly three years after Russia's full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "The idea also comes at a time when reliable and uninterrupted access to critical minerals is increasingly hard to come by globally.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s rare earth elements are largely untapped because of the war and because of state policies regulating the mineral industry. The country also lacks good information to guide the development of rare earth mining.",
      "Geological data is thin because mineral reserves are scattered across Ukraine, and existing studies are considered largely inadequate. The industry's true potential is clouded by insufficient research, according to businessmen and analysts.",
      "In general, the outlook for Ukrainian natural resources is promising. The country's reserves of titanium, a key component for the aerospace, medical and automotive industries, are believed to be among Europe\u2019s largest. Ukraine also holds some of Europe\u2019s largest known reserves of lithium, which is required to produce batteries, ceramics and glass.",
      "In 2021, the Ukrainian mineral industry accounted for 6.1% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product and 30% of exports.",
      "An estimated 40% of Ukraine's metallic mineral resources are inaccessible because of Russian occupation, according to data from We Build Ukraine, a Kyiv-based think tank. Ukraine has argued that it's in Trump\u2019s interest to develop the remainder before Russian advances capture more.",
      "The European Commission, the executive branch of the European Union, identified Ukraine as a potential supplier for more than 20 critical raw materials and concluded that if the country joins the 27-nation EU, it could strengthen the European economy.",
      "Details of any deal will likely develop in meetings between U.S. and Ukrainian officials. Zelenskyy and Trump will probably discuss the subject when they meet.",
      "U.S. companies have expressed interest, according to Ukrainian business officials. But striking a formal deal would likely require legislation, geological surveys and negotiation of specific terms.",
      "It's unclear what kind of security guarantees companies would require to risk working in Ukraine, even in the event of a ceasefire. And no one knows for sure what kind of financing agreements would underpin contracts between Ukraine and U.S companies.",

      "The omissions gained attention online over the last week, particularly around upcoming events that are no longer automatically listed. But Google says it made the change midway through last year.",
      "The California-based tech giant said it manually added \"a broader set of cultural moments in a wide number of countries\u201d for several years, supplementing public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com that have been used to populate Google Calendar for over a decade. Still, the company added, it received feedback about some other missing events and countries.",
      "\u201cMaintaining hundreds of moments manually and consistently globally wasn\u2019t scalable or sustainable,\u201d Google said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \"So in mid-2024 we returned to showing only public holidays and national observances from timeanddate.com globally, while allowing users to manually add other important moments.\u201d",

Last week, Google outlined plans to scrap some of its diversity hiring targets \u2014 joining a growing list of U.S. companies that have abandoned or scaled back their diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Google's move notably came in the wake of an executive order aimed, in part, at pressuring government contractors to end DEI initiatives. As a federal contractor, Google said it was evaluating required changes.",

      "PARIS -- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has dismissed a $97.4 billion takeover bid led by rival Elon Musk, but the unsolicited offer could complicate Altman's push to transform the maker of ChatGPT into a for-profit company.",
      "\"We are not for sale,\u201d Altman said Tuesday at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris.",
      "Musk\u2019s bid, announced Monday, is the latest in a bitter years-long battle with Altman over control of the AI startup they both helped found a decade ago as a nonprofit and is now a leading force in the global boom surrounding generative AI technology.",
      "\u201cOpenAI has a mission,\u201d Altman told France\u2019s AI minister in an on-stage discussion Tuesday mobbed by tech industry workers and investors. \u201cWe are an unusual organization and we have this mission of making AGI benefit all humanity. And we are here to do that.\u201d",
      "Its stated aim since its founding in 2015 is to safely build futuristic, better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Musk, an early investor and board member, quit OpenAI in 2018 after an internal power struggle left Altman in charge.",
      "Their public feud has escalated over the past year as Musk sued OpenAI and is working to grow his own AI company called xAI, part of a business empire that includes Tesla, SpaceX and social media platform X. Musk also now holds power as a top adviser to President Donald Trump in reshaping the U.S. government, and has publicly questioned OpenAI\u2019s Trump-backed private investment project for building AI data centers in the United States.",

      "OpenAI's nonprofit board will need to consider Musk's offer. It's not Altman alone who can accept or reject it, though the chair of the board, Bret Taylor, echoed Altman's approach and declared \u201cOpenAI is not for sale\u201d at a Wall Street Journal event Tuesday in Palo Alto, California.",
      "Taylor said Musk's move was \u201clargely a distraction\u201d from the board's fiduciary duty to its mission.",
      "As a nonprofit board, said Taylor, \u201cour job is very simple, which is to basically evaluate every strategic decision of the organization through that one test, which is, \u2018Does this actually further the mission of ensuring AGI benefits humanity?\u2019 And I have a hard time seeing how this would.\u201d",
      "The board will need to weigh not just the value of the company's assets but also the value of controlling the company developing this technology. Musk's offer also seems to set a floor for how much the nonprofit should be paid if it does relinquish control of its subsidiaries.",
      "Rose Chan Loui, executive director for the Lowell Milken Center on Philanthropy and Nonprofits at UCLA Law, said the board should consider the credibility of Musk's offer, including if he and his investors will pay in cash. And they should consider whether a new board under the control of Musk and other investors would be independent and what guarantees they can give about protecting its public mission.",
      "Musk's $44 billion Twitter takeover in 2022 also started with an unsolicited offer and a legal fight with Twitter's board, which was also led by Taylor, a former Facebook and Salesforce executive. However, taking over OpenAI would be more complicated because of its charitable purpose.",
      "\u201cThere is a legally binding purpose,\u201d said Jill Horwitz, a professor at UCLA School of Law. \u201cIt is the promise that was made to the public when OpenAI, the nonprofit, was formed. That promise is legally enforceable.\u201d",
      "The sudden popularity of ChatGPT two years ago brought worldwide fame and new commercial possibilities to OpenAI and also heightened internal turmoil over the future of the organization and the advanced AI it was trying to develop. Its nonprofit board fired Altman in late 2023. He came back days later with a new board.",
      "OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit purpose, as defined most recently in 2020, is \u201c(to) ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity, including by conducting and/or funding artificial intelligence research.\u201d",
      "The question is, can it do that if it sells its assets and loses control of the company developing this technology?",
      "\u201cTo make the promise to the world that you are bound by a legal purpose and to build with that promise, including telling your investors not to expect any returns and to think of your investments as more akin to a donation than an investment,\" said Horwitz. \"And then to say once you\u2019ve gotten big enough, \u2019You know what? We\u2019d like to own this.' That seems like a real violation of the promise.\u201d",
      "Musk sued OpenAI last year, first in a California state court and later in federal court, alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab that would benefit the public good. A lawyer for Musk has said he invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018.",
      "Lawyers for OpenAI and Musk faced off in a California federal court last week as a judge weighed Musk\u2019s request for a court order that would block OpenAI's for-profit conversion.",
      "The judge hasn\u2019t yet ruled on Musk\u2019s request but in the courtroom said it was a \u201cstretch\u201d for Musk to claim he will be irreparably harmed if she doesn\u2019t intervene to stop OpenAI from moving forward with its planned transition. But she also suggested Musk had plausible enough arguments to take to a jury trial.",
      "Along with Musk and xAI, others backing the bid announced Monday include Baron Capital Group, Valor Management, Atreides Management, Vy Fund, and firms run by Musk allies Ari Emanuel and Jon Lonsdale.",
      "Musk attorney Marc Toberoff said in a statement that if Altman and OpenAI\u2019s current board \u201care intent on becoming a fully for-profit corporation, it is vital that the charity be fairly compensated for what its leadership is taking away from it: control over the most transformative technology of our time.\u201d",
      "Altman told employees this week that OpenAI's structure \u201censures that no individual can take control of OpenAI\u201d and he has sought to characterize Musk's tactics as those of a competitor trying to catch up.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s probably just trying to slow us down. He obviously is a competitor,\u201d Altman told Bloomberg TV at the Paris summit on Tuesday.",
      "Continuing their deeply personal feud, Altman said Musk is probably not a \u201chappy person.\u201d",
      "\u201cProbably his whole life is from a position of insecurity. I feel for the guy,\u201d Altman said.",
      "\u2014-",
      "O'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island, and Beaty from Seattle.",
      "\u2014-",

      "Nearly 200 nations faced a Monday deadline to file what the United Nations\u2019 climate chief calls \u201camong the most important policy documents governments will produce this century.\"",
      "Nearly 200 nations faced a Monday deadline to file what the United Nations' climate chief calls \u201camong the most important policy documents governments will produce this century\u201d \u2014 their plans on how they will cut emissions of heat-trapping gases.",
      "Most won't make the deadline. The U.N. says that's OK as long as they are working on them.",
      "So far only a dozen of the 195 nations that signed the 2015 Paris climate agreement have filed their national plans for cutting emissions by 2035. Those nations account for only 16.2% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 the chief human-caused heat-trapping gas \u2014 and almost all of that is from the United States, where President Donald Trump has already discarded the plan submitted by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "Aside from the U.S., the only major emitters to submit 2035 targets are Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. The Marshall Islands, Singapore, Ecuador, Saint Lucia, Andorra, New Zealand, Switzerland and Uruguay have filed their plans, but they all produce less than 0.2% of the world's carbon dioxide.",
      "U.N. Climate Secretary Simon Stiell said that more than 170 countries have told his office they are working on their national plans, so he\u2019s not worried. He emphasized quality over timeliness.",
      "\u201cTaking a bit more time to ensure these plans are first-rate makes sense,\u201d Stiell said last week in a policy speech in Brazil. \u201cThese will be the most comprehensive climate plans ever developed.\u201d",
      "Champa Patel, policy director of the nonprofit Climate Group, wasn't as forgiving.",
      "\u201cIt's worrying that countries are failing to meet the urgency of the moment,\u201d Patel said. \u201cThe world cannot afford inaction.\u201d",
      "These plans \u2014 officially called Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs \u2014 are the main mechanism of the landmark international agreement. Every five years, nations are supposed to come up with new and stronger five-year plans that outline their voluntary plans to limit or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "The latest versions are supposed to be compatible with the Paris agreement's goal of limiting long-term warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. The world is now at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 1800s and on pace to warm another 1.8 degrees Celsius (3.2 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the U.N.",
      "Scientists say the warming atmosphere is driving ever more extreme weather events, including flooding, droughts, hurricanes, heat waves and wildfires that are killing people and causing billions of dollars in damage every year.",
      "The new targets are also supposed to be for all greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride. They should cover the entire economy not just the energy sector, according to a 2023 agreement.",
      "Climate Action Tracker \u2014 a group of scientists and other experts who analyze nations' climate plans for domestic emissions \u2014 found that four of the six NDC targets they looked at so far got an \u201calmost sufficient\" for their target of holding warming to 2 degrees Celsius. Switzerland got an insufficient, with the group saying its plan was more compatible with 3 degrees of warming. The U.K.'s plan was rated compatible for 1.5 degrees of warming.",
      "Britain's plan aims to cut emissions by at least 81% by 2035 when compared to 1990 emissions, mentioning efforts to phase out new internal combustion cars \u2014 which only use gasoline and diesel \u2014 by 2030. Brazil in its plan gave a range of emission cuts of 59% to 67% by 2035 when compared to 2005 emissions, talking heavily about an emphasis on climate justice, repeatedly mentioning efforts to combat deforestation.",
      "Most of those countries were rated insufficient when it compared what they plan to do with what they are actually doing and what their \u201cfair share\u201d is considering their resources and history. That included the U.S., where one of Trump's first actions last month was pulling out of the Paris agreement.",
      "\u201cWe know already right now that whatever (other) countries put out, it is not enough,\u201d Climate Action Tracker co-founder Niklas Hohne told The Associated Press Monday. \u201cThey all need to do more.\u201d",
      "The deadline \u2014 set in the Paris agreement to be nine months before the next international climate negotiations, this year in Belem, Brazil \u2014 is 11:59 p.m. in Germany, where the U.N. climate office is.",
      "But Stiell said the real deadline is in September. That's when the United Nations will tally up all the plans and figure out how much emissions will be cut and how much future warming will be prevented if countries do what they promise.",
      "That's a big if.",
      "The European Union and China should be done by the middle of the year and India will only submit their target after other major emitting nations do so, Hohne said.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk has long railed against the U.S. government, saying numerous investigations and safety programs have stymied Tesla, his electric car company, and its efforts to create fleets of robotaxis and other self-driving automobiles",
      "WASHINGTON -- Elon Musk has long railed against the U.S. government, saying a crushing number of federal investigations and safety programs have stymied Tesla, his electric car company, and its efforts to create fleets of robotaxis and other self-driving automobiles.",
      "Now, Musk\u2019s close relationship with President Donald Trump means many of those federal headaches could vanish within weeks or months.",
      "On the potential chopping block: crash investigations into Tesla\u2019s partially automated vehicles; a Justice Department criminal probe examining whether Musk and Tesla have overstated their cars\u2019 self-driving capabilities; and a government mandate to report crash data on vehicles using technology like Tesla\u2019s Autopilot.",
      "The consequences of such actions could prove dire, say safety advocates who credit the federal investigations and recalls with saving lives.",
      "\u201cMusk wants to run the Department of Transportation,\u201d said Missy Cummings, a former senior safety adviser at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. \u201cI\u2019ve lost count of the number of investigations that are underway with Tesla. They will all be gone.\u201d",
      "Within days of Trump taking office, the White House and Musk began waging an unbridled war against the federal government \u2014 freezing spending and programs while sacking a host of career employees, including prosecutors and government watchdogs typically shielded from such brazen dismissals without cause.",
      "The actions have sparked outcries from legal scholars who say the Trump administration\u2019s actions are without modern-day precedent and are already upending the balance of power in Washington.",
      "The Trump administration has not yet declared any actions that could benefit Tesla or Musk\u2019s other companies. However, snuffing out federal investigations or jettisoning safety initiatives would be an easier task than their assault on regulators and the bureaucracy.",
      "Investigations into companies like Tesla can be shut down overnight by the new leaders of agencies. And safety programs created through an agency order or initiative \u2014 not by laws passed by Congress or adopted through a formal regulatory process \u2014 can also be quickly dissolved by new leaders. Unlike many of the dismantling efforts that Trump and Musk have launched in recent weeks, stalling or killing such probes and programs would not be subject to legal challenges.",
      "As such, the temporal and fragile nature of the federal probes and safety programs make them easy targets for those seeking to weaken government oversight and upend long-established norms.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s election, and the bromance between Trump and Musk, will essentially lead to the defanging of a regulatory environment that\u2019s been stifling Tesla,\u201d said Daniel Ives, a veteran Wall Street technology and automobile industry analyst.",
      "Among Musk\u2019s businesses, the federal government\u2019s power over Tesla to investigate, order recalls, and mandate crash data reporting is perhaps the most wide-ranging. However, the ways the Trump administration could quickly ease up on Tesla also apply in some measure to other companies in Musk\u2019s sprawling business empire.",
      "A host of Musk's other businesses \u2014 such as his aerospace company SpaceX and his social media company X \u2014 are subjects of federal investigations.",
      "Musk\u2019s businesses are also intertwined with the federal government, pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars each year in contracts. SpaceX, for example, has secured nearly $20 billion in federal funds since 2008 to ferry astronauts and satellites into space. Tesla, meanwhile, has received $41.9 million from the U.S. government, including payment for vehicles provided to some U.S. embassies.",
      "Musk, Tesla\u2019s billionaire CEO, has found himself in his newly influential position by enthusiastically backing Trump\u2019s third bid for the White House. He was the largest donor to the campaign, plunging more than $270 million of his vast fortune into Trump\u2019s political apparatus, most of it during the final months of the heated presidential race.",
      "Those donations and his efforts during the campaign \u2014 including the transformation of his social media platform X into a firehose of pro-Trump commentary \u2014 have been rewarded by Trump, who has tapped the entrepreneur to oversee efforts to slash government regulations and spending.",
      "As the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk operates out of an office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where most White House staff work and from where he has launched his assault on the federal government. Musk\u2019s power under DOGE is being challenged in the courts.",
      "Even before Trump took office, there were signs that Musk\u2019s vast influence with the new administration was registering with the public \u2014 and paying dividends for Tesla.",
      "Tesla\u2019s stock surged more than 60% by December. Since then, its stock price has dropped, but still remains 40% higher than it was before Trump's election.",
      "\u201cFor Musk,\u201d said Ives, the technology analyst, \u201cbetting on Trump is a poker move for the ages.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to questions about how it would handle investigations and government oversight involving Tesla or other Musk companies. A spokesman for the transition team said last month that the White House would ensure that DOGE and \u201cthose involved with it are compliant with all legal guidelines and conflicts of interest.\u201d",
      "In the weeks before Trump took office on Jan. 20, the president-elect\u2019s transition team recommended changes that would benefit the billionaire and his car company, including scrapping the federal order requiring carmakers to report crash data involving self-driving and partially automated technology.",
      "The action would be a boon for Tesla, which has reported a vast majority of the crashes that triggered a series of investigations and recalls.",
      "The transition team also recommended shelving a $7,500 consumer tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, something Musk has publicly called for.",
      "\u201cTake away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla,\u201d Musk wrote in a post on X as he campaigned and raised money for Trump in July.",
      "Auto industry experts say the move would have a nominal impact on Tesla \u2014 by far the largest electric vehicle maker in the U.S. \u2014 but have a potentially devastating impact on its competitors in the EV sector since they are still struggling to secure a foothold in the market.",
      "Musk did not respond to requests for comment. Before the election, he posted a message on X, saying he had never asked Trump \u201cfor any favors, nor has he offered me any.\u201d",
      "Although most of the changes that Musk might seek for Tesla could unfold quickly, there is one long-term goal that could impact the autonomous vehicle industry for decades to come.",
      "Though nearly 30 states have rules that specifically govern self-driving cars, the federal government has yet to craft such regulations.",
      "During a late October call with Tesla investors, as Musk was pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into Trump\u2019s campaign, he signaled support for having the federal government create these rules.",
      "\u201cThere should be a federal approval process for autonomous vehicles,\u201d Musk said on the call. \u201cIf there\u2019s a department of government efficiency, I\u2019ll try to help make that happen.\u201d",
      "Musk leads that very organization.",
      "People whose lives have been forever changed by Tesla crashes fear that dangerous and fatal accidents may increase if the federal government\u2019s investigative and recall powers are restricted.",
      "They say they worry that the company may otherwise never be held accountable for its failures, like the one that took the life of 22-year-old Naibel Benavides Leon.",
      "The college student was on a date with her boyfriend, gazing at the stars on the side of a rural Florida road, when they were struck by an out-of-control Tesla driving on Autopilot \u2014 a system that allows Tesla cars to operate without driver input. The car had blown through a stop sign, a flashing light and five yellow warning signs, according to dashcam video and a police report.",
      "Benavides Leon died at the scene; her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, suffered injuries but survived. A federal investigation determined that Autopilot in Teslas at this time was faulty and needed repairs.",
      "\u201cWe, as a family, have never been the same,\u201d said Benavides Leon\u2019s sister, Neima. \u201cI\u2019m an engineer, and everything that we design and we build has to be by important codes and regulations. This technology cannot be an exception.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has to be investigated when it fails,\u201d she added. \u201cBecause it does fail.\u201d",
      "Tesla\u2019s lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement on Twitter in December 2023, Tesla pointed to an earlier lawsuit the Benavides Leon's family had brought against the driver who struck the college student. He testified that despite using Autopilot, \u201cI was highly aware that it was still my responsibility to operate the vehicle safely.\u201d",
      "Tesla also said the driver \u201cwas pressing the accelerator to maintain 60 mph,\" an action that effectively overrode Autopilot, which would have otherwise restricted the speed to 45 mph on the rural route, something Benavides Leon's attorney disputes.",
      "The federal agency that has the most power over Tesla \u2014 and the entire automobile industry \u2014 is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is part of the Department of Transportation.",
      "NHTSA sets automobile safety standards that must be met before vehicles can enter the marketplace. It also has a quasi-law enforcement arm, the Office of Defects Investigation, which has the power to launch probes into crashes and seek recalls for safety defects.",
      "The agency has six pending investigations into Tesla\u2019s self-driving technology, prompted by dozens of crashes that took place when the computerized systems were in use.",
      "Other federal agencies are also investigating Musk and Tesla, and all of those probes could be sidelined by Musk-friendly officials:",
      "\u2014The Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department are separately investigating whether Musk and Tesla overstated the autonomous capabilities of their vehicles, creating dangerous situations in which drivers may over rely on the car\u2019s technology.",
      "\u2014The Justice Department is also probing whether Tesla misled customers about how far its electric vehicles can travel before needing a charge.",
      "\u2014The National Labor Relations Board is weighing 12 unfair labor practice allegations leveled by workers at Tesla plants.",
      "\u2014The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is asking a federal judge to force Tesla to enact reforms and pay compensatory and punitive damages and backpay to Black employees who say they were subjected to racist attacks. In a federal lawsuit, the agency has alleged that supervisors and other employees at Tesla\u2019s plant in Fremont, California, routinely hurled racist insults at Black employees.",
      "Experts said most, if not all, of those investigations could be shut down, especially at the Justice Department where Trump has long shown a willingness to meddle in the department\u2019s affairs. The Trump administration has already ordered the firing of dozens of prosecutors who handled the criminal cases from the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol.",
      "\u201cDOJ is not going to be prosecuting Elon Musk,\u201d said Peter Zeidenberg, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Justice Department's public integrity section who served during the Clinton and George H.W. Bush administrations. \u201cI\u2019d expect that any investigations that were ongoing will be ground to an abrupt end.\u201d",
      "Trump has also taken steps to gain control of the NLRB and EEOC. Last month, he fired Democratic members of the board and commission, breaking with decades of precedent. One member has sued, and two others are exploring legal options.",
      "Tesla and Musk have denied wrongdoing in all those investigations and are fighting the probes.",
      "The federal agency that appears to have enjoyed the most success in changing Tesla\u2019s behavior is NHTSA, an organization of about 750 staffers that has forced the company to hand over crash data and cooperate in its investigations and requested recalls.",
      "\u201cNHTSA has been a thorn in Musk\u2019s side for over the last decade, and he\u2019s grappled with almost every three-letter agency in the Beltway,\u201d said Ives, the Wall Street analyst who covers the technology sector and automobile industry. \u201cThat\u2019s all created what looks to be a really big soap opera in 2025.\u201d",
      "Musk has repeatedly blamed the federal government for impeding Tesla\u2019s progress and creating negative publicity with recalls of his cars after its self-driving technology malfunctions or crashes.",
      "\u201cThe word \u2018recall\u2019 should be recalled,\u201d Musk posted on Twitter (now X) in 2014. Two years ago, he posted, \u201cThe word \u2018recall\u2019 for an over-the-air software update is anachronistic and just flat wrong!\u201d",
      "Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, said some investigations might continue under Trump, but a recall is less likely to happen if a defect is found.",
      "As with most car companies, Tesla\u2019s recalls have so far been voluntary. The threat of public hearings about a defect that precedes a NHTSA-ordered recall has generally prompted car companies to act on their own.",
      "That threat could be easily stripped away by the new NHTSA administrator, who will be a Trump appointee.",
      "\u201cIf there isn\u2019t a threat of recall, will Tesla do them?\u201d Brooks said. \u201cUnfortunately, this is where politics seeps in.\u201d",
      "Among the active NHTSA investigations, several are examining fundamental aspects of Tesla\u2019s partially automated driving systems that were in use when dozens of crashes occurred.",
      "An investigation of Tesla\u2019s \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system started in October after Tesla reported four crashes to NHTSA in which the vehicles had trouble navigating through sun glare, fog and airborne dust. In one of the accidents, an Arizona woman was killed after stopping on a freeway to help someone involved in another crash.",
      "Under pressure from NHTSA, Tesla has twice recalled the \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d feature for software updates. The technology \u2014 the most advanced of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot systems \u2014 is supposed to allow drivers to travel from point to point with little human intervention. But repeated malfunctions led NHTSA to recently launch a new inquiry that includes a crash in July that killed a motorcyclist near Seattle.",
      "NHTSA announced its latest investigation in January into \u201cActually Smart Summon,\u201d a Tesla technology that allows drivers to remotely move a car, after the agency learned of four incidents from a driver and several media reports.",
      "The agency said that in each collision, the vehicles were using the system that Tesla pushed out in a September software update that was \u201cfailing to detect posts or parked vehicles, resulting in a crash.\u201d NHTSA also criticized Tesla for failing to notify the agency of those accidents.",
      "NHTSA is also conducting a probe into whether a 2023 recall of Autopilot, the most basic of Tesla\u2019s partially automated driver assistance systems, was effective.",
      "That recall was supposed to boost the number of controls and alerts to keep drivers engaged; it had been prompted by an earlier NHTSA investigation that identified hundreds of crashes involving Autopilot that resulted in scores of injuries and more than a dozen deaths.",
      "In a letter to Tesla in April, agency investigators noted that crashes involving Autopilot continue and that they could not observe a difference between warnings issued to drivers before or after the new software had been installed.",
      "Critics have said that Teslas don\u2019t have proper sensors to be fully self-driving. Nearly all other companies working on autonomous vehicles use radar and laser sensors in addition to cameras to see better in the dark or in poor visibility conditions. Tesla, on the other hand, relies only on cameras to spot hazards.",
      "Musk has said that human drivers rely on their eyesight, so autonomous cars should be able to also get by with just cameras. He has called technology that relies on radar and light detection to discern objects a \u201cfool\u2019s errand.\u201d",
      "Bryant Walker Smith, a Stanford Law School scholar and a leading automated driving expert, said Musk\u2019s contention that the federal government is holding him back is not accurate. The problem, Smith said, is that Tesla\u2019s autonomous vehicles cannot perform as advertised.",
      "\u201cBlaming the federal government for holding them back, it provides a convenient, if dubious, scapegoat for the lack of an actual automated driving system that works,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Smith and other autonomous vehicle experts say Musk has felt pressure to provide Tesla shareholders with excuses for repeated delays in rolling out its futuristic cars. The financial stake is enormous, which Musk acknowledged during a 2022 interview. He said the development of a fully self-driving vehicle was \u201creally the difference between Tesla being worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero.\u201d",
      "The collisions from Tesla\u2019s malfunctioning technology on its vehicles have led not only to deaths but also catastrophic injuries that have forever altered people\u2019s lives.",
      "Attorneys representing people injured in Tesla crashes \u2014 or who represent surviving family members of those who died \u2014 say without NHTSA, the only other way to hold the car company accountable is through civil lawsuits.",
      "\u201cWhen government can\u2019t do it, then the civil justice system is left to pick up the slack,\u201d said Brett Schreiber, whose law firm is handling four Tesla cases.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 23:06:26 -0500",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump says he is banning federal use of paper straws, saying they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t work&rdquo; and don&rsquo;t last very long",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump says he is banning federal use of paper straws, saying they \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d and don\u2019t last very long",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Monday he is banning federal use of paper straws, saying they \u201cdon\u2019t work\u201d and don't last very long. Instead he wants the government to exclusively move to plastic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous situation. We\u2019re going back to plastic straws,\u201d Trump said as he signed an executive order to reverse federal purchasing policies that encourage paper straws and restrict plastic ones. The order directs federal agencies to stop buying paper straws \u201cand otherwise ensure that paper straws are no longer provided within agency buildings.\u201d",
      "The move by Trump \u2014 who has long railed against paper straws, and whose 2019 reelection campaign sold Trump-branded reusable plastic straws for $15 per pack of 10 \u2014 targets a Biden administration policy to phase out federal purchases of single-use plastics, including straws, from food service operations, events and packaging by 2027, and from all federal operations by 2035.",
      "Trump declared President Joe Biden\u2019s policy \u201cDEAD!\u201d in a social media post over the weekend.",
      "While plastic straws have been blamed for polluting oceans and harming marine life, Trump said Monday that he thinks \"it's OK\u201d to continue using them. \u201cI don\u2019t think that plastic is going to affect the shark very much as they\u2019re eating, as they\u2019re munching their way through the ocean,'' he said at a White House announcement.",
      "Several U.S. states and cities have banned plastic straws, and some restaurants no longer automatically give them to customers. But plastic straws are only a small part of the problem. The environment is littered with single-use plastic food and beverage containers \u2014 water bottles, takeout containers, coffee lids, shopping bags and more.",
      "Around the world, the equivalent of one garbage truck of plastic enters the ocean every minute from a range of sources, including plastic bags, toothbrushes, bottles, food packaging and more, experts say. As those materials break down in the environment, microplastics are turning up in the stomachs of fish, birds and other animals, as well as in human blood and tissue.",
      "And plastic manufacturing releases planet-warming greenhouse gases and other dangerous pollutants. More than 90% of plastic products are derived from fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas, and millions of tons of plastic waste enter the world\u2019s oceans every year. Many multinational companies have moved away from plastic straws and have made reducing plastic use across their operations central to their sustainability goals, making Trump's decision an outlier in the business world.",
      "Trump\u2019s order is \u201cmore about messaging than finding solutions,\u2033 said Christy Leavitt, plastics campaign director for the environmental group Oceana, noting that most U.S. voters support requiring companies to reduce single-use plastic packaging and foodware.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is moving in the wrong direction on single-use plastics,'' Leavitt said. \u201cThe world is facing a plastic pollution crisis, and we can no longer ignore one of the biggest environmental threats facing our oceans and our planet today.\u201d",
      "The plastic manufacturing industry applauded Trump's move.",
      "\u201cStraws are just the beginning,\u201d Matt Seaholm, president and CEO of the Plastics Industry Association, said in a statement. \u201c\u2018Back to Plastic\u2019 is a movement we should all get behind.\u201d",
      "More than 390 million straws are used every day in the United States, mostly for 30 minutes or less, according to advocacy group Straws Turtle Island Restoration Network. Straws take at least 200 years to decompose and pose a threat to turtles and other wildlife as they degrade into microplastics, the group says.",
      "\"To prevent another sea turtle from becoming a victim to plastic, we must make personal lifestyle alterations to fight for these species,'' the group said in a statement.",
      "Every year, the world produces more than 400 million tons of new plastic. About 40% of all plastics are used in packaging, according to the United Nations.",
      "Globally, nations are creating a treaty to address plastic pollution. Leaders met for a week in South Korea late last year but didn\u2019t reach an agreement. Talks resume this year as more than 100 countries pursue a pact that limits plastic production as well as tackles cleanup and recycling.",
      "The U.S., China and Germany are the biggest players in the global plastics trade. U.S. manufacturers have asked Trump to remain at the negotiating table, and to revert to Biden\u2019s previous position that focused on redesigning plastic products, recycling and reuse.",
      "White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who presented the executive order to Trump, told him the push for paper straws has cost the government and private industry \u201can absolute ton of money and left consumers all over the country wildly dissatisfied with their straws. It really is something that affects ordinary Americans in their everyday lives.\"",

A scammer than builds trust over a period of time before they ask their target for money \u2014 either by claiming hardship or offering investment opportunities, usually in cryptocurrency.",
      "Meta said it recently worked with research firm Graphika to take down romance scams in three common categories: those impersonating military officers, celebrity mimics and scammers posing as fake match-making agencies that target people in Africa \u2014 \u201cclaiming to offer opportunities to meet rich men from Western countries or build relationships with \u2018African women.'\"",
      "In addition to taking down scam networks, Meta says it is testing other tools to combat bad actors, including facial recognition technology that compares suspicious users' profile photos against a public figure's image. But, for now, that only works for celebrity impersonations.",
      "To stay vigilant, Meta recommend people be suspicious of messages from strangers. If you do engage, try to verify the person\u2019s identity by looking them up on the platform \u2014 check when their accounts were created or use a reverse image search on their photos. Requests for money, whether in the form of gift cards or payment apps, should also be treated with skepticism.",

      "PARIS -- JD Vance is stepping onto the world stage for the first time as U.S. vice president this week, using a high-profile artificial intelligence summit in France and a gathering of national security leaders in Germany to showcase Donald Trump\u2019s more assertive approach to diplomacy.",
      "The 40-year-old vice president, who was just 18 months into his tenure as a senator before joining Trump\u2019s ticket, is expected, while in Paris, to push back on European efforts to tighten AI oversight while advocating for a more open, innovation-driven approach.",
      "The AI summit has drawn world leaders, top tech executives, and policymakers to discuss artificial intelligence\u2019s impact on global security, economics, and governance. High-profile attendees also include Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, signaling Beijing\u2019s deep interest in shaping global AI standards. The event highlights a growing divide between the European Union and other players pushing for more regulations to make the fast-moving technology safer for the public, and the U.S., where the Trump administration has prioritized business-friendly policies and technological dominance.",
      "Vance\u2019s trip extends beyond Paris. Later this week, he will travel to Germany for the Munich Security Conference, where he has said he plans to push European allies to step up their commitments to NATO and Ukraine.",
      "The summit will give some European leaders an introduction to Vance, who is making his first major overseas trip since taking office. He has signaled he will use the summit as a venue for candid discussions on AI policy and broader geopolitical issues.",
      "\u201cAt the AI Summit, the main reason I\u2019m going is actually to have some private conversations with the world leaders who are also going to be there,\u201d Vance told Breitbart News. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot that some of the leaders who are present at the AI summit could do to, frankly \u2014 bring the Russia-Ukraine conflict to a close, help us diplomatically there \u2014 and so we\u2019re going to be focused on those meetings in France.\u201d",
      "Vance is expected to meet separately on Tuesday on the sidelines of the summit with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, according to a person familiar with planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the yet to be formally announced bilateral meetings.",
      "Vance was joined by his wife Usha and their three children \u2014 Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel \u2014 for the trip to Europe. They were greeted in France on Monday morning by Manuel Valls, the minister for Overseas France, and the U.S. Embassy\u2019s charge d\u2019affaires, David McCawley.",
      "On Tuesday, Vance will have a working lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron, with discussions on Ukraine and the Middle East on the agenda. Vance, like the U.S. president, has questioned U.S. spending on Ukraine and the broader approach to isolating Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump promised to end the fighting within six months of taking office.",
      "Vance also addressed what he views as a concerning trend in Europe regarding free speech, a topic he raised last year at the Munich Security Conference.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, you\u2019ve seen in Europe a really significant, and I think, frankly, an evil trend towards censorship,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you hear a lot about America\u2019s moral leadership. One of the things that America\u2019s moral leadership is going to be about during President Trump\u2019s term is free speech. We want people to be able to speak their minds, and we believe that free and open debate is actually a good thing. Unfortunately, a lot of our European friends have gone the wrong direction there.\u201d",
      "Vance is attending Munich again, where he may meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He plans to revisit themes he raised last year, including \u201cto hit on\u201d the need for NATO allies to take on a greater share of responsibility.",
      "Leaders in Europe have been carefully watching Trump\u2019s recent statements on threats to impose tariffs on the European Union, take control of Greenland and his suggestion that Palestinians clear out of Gaza once the fighting in the Israel-Hamas conflict ends \u2014 an idea that\u2019s been flatly rejected by Arab allies.",
      "The summit, which gathers major players such as Google, Microsoft and OpenAI, aims at fostering AI advances in sectors like health, education, environment and culture.",
      "A global public-private partnership named \u201cCurrent AI\u201d will be launched to support large-scale initiatives that serve the general interest.",
      "The Paris summit \u201cis the first time we\u2019ll have had such a broad international discussion in one place on the future of AI,\u201d said Linda Griffin, vice president of public policy at Mozilla. \u201cI see it as a norm-setting moment.\u201d",
      "Nick Reiners, senior geotechnology analyst at Eurasia Group, noted an opportunity to shape AI governance in a new direction by \u201cmoving away from this concentration of power amongst a handful of private actors and building this public interest AI instead.\"",
      "However, it remains unclear if the United States will support such initiatives.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of complicated questions to resolve\u201d around issues like the ability to control AI systems, Nobel Prize winner Demis Hassabis, founder of Google\u2019s DeepMind research lab, said. \u201cBut also I think even more complicated are maybe the geopolitical questions about things like regulation.\u201d",
      "French organizers are also looking for the summit to ignite major investment announcements in Europe, positioning the region as a viable contender in an industry increasingly shaped by a growing U.S.-China rivalry.",
      "France plans to announce AI private investments worth a total of 109 billion euros ($113 billion) over the coming years, Macron said, presenting it as \u201cthe equivalent\u201d of Trump's Stargate AI data centers project.",

      "She suggested her decision would come down over the next few days, but not on Friday night.",
      "The 19 states brought the lawsuit against Musk and the administration, arguing that allowing Musk's associates to access the Treasury Department's payment system as part of Trump's campaign pledge to slash the federal government would be a \"huge cybersecurity risk\" and potentially allow the Trump administration to unlawfully \"block federal funds from reaching beneficiaries who do not align with the President's political agenda.\"",

      "The lawsuit -- filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James and 18 other state attorneys general -- raised particular concern about unvetted DOGE employees accessing sensitive government records including social security numbers, bank information, and federal tax returns. According to the lawsuit, Musk being able to access the Bureau of Fiscal Services -- which serves as the country's checkbook by dispersing trillions in funding -- could allow Musk to cut off government spending from the source.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 14:12:59 -0500",
    "summary": "If the Department of Education is dismantled, as some Republican lawmakers are hoping to do, public school K-12 educators fear what programs could be impacted.",
    "story": [
      "Educators are concerned about funding for disabled and low-income students.",
      "Heather Stambaugh, a high school teacher in rural Ohio, said she sees the impact of federal funding every day in her classrooms.",
      "It opens up opportunities for individual aides to work one-on-one with high-need students, she said, or to lead small group learning sessions that help students achieve \"light bulb\" moments they may not have otherwise.",
      "\"At the end of the day, this is the next generation of doctors and lawyers, business executives,\" Stambaugh told ABC News. \"But they're not going to have as many opportunities if we don't have enough staff and we don't have the tools.\"",
      "Federal funds from the Department of Education support programs, resources and sometimes even staffing to address educational barriers faced by low-income, low-performing, disabled and rural students, among others.",
      "If the department is dismantled, as President Donald Trump and some Republican lawmakers have said they hope to do, public school K-12 educators fear these programs could be diminished.",
      "\"The first people that are going to feel that are second- and third-graders who are getting specific reading interventions that will help them be closer to grade level. I have high schoolers who are reading well below a ninth-grade level, and that would only get worse,\" Stambaugh said. \"And then to wonder to yourself will this child be able to read a medical document to sign? Will this child be able to conduct just the general business of life? Because at the bare minimum, that's what schools are offering.\"",
      "Detroit high school teacher Rodney Fresh said he's seen students that might have been considered \"a throwaway child by society \u2026 become a productive member of society when they graduate\" because of the Michigan school's career and technical programs, which get federal funding.",
      "\"I've seen students where traditional schooling hasn't necessarily been beneficial, but we get them in supportive career tech programs that are supported by federal finances, and they excel. They find their niche,\" Fresh told ABC News.",
      "Established in 1980 by Congress, the department is intended to collect data and research on schooling and education, direct supportive funds to targeted communities, and investigate and enforce civil rights anti-discrimination law. It's the smallest Cabinet-level department, with less than 5,000 employees.",
      "The department does not dictate or implement policy on school curriculum.",
      "President Trump said he wants to eliminate the department and \"send all education work and needs back to the States,\" according to Trump's Agenda47 campaign.",
      "Trump's team hasn't clarified what it would mean to give the power back to the states, though he has cited the use of \"block grants\" by the federal government as a way to further expand school voucher programs.",
      "In the ongoing efforts to dismantle the Department of Education, lawmakers have recommended redirecting program enforcement and funds to other federal departments.",
      "\"The federal Department of Education has never educated a single student, and it's long past time to end this bureaucratic Department that causes more harm than good,\" U.S. Senator Mike Rounds said when introducing legislation to dismantle the department.",
      "A statement from his office continued, stating: \"Despite its inefficiencies, there are several important programs housed within the Department. Rounds' legislation would redirect these to Departments of Interior, Treasury, Health and Human Services, Labor and State.\"",
      "ABC News has reached out to the White House and the Department of Education for comment.",
      "\"Many of the concerns that people have with education and the direction of education this country, whether it be curriculum, instruction or even instructional materials, are not handled by the Department of Education,\" Rep. Jahana Hayes, a Democrat on the House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, said in an interview with ABC News.",
      "\"Those are already local decisions that are handled by local boards of education, state boards of education. So all of that is handled locally.\"",
      "Federal funding makes up 11% of school revenue nationwide, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.",
      "However, the weight this funding carries is heavier for some states than others; federal dollars make up roughly 20% of South Dakota school revenue and 19% of revenue in Mississippi and Montana. These are the biggest recipients of federal dollars in the country, the NCES noted.",
      "States like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are among the smallest recipients, with federal dollars making up just 5% of school revenue.",
      "Among the grants and funds delivered by the department are Title I funding and Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funding. These federal financial assistance programs are geared towards communities facing high levels of poverty or disabled populations. They can support services like additional reading and mathematics instruction and staffing, speech or behavioral therapy, after-school and summer programs.",
      "Across Ohio, the state's Coalition for the Education of Children with Disabilities reports that almost 16% of students have a disability of some kind.",
      "Stambaugh said she sees the role that federal funding plays for the disabled students in her classrooms each day. She noted the money subsidizes the salaries or pay for tutors, individual aids for highly disabled children and intervention specialists aimed at helping struggling readers and performers.",
      "Getting rid of federal funding, Stambaugh argued, \"gives our highest vulnerability students less one-on-one attention, less individualized education, and it puts them at greater risk to be even further behind the peers that they're already testing behind.\"",
      "In Detroit, where about 84% of kids are eligible for free and/or reduced-price lunch, schools have become more than a place for students to learn.",
      "For those who come to school hungry, need a place to wash and dry their clothes, or need additional help with literacy and math after class, federal funding helps schools run additional services for students in need, according to Fresh.",
      "\"For some students, I become a counselor, a social worker, a big brother, a dad, and so I don't think you ever really get to just turn off from being a teacher,\" said Fresh. \"I think it's a 24/7 job.\"",
      "Title I and IDEA were established through Congress, just as the Department of Education was, and it would take Congress to lead their undoing, some lawmakers told ABC News.",
      "Hayes told ABC News that she expects Trump and billionaire businessman and Trump confidant Elon Musk to \"strangle the funding\" of the department if it can't be dismantled.",
      "\"What we're seeing through some of the actions with other organizations is that we are dealing with an administration that is not following the rules as they've been established,\" Hayes said. \"The Department of Education was set up by an act of Congress, and can only be dismantled by an act of Congress.\"",
      "Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has already made sizable cuts to the Education Department \u2013 slashing 89 independent research contracts at the department's Institute of Education Sciences worth nearly $900 million, according to DOGE's post on X and confirmed by a department spokesperson on Feb. 11.",
      "But with the thin Republican majority in the House and Senate, it's unclear just how likely it would be for Congress to dismantle the department completely.",
      "Utah Republican Rep. Burgess Owens told ABC News it'll be a congressional numbers game to take down the Education Department, but noted that he has to \"see if executive order can really do that or not.\"",
      "\"All the things will be tested,\" he said.",
      "Owens, who supports dismantling the department, said that issuing block grants to states could serve as a replacement for the department's programs, adding that there would have to be some state accountability for funds.",
      "\"If this is not working, let's be innovative. Let's be creative, and we figure out something else,\" he said.",

      "\u201cPeople wanted that very badly,\u201d Trump said.",
      "In a fact sheet provided to reporters, the White House said the order was necessary because COVID vaccine mandates were \"threatening educational opportunities for students.\"",

      "Some states and cities had proposed COVID vaccine mandates after the pandemic, including California, but quickly dropped them due to pushback from parents.",
      "Trump's directive also calls on Health an Humans Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the incoming Education secretary to \"provide a plan to end coercive COVID-19 vaccine mandates\" and report back on the compliance of schools.",
      "One open question is whether the new administration could opt to go beyond COVID vaccines and put pressure on schools to drop requirements for other vaccines.",
      "Currently, all 50 states mandate that students receive certain vaccinations, including to prevent the measles. Many states, however, offer religious exemptions.",
      "Trump campaigned on ending all vaccine and mask mandates.",
      "\"I will not give one penny to any school that has a vaccine mandate or a mask mandate,\" Trump declared last August.",

      "OGE is responsible for overseeing the executive branch's ethics programs, including efforts to \"prevent financial conflicts.\" Huitema was nominated by former President Joe Biden and was sworn in the weeks after Trump's victory in the 2024 election.",
      "ABC News\u2019 Linsey Davis spoke with Huitema about his sudden removal from the job on Wednesday.",
      "ABC NEWS: Tonight, a group of eight now former government watchdogs fired by President Trump have filed a lawsuit challenging their terminations. They include inspector generals at the Department of Defense, Veteran Affairs, education and more.",

      "David Huitema was confirmed by the Senate in December for a 5-year term and just two months into that term, two days ago, he was terminated. He joins us now tonight.",
      "Thank you so much for your time, Mr. Huitema. So, the office you worked in is an independent agency that was working to prevent conflicts of interest in government. Have those guardrails now simply been removed?",
      "HUITEMA: Well, I know that there are committed public servants still at the Office of Government Ethics and ethics officials throughout the executive branch who are committed to their work and committed to upholding those values of integrity.",
      "But certainly those guardrails have been weakened. There is a real change in vision; I would say, from having organizations -- like the inspectors general, the Office of Special Counsel, the Office of Government Ethics -- that have an air of independence and authority and stature to speak without an agenda, you know, play it straight and narrow and uphold integrity, uphold the rule of law and and uphold accountability in government.",
      "ABC NEWS: So should the American public be confident executive branch nominees are not violating ethics rules and are complying with the law?",
      "HUITEMA: Well, we'll have to see. You know, it's interesting -- I was caught by surprise, obviously, by my termination. And my biggest feeling is one of disappointment. I had signed up for a five-year commitment and I was committed to seeing that through.",
      "And I knew that that meant working across multiple administrations and I was willing to serve in good faith any administration, including this one. And we'd actually gotten off to a good start.",
      "The vetting of nominees for cabinet positions, for example, has happened in basically the same way it's happened in the past. And we were able to do those, finish them up at a faster rate than ever before.",
      "But we're entering a new phase now, right? As officials actually come into their positions and are taking actions as government employees, now is when we're entering that time period where real substantive concerns about ethics and integrity can arise.",
      "And my sense is that the president just doesn't want an Office of Government Ethics that's empowered to take those issues seriously and speak to them.",
      "ABC NEWS: Are you concerned about Elon Musk's possible conflict of interest as he takes an unprecedented role in government oversight?",
      "HUITEMA: Well, I don't want to speak to any particular individuals. And, you know, part of the issue with Elon Musk and the DOGE [Department of Government Efficiency] effort, right, is we don't really know exactly what he's doing. So, I'm not privy to any details and don't have anything to share in that regard.",
      "But it's a perfect example of what a challenge it can be for people from the private sector with extensive investments and financial interests to come into government and adjust to the change in expectations, the change in rules that apply.",
      "ABC NEWS: I guess it sounds like an obvious question, but humor us here for a moment, why do you believe that government watchdogs are important?",
      "HUITEMA: Well, I think they're important for a couple of reasons. Even though they are mostly internally focused, they don't have a lot of visibility, I recognize that a lot of people watching probably have never even heard of the Office of Government Ethics, but they help set the tone and build a culture within government of respect for the rule of law, adherence to the rule of law, a commitment to public service, and an expectation of accountability for that public service.",
      "And so as those institutions are eroded, people may not see it right away, but in time, you can expect to see more corruption, more abuse of office and less accountability for that. The guardrails to sort of notice and address those kinds of concerns will be reduced.",
      "And eventually, I guess my big concern is that in the long run, if that continues now, a change of culture is really hard to reverse.",
      "ABC NEWS: David Huitema, we thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it.",

      "Hagan Scotten sent a scathing letter to Deputy AG Emil Bove over his request.",
      "The battle between New York federal prosecutors and President Donald Trump's Justice Department continued Friday as another prosecutor resigned over the order to dismiss Mayor Eric Adams' bribery case.",
      "Hagan Scotten, the assistant United States attorney for Southern District of New York, blasted Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove in a letter one day after acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Danielle Sassoon resigned over her refusal to follow through with the Justice Department's request.",
      "\"In short, the first justification for the motion -- that [former U.S. Attorney] Damian Williams's role in the case somehow tainted a valid indictment supported by ample evidence, and pursued under different U.S. attorneys is so weak as to be transparently pretextual,\" Scotten wrote.",
      "\"The second justification is worse. No system of ordered liberty can allow the Government to use the carrot of dismissing charges, or the stick of threatening to bring them again, to induce an elected official to support its policy objectives,\" he added.",
      "Scotten, an Army veteran who served in Iraq and clerked under Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Brett Kavanaugh before he was appointed to the Supreme Court, chastised the president and the administration.",
      "\"I can even understand how a Chief Executive whose background is in business and politics might see the contemplated dismissal-with-leverage as a good, if distasteful, deal,\" he wrote.",
      "\"If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion. But it was never going to be me,\" he added.",
      "The letter came hours after what several former and current federal justice officials dubbed the \"Thursday afternoon massacre,\" when six people involved with the case resigned and pushed back against the U.S. attorney general's office.",
      "Sassoon resigned Thursday over the Justice Department's request to end the federal bribery case against the mayor.",
      "The Justice Department planned to remove the prosecutors handling the mayor's case and reassign it to the Public Integrity Section in Washington, D.C.",
      "However, as soon the Public Integrity Section was informed it would be taking over, John Keller, the acting head of the unit, and his boss, Kevin Driscoll, the most senior career official in the criminal division, resigned along with three other members of the unit, according to multiple sources.",
      "Chad Mizelle, the chief of staff for Attorney General Pam Bondi, pushed back against the defiant prosecutors in a statement Friday afternoon contending Adams' prosecution was politically motivated.",
      "'The fact that those who indicted and prosecuted the case refused to follow a direct command is further proof of the disordered and ulterior motives of the prosecutors. Such individuals have no place at DOJ,\" he said.",
      "Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has the power to remove Adams from office, called the Department of Justice's moves \"unbelievably unprecedented\" during an interview on MSNBC Thursday night.",
      "\"This is not supposed to happen in our system of justice,\" she told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow.",
      "Hochul, however, declined to discuss the possibility of removing the mayor.",
      "\"The allegations are extremely concerning and serious. But I cannot, as the governor of this state, have a knee-jerk, politically motivated reaction, like a lot of other people are saying right now,\" she said. \"I have to do it smart, what's right, and I'm consulting with other leaders in government at this time.\"",
      "The Rev. Al Sharpton, a longtime ally of Adams, said in a statement Tuesday that he was convening with other Black clergy to discuss the situation but he already raised concerns about the mayor's allegiances.",
      "\"President Trump is holding the mayor hostage,\" Sharpton said.",
      "Four prominent New York City Black clergy members -- the Revs. Johnnie Green, Kevin McCall, Carl L. Washington and Adolphus Lacey -- wrote a letter Wednesday calling on the mayor not to run for reelection this year.",
      "\"Eric Adams had every right to prove his innocence and many of us were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, but that\u2019s not what has happened,\" they wrote.",
      "Adams, a former NYPD officer and Democrat who previously registered as a Republican, was accused by federal prosecutors of taking lavish flights and hotel stays from Turkish businessmen and officials for more than a decade.",
      "He and his staff members also allegedly received straw campaign donations to become eligible for New York City's matching funds program for his campaigns, according to the criminal indictment that was issued in September.",
      "In exchange, Adams allegedly used his power as Brooklyn borough president and later as mayor to give the foreign conspirators preferential treatment for various projects and proposals, including permits for the Turkish consulate despite fire safety concerns, the indictment said.",
      "Adams pleaded not guilty, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and claimed without any basis that he was being politically targeted by the Biden administration, even though the probe covers many years before Biden was in office.",
      "Adams' primary opponents have called for him to step down since the indictment, as have other New York Democrats, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.",
      "The mayor, however, appeared on \"Fox and Friends\" on Friday with Trump \"border czar\" Thomas Homan and reiterated he was not only staying in office but he would run for reelection as a Democrat. The deadline to change parties is Friday.",
      "\"People had me gone months ago, but, you know what, I\u2019m sitting on your couch,\" Adams told the hosts.",
      "The mayor remained silent during the interview when Homan discussed Trump's deportation policy and called on Hochul to resign for not cooperating with the federal office.",
      "Adams, however, did light up and smile when the \"border czar\" discussed their partnership. The mayor announced Thursday the city would allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents into Rikers Island jail, a major shift in the city's policies.",
      "\"If he doesn\u2019t come through, I\u2019ll be back in New York City, and we won\u2019t be sitting on the couch,\" Homan said with a laugh. \"I\u2019ll be in his office, up his butt, saying, 'Where the hell is the agreement we came to?'\"",
      "Sassoon prosecutor warned in a letter that the close relationship between the Trump administration and Adams crossed a line.",

      "Sassoon alleged Adams' vocal support of Trump's immigration policies would be boosted by dismissing the indictment against him.",
      "Sassoon's letter detailed a January meeting with Bove and counsel for the mayor, where she says Adams' attorneys put forward \"what amounted to a quid pro quo,\" after which Bove \"admonished a member of my team who took notes during that meeting and directed the collection of those notes at the meeting's conclusion.\"",
      "\"Although Mr. Bove disclaimed any intention to exchange leniency in this case for Adams's assistance in enforcing federal law, that is the nature of the bargain laid bare in Mr. Bove's memo,\" Sassoon wrote in her letter.",
      "Bove accused Sassoon of insubordination and rejected her claims. Trump told reporters Thursday he was not involved with the Justice Department decisions this week and claimed the SDNY prosecutor was fired, although he did not name her.",

      "The stampede of Argentines traveling abroad for their summer vacations is driven by several factors, including the recent devaluation of various foreign currencies, the convenience of nearby destinations accessible by car and the prohibitively high cost of domestic vacations, especially along the Argentine Atlantic coast.",
      "Argentine tourism abroad surged in December, with departures up 76.4% year-over-year to 1.3 million travelers compared to the same month the previous year, according to official figures. Of those, 80.7% visited neighboring countries, primarily Chile (28%), Brazil (22.6%) and Uruguay (15.6%).",
      "Chile has become a popular destination for Argentines, who made up 40% of the 5.2 million visitors to the country in 2024 and early 2025. Chile\u2019s strong economic position relative to Argentina has resulted in competitive prices, a major draw for Argentine tourists.",

      "A traffic stop in Vermont has cracked open a cultlike group called Zizians linked to six deaths in three states",
      "In the wooded outskirts of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, a perplexed landlord noticed odd sights at two of his rental properties.",
      "Tenants wore long black coats and parked box trucks outside the duplexes. They ran an electrical cord from one box truck into one of the condos, and kept a stretcher inside another.",
      "A neighbor remembers similarly dressed figures walking around at night holding hands. They never spoke a word.",
      "By the time the FBI searched the property last week, one of the most recent tenants had been killed in a shootout with U.S. Border Patrol agents in Vermont, and a second was under arrest. A third, a shadowy figure known online as \u201cZiz,\u201d remains missing after authorities linked their cultlike group to six deaths in three states.",
      "Officials have offered few details of the cross-country investigation, which broke open after the Jan. 20 shooting death of a Border Patrol trooper in Vermont during a traffic stop. Associated Press interviews and a review of court records and online postings tell the story of how a group of young, highly intelligent computer scientists, most of them in their 20s and 30s, met online, shared anarchist beliefs, and became increasingly violent.",
      "Their goals aren\u2019t clear, but online writings span topics from radical veganism and gender identity to artificial intelligence.",
      "At the middle of it all is \u201cZiz,\u201d who appears to be the leader of the strange group, who called themselves \u201cZizians.\u201d She has been seen near multiple crime scenes and has connections to various suspects.",
      "She was even declared dead for a time, before reappearing amid more violence.",
      "Jack LaSota moved to the San Francisco Bay area after earning a computer science degree from the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 2013 and interning at NASA, according to a profile on a hiring site for programmers, coders and other freelance workers. NASA officials did not respond to a request to confirm LaSota's internship, but a Jack LaSota is listed on a website about past interns.",
      "In 2016, she began publishing a dark and rambling blog under the name Ziz, describing her theory that the two hemispheres of the brain could hold separate values and genders and \u201coften desire to kill each other.\u201d",
      "LaSota used she/her pronouns, and in her writings says she is a transgender woman. She railed against perceived enemies, including so-called rationalist groups, which operate mostly online and seek to understand human cognition through reason and knowledge. Some are concerned with the potential dangers of artificial intelligence.",
      "LaSota began promoting an extreme mix of rationalism, ethical veganism, anarchism and other value systems, said Jessica Taylor, an AI researcher who met LaSota both in person and online through the rationalist community and knew her as Ziz.",
      "When LaSota left the rationalists behind, she took with her a group of \u201cextremely vulnerable and isolated\u201d followers, Anna Salamon, executive director of the Center for Applied Rationality, told the San Francisco Chronicle.",
      "Taylor said Ziz adherents use the rationalist ideology as a reason to commit violence. \u201cStuff like, thinking it\u2019s reasonable to avoid paying rent and defend oneself from being evicted,\u201d she said.",
      "Poulomi Saha, a professor who has studied cults, said LaSota\u2019s beliefs and writings may have made readers feel seen, an often central factor in the formation of groups commonly labeled cults. That\u2019s especially true in the era of online communities, in which it\u2019s easier for marginalized people to seek fellow believers.",
      "\u201cFor the person who feels hailed by that blog post, there is likely to be a kind of dual experience,\u201d said Saha, co-director of the program in critical theory at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cOne where they feel like \u2018I have been saying this, or thinking this, all along, and no one has believed me.\u2019\u201d",
      "LaSota, 34, has not responded to multiple Associated Press emails in recent weeks, and her attorney Daniel McGarrigle declined to comment when asked whether she is connected to any of the deaths. She has missed court appearances in two states, and bench warrants have been issued for her arrest. Associated Press reporters have left numerous phone and e-mail messages with LaSota's family and received no response.",
      "In November 2019, LaSota was arrested along with several other people at a protest outside a Northern California retreat center where the Center for Applied Rationality was holding an event. Sheriff\u2019s deputies called in a SWAT team and armored vehicle after the mask-wearing group blocked the property\u2019s exits and handed out fliers railing against the rationalist organization. The group said they were protesting sexual misconduct inside the rationalist group.",
      "The case against LaSota, Emma Borhanian, 31, Gwen Danielson and Alexander Leatham, 29, was pending in August 2022 when the U.S. Coast Guard responded to a report that LaSota had fallen out of a boat in San Francisco Bay. Her body wasn\u2019t found, but her mother confirmed the death and an obituary was published.",
      "It wasn\u2019t long before Ziz surfaced again.",
      "By the autumn of 2022, LaSota had moved with other group members, including Borhanian and Leatham, into vans and box trucks on property owned by Curtis Lind in Vallejo, about 30 miles north of San Francisco.",
      "\u201cEmma\u2019s van was amazing,\u201d said someone who knew Borhanian. \u201cIt had a refrigerator and freezer and microwave. It was truly a work of art.\u201d",
      "The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of fears for her safety, described Borhanian as a kind and loving young woman so smart that she worked at Google while in college. Google did not respond to an inquiry about Borhanian's employment there.",
      "Prosecutors say she was among those who attacked Lind on Nov. 13 when he tried to evict the group for not paying rent.",
      "Impaled by a sword and partially blinded, Lind fought back, fatally shooting Borhanian. Concluding that Lind acted in self-defense, officials charged Leatham and Suri Dao, 23, with murder in Borhanian\u2019s death, as well as attempted murder of Lind.",
      "A person reached by an Associated Press reporter at a phone number listed for Alex Leatham\u2019s father declined to comment. Attempts to reach family members for Dao were not successful.",
      "Police believe LaSota was at the scene of the crime, but she was not arrested.",
      "On New Year\u2019s Eve of 2022, a couple was shot and killed in their home in Chester Heights, Pennsylvania.",
      "A doorbell camera captured audio and video of a car pulling up to the home of Richard Zajko, 71, and his wife, Rita, 69. A voice shouts \u201cMom!\u201d and another voice exclaims, \u201cOh my God! Oh, God, God!\u201d according to a Pennsylvania state police affidavit. Police found the couple shot in the head in an upstairs bedroom after they failed to show up to take care of Rita\u2019s mother.",
      "Police questioned the couple\u2019s daughter, Michelle, at her home in Vermont, and a few weeks later, took her into custody at a Pennsylvania hotel. She wasn't arrested or charged with anything. LaSota was at the hotel, too, and was arrested after refusing to cooperate with officers, and charged with obstructing law enforcement and disorderly conduct.",
      "Six months later, LaSota was released on bail but stopped showing up for court.",
      "LaSota\u2019s attorney, Daniel McGarrigle, said last month his client was \u201cwholly and unequivocally innocent of the charges filed in this case.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the case regarding the landlord in California was headed to trial. The landlord, who was 82, was the only eyewitness, and prosecutors wanted to hurry along the proceedings.",
      "But on Jan. 17, Lind\u2019s throat was cut, and he died, not far from where he had survived the earlier attack.",
      "Maximilian Snyder, 22, who is charged with murder, appeared in court Feb. 6, only long enough to request a new attorney. It's not clear how he was identified as a suspect; he has ties to a woman who just days later would be involved in a shootout.",
      "Snyder is listed as in custody in the Solano County Jail in California. Attempts to reach family members of Snyder were not successful.",
      "On. Jan 20, in Vermont, U.S. Border Patrol agents stopped a vehicle carrying two people connected to the Ziz group. A hotel worker had called authorities after seeing one of them, Teresa Youngblut, with a gun.",
      "Youngblut was driving the car when it was pulled over on Jan. 20, and authorities say she quickly opened fire on officers. The passenger, Felix Bauckholt, a German national who is also listed in court documents as Ophelia, died, along with the border patrol agent, David Maland.",
      "Youngblut was wounded and arrested and has pleaded not guilty to firearms charges.",
      "Authorities who searched the car found a ballistic helmet, night-vision goggles, respirators and ammunition, the FBI said. They also found two-way radios and used shooting range targets.",
      "Youngblut applied for a marriage license with Snyder, the man accused of murdering the elderly landlord. He was a childhood friend; it was unclear if they were married. Authorities say the gun she was carrying was purchased by a person of interest in the Zajko killings.",
      "Youngblut and Bauckholt had been living at the two condos in North Carolina, where the landlord and neighbors now say they saw the odd behavior.",
      "LaSota also had been living there as recently as this winter, said the landlord, who reviewed LaSota\u2019s 2019 police booking photo. He spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because he was concerned for his safety.",
      "Expressing similar concerns, a neighbor who lived in the other side of Bauckholt\u2019s duplex until September 2023 recalled seeing three people wearing long black robes and tactical clothes.",
      "\u201cThey rarely came out during the day but would walk around the neighborhood and in the woods at night,\u201d the former neighbor said, who also spoke only on condition of anonymity because of concerns for their safety. \u201cSometimes all three of them would go for a walk and they all held hands. They seemed to care for each other a great deal.\u201d",

      "This comes as the Trump administration intensified sweeping efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce, by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who had not yet gained civil service protection.",
      "It's unclear how many IRS workers will be affected. Previously, the administration announced a plan to offer buyouts to almost all federal employees through a \u201cdeferred resignation program\u201d to quickly reduce the government workforce. The program deadline was Feb. 6, and administration officials said employees who accept will be able to stop working while still collecting a paycheck until Sept. 30.",

      "Jan. 27 was the official start date of the 2025 tax season, and the IRS expects more than 140 million tax returns to be filed by the April 15 deadline. The Biden administration invested heavily in the IRS through an $80 billion infusion of funds in Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, which included plans to hire tens of thousands of new employees to help with customer service and enforcement as well as new technology to update the tax collection agency.",

      "The proposal, which was at the center of Zelenskyy\u2019s talks with U.S. Vice President JD Vance on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday, did not offer any specific security guarantees in return, according to one current and one former senior official familiar with the talks.",
      "Zelenskyy\u2019s decision to reject a deal, at least for now, was described as \u201cshort-sighted\u201d by a senior White House official.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t let the ministers sign a relevant agreement because in my view it is not ready to protect us, our interest,\u201d Zelenskyy told The Associated Press on Saturday in Munich.",
      "The proposal focused on how the U.S. could use Kyiv\u2019s rare earth minerals \u201cas compensation\u201d for support already given to Ukraine by the Biden administration and as payment for future aid, current and former senior Ukrainian officials said speaking anonymously so they could speak freely.",
      "Ukraine has vast reserves of critical minerals which are used in aerospace, defense and nuclear industries. The Trump administration has indicated it is interested in accessing them to reduce dependence on China but Zelenskyy said any exploitation would need to be tied to security guarantees for Ukraine that would deter future Russian aggression.",
      "\u201cFor me is very important the connection between some kind of security guarantees and some kind of investment,\u201d the Ukrainian president said.",
      "Zelenskyy did not go into details about why he instructed his officials not to sign the document which was given to Ukrainian officials on Wednesday by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bassent on a visit to Kyiv.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a colonial agreement and Zelenskyy cannot sign it,\u201d the former senior official said.",
      "White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes did not explicitly confirm the offer, but said in a statement that \u201cPresident Zelenskyy is being short-sighted about the excellent opportunity the Trump Administration has presented to Ukraine.\u201d The Trump administration has grown weary of sending additional U.S. aid to Ukraine and Hughes said a minerals deal would allow American taxpayers to \u201crecoup\u201d money sent to Kyiv while growing Ukraine\u2019s economy.",
      "Hughes added that the White House believes \u201cbinding economic ties with the United States will be the best guarantee against future aggression and an integral part of lasting peace.\u201d He added, \u201cThe U.S. recognizes this, the Russians recognize this, and the Ukrainians must recognize this.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials in discussions with their Ukrainian counterparts in Munich were commercially minded and largely concentrated on the specifics of exploring the minerals and how to form a possible partnership to do that with Ukraine, the senior official said.",
      "The potential value of the deposits in Ukraine has not yet been discussed, with much unexplored or close to the front line.",
      "The U.S. proposal apparently did not take into account how the deposits would be secured in the event of continuing Russian aggression. The official suggested the U.S. did not have \u201cready answers,\u201d to that question and that one of their takeaways from discussions in Munich will be how to secure any mineral extraction operation in Ukraine involving people and infrastructure.",
      "Any deal must be in accordance with Ukrainian law and acceptable to the Ukrainian people, the senior Ukrainian official said.",
      "\u201cSubsoil belongs to Ukrainians under the Constitution,\u201d Kseniiia Orynchak, founder of the National Association of Mining Industry of Ukraine previously told the AP suggesting a deal would need popular support.",
      "Zelenskyy and Vance did not discuss the details of the U.S. document during their meeting Friday at the Munich Security Conference, the senior official said. That meeting was \u201cvery good\u201d and \u201csubstantive,\u201d with Vance making it clear his and Trump\u2019s main goal was to achieve a durable, lasting peace, the senior official said.",
      "Zelenskyy told Vance that real peace requires Ukraine to be in a \u201cstrong position\u201d when starting negotiations, stressed that the U.S negotiators should come to Ukraine, and that the U.S., Ukraine and Europe must be at the negotiating table for talks with Russia.",
      "But Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump\u2019s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, all but cut Europeans out of any Ukraine-Russia talks, despite Zelenskyy\u2019s request.",
      "\u201cYou can have the Ukrainians, the Russians, and clearly the Americans at the table talking,\u201d Kellogg said at an event hosted by a Ukrainian tycoon at the Munich Security Conference.

      "\u201cPresident Trump is touring a new Boeing plane to checkout the new hardware/technology,\" said Steven Cheung, the White House communications director. \u201cThis highlights the project\u2019s failure to deliver a new Air Force One on time as promised.\u201d",
      "Air Force One is a modified Boeing 747. Two exist and the president flies on both of the more than 30-year-old planes. Boeing Inc. has the contract to produce updated versions, but delivery has been delayed while the aircraft maker has lost billions of dollars on the project.",

      "Trump has railed against the project's cost and delivery delays. He told Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk during an online chat in 2024 on Musk's X social media platform that he was able to cut more than $1 billion from the project by playing hard ball with Boeing during his first term in office.",

      "The water line was darkened by ash. Burnt remnants of washing machines and dryers and metal appliances were strewn about the shoreline. Sludge carpeted the water's edge. Waves during high tide lapped onto charred homes, pulling debris and potentially toxic ash into the ocean as they receded.",
      "\u201cIt was just heartbreaking,\u201d said Quinn, president and CEO of the environmental group Heal the Bay, whose team has reported ash and debris some 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of the Palisades burn area west of Los Angeles.",
      "As crews work to remove potentially hundreds of thousands of tons of hazardous materials from the Los Angeles wildfires, researchers and officials are trying to understand how the fires on land have impacted the sea. The Palisades and Eaton fires scorched thousands of homes, businesses, cars and electronics, turning everyday items into hazardous ash made of pesticides, asbestos, plastics, lead, heavy metals and more.",
      "Since much of it could end up in the Pacific Ocean, there are concerns and many unknowns about how the fires could affect life under the sea.",
      "\u201cWe haven't seen a concentration of homes and buildings burned so close to the water,\" Quinn said.",
      "Fire debris and potentially toxic ash could make the water unsafe for surfers and swimmers, especially after rainfall that can transport chemicals, trash and other hazards into the sea. Longer term, scientists worry if and how charred urban contaminants will affect the food supply.",
      "The atmospheric river and mudslides that pummeled the Los Angeles region last week exacerbated some of those fears.",
      "When the fires broke out in January, one of Mara Dias' first concerns was ocean water contamination. Strong winds were carrying smoke and ash far beyond the blazes before settling at sea, said the water quality manager for the Surfrider Foundation, an environmental nonprofit.",
      "Scientists on board a research vessel during the fires detected ash and waste on the water as far as 100 miles (161 kilometers) offshore, said marine ecologist Julie Dinasquet with the University of California, San Diego\u2019s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Things like twigs and shard. They described the smell as electronics burning, she recalled, \u201cnot like a nice campfire.\u201d",
      "Runoff from rains also are a huge and immediate concern. Rainfall picks up contaminants and trash while flushing toward the sea through a network of drains and rivers. That runoff could contain \u201ca lot of nutrients, nitrogen and phosphate that end up in the ash of the burn material that can get into the water,\u201d said Dias, as well as \"heavy metals, something called PAHs, which are given off when you burn different types of fuel.\u201d",
      "Mudslides and debris flows in the Palisades Fire burn zone also can dump more hazardous waste into the ocean. After fires, the soil in burn scars is less able to absorb rainfall and can develop a layer that repels water from the remains of seared organic material. When there is less organic material to hold the soil in place, the risks of mudslides and debris flows increase.",
      "Los Angeles County officials, with help from other agencies, have set thousands of feet of concrete barriers, sandbags, silt socks and more to prevent debris from reaching beaches. The LA County Board of Supervisors also recently passed a motion seeking state and federal help to expand beach clean ups, prepare for storm runoff and test ocean water for potential toxins and chemicals, among other things.",
      "Beyond the usual samples, state water officials and others are testing for total and dissolved metals such as arsenic, lead and aluminum and volatile organic compounds.",
      "They also are sampling for microplastics, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, that are harmful to human and aquatic life, and polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, a group of man-made chemicals shown to cause cancer in animals and other serious health effects. Now banned from being manufactured, they were used in products like pigments, paints and electrical equipment.",
      "County public health officials said chemical tests of water samples last month did not raise health concerns, so they downgraded one beach closure to an ocean water advisory. Beachgoers were still advised to stay out of the water.",
      "Dinasquet and colleagues are working to understand how far potentially toxic ash and debris dispersed across the ocean, how deep and how fast they sunk and, over time, where it ends up.",
      "Forest fires can deposit important nutrients like iron and nitrogen into the ocean ecosystem, boosting the growth of phytoplankton, which can create a positive, cascading effect across the ecosystem. But the potentially toxic ash from urban coastal fires could have dire consequences, Dinasquet said.",
      "\u201cReports are already showing that there was a lot of lead and asbestos in the ash,\u201d she added. \"This is really bad for people so its probably also very bad for the marine organisms.\"",
      "A huge concern is whether toxic contaminants from the fire will enter the food chain. Researchers plan to take tissue fragments from fish for signs of heavy metals and contaminants. But they say it will take a while to understand how a massive urban fire will affect the larger ecosystem and our food supply.",
      "Dias noted the ocean has long taken in pollution from land, but with fires and other disasters, \u201ceverything is compounded and the situation is even more dire.\u201d",

      "The majority of state constitutions shield lawmakers from arrests, lawsuits and low-level infractions like traffic tickets during legislative sessions",
      "PHOENIX -- When a police officer gave state Sen. Mark Finchem a speeding ticket, the Arizona Republican didn't need to worry about the consequences.",
      "That's because the Arizona Constitution shields state lawmakers from any civil process and arrest for anything but treason, felony and breach of peace during legeslative sessions and the 15 days before. Legislative immunity exists in most states and allows lawmakers to brush aside lawsuits and low-level infractions like traffic tickets.",
      "Legal experts say the privilege is a form of separation of powers. It originated centuries ago in the English Bill of Rights as monarchs tried to intimidate legislators and it's been invoked over the years in a variety of situations, not always with success.",
      "In 2019, a politician in West Virginia invoked immunity after having a violent outburst. In 2022, a Wisconsin lawmaker argued he didn\u2019t have to comply with a subpoena ordering him to testify about a conversation he had with President Donald Trump about overturning the 2020 election. And last year, it shielded Kansas lawmakers who shared social media posts that falsely accused a man of being among those who opened fire at a rally celebrating the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 Super Bowl victory.",
      "In Arizona, the perk doesn't have unanimous support in the Legislature. Republican Rep. Quang Nguyen has introduced a resolution to end immunity for traffic violations. If passed, it would become a ballot measure for voters to decide in 2026.",
      "\u201cThe people we serve are expected to follow traffic laws, and legislators should be no different,\" Nguyen said in a statement. \"If a lawmaker is caught speeding, running a red light, or committing any other traffic violation, they should face the same consequences as everyone else.\u201d",
      "Nguyen represents a legislative district two hours north of Phoenix that includes the city of Prescott, the same district that Finchem represents and where he was cited on a recent Saturday by an officer who said he was driving 48 mph (77 kph) in a 30 mph (48 kph) zone.",
      "Finchem wrote to Prescott's police chief two days later, asking for the citation to \u201cbe voided and stricken from the record.\u201d It was dismissed Feb. 4 without prejudice, meaning it can be refiled, court records show.",
      "Finchem declined to comment through a spokesperson.",
      "Immunity generally falls into two categories, one protecting speech and debate and the other protecting lawmakers from arrest, according to the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "In the U.S., 43 state constitutions offer protection to lawmakers for speech and debate, and about 45 provide legislative immunity from arrest related to legislative service. However, the specific provisions can vary significantly, said Mick Bullock, a spokesperson for the group.",
      "In New Mexico, for example, the constitution says lawmakers are protected from arrest when they commute to and from the Legislature. Arizona doesn't have location restrictions.",
      "Members of Congress also have legislative immunity but courts have narrowly interpreted it. Former Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey tried to claim immunity in his bribery case last year, but ended up being sentenced to 11 years in prison.",
      "In a speech Tuesday on the House floor, Republican U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina accused her ex-fianc\u00e9 of assaulting her and raping others. She argued she had immunity through the \u201cspeech and debate\u201d clause, providing her protection from any civil lawsuits.",
      "While it's unclear how many times legislative immunity has been invoked since it was written into the Arizona Constitution in 1912, Finchem is far from the first to claim it.",
      "In 2012, then-state Sen. Scott Bundgaard invoked it after he and his girlfriend were pulled over on a Phoenix freeway amid a violent domestic dispute. Bundgaard was allowed to go home while his girlfriend spent a night in jail. Bundgaard was later prosecuted and pleaded no-contest to a misdemeanor charge.",
      "In 2018, then-state Rep. Paul Mosely was caught on camera bragging about going as fast as 140 mph (225 kph) to a sheriff's deputy who said he pulled him over because he was speeding. Mosely later apologized. Finchem was serving in the House at the time and filed an ethics complaint, asking the committee to take whatever action it deemed necessary.",
      "Past efforts to repeal legislative immunity in Arizona have failed. Former Republican Gov. Doug Ducey supported a repeal in 2019, but it lacked traction among lawmakers. Steve Gallardo, a former state lawmaker, introduced a bill to do the same in 2012, but it met the same fate.",
      "Gallardo, a Democrat who now serves on the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, said he understands the thinking behind legislative immunity during the early days of statehood. He doesn't believe it's needed today.",
      "\u201cAnyone who is utilizing that type of privilege is really doing a disservice to the institution, and really a big disservice to his constituency,\" Gallardo said. \u201cThey're telling the greater public that they are above the law.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is in the crosshairs of a White House that has halted its work, closed its headquarters and fired dozens of its workers",
      "NEW YORK -- To President Donald Trump, it\u2019s a hotbed of \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse\u201d whose only purpose is to \u201cdestroy people\u201d and whose staff amounts to a \u201cvicious group.\u201d",
      "To Jonathon Booth, it\u2019s simply the agency that helped him get $17 back.",
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is in the crosshairs of a White House that has halted its work, closed its headquarters and fired scores of its workers. But to many who have turned to the agency, it has been an effective problem-solver that fought abusive businesses when no one else would.",
      "\u201cThis is the core of consumer protection \u2013 someone willing to help with stuff that\u2019s small enough that no one would sue over,\u201d says Booth, a 34-year-old professor from Boulder, Colorado, who filed a complaint with CFPB in October when his credit card company wouldn't remove an errant late fee. \u201cIf there\u2019s no one watching, if the risk of getting caught goes down, more companies will bend the law to make money.\u201d",
      "A few weeks after Booth turned to CFPB, his case was closed and his account credited.",
      "Even as Trump and his cost-cutting czar, the billionaire Elon Musk, have demonized and neutered the agency, its defenders tell success stories of its work. Created under the 2010 Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and beginning its work in 2011, CFPB says it has fielded more than 7.7 million complaints and returned nearly $20 billion to consumers in just over 13 years of existence.",
      "Nurit Baytch, a 47-year-old from Cambridge, Massachusetts, turned to CFPB last month after a dispute over a basement mold removal project. Baytch, who is disabled, said she discovered a worker knocked over a jug of hydrogen peroxide, soaking boxes of photos, books and electronics. When neither the contractor nor Venmo, the service she used to pay him, would help, she contacted CFPB.",
      "She didn\u2019t expect to receive anything out of the filing, but less than two weeks later, she was refunded $100 to cover the damage. Baytch now calls the agency an \u201cunalloyed good.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe only people it\u2019s bad for is big businesses that want to mistreat consumers,\u201d Baytch says, calling Trump\u2019s targeting of the agency \u201cdishonest.\u201d \u201cAny voter who understands what it does sees it\u2019s a positive thing.\u201d",
      "CFPB, a response to the 2008 financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession, was set up to protect Americans from credit card companies, mortgage providers and debt collectors, among others. It was a brainchild of Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts prior to her election to the Senate and, from its birth, has been a source of ire for the finance industry and many Republican lawmakers.",
      "Conservatives have long branded CFPB a power-hungry agency that goes beyond its authority, a viewpoint made clear in the sweeping far-right vision for the U.S. known as Project 2025, which called the bureau a \u201cshakedown mechanism\u201d for \u201cleftist nonprofits.\u201d",
      "Still, nothing has compared to what awaited CFPB since Trump returned to Washington. The White House branded the agency \u201cwoke\u201d and \u201cweaponized\u201d and ordered it to stop nearly all its work.",
      "A judge ruled Friday that plans for mass layoffs, deletion of data or removal of funding from the agency must be halted at least through March 3. But CFPB's future has never seemed more tenuous.",
      "It\u2019s been troubling to watch for those like Barbara Seese, a 71-year-old retired teacher in Phoenix, who says CFPB is far from the villain Trump has portrayed it as.",
      "\u201cA hero,\u201d she says of the agency.",
      "A decade ago, Seese was pestered by debt collectors who claimed her 95-year-old father had unpaid dentist bills. Even as the calls persisted and got increasingly ugly, the debt collectors refused to give basic information for Seese to check if there actually were bills that she let slip through the cracks.",
      "She reached out to attorneys general in two states but it wasn\u2019t until she filed a claim with CFPB that anything changed. Within a day, the calls stopped, and a week later, the case was closed. The debt, it turned out, was for another man with the same name as her father.",
      "\u201cThey were just so helpful, so informative, so professional. I just really felt like I was in safe hands, in good hands,\u201d says Seese.",
      "Once a complaint is filed with CFPB, it is reviewed by staff and the clock begins ticking. In cases outside CFPB\u2019s oversight, the consumer is referred to another regulator or advised to contact a local authority like their state attorney general. But for cases within CFPB\u2019s purview \u2014 pertaining to large financial services companies \u2014 the complaint is routed to that company, which typically has 15 days to respond.",
      "Sometimes, the simple involvement of CFPB and the clout of its name leads to an immediate resolution from a company eager to avoid a negative light in the agency complaint database. For others, it prompts additional investigation. And in some, the company digs in its heels, insisting it is in the right.",
      "The agency\u2019s work has two essential tracks: the micro view of individual complaints and the macro view across all complaints that informs broader regulation and lawsuits. Whatever the outcome in the former could lead to action in the latter.",
      "In 2023, some 40% of cases were closed with some sort of non-monetary relief. Just 1.5% resulted in a payment to the consumer.",
      "\u201cI would like to see more of these complaints resolved but no agency is flawless,\u201d says Ruth Susswein, director of consumer protection at the nonprofit Consumer Action and a wholehearted supporter of CFPB. \u201cResolution is the goal but it\u2019s not the only benefit of this system, of this process.\u201d",
      "As much of a target as CFPB has been for some, it had recently showed signs of staying power. Bills introduced to repeal the agency in the last Congress went nowhere and a Supreme Court case aimed at dismantling the way CPFB is funded failed last year by a 7-2 vote.",
      "The bureau marshalled on, with recent work including capping bank overdraft fees and removing medical debt from consumer credit reports. Now, all of it is in doubt.",
      "Musk conceded the agency staff did \u201cabove zero good things, but still need to go.\u201d CFPB had about 1,700 employees late last year. Its budget last fiscal year was $729 million.",
      "Though many are quick to defend Trump\u2019s moves and agree Washington is a hotbed of waste, the attack on CFPB has caused even some of his supporters to pause.",
      "Darren Cobb, a 61-year-old retired auto dealership manager from Las Vegas, spent two months wrestling with his mortgage company last year when it failed to pay local taxes that he was billed for.",
      "Nine letters and countless calls yielded nothing.",
      "But Cobb says as soon as he filed a CFPB complaint, the mortgage company\u2019s tenor changed. Within two weeks, the claim was settled. To avoid being in arrears with his county, he had paid the roughly $800 tax bill a second time. The mortgage company finally refunded the money.",
      "With CFPB\u2019s intervention, a check was overnighted to him.",
      "\u201cSometimes you\u2019re up against a brick wall and you need an advocate,\u201d says Cobb. \u201cIf that program is disbanded, where is a consumer supposed to turn to? There is nobody.\u201d",
      "Cobb voted for Trump and agrees there is government waste, but cautions the president to make sure he understands the work of the agency he\u2019s targeting.",
      "\u201cYou just can\u2019t get scissors out and start cutting without understanding what you\u2019re cutting,\u201d he says.",

    "story": [
      "George Washington was uneasy about the idea of commemorating his life",
      "NORFOLK, Va. -- Like the other Founding Fathers, George Washington was uneasy about the idea of publicly celebrating his life. He was the first leader of a new republic, not a king.",
      "And yet the United States will once again commemorate its first president on Monday, 293 years after he was born.",
      "The meaning of Presidents Day has changed dramatically, from being mostly unremarkable and filled with work for Washington in the 1700s to the bonanza of consumerism it has become today. For some historians, the holiday has lost all discernible meaning.",
      "Historian Alexis Coe, author of \u201cYou Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington,\u201d has said she thinks about Presidents Day in much the same way as the towering monument in D.C. bearing his name.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be about Washington, but can you really point to anything that looks or sounds like him?\u201d she remarked in an interview with The Associated Press in 2024. \u201cJefferson and Lincoln are presented as people with limbs and noses and words associated with their memorials. And he\u2019s just a giant, granite point. He has been sanded down to have absolutely no identifiable features.\u201d",
      "Here is a look at how things have evolved:",
      "Washington was born Feb. 22, 1732, on Popes Creek Plantation near the Potomac River in Virginia.",
      "Technically, though, he was born Feb. 11 under the ancient Julian calendar, which was still in use for the first 20 years of his life. The Gregorian calendar, intended to more accurately mark the solar year, was adopted in 1752, adding 11 days.",
      "Either way, Washington paid little attention to his birthday, according to Mountvernon.org, the website of the organization that manages his estate. Surviving records make no mention of observances at Mount Vernon, while his diary shows he was often hard at work.",
      "\u201cIf he had it his way, he would be at home with his family,\u201d Coe said. \u201cMaybe some beloved nieces and nephews (and friend) Marquis de Lafayette would be ideal. And Martha\u2019s recipe for an indulgent cake. But that\u2019s about it.\u201d",
      "Washington\u2019s birthday was celebrated by his peers in government when he was president, mostly.",
      "Congress voted during his first two terms to take a short commemorative break each year, with one exception, his last birthday in office, Coe said. By then, Washington was less popular, partisanship was rampant and many members of his original Cabinet were gone, including Thomas Jefferson.",
      "\u201cOne way to show their disdain for his Federalist policies was to keep working through his birthday,\u201d Coe said.",
      "The Library of Congress does note a French military officer, the comte de Rochambeau, threw a ball celebrating Washington\u2019s 50th birthday in 1782.",
      "Washington was very aware of his inaugural role as president and its distinction from the British crown. He didn\u2019t want to be honored like a king, Seth Bruggeman, a history professor at Temple University in Philadelphia, told the AP last year.",
      "Still, he said, a market for Washington memorabilia sprang up almost immediately after his death in 1799 at age 67, with people snapping up pottery and reproductions of etchings portraying him as a divine figure going off into heaven.",
      "\u201cEven in that early moment, Americans kind of conflated consumerism with patriotic memory,\u201d said Bruggeman, whose books include \u201cHere, George Washington Was Born: Memory, Material Culture, and the Public History of a National Monument.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t until 1832, the centennial of his birth, that Congress established a committee to arrange national \u201cparades, orations and festivals,\u201d according to the Congressional Research Service.",
      "Only in 1879 was his birthday formally made into a legal holiday for federal employees in the District of Columbia.",
      "The official designation for the holiday is Washington\u2019s Birthday, although it has come to be known informally as Presidents Day. Arguments have been made to honor President Lincoln as well because his birth date falls nearby, on Feb. 12.",
      "A small number of states, including Illinois, observe Lincoln\u2019s birthday as a public holiday, according to the Library of Congress. And some commemorate both Lincoln and Washington on Presidents Day.",
      "But on the federal level, the day is still officially Washington\u2019s Birthday.",
      "By the late 1960s, Washington\u2019s Birthday was one of nine federal holidays that fell on specific dates on different days of the week, according to a 2004 article in the National Archives\u2019 Prologue magazine.",
      "Congress voted to move some of those to Mondays, following concerns that were in part about absenteeism among government workers when a holiday fell midweek. But lawmakers also noted clear benefits to the economy, including boosts in retail sales and travel on three-day weekends.",
      "The Uniform Monday Holiday Act took effect in 1971, moving Presidents Day to the third Monday in February. Sales campaigns soared, historian C. L. Arbelbide wrote in Prologue.",
      "Bruggeman said Washington and the other Founding Fathers \u201cwould have been deeply worried\u201d by how the holiday became taken over by commercial and private interests.",
      "\u201cThey were very nervous about corporations,\u201d Bruggeman said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that they forbade them. But they saw corporations as like little republics that potentially threatened the power of The Republic.\u201d",
      "Coe, who is also a fellow at the Washington think tank New America, said by now the day is devoid of recognizable traditions.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no moment of reflection,\u201d Coe said. Given today\u2019s widespread cynicism toward the office, she added, that sort of reflection \u201cwould probably be a good idea.\u201d"

      "Evers presented his plan as the best and only option to address the state\u2019s aging facilities, which have been beset with deaths of incarcerated people, assaults against staff including one that left a juvenile guard dead, lockdowns, lawsuits, federal investigations, criminal charges against prison staff, resignations and rising maintenance costs.",
      "The roughly $500 million proposal, made public on Sunday, would be subject to approval by the Republican-controlled Legislature, which has backed some aspects in the past but also has repeatedly blocked initiatives by the Democratic governor.",
      "Evers cast the proposal as a better option than building a new adult prison that he said would take at least a decade to complete and cost more than $1.3 billion.",
      "\u201cThis plan is as good as plans get,\u201d Evers said at a Friday briefing while encouraging Democrats and Republicans to work together to enact it. \u201cWe have to get this done, period.\u201d",
      "The state\u2019s current trajectory of maintaining aging, overcrowded and understaffed prisons is not sustainable, Evers said.",
      "The multi-tiered plan starts with finally closing the troubled Lincoln Hills and Cooper Lake juvenile correctional facilities in northern Wisconsin and building a new one near Madison at the site of a current minimum security prison. The Lincoln Hills campus would then be converted into a medium security adult prison. The prison in Green Bay, built in 1898, would be closed.",
      "The plan also proposes that the state\u2019s oldest prison in Waupun, built in 1851, be converted from a maximum security prison to a medium security center focused on vocational training. The Stanley Correctional Center would be converted from a medium to a maximum security prison and the prison in Hobart would be expanded to add 200 minimum security beds.",
      "Another key part of the plan is expanding options for those convicted of nonviolent offenses to participate in the earned release program and be set free earlier.",
      "All of the changes would take place over the next six years.",
      "Republicans and Democrats alike have been calling for years to close both the prisons in Waupun and Green Bay. But concerns over job losses in the communities and the cost of building a new prison have been stumbling blocks.",
      "There would be no staff layoffs under the new plan, the Evers administration said.",
      "Evers said he hoped lawmakers would come together and support the plan, much like they did in 2017 when they agreed to close the Lincoln Hills juvenile prison. Eight years later, that prison remains open amid obstacles to fully implementing the closure plan."

      "More than two weeks after a helicopter and airplane collision over Washington killed 67 people, investigators have completed their work at the scene where both aircraft fell into the Potomac River in the deadliest U.S. air disaster since 2001.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board offered a detailed timeline Friday of the events leading up to the crash, but there are still many unanswered questions.",
      "President Donald Trump publicly faulted the helicopter, which had a flight ceiling of 200 feet (61 meters), for flying too high. The NTSB confirmed Friday that it was at 278 feet (85 meters), but it's not clear if the pilots knew that. Trump also blamed federal diversity and inclusion efforts, particularly regarding air traffic controllers. When pressed by reporters, the president could not back up those claims. A few days later, Trump placed the blame on what he called an \u201cobsolete\u201d air traffic control system.",
      "Investigators are looking closely at whether the helicopter\u2019s pilots had inaccurate information about its altitude and how their vision would have been affected by their night vision goggles.",
      "Here's a look at the timeline of events before the crash and in the days afterward:",
      "At around 8:15 p.m. American Airlines Flight 5342, with 64 people on board, begins its initial descent into Reagan National.",
      "At 8:43, from the airport\u2019s tower, a controller asks the plane's pilots to switch from landing on Runway 1 to Runway 33. Nearby an Army Black Hawk helicopter, referred to as PAT25 by air traffic control, is flying south over the River. The skies are clear.",
      "As the helicopter is approaching the airport, the cockpit voice recorder captures the pilot saying it is flying at 300 feet (91 meters) and the instructor pilot says it is at 400 feet (122 meters). The discrepancy isn't explained and the helicopter continues to descend. The ceiling for the helicopter flight gets progressively lower as it approaches the airport.",
      "At 8:46, the controller radios the Black Hawk crew to say a passenger jet, referred to as CRJ, is at 1,200 feet (365 meters) and circling to Runway 33. The helicopter's pilots say they see the jet and ask for permission to maintain visual separation \u2014 allowing it to fly closer than otherwise may have been allowed if the pilots didn\u2019t see the plane. Controllers approve the request.",
      "At 8:47 \u2014 20 seconds before impact \u2014 the controller again radios: \u201cPAT25, do you have the CRJ in sight?\u201d while a conflict alarm sounds in the background. Then, again: \u201cPAT25, pass behind the CRJ.\u201d But the NTSB said the helicopter's recorder shows the pilots may never have heard that instruction.",
      "One second later the plane\u2019s crew gets an alert from their collision avoidance system declaring \u201cTraffic! Traffic!\u201d",
      "A few seconds after that, a crewmember on the helicopter replies that the aircraft \u201cis in sight\u201d and again requests \u201cvisual separation\u201d with the incoming plane.",
      "Just after the plane descends past its last recorded altitude of 313 feet (95 meters), the pilots pull up the nose of the plane sharply in an evasive maneuver one second before impact.",
      "Then a commotion is heard on the tower audio. A flash appears in the sky, and both aircraft fall into the river. Moments later someone says over the radio, \u201cTower, did you see that?\u201d",
      "In the ensuing hours, helicopters and inflatable boats light up the Potomac in search of survivors.",
      "In the morning Trump tells reporters there are no survivors and says it is unclear what led to the collision.",
      "The names of those on both flights begin to emerge online, appearing in Facebook eulogies or statements from grieving families.",
      "By midday the bodies of all three soldiers in the helicopter have been recovered.",
      "About 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) downriver from the crash site, Dean Naujoks, who patrols the Potomac for the Waterkeeper Alliance, finds pages from the flight manual, a piece of the plane's cabin wall and dozens of sugar packets stamped with the American Airlines logo. He turns the items over to the FBI.",
      "In the evening the airplane's cockpit voice and flight data recorders are recovered and sent to labs for evaluation.",
      "It is raining as police boats comb the Potomac for victims and investigators search for clues as to what happened.",
      "Officials announce that the Black Hawk's black box has recovered and the flight data is being reviewed, along with the actions of the military pilot and air traffic control.",
      "Over 300 responders are on the scene throughout the day, including dive teams. By the afternoon the remains of 41 people have been pulled recovered.",
      "The Army releases the names of two of the dead soldiers: Staff Sgt. Ryan Austin O\u2019Hara, 28, of Lilburn, Georgia, the crew chief; and Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew Loyd Eaves, 39, of Great Mills, Maryland.",
      "The rain clears. A Coast Guard cutter outfitted with a crane waits nearby as recovery team members slip into the chilly water to continue the search.",
      "At a news conference, investigators say they are trying to work out a discrepancy in the altitude data between the helicopter and the airliner.",
      "Investigators say they hope the helicopter's black box can help reconcile difference. The box is waterlogged, delaying retrieval of its data.",
      "The Army identifies the third soldier who died in the helicopter: Capt. Rebecca M. Lobach. She is described by friends as \u201cbrilliant and fearless.\u201d",
      "Officials say the number of victims whose remains have been recovered has risen to 55 and they are confident the rest will be found.",
      "As the search continues, salvage crews prepare to lift wreckage from the Potomac.",
      "Col. Francis B. Pera of the Army Corps of Engineers says divers and salvage workers are adhering to strict protocols and will stop moving debris if a body is found.",
      "The \u201cdignified recovery\u201d of remains takes precedence over all else, he says.",
      "Salvage crews recover an engine and large pieces of fuselage of the airliner and work to retrieve a wing.",
      "Portions of the helicopter and plane that were pulled from the water are loaded onto flatbed trucks and taken to a hangar for investigation.",
      "Families of the victims gather on the banks of the Potomac.",
      "Early on in the day, crews working in choppy conditions raise a number of large pieces of the jetliner including the right wing, the center fuselage and parts of the forward cabin, cockpit, tail cone and rudder.",
      "Investigators announce that they are examining new data that could shed light on the altitude discrepancy.",
      "Authorities say the remains of all 67 victims of the collision have been recovered and all but one have been identified.",
      "One of the first memorial services is held for one of the victims of the crash. A flight attendant who died is remembered at the service in North Carolina as a loving father, stepfather, husband, brother and uncle who loved the career that afforded him the opportunity to connect with people and explore the world.",
      "Organizers announce plans for a figure skating tribute that will take place in Washington, D.C., in early March. Many of the crash victims had just been to a development camp after the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Wichita, Kansas.",
      "Authorities say they have identified all of the victims and the medical examiner is working to return the remains to families.",
      "Salvage crews finish removing all major components of the helicopter and jet from the river. The wreckage is trucked to a secure hanger where NTSB investigators can examine it for clues.",
      "Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz says NTSB officials in a briefing told senators that the helicopter\u2019s Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) \u2014 an aviation surveillance technology that transmits aircraft location and other data to air traffic control and other aircraft \u2014 was off. He questions why it was turned off."

      "At least two people were killed and five others were seriously injured in Friday's multivehicle crash, officials said. The crash took place in the westbound tunnel of Interstate 80 under Castle Rock, a snow-covered sandstone formation that looms over the town of Green River in the state's southwest.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really going to be a long process just because of the magnitude of the incident and then being able to document everything that we need to make sure that our investigation is thorough,\u201d said Maj. James Thomas of the Wyoming Highway Patrol.",
      "Once officials are able to pull vehicles out, they will work with the county coroner, he said. Authorities still have yet to be able to count all the vehicles involved.",
      "Photos of the scene Friday showed crumpled semitrailers outside the smoke-blackened mouth of the tunnel, which is about a quarter-mile long (400 meters).",
      "Randy Ringstmeyer, a Wyoming Department of Transportation engineer, said there was extensive fire damage in the middle third of the westbound tunnel. The blaze damaged its concrete lining, causing loose concrete to fall and requiring first responders to avoid those areas.",
      "Interstate traffic was being rerouted through Green River. Officials aimed to reopen the eastbound tunnel in three days so it can host two-way traffic while the westbound section remains closed. Engineers were unable to estimate when the westbound tunnel would reopen.",

      "The killing of U.S. Border Patrol Agent David Maland near the Canadian border last month and five other homicides in Vermont, Pennsylvania and California have been tied to a cultlike group.",
      "Interviews and online postings reveal how young computer scientists described by those who know them as highly intelligent appear to have become increasingly violent.",
      "Maland, 44, was killed in a Jan. 20 shootout following a traffic stop in Coventry, Vermont, a small town about 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the Canadian border. Washington state resident Teresa Youngblut, 21, faces two weapons charges in connection with the killing.",
      "She was traveling with German citizen Felix Bauckholt, who is also listed in court documents as Ophelia. Both had connections to a cultlike group known in online communities as \u201cZizians\" because of their affinity for a blogger who calls herself \u201cZiz.\u201d The pair had been under the surveillance of authorities for several days after an employee at a hotel where they were staying reported seeing Youngblut carrying a gun.",
      "Bauckholt died in the Vermont shootout. Authorities have not specified whose bullets hit whom. Youngblut's lawyer said through a spokesperson that they are not commenting. Youngblut pleaded not guilty in federal court on Feb. 7.",
      "Jack LaSota, 34, of Berkeley, California, published a dark and sometimes violent blog under the name Ziz and, in one section, described her theory that the two hemispheres of the brain could hold separate values and genders and \u201coften desire to kill each other.\u201d",
      "LaSota, who used she/her pronouns, and in her writings says she is a transgender woman, railed against perceived enemies, including so-called rationalist groups, which operate mostly online and seek to understand human cognition through reason and knowledge. Some are concerned with the potential dangers of artificial intelligence.",
      "When LaSota left the rationalists behind, she took with her a group of \u201cextremely vulnerable and isolated\u201d followers, Anna Salamon, executive director of the Center for Applied Rationality, told the San Francisco Chronicle.",
      "In North Carolina, a landlord told The Associated Press that he had been renting two condos to Bauckholt and Youngblut. LaSota also had been living with Bauckholt as recently as this winter, said the landlord, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of concerns for his safety.",
      "In November 2019, LaSota, Emma Borhanian, 31, Gwen Danielson and Alexander Leatham, 29 were arrested at a protest outside a Northern California retreat center where a rationalist group was holding an event. The group said they were protesting sexual misconduct inside the group.",
      "In 2022, landlord Curtis Lind went to court to evict Borhanian, LaSota, Leatham and other tenants who had stopped paying rent at a Vallejo, California, property. Two days before the Nov. 15 eviction deadline, prosecutors say Leatham, Borhanian and Suri Dao attacked him.",

      "Police questioned the couple\u2019s daughter, Michelle, at her home in Vermont, and a few weeks later, took her into custody at a Pennsylvania hotel. She was not arrested or charged. LaSota was at the hotel, too, and was arrested after refusing to cooperate with officers, and charged with obstructing law enforcement and disorderly conduct.",

      "LaSota, 34, has not responded to multiple Associated Press emails in recent week. She has missed court appearances in two states, and bench warrants have been issued for her arrest. Associated Press reporters have left numerous phone and e-mail messages with LaSota\u2019s family and received no response.",

      "The federal agency that enforces workplace anti-discrimination laws has moved to dismiss its own lawsuit on behalf of a worker allegedly fired for his sexual orientation and gender identity, arguing that the case now conflicts with President Donald Trump's recent executive order, according to court documents.",
      "The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Thursday filed a joint motion to dismiss its case against Harmony Hospitality LLC, which operates a Home2 Suites by Hilton hotel in Dothan, Alabama, just eight months after the agency sued the company over its firing of an employee who identifies as nonbinary male and gay.",
      "The employee worked for Harmony as a night auditor and \u201cstyled himself in conformity with male gender stereotypes\u201d at work, according to the EEOC's original lawsuit. But when he was called in for a meeting outside of working hours, he wore \u201ccapri-cut joggers, pink-painted nails, and box braids.\u201d",
      "Upon learning about the employee\u2019s gender identity and sexual orientation, Harmony Hospitality's co-owner said the employee needed to be \u201chidden\u201d because of his appearance, and seven hours later, he was fired via text message, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "The complaint accuses Harmony of violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by terminating the employee \u201cbecause of his sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and failure to adhere to male gender stereotypes.\u201d",
      "The EEOC\u2019s request to now dismiss the case marks a major departure from its prior interpretation of civil rights law after the Trump administration declared that the government would recognize only two sexes: male and female.",
      "That's in stark contrast to a decade ago when the agency issued a landmark finding that a transgender civilian employee of the U.S. Army had been discriminated against because her employer refused to use her preferred pronouns or allow her to use bathrooms based on her gender identity.",
      "Just last year, the EEOC updated its guidance to specify that deliberately using the wrong pronouns for an employee, or refusing them access to bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, constituted a form of harassment.",
      "Former EEOC General Counsel and Professor and Co-Dean Emeritus at Rutgers Law School David Lopez, who served in the agency for more than 20 years, called the EEOC\u2019s move \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201cdiscriminatory.\u201d",
      "For an anti-discrimination agency \u201cto discriminate against a group, and say, \u2018We\u2019re not going to enforce the law on their behalf\u2019 itself is discrimination, in my view. It\u2019s like a complete abdication of responsibility,\u201d Lopez told The Associated Press in a phone interview.",
      "The motion to dismiss the Alabama case, filed jointly with the defendants, comes just weeks after Trump dismissed two Democratic commissioners of the five-member EEOC before their terms expired, an unprecedented decision that removed what would have been a major obstacle to his administration efforts to upend interpretation of the nation's civil rights laws. Had the commissioners been allowed to carry out their terms, the EEOC would have had a Democratic majority well into Trump's term. The administration also fired Karla Gilbride as the EEOC's general counsel, replacing her with Andrew Rogers as acting counsel.",
      "Shortly after their dismissal, acting EEOC chair Andrea Lucas, a Republican, signaled her intent to put the agency's resources behind enforcing Trump's executive order on gender. She announced in a statement that one of her priorities would be \u201cdefending the biological and binary reality of sex and related rights.\" Later, she ordered that the EEOC would continue accepting any and all discrimination charges filed by workers, although complaints that \u201cimplicate\u201d Trump's order should be elevated to headquarters for \u201creview.\u201d",
      "\u201cBiology is not bigotry. Biological sex is real, and it matters,\u201d Lucas said in her statement. \u201cSex is binary (male and female) and immutable. It is not harassment to acknowledge these truths \u2014 or to use language like pronouns that flow from these realities, even repeatedly.\u201d She removed the agency\u2019s \u201cpronoun app,\u201d which allowed employees to display their pronouns in their Microsoft 365 profiles, among other changes.",
      "Nearly all workplace discrimination charges must pass through the EEOC \u2014 at least initially \u2014 and the agency's decision to drop the Alabama case raises serious questions about whether its protections will extend to LGBTQ+ and gender nonconforming people going forward.",
      "Attorneys for Harmony Hospitality LLC did not immediately reply to emails seeking comment. In a court filing, the company denied the original allegations of discrimination in the EEOC\u2019s lawsuit and said the plaintiff was \u201cseparated from employment\u201d based on \u201creasonable, legitimate factors,\u201d though the company did not specify the reasons. The company also said the plaintiff\u2019s gender played no role in any of the company\u2019s actions.",
      "Asked for comment on why it's dropping the case, an EEOC spokesperson replied that the agency will not comment on litigation. But in its motion to dismiss, the EEOC cites compliance guidance from the Office of Personnel Management on Trump's executive order titled \u201cDefending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government\" as the reason behind its decision.",
      "\u201cThe EEOC\u2019s continued litigation of the claims in this action may be inconsistent with the Order and the OPM Guidance,\u201d the motion says.",
      "Jocelyn Samuels, one of the Democratic EEOC commissioners who was fired last month, said via email of the decision: \u201cI think it is truly regrettable and an illustration of the significant damage caused by the President\u2019s executive order. The Administration\u2019s efforts to erase trans people are deeply harmful to a vulnerable community and inconsistent with governing law. I hope that the EEOC will assist each of the individuals harmed by this withdrawal to find counsel who can represent them in vindicating their rights.\u201d",
      "Lopez of Rutgers University said dropping the Alabama case is not only inconsistent with a 2020 Supreme Court decision that ruled gay, lesbian and transgender people are protected from discrimination in employment, but also the agency's own strategic priorities and harassment enforcement guidance.",
      "\u201cThis is the inevitable outcome when the EEOC is weaponized to greenlight discrimination against American workers,\u201d added Sarah Warbelow, vice president of legal at LGBTQ+ rights group Human Rights Campaign, in an emailed statement. \u201cInstead of standing up for the rights of everyone to a workplace free from discrimination, including harassment and bias, the Trump administration is making it abundantly clear they will not protect working people.\u201d",

It's officially Washington's Birthday, honoring the first president and the original American yardstick for measuring greatness.",

    "story": [
      "Since President Donald Trump took office, immigrants in the U.S. illegally have changed their travel patterns and try to stay home, out of fear they could be deported",
      "HOMESTEAD, Fla. -- The day before President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, a dozen immigrant families came to Nora Sandigo's ranch to ask her to be a legal guardian of their children. Now they are insisting she come over to their homes to sign the necessary paperwork.",
      "It's a result of the many ways immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally have changed their travel patterns as many try to stay home as much as possible and avoid going to the homes and offices of advocates such as Sandigo. Many fear they could be caught up in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation after Trump campaigned on a promise of mass deportations and has terminated programs that had given immigrants a legal way into the U.S.",
      "In the past few weeks, Sandigo has received hundreds of calls from immigrant parents across the U.S. She said she has been in at least 15 houses where parents have filled out paperwork so Sandigo could sign documents on behalf of their children at schools, hospitals and courts if they are deported. The power of attorney also allows her to help the children travel to reunite with their families.",
      "\u201cNow people are telling us that they are afraid to go out on the street, that they are afraid to drive, that they are afraid that they will stop them on the street,\u201d said Sandigo, a 59-year-old mother of two daughters who lives in Homestead, a city of about 80,000 people south of Miami. \u201cThey have asked me to go to where they are instead of them coming to me.\u201d",
      "The White House has said over 8,000 immigrants who were in the country illegally have been arrested since Trump\u2019s inauguration  on Jan. 20. ICE averaged 787 arrests a day from Jan. 23 to Jan. 31, compared with a daily average of 311 during a 12-month period that ended Sept. 30 during the Biden administration. ICE has stopped publishing daily arrest totals.",
      "In Homestead, where many immigrants from Mexico and Central America live and work in nurseries and fruit and vegetable fields, some avoid the supermarkets and instead ask neighbors to do their grocery shopping. In front of stores like Home Depot, men no longer stand around looking for work. Others have even stopped going to Sacred Heart Church on Sundays.",
      "\u201cPeople have stopped coming, and when they come, they ask if the immigration officials came here,\u201d said Elisaul Velazco, the owner of a clothing store downtown. \u201cEverything is paralyzed. Sales have dropped by 60%.\u201d",
      "For years, Sandigo has prepared immigrant parents for the worst-case scenario: being separated from their children.",
      "Now she goes to those parents instead of having them come to her.",
      "One recent Sunday, she visited four houses and received documents involving over 20 children. In some cases, the children were born in the U.S. and are citizens. The documents do not provide her full legal guardianship or transfer parental rights, but simply allow Sandigo to make decisions on their behalf.",
      "Most parents fear if they do not name a legal guardian, their children will enter the foster care system, they will lose their parental rights and someone else will adopt their children.",
      "Julia, a 36-year-old Guatemalan woman who insisted she be identified only by her first name out of fear of deportation, waited a few minutes before opening the door for Sandigo as a group of people ran out the back door.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s me, Nora, the lady you phoned to come,\u201d Sandigo told her.",
      "Julia opened the door a crack, saw Sandigo and then came out. Julia explained her husband had been detained days earlier while in a van with other immigrants on their way to a construction job.",
      "After a brief conversation, Julia invited Sandigo, a notary and a volunteer into her small house.",
      "Julia recalled that eight years ago her first husband, also Guatemalan, was deported, leaving her behind with their two American children, now 18 and 11 years old.",
      "\u201cWe are afraid. I feel very sad with life because of what I am going through,\u201d said Julia, her voice breaking and her eyes getting watery.",
      "The notary asked Julia to show her daughter's birth certificate and explained the son is an adult and doesn\u2019t need a guardian.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want my children to be taken away from me. If something happens to me, I want them with me,\u201d she said before signing the power of attorney naming Sandigo as the legal guardian of the youngest.",
      "In the backyard of another home, Albertina, a 36-year-old Mexican mother, held her 2-month-old baby while explaining what she wants for her six children if she is deported. Albertina also insisted only her first name be used.",
      "\u201cI am very afraid that they will grab me on the road and take me away. What\u2019s going to happen to them?\u201d she said of her children.",
      "She asked Sandigo to take care of her two oldest daughters, 15 and 17, because they do not want to go to Mexico, while Sandigo should send the other four to her home country.",
      "Sandigo relates to the families she helps. A devout Catholic, she fled Nicaragua when she was 16, leaving behind her parents after the Sandinista government confiscated her family\u2019s farm. She is now a U.S. citizen.",
      "About 15 years ago, she began offering to be a legal guardian to immigrant children. About 22 children of deported parents have lived in her house temporarily since then. More than 2,000 children have been under her guardianship, although some are now adults. Sandigo said she has assisted hundreds of those children.",
      "\u201cI feel empathy for them, solidarity, love for God. I want to do something,\u201d she said."

      "WASHINGTON -- The NAACP wants Black Americans to steer their buying power toward companies that haven\u2019t pulled back from diversity, equity and inclusion programs under conservative pressure, and the nation\u2019s oldest civil rights organization is listing which brands have stood by \u2014 or reversed \u2014 past commitments to DEI.",
      "The NAACP says the spending guide it published Saturday is needed because DEI initiatives promote the social and economic advancement of Black Americans, who are projected to consume nearly $2 trillion in goods and services in nominal dollars by 2030, according to the McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility.",
      "\u201cDiversity is better for the bottom line,\u201d NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in an exclusive announcement to The Associated Press. \u201cIn a global economy, those who reject the multicultural nature of consumerism and business will be left in the past they are living in.\u201d",
      "Keisha Bross, an economic strategist at the NAACP, says they are not calling for a \u201cboycott\u201d of companies but instead encourage consumers to \u201cbuy-in\u201d on companies that back their values. People of all backgrounds are encouraged to use the Black Consumer Advisory.",
      "The NAACP is speaking with executives at companies named in the advisory for reversing their DEI policies \u2014 including Lowe\u2019s, TargetWalmart, Amazon, Meta, McDonald\u2019s, and Tractor Supply \u2014 and will update its guidance as companies roll back or reaffirm commitments to DEI.",
      "The advisory praises Costco for standing by previous commitments, as well as Apple, Ben & Jerry\u2019s, Delta Airlines, e.l.f. Cosmetics and JPMorgan Chase & Co.",
      "The effort comes as corporations, governments and other major institutions face pressure to roll back DEI policies amid a backlash from the Trump administration and Republican-led state governments.",
      "Soon after taking office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to end \u201cillegal preferences and discrimination\u201d in government and instructed federal agencies to find ways alongside the Justice Department to \u201cencourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.\u201d",
      "DEI policies are a catchall term for programs meant to promote fair treatment, impartial hiring and cooperation between people from different backgrounds. Such policies vary wildly but often include anti-discrimination mandates and training meant to inform people about how to promote inclusive values. Some institutions hire staff who focus on implementing DEI policies.",
      "The advisory looks at which companies are backtracking on prior commitments, including by eliminating diversity officer positions, ending hiring practices meant to boost staff diversity or supplier diversity standards, or reducing investments in Black communities such as support for historically Black colleges and universities.",
      "The study by McKinsey also found that Black Americans are more likely to live in communities that lack access to the goods and services of major companies.",
      "Johnson, the NAACP president, said he wants to provide a framework for Black communities \u201cas we make difficult decisions on where to spend our hard-earned money.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf corporations want our dollars, they better be ready to do the right thing,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump's orders also face legal pushback. In February, a group that included the mayor of Baltimore and an association representing university professors sued the Trump administration over the orders, claiming that the directives violated civil rights law.",
      "\u201cIn his crusade to erase diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility from our country, President Trump cannot usurp Congress\u2019s exclusive power of the purse, nor can he silence those who disagree with him by threatening them with the loss of federal funds and other enforcement actions,\u201d the plaintiffs in the lawsuit wrote.",
      "More litigation surrounding DEI in the private sector is pending. The Federal Communications Commission recently sued Comcast over its DEI policies. And the state of Missouri in February filed a lawsuit against Starbucks over its DEI policies. Companies including Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, Coca-Cola, IBM, Mastercard and Pepsico face shareholder resolutions challenging their DEI practices."

      "On Friday, 13 judges who had yet to be sworn in and five assistant chief immigration judges were dismissed without notice, said Matthew Biggs, president of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers, which represents federal workers. Two other judges were fired under similar circumstances in the last week.",

There is support across the political spectrum for more judges and support staff, though the first Trump administration also pressured some judges to decide cases more quickly.",

    "summary": "The surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate tariffs prompts questions over the possible impact on British businesses.",
    "story": [
      "Concerns are growing the UK could be more exposed to US trade taxes after President Donald Trump announced he would target VAT in his latest move.",
      "Trump has instructed his staff to develop custom so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for individual countries based in part on trading agreements, including imports and exports, with the US.",
      "The UK's trading relationship with US had suggested it would be less exposed to tariffs than others, but the surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate potential tariffs has prompted questions over the impact on British businesses.",
      "Analysts have suggested tariffs of 20% or more could be placed on the UK as well as the European Union, but the outcome remains uncertain.",
      "The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) business group warned that cars, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink were specific goods which could be \"significantly hit\" by the measures, which were announced by the White House on Thursday.",
      "The latest announcement by Trump administration was wide-ranging and threatened retaliation by the US for not just trade tariffs, but for other \"unfair or harmful acts, policies or practices\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given to date for imposing tariffs on countries is whether they have a trade surplus with the US - i.e. they sell more to the US than they import from the country.",
      "The use of tariffs is part of Trump's efforts to protect American businesses and boost manufacturing.",
      "Trump launches plan to target countries with new tariffs",
      "UK not planning to hit back at US on steel tariffs",
      "UK signals it will seek US steel tariff exemption",
      "Both the UK and US claim to have trade surpluses with each other due to discrepancies in how the countries collect data. It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.",
      "The president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\".",
      "VAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.",
      "George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.",
      "\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.",
      "William Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries.",
      "But he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".",
      "Fiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.",
      "But she told the BBC's World At One that she was looking at starting production in the US \"because there is real, huge tax breaks for innovative companies like us to set up manufacturing in the US\".",
      "She said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.",
      "Paul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.",
      "But he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".",
      "Mr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.",
      "'Difficult to predict'",
      "A tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.",
      "But in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.",
      "Caroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.",
      "She suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair.",
      "\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.",
      "Mr Bain argued it was \"vital\" that the UK government negotiated with Trump and did not get \"sucked into a trade war of tit-for-tat tariffs\".",
      "Senior UK government minister Pat McFadden said the government would wait before reacting.",
      "\"The most sensible thing to do with all of these announcements is to digest them, see if they actually come to pass, and then decide what you do.\""

We do not expect to see any disruption to volumes or service levels on February 14.\"",
      "In September 2024, Bolt drivers won a claim against the company after an employment tribunal ruled they were \"workers\" under UK law and entitled to rights and protections, including the national minimum wage.",
      "In January 2025, Addison Lee drivers won a similar case.",
      "'Breaking point'",
      "Helio Santos, who is based in Stratford in east London, is another driver taking part in the strike.",
      "He has been driving with Uber for three years and said that while he spent 70 to 80 hours per week online, that often translates to just 25 to 30 hours of driving.",
      "Mr Santos said that Friday's strike action shows that drivers across UK are \"reaching a breaking point\".",
      "\"This is unsustainable,\" he said. \"Fees are too low, there is no safety, no transparency. Uber keeps ignoring us.\"",
      "Mr Santos, who has three children including a four-year-old, said Uber's promise of the national living wage was \"meaningless\".",
      "\"It is mocking us, saying drivers get a living wage. I'll be better off working for a cleaning company,\" he added.",
      "The IWGB said that since drivers became \"workers\" under the law, they have reported their conditions have worsened.",
      "Alongside demands for fairer pay and more secure work, the union is calling for the introduction of safety measures for drivers such as rider ID verification, complaint tracking systems, and support for victims of assault.",
      "A spokesperson for Bolt said the company has committed \u20ac100m (\u00a383.3m) over the next three years to support safety initiatives for its drivers. In recent years, it has introduced an in-app emergency assist button and provided additional passenger information prior to pick-up, the spokesperson added.",
      "Part of Friday's action will include a vigil for Bolt driver Gabriel Bringye who was killed in Tottenham, north London, in 2021.",
      "Mr Bringye, 37, was set upon by a group of teenagers on a crime spree, who booked the cab with the sole intention of robbing the driver.",

      "In 2022, 692,334 new EU-made cars were exported to the US, worth \u20ac36bn ($37bn; \u00a330bn). While only 116,207 new US-made cars went in the opposite direction, for \u20ac5.2bn.",
      "This imbalance is caused by unfair trading rules and needs correcting, according to Mr Trump.",
      "\"Mr Trump is concerned because the terms of trade are not really equal,\" explains Mr Engellau, pointing out that the EU's 10% tariffs on cars imported from the US far exceeds the 2.5% tariffs the US \u2013 currently - charges on cars imported from the EU.",
      "These disparities have prompted Trump to say he wants to raise US tariffs on European automotive imports. He has already announced 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, two metals crucial for carmakers.",
      "Trump's move appears to have prompted EU officials to consider reducing their own tariffs in order to protect Europe's automotive industry from a potential trade war.",
      "Trump's intervention has not impressed Jim Farley, the boss of US carmaker Ford. \"So far what we've been seeing is a lot of cost and a lot of chaos,\" NBC News recently reported him as saying.",
      "In fact, the very focus on trade is perhaps misplaced, according to automotive industry veteran Andy Palmer, formerly the chief operating officer of Nissan and CEO of Aston Martin, and currently a consultant. \"If you can help it, you don't want to ship cars around the world. They're big boxes of expensive air,\" he says.",
      "The automotive industry is global, adds the SMMT's Mr Hawes, so carmakers generally want to \"manufacture close to where the customer is based\".",
      "As such, several European carmakers, most notably marques such as BMW, Mercedes and Audi, are making some of their largest cars in North America, and some of these vehicles are exported back to Europe.",
      "US carmakers have historically pursued similar strategies in Europe. General Motors owned and manufactured European marques such as Opel/Vauxhall and Saab, but it sold the former in 2017, and shut the latter back in 2009.",
      "Meanwhile, Ford offloaded Aston Martin in 2007, Jaguar and Land Rover in 2008, and Volvo in 2010.",
      "After years of losing money, Ford is currently redirecting its European business towards electric and commercial vehicles and away from small, affordable cars, such as its Focus models.",
      "Ford plans to cut 800 jobs in the UK and 2,900 jobs in Germany by 2027, which represents a 14% reduction in its 28,000-strong European workforce.",
      "Elon Musk's Tesla has a factory near Berlin in Germany, where it makes its Model Y cars for the European market, but even here there are headwinds as low-cost Chinese imports in particular see their share of Europe's market for electric cars grow.",
      "Europe is a very tough marketplace for carmakers, according to Jose Asumendi, head of European automotive research at JP Morgan, an investment bank. \"You need to have the right products, and you need to run the manufacturing plants well.\"",
      "He also points to brands having a competitive advantage in their home countries, be it BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi in Germany, Peugeot, Citroen and Renault in France, or Fiat and Alfa Romeo in Italy.",
      "\"There's a natural inclination for people to buy local champions, especially in Germany, France and Italy,\" explains Mr Asumendi.",
      "He adds that while other European countries are more open to different brands, the market is crowded, with a slew of Japanese, South Korea, and, increasingly, Chinese cars.",
      "Adding to Europe's complexities for overseas carmakers are different taxation regulations, and the need to communicate in many different languages.",
      "Mr Palmer does not think \"European customers have any particular objections to American cars\", and Mr Asumendi agrees. \"I think Europeans do like American brands, but there are many other brands available in Europe, so competition is fierce,\" he says.",
      "Mr Trump's ambition is to make the US car industry stronger, by bringing more production and innovation home. But Mr Palmer insists that a car trade war with Europe will not deliver this.",
      "Not least, he says, since tariffs tend to \"insulate the beneficiaries from the free market, and this merely makes them lazy, so they stop innovating and fail to remain competitive\".",
      "\"It's not about trade,\" adds Mr Palmer. \"It's about investment and collaboration.\"",

    "story": [
      "Homeowners who say their houses are being destroyed by unsuitable insulation are missing out on measures to fix it as the work was carried out too long ago.",
      "The government has found a \"serious systemic\" issue in homes fitted with insulation under two of its own schemes since 2022 \u2013 and ordered installers to put it right.",
      "But that won't include 93-year-old Margaret Chappell whose work was done in 2021 and now her house is consumed by damp, black mould and crumbling plaster.",
      "The government said it would keep other schemes under review but Mrs Chappell said she and other residents were being ''ignored\".",
      "\"It's as if we don't exist. It's appalling,\" added Mrs Chappell, who has lived in her home in County Durham for 60 years.",
      "She and 153 of her neighbours in the town of Chilton had solid wall insulation fitted after Durham County Council advised them to take advantage of a free government scheme.",
      "They were told the work would help make their homes warmer and lower their energy bills. But Mrs Chappell, who suffers from chronic asthma, said that since then, damp has consumed her living room.",
      "Her wallpaper has peeled off and the plaster behind it is saturated and crumbling.",
      "\"I don't want to be sitting here, breathing in this dust,\" she said.",
      "The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DSENZ) said homeowners affected should contact the installer or the installer's scheme provider using the TrustMark complaints process.",
      "Durham County Council said it was working closely with residents and the subcontractor to address the issues.",
      "More than three million homes in the UK have had insulation fitted under government schemes including 260,000 properties which have had solid wall insulation.",
      "In October, the BBC told the story of 84-year-old Tormuja Khatun from Luton whose house with unsuitable solid wall insulation had mushrooms growing on the walls and dry rot feeding off the floor joists.",
      "Since then the house became so dangerous to live in she had to move out. Her family has been warned it will cost more than \u00a3100,000 to fix.",
      "Mrs Khatun's insulation was fitted in 2022 so in theory should be covered by the government's promise of help - but they still don't know when the work will start and who will pick up the bill.",
      "Not long after this BBC report, the government ordered an audit by the independent organisation Trustmark of more than 1,000 properties that have had solid wall insulation. It found that in half of the homes audited the work had not been done to the required standard.",
      "The Minister for Energy Consumers, Miatta Fahnbulleh MP, told Parliament last month that the audit had found ''serious systemic'' problems. She said installers would be required to fix and pay for any problems.",
      "The energy regulator Ofgem is now trying to establish how widespread the problems are and has written to 65,000 households that have had solid wall insulation since 2022 under the government's ECO4 and GBIS schemes.",
      "But because the homes in Chilton were done under a different government programme, called the Local Authority Delivery Scheme, there is currently no plan to contact residents.",
      "The government said it was ''currently confident the quality of works under the Local Authority Delivery scheme was high'' but it would keep the situation under review.",
      "'Catastrophic scheme'",
      "Building surveyor, David Walter, has been inspecting insulated properties for 25 years. He assessed the damage at several of the homes in Chilton and said ''poor design and poor workmanship'' had led to rain penetration which was causing the damp and mould.",
      "In Mr Walter's view the properties were unsuitable for solid wall insulation and said it would have to be removed from all of the properties. He warned this could cost tens of thousands of pounds per home to fix.",
      "He said the cost \"could actually exceed the market value'' of each house and added ''it just demonstrates what a catastrophic scheme it's been.''",
      "'Somebody needs to act'",
      "Susan Haslam said she has been fighting to get the damage repaired to her late parents', Bob and Maureen's Chilton home ever since they died three years ago.",
      "She said her father worried about the damp as he cared for her mother, who had dementia.",
      "She said the stress had prevented her family from being able to grieve properly for their parents, who saw the house \"as part of their legacy,\" after working for decades.",
      "\"We don't want to let them down, we want it to be sorted for them and for us,\" she said. \"Somebody is responsible and they need to act.\"",
      "The company hired by Durham County Council to do the work on Mrs Chappell's house, Tolent, went bust before the installations were completed.",
      "Tolent sub-contracted the work to another firm, Westdale North Ltd, which says it is \"still on site, and working on issues that have arisen.\"",
      "It added that it was doing the work \"as a goodwill gesture although it may not legally be required to do so\" adding \"the care and consideration we have for residents is a core part of our service.\"",
      "The company said the work had been signed off by the Council and Tolent before it went bust, adding: \"Some issues that were raised with Tolent were not communicated to us, due to them no longer being in business.\"",
      "Durham County Council's head of planning and housing, Michael Kelleher said it had been \"a complex situation, with the collapse of Tolent causing delays outside of our control and we understand residents' frustrations.\"",
      "Mr Kelleher said the council has set up an email address for concerned residents, arranged for inspections to take place at affected properties and provided Westdale North with a list of issues raised by residents.",
      "\"Westdale North has carried out extensive work to resolve the issues and we will continue to liaise with them to ensure any outstanding problems are rectified,\" he added.",

    "summary": "The US president ordered his staff to develop a response to countries with trade policies he says are unfair.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump is sharpening plans to hit exports from countries that he says have trade policies that are unfair to the US.",
      "On Thursday, Trump signed a memo that instructed staff to develop custom tariffs for each country, taking into account features such as their existing tariffs, exchange rates, trade balances and other rules.",
      "In outlining its concerns, the White House said that tariffs imposed by other countries were not necessarily the biggest issue, singling out the European Union for other policies the Trump administration said put US exporters at a disadvantage.",
      "While big questions remain about the plans, the announcement is likely to kick off trade talks around the world.",
      "Which countries could be affected?",
      "The memo signed by the president asked that staff report back for a plan for \"reciprocal trade and tariffs\" within 180 days.",
      "Trump's pick for Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, said his team would be ready to hand a plan to the president by 1 April.",
      "Trump cast his plan for so-called reciprocal tariffs as part of his effort to bring investment to the US and boost manufacturing.",
      "\"If you build your product in the United States, there are no tariffs,\" he said, adding that he was \"just doing what was fair\".",
      "\"In almost all cases, they're charging us vastly more than we charge them but those days are over,\" he said. \"This should have been done a long time ago.\"",
      "As well as the European Union, Trump's moves are expected to have an impact on trade relationships with countries such as India, Vietnam and Thailand, which have relatively higher tariffs and rely on the US as a big market for exports.",
      "Trump signed the memo ahead of a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has already taken steps to reduce tariffs on key items such as motorcycles, which Trump made an issue during his first term.",
      "Still, he vowed reciprocal tariffs on Indian imports at a joint press conference with Modi on Thursday: \"Whatever India charges us, we charge them.\"",
      "In recent days, officials in Thailand and Vietnam have also said they were reviewing trade with the US.",
      "Ahead of Trump's announcement, the European Union said it was committed to \"maintaining a close partnership with the US\".",
      "\"We will continue to seek constructive engagement,\" Olof Gill, the commission's spokesperson for trade said. \"At the same time, we stand ready to protect our interests.\"",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "A tariff is a tax on imports collected by the government. It is paid by the company importing the good.",
      "Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.",
      "Historically, the US has championed free trade and kept the majority of its tariffs low, except on certain products such as footwear and, more recently, steel and aluminium.",
      "The US has an average tariff rate of 3.4%, compared with an average rate of 5% in Europe, according to the WTO.",
      "In setting out its plans, the White House cited objections to tariffs such as the 10% tax that US-made cars face in Europe, compared with the 2.5% tariff the US applies to cars brought into the US.",
      "The White House also said that Brazil charges an 18% tariff on ethanol imports, while the US charges a 2.5% tariff on the same product.",
      "But officials made clear that the US intends to use tariffs to challenge policies farther afield, citing concerns about the digital services taxes many countries, including Canada and the UK, have unveiled against Big Tech firms - many of which are US-based - as well as Europe's rules for its Value Added Tax (VAT), a kind of sales tax.",
      "Those kinds of issues also raise risks for the UK.",
      "Duncan Edwards, chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, a group representing transatlantic firms, said Trump's plans \"should not come as a surprise\"  and the details of how any reciprocal tariffs are calculated will be a key focus.",
      "\"Our hope at BritishAmerican Business, is that the UK's relatively open market and balanced trade with the USA gives it a chance to avoid much of the impact of this policy but nothing should be taken for granted,\" he said.",
      "What impact could tariffs have on the economy?",
      "Thursday's announcement comes after a string of tariff-related moves from the new administration.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump ordered the US to start charging a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium brought into the country, ending exemptions for countries including the European Union, UK and Brazil. That is due to go into effect next month.",
      "He also raised tariffs on all goods from China to 10% and threatened to hit imports from Canada and Mexico with duties of 25%, a plan that has been put on hold until March.",
      "Shares on Wall Street rose after no immediate tariffs were announced.",
      "John Cassidy, chief executive of Red Cedar Investment Management, said Trump's string of rapid-fire tariff announcements had unnerved Wall Street, which \"does not like the unknown\".",
      "But he warned against over-reacting, noting that tariffs that Trump imposed during his first term had a relatively mild impact on the US economy.",
      "\"I think Trump's playing a hand here and I think he's got a very strong hand to play,\" he said.",
      "However, Alex Durante, economist at the Tax Foundation, said it remained to be seen what changes could result from Trump's moves.",
      "He does not think tariffs are the best strategy for dealing with trade complaints, given the costs and uncertainty they introduce for US firms and risks of retaliation.",
      "\"I think we're inching toward more and more tariffs with each coming week and further escalation of a trade war with other countries,\" he said.",
      "He noted that Trump in his first term walked away from the Trans Pacific Partnership, a free trade agreement that had been intended to address some of these same issues with countries in Asia.",
      "\"They were open to doing this without having to put the US through more trade uncertainty,\" he said.",
      "Trump has dismissed concerns about collateral economic damage, saying his plans will boost manufacturing in the US over the long term.",
      "\"What's going to go up is jobs are going to go up,\" he said. \"Prices could go up somewhat short term, but prices will also go down.\"",
      "But surveys indicate the US public remains concerned about the cost of living and is unconvinced about the benefits of tariffs, which economists have warned are likely to lead to higher prices for US businesses and households.",
      "A recent Marquette Law School poll found just 24% of respondents believe tariffs will help the US economy, including just under half of Republicans and just 12% of independents and 4% of Democrats.",
      "\"The question is are these tariffs going to lead to higher inflation, higher costs of goods,\" said Charles Franklin, director of the poll. \"The fairness argument is probably a good argument for the president to make but the price impact is much more of a hard thing to sell\".",

    "title": "Scientists work on 'superhuman' vision systems for robots",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 00:08:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Researchers have given a robot a powerful radio-based vision system which can see through smoke.",
    "story": [
      "If you want to find out whether your robot can see through smoke, well, you're going to need some smoke.",
      "But a University of Pennsylvania student got a shock when they began setting up a late night experiment to test such a robot.",
      "Shortly after flicking the switch on the smoke machine, a loud fire alarm went off.",
      "\"The whole building got triggered,\" says Mingmin Zhao of the University of Pennsylvania, smiling. \"My student called me. He was very surprised.\"",
      "The incident was a minor setback for the team developing a robot equipped with a innovative radio-based sensing system.",
      "Radio waves could allow robots or autonomous vehicles to see through thick smoke, intense rain \u2013 or even around corners. Such waves can even detect concealed weapons.",
      "But simulating visual imagery based on radio waves is an unusual approach for robots and autonomous vehicles. Much more established in those fields are regular optical cameras, light detection and ranging (Lidar), and other sensors.",
      "However, Prof Zhao and his students have developed a potentially powerful way for robots to see using radio waves.",
      "Of course radar, which uses radio waves, has been used for decades to track aircraft, ships and the weather.",
      "But the spinning array on Prof Zhao's robot throws radio waves in all directions.",
      "An on-board artificial intelligence (AI) system then builds a 3D view of the environment with this information.",
      "\"What we have been trying to do here is basically help robots obtain superhuman vision \u2013 to see in scenarios where human eyes or traditional visual sensors cannot,\" explains Prof Zhao.",
      "He suggests the technology could help a future search-and-rescue robot save people from a burning building.",
      "Subsequent tests of the bot used a clear plastic box full of smoke placed around the its spinning equipment, in order to avoid triggering any nearby fire alarms.",
      "Although humans can't see them, radio waves are a form of light in the sense that they are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes X-rays and gamma rays. Only a small part the spectrum is classed as visible light.",
      "Being light, radio waves can reflect off surfaces and materials, though in a slightly different way to visible light. Prof Zhao and his colleagues have designed their robot so that it can sense these radio wave reflections.",
      "The crucial factor here is that radio waves are much longer than visible light waves meaning they are not blocked by tiny smoke particles.",
      "Prof Zhao says he has also been working on adapting the technology so that the robot can see part of the way round a corner. Think of it like a hall of mirrors, he suggests, just for radio waves rather than visible light.",
      "\"It's really very interesting work and quite impressive,\" says Friedemann Reinhard at the University of Rostock in Germany, who was not involved in the work. In 2017, Prof Reinhard and colleagues described how Wi-Fi signals could allow spies to see into private rooms.",
      "One slight limitation is that the spinning array cannot, by definition, see in all directions at once. Prof Reinhard says that a lot of data processing carried out by the system appears necessary to clean up the image that results from this spinning device.",
      "However, the robot sends out radio waves in the millimetre wave band (waves that are between one and ten millimetres long). This is the same technology used for some 5G installations.",
      "\"That's potentially very attractive, it's a very well understood, cheap technology,\" says Prof Reinhard. \"I certainly would love to see a self-driving car driving only on radar.\"",
      "But it is possible to avoid using spinning radio-emitting devices to get a full picture, says Fabio da Silva, founder and chief executive of US firm Wavsens, which is also developing radio-based sensing technology.",
      "\"We created an algorithm that allows you to sense the entire space instantaneously and continuously so we don't have to spin our antennas,\" he says.",
      "He describes the system as akin to echolocation, used by bats. It sends out radio waves and \"listens\" to how the waves come back, which reveals the shape of whatever they have hit.",
      "Some researchers have used radio waves to detect concealed weapons such as hidden handguns and knives.",
      "Radio waves can even \"fingerprint\" the details of a room. Then, if scanned again later, this would reveal whether any objects in the room have been moved.",
      "Last year, scientists in Germany proposed that countries use this method to scrutinise other countries' management of their nuclear weapons stockpiles. It would be one way of knowing whether someone had been moving the warheads around, for example.",
      "Separately, Luana Olivieri at Loughborough University has explored using a different form of non-visible electromagnetic radiation, terahertz waves. These are shorter than radio waves but longer than visible light waves. \"This wavelength is particularly unexplored,\" says Dr Olivieri.",
      "It is possible to see through objects and analyse materials using this form of radiation, she adds. Such a system could even, in theory, identify specific drugs by detecting their chemical structure.",
      "But while seeing through materials could help a rescue bot find a trapped person in some future disaster, it also has other applications. Police forces and militaries have access to radio-based technology that allows them to see through doors and walls, to some extent.",
      "\"Warfighting is definitely one market that it caters to. It can be used to find and kill someone,\" says Mr da Silva. He has exhibited Wavsens' technology to the US Department of Defense and the Israeli Ministry of Defense, he says.",
      "And yet these applications are not entirely surprising, suggests Prof Reinhard, who points out that a range of emerging technologies have, in principle, made it easier to detect and attack people.",
      "\"Maybe radar sounds scary \u2013 but drones and cheap cameras are the much more dangerous thing,\" he says."

    "summary": "Trump and Modi, who share warm personal ties, met in the shadow of trade tensions complicating US-India relations.",
    "story": [
      "India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has hailed a \"mega partnership\" with the US, as he and US President Donald Trump agreed on a deal for Delhi to import more American oil and gas.",
      "Modi's two-day visit comes as Trump recently ordered that all the US'  trading partners - including India - should face sweeping reciprocal tariffs.",
      "While both men praised each other's leadership, Trump criticised India for having some of the highest trade tariffs in the world, calling them a \"big problem\".",
      "The Indian leader, seeking to soften impending trade barriers, said he was open to reducing tariffs on US goods, repatriating undocumented Indian nationals and buying military fighter jets from the US.",
      "At a joint news conference, Modi made several references to Trump's \"make America great again\" slogan, including his own spin to it: \"It's Make India Great Again - Miga,\" Modi said.",
      "\"Maga plus Miga...[is a] Mega partnership for prosperity\".",
      "Trump also added that India would be \"purchasing a lot of our oil and gas\" in an effort to close the trade deficit between both countries.",
      "\"They need it. And we have it,\" Trump said.",
      "With India already being reliant on imported oil, which it sources from multiple countries, the energy deal with the US \"presents a relatively low hanging fruit for both parties\", Radhika Rao, a senior economist at Singapore's DBS bank told the BBC.",
      "\"The US is the largest export market for India's goods and services, which underscores the administration's willingness to pre-emptively smoothen trade relations and offer concessions to narrow the bilateral trade deficit that the US runs with India,\" she said.",
      "However, \"India's challenge will be to balance its own trade deficit because US oil and gas might be more expensive due to a stronger dollar,\" Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Institute of South Asian Studies said.",
      "\"Reciprocal tariffs are likely to follow on India too at some stage. Hopefully for India, they won't turn out to be larger than expected,\" said Dr Palit.",
      "Trump also added that the US would increase sales of military hardware to India by millions of dollars, eventually supplying Delhi with F-35 fighter jets.",
      "The two also spoke about immigration - another pain point in bilateral relations - with Trump announcing that the US would extradite a man who allegedly plotted 2008 Mumbai terror attack to \"face justice in India\".",
      "Modi thanked Trump for allowing the extradition and vowed to accept repatriations of Indian nationals illegally living in the US.",
      "Last week, US deported on a military plane 104 Indians accused of being illegal immigrants, with a video showing deportees in shackles. A second flight is expected to land in India on Saturday.",
      "Indians are one of the largest populations of unauthorised immigrants in the US. They also hold the majority of H-1B visas - a programme that Trump had temporarily banned during his first term and is now coming under fresh scrutiny.",
      "Shortly before his meeting with Modi, Trump had ordered his advisers to calculate broad new tariffs on US trading partners around the globe, warning they could start coming into effect by 1 April.",
      "He acknowledged the risks of his tariff policy but argued the policy would boost American manufacturing and the country would be \"flooded with jobs\".",
      "Trump told reporters that \"our allies are worse than our enemies\", when it comes to import taxes.",
      "\"We had a very unfair system to us,\" the Republican president said before meeting Modi. \"Everybody took advantage of the United States.\"",
      "The White House also issued a news release that fired a trade shot across the bows of India and other countries.",
      "The document noted that the average US tariff on agricultural goods was 5% for countries to which Washington had granted most favoured nation (MFN) status.",
      "\"But India's average applied MFN tariff is 39%,\" the White House fact sheet said.",
      "\"India also charges a 100% tariff on US motorcycles, while we only charge a 2.4% tariff on Indian motorcycles.\"",
      "Trump has already placed an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, citing its production of fentanyl, a deadly opioid that has stoked a US overdose epidemic.",
      "He has also readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico, America's two largest trading partners, that could take effect in March after being suspended for 30 days.",
      "Earlier this week, he removed exemptions from his 2018 steel and aluminium tariffs."

    "story": [
      "The UK government has given its strongest signal yet that it will seek exemptions from tariffs being threatened on British steel entering the US.",
      "US President Donald Trump has announced 25% taxes on steel entering the country, meaning American businesses face having to pay more to import the metal.",
      "But Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC that the UK had a strong case to avoid the border taxes, given the amounts Britain exported to the US were small in comparison to other countries and because the steel was used in areas such as defence.",
      "Trump has previously said the tariffs will be enforced on 12 March \"without exceptions or exemptions\".",
      "The government has said it would not retaliate immediately to new measures announced this week, despite many in the steel industry calling on Britain to join the European Union and Canada who have said they will hit back against the policy.",
      "The UK is not a big supplier of steel to the US, with the country accounting for about 10% of British steel exports. However, for some suppliers of specialist products, trade with the US is much more important.",
      "There are also concerns within the industry that the tariffs might not only hinder exports to the US, but could also lead to excess steel being \"dumped\" in the UK.",
      "This could occur if other countries no longer exporting to the US decide to offload steel at cheaper prices, which could potentially lead to UK steelmaking businesses being undercut.",
      "Reynolds acknowledged there was a global oversupply of steel and aluminium but said he would argue to the Trump administration that the UK was not the problem.",
      "His comments also suggested that the UK would be reluctant to join potential retaliation by the EU to any further tariffs imposed by the US, adding that \"the UK national interest was best served by free trade\".",
      "Tariffs are paid by companies importing goods from overseas, not by the foreign companies selling the products.",
      "There are concerns that the measures could lead to a rise in inflation if the company buying the goods passes on the cost of the tariff by charging their customers more.",
      "In some cases, the company could decide to absorb the costs themselves, or simply to reduce imports, which would hit foreign exporters - and in the UK's case, British steelmakers exporting to the US.",
      "Earlier this week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's spokesperson declined to say whether Trump was wrong to impose the tariffs.",
      "The threat of trade tariffs has been noted to have created uncertainty for UK businesses, which are set to be hit by higher taxes from April.",
      "Reynolds conceded that tax rises on businesses announced in Budget had been \"challenging\" for firms of whom the government was \"asking a lot\".",
      "Appearing before a gathering of business leaders near Kings Cross, Reynolds announced new guidance for the competition watchdog to be more agile, speedy, and less risk averse.",
      "The meeting came after the chair of the Competition and Markets Authority [CMA] was recently forced out by ministers over concerns it had not been sufficiently focused on economic growth.",
      "The business secretary hinted the government could take further action to reduce the regulatory burden on businesses.",
      "\"I think we have to genuinely ask ourselves, have we got the right number of regulators?\" Reynolds said."

      "Rachel Reeves and two colleagues were the subject of an expenses probe while she was a senior manager at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in the late 2000s.",
      "It was also revealed that the chancellor's online CV exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said Reeves has \"dealt with any issues that arise\" when asked about her CV by a reporter.",
      "The initial stage of the investigation found that a whistleblower's complaint was substantiated at HBOS, and the three employees appeared to have broken the rules, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the probe.",
      "We have not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was. Indeed, it may not have concluded.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.",
      "BBC News investigates the Chancellor's expenses before she became an MP",
      "In a brief interview with a reporter, Sir Keir was asked about Rachel Reeves's CV.",
      "The prime minister was asked whether he was \"comfortable that she exaggerated her relevant experience\".",
      "He said the issues were from \"many years ago\" but that he and the chancellor \"get up every day to... make sure that the economy in our country, which was badly damaged under the last government, is revived and we have growth, and that is felt in the pockets of working people across the country\".",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the investigation raised questions for the chancellor.",
      "She posted on X: \"Keir Starmer said 'restoring trust in politics is the great test of our era'. Until she [Reeves] comes clean - not just about her CV but about the circumstances in which she left HBOS, no one will take him seriously.\"",
      "Rachel Reeves has frequently cited her time at the Bank of England as part of the reason that voters can trust her with the public finances, and has repeatedly claimed to have spent up to 10 years there.",
      "The chancellor left the financial institution nine months earlier than she stated in her LinkedIn profile. This means she spent five and a half years working at the bank - including nearly a year studying - despite publicly claiming to have spent a decade there.",
      "On the professional networking site LinkedIn, the chancellor's profile claimed she worked at the Bank of England from September 2000 to December 2006.",
      "However, BBC News has established she had left by March 2006 when she began working for Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) in West Yorkshire.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves confirmed that dates on her LinkedIn were inaccurate and said it was due to an administrative error by the team.",
      "They said the chancellor hadn't seen it before it was published.",
      "Speaking before the prime minister was interviewed, a Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had no concerns about Reeves's conduct.",
      "Asked whether Sir Keir still thought the chancellor had integrity after she updated her career history on LinkedIn, his official spokesman said: \"Yes. The Chancellor and the prime minister are working hand in hand to deliver on the priorities, the plan for change, and to deliver the higher growth and the improvements in living standards that the country needs.\"",
      "The Number 10 official added that the chancellor had gone through the declaration process, which all members of Cabinet go through, when asked if she disclosed that there had been an investigation into her expenses before she was an MP.",
      "Reeves's profile was updated on Thursday morning just before the BBC broke the news, to reflect that the chancellor left the Bank of England in March 2006",
      "The rest of the profile was subsequently edited to clarify the dates she worked at HBOS.",
      "A photo taken in March 2006 shows her with other HBOS staff at the Council of Mortgage Lenders annual lunch.",
      "A former HR lead for the bank who helped with Reeves's relocation also said she could recall her first day and it was in March 2006.",
      "In a 2021 magazine interview, which she subsequently posted on X, she said: \"I spent a decade working as an economist at the Bank of England and loved it.\"",
      "In a speech to the Labour Party Business Conference in February last year, Reeves said: \"I spent the best part of a decade as an economist at the Bank of England.\"",
      "She said the same thing in a speech at a CEO summit in July 2022, and in a video posted on her Facebook page in the same month.",
      "The claim was also repeated in a Labour party document last year which stated that she spent \"most of the first decade of her career at the Bank of England\".",
      "As she had already started at HBOS by the spring of 2006, her time at the central bank only amounted to five and a half years. This included nearly a year studying for a Masters at the London School of Economics (LSE).",
      "Last year, during previous controversy about Reeves's CV, the Bank of England confirmed that Reeves had left in 2006 but refused to give the month of her departure saying it was a detailed staff record which they couldn't provide.",
      "Reeves also stood for election in Bromley in south-east London more than three months after she had taken a job in West Yorkshire.",
      "She stood in a by-election on 29 June 2006 but had taken up a role at HBOS in March that year and received a relocation package to move from London. It is understood she rented a flat in Leeds and kept a flat in London at this time.",
      "The chancellor's online CV gives incorrect dates for her time at HBOS as well, which her team also acknowledged. It states that she left in December 2009, five months before she was elected to parliament in May 2010.",
      "In fact, we have established, her employment at HBOS finished in mid-May 2009, when she signed a compromise agreement. An invoice for legal advice on the agreement stated that it arose \"from a decision by your employer to terminate your employment\".",
      "The bank was undergoing restructuring at the time of Reeves's departure and a spokesman for the chancellor said she had taken voluntary redundancy.",
      "A compromise agreement, now known as a settlement agreement, is a legal document between an employer and employee which HBOS used when senior managers were made redundant.",
      "Reeves was allowed to continue using a company car for six months, according to her spokesman.",
      "She then spent a year campaigning ahead of the May 2010 general election without seeking further employment.",
      "The MP for Leeds West and Pudsey has previously faced accusations that she has embellished her online CV.",
      "Her LinkedIn profile was changed last year to describe her role at HBOS as \"Retail Banking\".",
      "It had previously claimed she worked as an economist at the bank but she instead held a management role in the bank's Customer Relations department, which dealt with complaints.",
      "In November, several MPs raised the row in the House of Commons while putting questions to Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner.",
      "The prime minister's spokeswoman also faced questions at that time, with journalists asking if Sir Keir expected members of his Cabinet to tell the truth on their CV.",
      "The spokeswoman said the row related to \"the chancellor's time before she was the chancellor\".",
      "\"The prime minister is very clear that what is most important is having a chancellor who is able to balance the books and who is able to be straight with the public and restore the public finances,\" she added.",

      "But the attention-grabbing sub-4% deals by Santander and Barclays will not be available to all borrowers, particularly first-time buyers, and may come with a hefty fee.",
      "The return of such deals might prompt other lenders to follow suit after a period of tepid competition.",

      "The interest rate on this kind of mortgage does not change until the deal expires, usually after two or five years, and a new one is chosen to replace it.",
      "About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages, currently with an interest rate of 3% or below, are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027.",
      "That means a higher monthly bill for many homeowners on their next renewal, but there are signs that the rate they could pay is on its way down.",
      "Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said the interest-rate setting committee expected to be able to cut rates further \"but we will have to judge meeting by meeting, how far and how fast\".",

      "They may also have a relatively large fee, so borrowers will need to check whether the overall value works for them.",
      "More demand for homes from buyers could be generated if mortgage rates fall for a prolonged period.",
      "In its latest survey, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) said that housing market activity was expected to pick up over the coming months following a flat start to the year.",
      "Separate figures show landlords have been feeling the pressure from relatively high mortgage rates.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 10:35:40 GMT",
    "summary": "The economy expanded by 0.1% between October and December, official figures suggest.",
    "story": [
      "The UK economy unexpectedly grew in the final three months of last year following a boost to the construction and services sectors.",
      "The economy expanded by 0.1% between October and December, according to official figures, despite analysts predicting it would contract.",
      "Growth in the quarter was driven by a range of industries, from pubs and bars to machinery manufacturers, having a strong December.",
      "However, the figures also indicated living standards last year were slightly lower than in 2023 on average.",
      "With tax rises coming into force in April, concerns remain that economic growth will remain sluggish for sometime.",
      "Businesses have warned that paying more in National Insurance, along with minimum wages rising and business rates relief being reduced, could affect the economy's ability to grow, with employers expecting to have less cash to give pay rises and create new jobs.",
      "The Bank of England has also halved its growth forecast for the UK this year, amid concerns that higher costs for employers could hit hiring, profits, investment - and push up prices. Last week, it decided to cut interest rates to 4.5%.",
      "Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the economy was \"all-but stagnating\" as businesses adjusted for higher costs and \"more uncertainty overseas\" - pointing to the introduction of trade tariffs in the US by President Donald Trump.",
      "He said it was a clear that \"a lot of the weakness\" in the economy was due to the rise in taxes on firms announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in her Budget last year, with \"business sentiment on the floor\" and investment and consumer spending down.",
      "\"Overall, the economy is unlikely to do more than move sideways over the next six months,\" he suggested.",
      "How fast is the UK's economy growing?",
      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "But the latest figures showing a return to growth at the end of 2024 will be welcome news for the government, which has made growing the economy its top priority in its effort to improve living standards.",
      "A separate figure from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) measuring living standards fell 0.1% in 2024 compared with the year before. The measure - known as real GDP per head - calculates the volume of goods and services available to the average person in the UK and a person is deemed better off the more they have.",
      "When an economy grows, businesses on average have more money to spend to employ more people or give pay rises. Firms making more profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "All this together, in theory, leaves people better off - but it takes time for the benefits to be felt, and it does not necessarily benefit everyone.",
      "In December alone, the economy was estimated to have grown by 0.4%.",
      "Film distribution firms, pubs and bars all had a \"strong month\", as did industries involved in machinery manufacturing, according to Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS.",
      "However, this was offset by weak months in trade for computer programming, publishing and car sales businesses.",
      "In the construction sector, the final months of 2024 saw an increase in new work driven by new private housing projects, but repairs and maintenance work from private homes fell over the period, suggesting homeowners cut back.",
      "'People don't have the money'",
      "Sushma Solanki, the owner of Bolton catering firm Sushma's Snacks, told the BBC the economic situation was \"very worrying\" as she found trading at the end of last year very tough.",
      "\"I normally do about 20 to 30 Christmas office events,\" she said. \"Instead, I did two, which was very hard. People don't have the money.\"",
      "She said she had to let go an employee partly because of the upcoming rise in National Insurance.",
      "\"It's not just the policies, it's everything. Peppers for my chicken dish started off at 79p, they are \u00a31.85,\" she added.",
      "Chris Taylor, the owner of coffee shop Gran T's in Manchester, said he was \"shocked\" that there had been any growth in the economy.",
      "\"Going into last winter was one of the biggest struggles. I think a lot of people were naturally clinging onto their purse strings. Trade was not there,\" he said.",
      "\"This government's action plan, without hitting people directly with higher taxes, is hitting the level above and that effectively is going to hit people one way or another. It is really an indirect punch to the whole economy.\"",
      "Following the release of the new figures, the chancellor said she was still not satisfied with the performance of the economy.",
      "\"It's not possible to turn around more than a decade of poor economic performance in just a few months, but we are doing what is necessary to bring stability to the economy,\" she said.",
      "Reeves also said the government was going \"further and faster\" to \"put more money in people's pockets\".",
      "She also reiterated her self-imposed rules on borrowing and debt were \"non-negotiable\" after reports this week suggested the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, had downgraded growth forecasts.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said Reeves's Budget was \"killing growth\" in the UK.",
      "\"Working people and businesses are already paying for her choices with ever rocketing taxes, hundreds of thousands of job cuts and business confidence plummeting,\" he added.",
      "Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper said the chancellor's Budget was to blame for \"pitiful economic growth\".",
      "\"Her complete pig's ear of a jobs tax will hammer small businesses, the backbone of our economy.\"",

      "Nissan announced cost-cutting measures last year, including shedding 9,000 jobs globally, and halving its current chief executive's pay.",
      "Honda's boss Toshihiro Mibe had said any merger would be \"based on the assumption that Nissan completes its turnaround action\".",

      "Renault chimed in on the Honda-Nissan fallout on Thursday, calling the terms of the proposed deal \"unacceptable\".",

      "A 25% tax is set to be imposed on all imports of steel and aluminium into the US , ending exemptions from the rules for goods from major trade partners including Canada, Mexico, Brazil, as well as the European Union.",
      "The expanded tariff measures announced by President Donald Trump, expected to go into effect next month, will mean many US businesses wanting to bring the metals into the country will have to pay more.",
      "But there is a risk that the companies will pass on the added costs, or some portion of it, to consumers.",
      "Since steel and aluminium are key components in many goods, what items could get more expensive?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "1. Canned food, beer and fizzy drinks",
      "About 70% of the steel used in the US to make cans for food is imported today, coming in from countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Canada, according to the Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI), a business group representing can-makers.",
      "After Trump ordered tariffs on steel in 2018, many can-makers won \"exclusions\" from those import taxes, over the objections of steelmakers, given the limited production of the type of steel used to make cans in the US.",
      "Since then, steel manufacturers have cut production further, pushing up prices, warned the CMI, which sent a letter to the Trump administration earlier this month signed by big food companies including General Mills, Del Monte and Goya.",
      "Robert Budway, president of the CMI, said without exemptions for can manufacturers to import steel tariff free, grocery prices for canned foods made in the US are likely to rise.",
      "\"While the president may believe that these tariffs are protecting the steel industry, they certainly are undermining our food security and our supply resiliency for American canned food, which Americans rely on every day,\" Mr Budway said.",
      "When it comes to aluminium, brewers and makers of fizzy drinks, such as Coca-Cola, have also warned the move will add costs and could lead to higher prices for customers.",
      "\"We control enough variables that we can adapt and mitigate our way through what is happening,\" Coca-Cola chief executive James Quincey told investors this week.",
      "Trump has said there will be no exemptions from the rules this time, either for individual products or for particular countries,  however some sectors are hoping he will row back from that position.",
      "2. Cars",
      "After Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium during his first term, carmakers including Ford and General Motors warned the measures would add about $1bn to each of their costs.",
      "For customers, Morningstar estimated the tariff costs back then would result in a roughly 1%, or a $300 price rise for customers.",
      "David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, warned Ford could be facing a similar cost increase this time, but said it was unclear how consumers will be affected.",
      "Affordability pressures in a market where sales have yet to return to 2019 levels could limit how much of the costs companies choose to pass on, according to Michael Wall, an auto analyst at S&P Global Mobility.",
      "But he said it was still \"realistic\" to expect some of the costs from the metals tariffs to trickle down to buyers.",
      "However he noted that Trump's announcement of tariffs on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico, currently on hold until March, would have a much bigger impact for buyers.",
      "At a business conference, Ford chief executive Jim Farley warned Trump's recent moves were causing \"a lot of cost and a lot of chaos\" for his industry.",
      "TD Economics has estimated cars could go up in price by about $3,000 if blanket tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada came into force.",
      "3. Construction, housing and appliances",
      "The construction industry as a sector is one of the single biggest users of steel, which developers and homebuilders need for everything from building frames to appliances.",
      "Carl Harris, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders, said the decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium ran \"totally counter\" to Trump's stated goal of making housing more affordable, warning it would raise costs and deter development and rebuilding.",
      "\"Ultimately, consumers will pay for these tariffs in the form of higher home prices,\" he warned.",
      "The National Association of Home Builders has urged the president to exempt building materials from the proposed tariffs.",
      "After Trump imposed steel tariffs in 2018, appliance maker Whirlpool faced an unexpected $350m jump in costs it said was driven by the increase in steel prices.",
      "Companies unable to absorb such costs would likely pass them on through higher prices in the shops."

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 10:16:27 GMT",
    "summary": "The bank ditches a policy that stopped it acting on flotations for firms with an all male, all white board.",
    "story": [
      "Goldman Sachs' vice chair has said the bank ditched an internal diversity rule that barred it from advising all male, all white boards on company flotations because it was no longer needed.",
      "The investment bank had pledged that it would only help a business sell its shares on a stock exchange if it had two board members that satisfied diversity requirements, one of whom had to be a woman.",
      "But Richard Gnodde told the BBC: \"That policy was put in place to try and drive a change in behaviour and I think that's happened.\"",
      "In a wide-ranging interview, he also said the UK government needed to get on and start infrastructure projects now.",
      "Goldman Sachs introduced its diversity policy on boards in 2020, initially mandating that companies who wanted to float had to have one diverse member, before increasing it to two people.",
      "Mr Gnodde said: \"I think what is important is that you have a diversity of views on that board and if you look at these companies they've all embraced diversity, it's moved along.",
      "\"I think it has served its purpose.\"",
      "According to think tank The Conference Board, although US boards are \"more diverse than ever\", there was a \"marked slowdown\" in racial diversity hiring on boards between 2022 and 2024.",
      "Among the 500 largest US firms, the share of non-white directors was 26% and the share of women directors was 34% in 2024, according to the think tank.",
      "In December last year, a US federal appeals court ruled that Nasdaq, the stock market index, did not have the authority to impose rules requiring companies to have women and minorities or LGBTQ+ people on their boards or explain why they did not.",

      "A number of companies have since rowed back on diverse hiring programs, including Google and Meta, the firm that owns Instagram and Facebook.",
      "Asked whether firms were stepping back from policies around diversity because of the Trump White House, Mr Gnodde said: \"I can only speak for ourselves, I don't think that's the case.",
      "\"Our ambitions are to continue to take things forward and frankly to go much further than we have been.\"",
      "'Animal spirits'",
      "However, he conceded that uncertainty caused by Trump's policy on trade tariffs was weighing on companies' \"animal spirits\" and their appetite for investment.",
      "\"I think right now, the mood is on the margin [is] a little tempered, because people are uncertain about exactly what the policy outcome will be and exactly what the impacts will be,\" said Mr Gnodde.",
      "Trump initially said he would impose 25% tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. However, he then paused them against Canada and Mexico for 30 days.",
      "Since then, the president has subsequently announced he would impose 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminium entering the US, provoking furious responses from the likes of Canada and the European Union.",
      "Start building",
      "Looking at the UK, Mr Gnodde urged the government to get going on infrastructure  projects sooner rather than later.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves recently announced her backing for a third runway at Heathrow as well as expanding Luton and Gatwick airports, and building a \"growth corridor\" between Oxford and Cambridge.",
      "However, these projects are not expected to be completed for a number of years.",
      "The government has made growing the economy a key policy but UK growth has slowed, according to official figures.",
      "Mr Gnodde said: \"The long range projects are very interesting. We need to put them in place but they're going to take a long time.\"",
      "He added: \"Let's find some infrastructure builds that we need to do, whether it's in the energy sector, whether it's in transportation, improving the road network, something on energy transition.",
      "\"These plans all sit on the Treasury's desk. Why don't we put them out to tender, get the private sector to bid on terms that will be attractive to the private sector, and you will see competition.\"",
      "In a report into boosting small businesses in Britain, released on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs said: \"If there are two things we know from the first six months of a new administration in the UK, it is that growth is the pressing national mission and unlocking it is perhaps the greatest challenge that consecutive governments have faced.\"",
      "Mr Gnodde said Labour had \"sent a strong message on the competition front\" after it recently ousted the chair of the Competition and Markets Authority.",
      "He added that the government pulling such a lever could ignite growth to make the UK \"globally competitive\".",
      "He also suggested that UK businesses had to consolidate to compete globally.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 10:09:01 GMT",
    "summary": "The advertising watchdog says it was \"irresponsible\" to emphasise the thinness of the model's legs.",
    "story": [
      "An advert by fashion brand Next has been banned because the model's pose and the camera angle gave the impression she was \"unhealthily thin\".",
      "The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) compared the advert with other photos of the same model and did not think she looked unhealthily thin in those.",
      "But it said in the now-banned image, emphasising the thinness of the model's legs using camera angles, pose and styling was \"irresponsible\".",
      "Next said it disagreed with the advertising watchdog's decision and said the model, while slim, had a \"healthy and toned physique\".",
      "In response to the ASA, the retailer said the 5'9\" model's pose was chosen \"specifically to display the leggings' fit on both straight and bent legs\", and that the image, which was shot nearly two years ago, was created with a \"strong sense of responsibility\".",
      "A spokesperson added a Next stylist and product image manager met the model in person and \"did not have any concerns about her health\".",
      "In its ruling, the ASA acknowledged the model's face \"did not appear to be gaunt and her arms, while slim, did not display any protruding bones\".",
      "But it said: \"Because the pose, camera angle and styling in the ad investigated strongly emphasised the slimness of the model's legs, we considered that the ad gave the impression that the model was unhealthily thin.\"",
      "Next said it had not used digital retouching to alter the model's appearance but did digitally alter the appearance of the leggings by bringing them down further towards the model's ankle on both legs.",
      "This was not said to alter the model's natural proportions.",
      "The ASA told Next that its advert breached the code for social responsibility.",
      "It said the ad must not appear again in its current form, and that Next  should ensure the images in their ads were \"prepared responsibly and did not portray models as being unhealthily thin.\"",
      "\"You do wonder how it got through,\" fashion journalist Victoria Moss told BBC Breakfast.",
      "\"Next are usually very commercial, their models are very 'girl-next-door'. This model has 'the look' of a model,\" she said, adding however that it was \"important not to stigmatise either way\".",
      "Body positivity",
      "The ruling comes as there is increased focus on the effects of advertising unrealistic or unhealthy body images on mental health.",
      "The \"body positivity\" movement which began around 2010 focused particularly on promoting a more diverse range of models.",
      "But Ms Moss told BBC Breakfast she thinks the body positivity movement is \"slightly under threat\".",
      "\"The wider industry is veering towards a very thin model look,\" she said.",
      "Adding: \"With a rise of weight loss injection drugs there's a rise of talk in the media of people taking these drugs and I think that's really pushed this idea of everyone has to be thin much more to the fore again.\"",
      "She said \"bigger girls are simply not being cast\" for fashion campaigns and raised concerns over a rise in eating disorders among young women along with more \"thinspiration pictures\" being posted on social media.",
      "Ms Moss says the use of body positive curve models has certainly declined in the high fashion industry over last few years but it is still unusual to see very thin models used in high street campaigns.",
      "Editorial director of British Vogue previously told the BBC  the fashion industry \"should be concerned\" by a recent trend towards a return of skinnier models.",
      "Chioma Nnadi suggested the change, a departure from recent progress in body diversity, had been partly fuelled by the rise in popularity of weightloss drugs like Ozempic.",
      "In 2023, the ASA banned fashion retailer Warehouse from using an image of a model in an oversized biker jacket, saying the model's pronounced collar bone, hip bones and torso gave the appearance of her being \"very thin\", which made the ad \"irresponsible\".",

      "The notorious criminal, who was killed by security forces in 1993, has achieved a near cult-like status around the world, immortalised in books, music and TV productions like the Netflix series Narcos.",
      "In Colombia itself, his name and face are adorned on mugs, keychains, and t-shirts in tourist shops catering mainly to curious visitors.",
      "But a proposed law in Colombia's Congress is seeking to change this.",
      "The bill wants to ban Escobar merchandise - and that of other convicted criminals  - to help put an end to the glorification of a drug boss who was central in the global cocaine trade and widely held responsible for at least 4,000 killings.",
      "\"Difficult issues that are part of the history and memory of our country cannot simply be remembered by a T-shirt, or a sticker sold on a street corner,\" says Juan Sebasti\u00e1n G\u00f3mez, Congress member and co-author of the bill.",
      "The proposed law would prohibit the selling, as well as the use and carrying of clothing and items promoting criminals, including Escobar. It would mean fines for  those who violated the rules, and a temporary suspension of businesses.",
      "Many vendors selling the goods claim a law prohibiting this merchandise would harm their livelihoods.",
      "\"This is terrible. We have a right to work, and these Pablo T-shirts especially always sell well,\" says Joana Montoya, who owns a stall stocked full of Escobar merchandise in Comuna 13, a popular tourist zone of Medell\u00edn.",
      "Medell\u00edn, Escobar's hometown, was known as \"the most dangerous city in the world\" in the late 80s and early 90s due to violence associated with drug wars and Colombia's armed conflict.",
      "Today it's been revitalised into a hub of innovation and tourism, with vendors eager to cash in on the influx of visitors wanting to take home souvenirs - some related to Escobar.",
      "\"This Escobar merchandise benefits many families here - it sustains us. It helps us pay our rent, buy food, look after our kids,\" says Ms Montaya, who supports herself and her young daughter.",
      "Ms Montoya says at least 15% of her sales come from Escobar products, but some sellers tell the BBC that for them it's as much as 60%.",
      "If the bill is approved there would be a defined time period for sellers to familiarise themselves with the new rules and phase out their Escobar stock.",
      "\"We'd need a transition phase so that people could stop selling these products and replace them with other ones,\" explains Congressman G\u00f3mez. He says that Colombia has more interesting things to show than drug lords, and that the association with Escobar has stigmatised the country abroad.",
      "Some of the T-shirts, sold for around \u00a35, bear a catchphrase linked to Escobar - \"silver or lead?\".  This symbolises the choice the cartel boss gave to those who posed a threat to his criminal operations: accept a bribe or be killed.",
      "Shop assistant Mar\u00eda Suarez believes that the profit gained from sales of Escobar merchandise isn't ethical.",
      "\"We need this ban. He did awful things and these souvenirs are things that shouldn't exist,\" she says, explaining that she feels uncomfortable that her boss stocks Escobar items.",
      "Escobar and his Medell\u00edn cartel at one point were believed to have controlled 80% of the cocaine entering the US. In 1987, he was named as one of the richest people in the world by Forbes magazine.",
      "He spent some of his fortune developing deprived neighbourhoods, but many people consider this as a tactic to buy loyalty from some segments of the population.",
      "Years on from his father's death, Mr Rojas remembers him as a calm and responsible man, who loved his family. For him, the bill is a defining moment.",
      "\"It's a milestone in the road about how we reflect on what is happening in terms of the commercialisation of images of Pablo Escobar in order to correct it,\" says Mr Rojas.",
      "Yet he does have criticisms about the proposals. He believes the bill doesn't focus enough on education.",
      "Mr Rojas recalls a day many years ago when he met a man wearing a green T-shirt with a silhouette of  Escobar, and the words \"Pablo, President\".",
      "\"It caused me such confusion that I wasn't able to say anything to him about it,\" he says.",
      "\"There needs to be more of an emphasis on how we deliver different messages to new generations, so that there isn't a positive image of what a cartel boss is.\"",
      "Mr Rojas has actively been involved in efforts to reshape narratives around Escobar and the drug trade. Along with some other victims, he launched narcostore.co in 2019, an online shop that appears to sell Escobar-themed items.",
      "But none of the products actually exist and when customers select an item they are shown a video testimony from a victim. Mr Rojas says the site has attracted 180 million visits from around the world.",
      "In Colombia's Congress, the bill faces four stages it needs to pass before it can become law. G\u00f3mez says he's hoping it sparks reflection both inside and outside of Congress.",

      "\"I think the most important thing the bill can do is to generate a conversation as a country - a conversation that hasn't happened yet.\"",
      "Medell\u00edn's mayor  - who was also a presidential candidate in the 2022 elections - has publicly backed the bill, calling the merchandise \"an insult to the city, the country and the victims\".",

      "But for supporters of the bill, this isn't about removing Escobar from history, it's about erasing a mythical construct of him, fostering new ways to honour the victims he killed - and acknowledging the lingering pain of victims left behind."

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 00:33:37 GMT",
    "summary": "With the economy a key factor in German elections this month, can the auto sector get back on the road to recovery?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "Listen to Theo read this story",
      "For decades, car-making has been the jewel in Germany's industrial crown, a powerful symbol of the country's famous post-war economic miracle. Its \"Big Three\" brands, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW, have long been praised for their performance, innovation and precision engineering. But today, the German motor industry is struggling. With the faltering economy a key factor in federal elections this month, how can it get back on the road to recovery?",
      "When you arrive by train in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, the first thing you see is the Volkswagen factory. Its huge facade, emblazoned with a giant VW logo and flanked by four tall chimneys, dominates one bank of the canal that runs through the city. The 6.5 sq km (2.5 sq mile) complex sits adjacent to the Autostadt, a kind of theme park devoted to the automobile and to VW, Europe's biggest carmaker. The Volkswagen Arena, a sports stadium, is a short distance away.",
      "Wolfsburg is Germany's answer to mid-20th Century Detroit - not so much a city with a car factory as a factory with a city that has grown up around it. Some 60,000 people from across the region work in the plant, while the town itself has a population of around 125,000. Locals say that even if you don't work in the factory yourself, it's certain many of your friends will, along with half of your class from school.",
      "\"Wolfsburg and Volkswagen - it's kind of a synonym,\" explains Dieter Landenberger, the VW Group's in-house historian, as he looks lovingly at an early model Beetle. It is one of an array of beautifully restored classic cars in the Zeithaus \u2013 a huge, glass-fronted museum in the Autostadt dedicated to icons of the motor industry.",
      "\"We're proud of the plant,\" he says. \"It is a symbol of that period in the 1950s when Germany had to reinvent itself and rebuild after the war. It was a kind of motor for the German economic miracle.\"",
      "Today, however, the plant has also come to symbolise some of the main problems affecting the German car industry as a whole. The Wolfsburg factory is capable of building 870,000 cars a year. But by 2023 it was making just 490,000, according to the Cologne-based German Economic Institute. And in Germany it is far from alone. Car factories across the country have been operating well below their maximum capacity. The number of cars produced in Germany declined from 5.65m in 2017 to 4.1m in 2023, according to the International Organisation of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers.",
      "All of this matters deeply as the German public prepares to go to the polls on 23 February. The car industry is not just a source of national pride; it is also a significant driver of national wealth. Disagreements over how to resolve the country's economic malaise were a factor in the collapse of the coalition government in November. Whoever is in power after the election will inevitably need a plan to revive the economy \u2013 and getting the motor industry back in gear is likely to play an important role.",
      "Car-making makes up about a fifth of the country's manufacturing output, and if the supply chain is taken into account, it generates around 6% of GDP, according to Capital Economics. The industry employs some 780,000 people directly \u2013 and supports millions of other jobs.",
      "It's not just production that is down. Sales of cars made by German brands are far lower than they were just a few years ago. Between 2017 and 2023, those of VW fell  from 10.7m to 9.2m, while over the same period BMW's went from 2.46m to 2.25m and Mercedes-Benz's went from 2.3m to 2.04m, company reports show.",
      "All of the Big Three saw their pre-tax profits fall by about a third in the first nine months of 2024, and each warned that their earnings for the year as a whole would be lower than previously forecast.",
      "The development of electric cars has sucked up huge investment, but the market for them hasn't grown as quickly as expected, while foreign competitors are flexing their muscles. The threat of tariffs being imposed by the US and other governments also looms large.",
      "\"There are so many crises, a whole world of crises. When one crisis is over, another is coming up,\" is how Simon Sh\u00fctz, a spokesman for the German Automotive Industry Federation (VDA) puts it.",
      "Car sales across Europe have been declining since 2017, according to Franziska Palmas, a senior Europe economist at Capital Economics. \"Lately they've recovered a bit, but they're still around 15 to 20% lower than they were at the peak in 2017,\" she says. \"That's partly due to factors like the pandemic, the energy crisis. But it's also cars lasting longer  - and people already have a lot of cars in Europe. So demand has been weak.\"",
      "Electric dreams",
      "Another key factor has been the aforementioned transition to electric cars. Since the diesel emissions scandal of 2015 \u2013 in which VW was found to have rigged emissions tests in the US \u2013 the industry has been undergoing a technological revolution.",
      "With the EU and European governments determined to phase out petrol and diesel cars over the next decade, manufacturers have had little choice but to invest tens, and collectively hundreds of billions of Euros on developing electric models and building new production lines.",
      "However, although electric cars do now make up a significant share of all cars sold \u2013 13.6% in the EU and 19.6% in the UK last year, for example \u2013 their market share has not been growing as quickly as anticipated.",
      "And in Germany itself, the sudden removal of generous subsidies for electric car buyers in late 2023 actually contributed to a dramatic 27% fall in sales of all electric cars within the country last year, making life still more difficult for German firms in their home market.",
      "\"The decision to drop subsidies suddenly \u2013 that was very bad, because it undermined trust among our customers,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "\"Going from the combustion engine to electric mobility is very big process. We are investing billions in rebuilding all the factories. And so that takes some time, there's no question about it.\"",
      "An expensive business",
      "While all of this has been going on, German manufacturers have also been grappling with another serious concern. Doing business in Germany itself, operating factories here and employing hundreds of thousands of people, is very expensive.",
      "Workers in the automotive sector have traditionally enjoyed generous pay and benefits thanks to agreements drawn up between unions and management. According to Capital Economics, in 2023 the average monthly base salary in the German auto industry was about \u20ac5,300, compared with \u20ac4,300 across the German economy as a whole.",
      "For years, this approach gave German-based companies certain advantages, for example in avoiding industrial unrest and in attracting and retaining talented staff. However, it also led to German car manufacturers having the highest labour costs in the global industry. In 2023, these averaged \u20ac62 per hour, compared to \u20ac29 in Spain and \u20ac20 in Portugal, according to the VDA.",
      "The situation for Germany's domestic car industry became more acute following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This choked off Germany's once-abundant supplies of cheap Russian gas, at the very time when the country was phasing out nuclear power.",
      "The result was a sharp increase in energy prices. Although they have since subsided, energy costs for industrial users in Germany remain very high by international standards. \"Energy prices here are three to five times higher than in the US, or in China \u2013 much higher than for our main competitors,\" says Mr Sch\u00fctz.",
      "And this is being felt across the industry, not just at the carmakers themselves. \"From the Thysenkrupp and Salzgitter steel mills producing the sheet metal rolls that are later turned into doors and bonnets, to makers of smaller components used in drivetrains, costs have exploded as a result of high energy prices,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research.",
      "'A very big shock'",
      "Last year these pressures came to a head. At VW, which has 45% of its global staff in Germany, managers finally decided radical action was needed to bring down costs.",
      "\"It was a very big shock,\" IG Metall union spokesman Steffen Schmidt tells me over a cup of coffee near the VW factory in Wolfsburg. \"The company didn't say anything publicly.\"",
      "It was left to Daniela Cavallo, head of the powerful VW works council and the top employees' representative, to deliver the news. \"They held a big meeting outside the gates of the factory. Thousands of workers \u2013 and you could have heard a pin drop,\" says Mr Schmidt.",
      "\"They were stunned. Thousands of people, all completely silent.\"",
      "What VW proposed was unprecedented. Union representatives had come to meetings expecting to negotiate an annual pay rise. They were asking for a 7% boost. Instead, they were told, the company needed them to take a 10% pay cut.",
      "Worse was to follow. The company said it might have to close up to three of its factories within Germany itself \u2013 and was tearing up a job security agreement that had been in place for decades.",
      "Arne Meiswinkel, VW's chief negotiator, said at the time that the situation it faced in Germany was \"very serious\" and that \"Volkswagen will only be able to prevail if we future-proof the company now in the face of rising costs and the massive increase in competition\".",
      "Volkswagen had never previously closed a German factory in its 87-year history. In the face of intense opposition from unions and politicians, and following short but disruptive \"warning strikes\" by unionised workers, the idea was ultimately shelved. But the very fact it had been put forward sent a seismic shock through the entire sector.",
      "In the meantime, the workforce did agree to painful limits on pay and bonuses, and VW said it would cut more than 35,000 jobs by the end of the decade, albeit in a \"socially responsible manner\" that avoided compulsory redundancies.",
      "Less conspicuously, Mercedes-Benz also launched a cost-cutting drive last year, aimed at saving several billion euros annually - albeit compulsory redundancies in the German workforce are highly unlikely, as a job security agreement effectively rules them out until 2030. Meanwhile Ford, which operates two factories in Germany, recently announced plans to cut 2,800 jobs in the country.",
      "Not all of the German car industry's problems are confined to Germany itself. With the European market saturated, for several decades the continent's manufacturers have looked for growth elsewhere.",
      "The impact of China",
      "One of the most lucrative markets has been China, where for a while the growing middle class had an apparently insatiable appetite for upmarket European vehicles. VW, Mercedes-Benz and BMW all teamed up with local businesses, setting up factories in China itself to meet local demand.",
      "But now that source of growth is drying up. The Big Three have all seen sales fall recently  \u2013 in 2023 VW's China sales were down 9.5% on the previous year, Mercedes-Benz's by 7% and BMW's by 13.4%. Their combined share of the Chinese market has shrunk as well to 18.7%, from a peak of 26.2% in 2019. This appears to be the result of a slowing Chinese economy, falling interest in expensive, foreign-badged cars and the rapid growth of local marques, especially in the electric car market.",
      "\"Not that long ago, Western brands represented quality and trust,\" explains Mark Rainford, founder of the Inside China Auto website. However, he says, since then the reputation and appeal of Chinese brands has improved beyond recognition.",
      "All of the Big Three say trends in China have had a significant impact on their earnings.",
      "Chinese brands are also attempting to build a share of the European market, helped by their much lower operating costs than more established rivals, both because wages are lower in China and because, as pure EV firms, they don't have the same legacy costs carried by manufacturers making the transition from petrol and diesel to battery-powered cars.",
      "According to the European Commission, Chinese brands also benefit from hefty government subsidies, which allow them to sell cars at artificially low prices. In October, the EU introduced extra tariffs on imports of Chinese-made EVs, in an effort to create a more level playing field.",
      "Trade wars?",
      "German firms opposed the EU tariffs, because they feared retaliation from China could affect their own exports. Now they also face the threat of new protectionist measures being introduced by the Trump administration, including possible tariffs on cars shipped from the EU. For an industry that relies heavily on exports, the rise of protectionism is a growing threat.",
      "\"We know that trade wars only create losers on both sides. Tariffs will cost wealth, cost growth and cost jobs,\" says the VDA's Simon Sch\u00fctz.",
      "Although some of the pressures facing Germany's car companies were not foreseeable, there was still an element of complacency, believes analyst Matthias Schmidt: \"They knew the structural issues were there, but were blindsided by cheap Russian gas,\" he says.",
      "\"The expansion to China and the high profits being shipped back to Europe plastered over the high labour cost issues, giving unions a joker card to play with.",
      "\"Germany has effectively been an export-driven market, and once those markets sneeze, Germany catches a cold, which is what's happened.\"",
      "A high-stakes challenge",
      "So can Germany's carmakers revive their fortunes? It is a vital question for the manufacturers, for their networks of suppliers and for the country as a whole.",
      "\"The problem for Germany is we are not competitive,\" says Dr Ferdinand Dudenh\u00f6ffer, head of the Bochum-based Center for Automotive Research. \"Not just in cost terms, but also in terms of the new technologies which will run the world in future\".",
      "He thinks China has become the centre of gravity for innovation in areas such as digitisation and battery technology. \"The solution for the carmakers and for the suppliers, in my view, will be that they take their factories abroad,\" he says.",
      "The Debate: Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
      "Why more young men in Germany are turning to the far right",
      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "Simon Sch\u00fctz is more optimistic. He thinks the industry can prosper, but only if it gets the support it needs from the government after the elections later this month.",
      "\"Our automotive industry will be world-leading, I am sure of that,\" he says.",
      "\"The question is, where will the future jobs be? Will they be in Germany, because we can build cars here, or will our companies go elsewhere?'",
      "For union rep Steffen Schmidt, however, the solution is to go back to Germany's traditional industrial values. \"We have to become a leader in innovation and technology again,\" he says. \"Then we can keep high pay and good conditions for workers.\"",
      "He thinks the path ahead for the new government is very clear: \"Invest, invest, invest. In infrastructure, in technology, in green energy and in education.\"",
      "For tens of thousands of workers in Wolfsburg, and in Germany's other \"car towns\" such as Ingolstadt, Weissach, Munich, Stuttgart and Zwickau, the stakes could not be higher.",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:31:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Kindness influencers give away money and gifts but not everyone supports their work.",
    "story": [
      "Growing up, Samuel Weidenhofer struggled with his mental health after losing his aunt to suicide when he was nine, experiencing a speech impediment, and being bullied.",
      "The trauma of it all made him want to end his own life, he says. When he was 17, he says he decided to turn to social media to spread a positive message.",
      "\"It started with simple things like giving people hugs in public and giving out roses and flowers and things that would make people smile,\" says Weidenhofer, now 21, and living in Melbourne, Australia.",
      "The difference was Weidenhofer filmed these acts and shared them across his social media accounts. The content spiralled and four years later, on Instagram alone he has amassed 1.7 million followers, where he can be seen surprising a person with a serious illness with money or a visit from a celebrity such as Jake Paul or Kristen Bell.",
      "\"I hope my videos inspire someone just a little bit,\" he says.",
      "Kindness content creators, or influencers as they're often called, are increasing in numbers on social media.",
      "Their approaches differ but a common tactic is to secretly film someone being given money, or tickets to a gig or sports match, or perhaps a free haircut.",
      "\"Kindness is cool,\" says Zachery Dereniowski, 31, in the bio of his Instagram account where he has 5.7 million followers.",
      "Mr Dereniowski's videos often involve him telling a stranger that he is hungry and asking for food. When the person helps him out, he rewards the person with a gift, such as a laptop, or money.",
      "\"I suppose I want to really emphasise that every single person you come across has a story\u2026 and often the people who have the least give the most,\" says Mr Dereniowski, who lives in Windsor, near Toronto in Canada, and started the account after giving free hugs to strangers.",
      "Like many influencers, the kindness creators make money from adverts and sponsorship from the brands they work with. For example they might do a deal that involves giving away a particular brand's product.",
      "The videos of kindness content creators attract millions of views. Why are they so popular?",
      "Saoirse Cleary, creative strategy director at marketing agency MG Empower, says they incorporate many of the elements that both social media algorithms and audiences favour: strong hooks, engaging captions, heartfelt narratives, and authentic, unscripted moments.",
      "\"Audiences are captivated by raw, real interactions with everyday people, offering an emotional connection from the comfort of their own screens. People increasingly seek positivity, authenticity, and emotional resonance in their online experiences, especially in spaces often saturated with entertainment-driven content.\"",
      "On the face of it the acts seem well meaning, so why do they attract criticism?",
      "\"\"While these influencers may be genuinely generous... the generosity can sometimes feel performative, as it often serves as a way to attract more views, engagement, and ultimately financial reward, rather than purely altruistic motives,\" says Ms Cleary.",
      "Others go further, questing whether focussing on one, usually vulnerable person, is the right way to help out.",
      "\"I find the typical set up of many of the scenes quite disturbing,\" says Hilda Burke, a psychotherapist, accredited with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.",
      "She explains that the videos often involve someone being identified as \"in need\". They are then asked for a favour. It might be spare money for a bus fare or help with something.",
      "She argues the participant is being \"lured\" into valuing the needs of someone else, who appears richer, more highly than their own.",
      "Only if they do that are they rewarded.",
      "\"I wonder what happens to those who don't play the game?,\" asks Ms Burke.",
      "The influencers defend themselves by arguing that using social media this way is an effective strategy.",
      "\"I can raise more money, so I can help more people if I post it online,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",
      "And how about filming people without their consent?",
      "\"If you are doing a video where you're giving a hug to someone, if you tell them beforehand, it just takes away that authenticity,\" says Mr Weidenhofer.",
      "But he adds that these days he avoids filming people without consent as it was making him \"feel weird\".",
      "Sometimes large amounts of money are given to vulnerable people, which they might not be in a position to manage.",
      "Mr Dereniowski realised that this might be an issue when he raised $240,000 overnight for a father and son who were living in their car.",
      "After that, more thought goes into longer term help.",
      "\"We've started setting up financial advisors. We've started getting these people jobs. We've helped allocate the funds properly to pay off their debt, their car, helping them get a home and [pay their] rent,\" he says.",

    "title": "Do Trump's tariffs mean the end of the post-war free trade world?",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Feb 2025 01:05:54 GMT",
    "summary": "President Trump has proposed a sweeping set of tariffs. Does this mark the end of the post-war free trade world?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's sweeping set of tariffs is intended, in part, to protect American industries, raise money and - as we've seen - be used as a bargaining chip.",
      "The Republican has already imposed tariffs on imports from China, announced plans for a 25% duty on all steel and aluminium imports, and threatened to place 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. We don't yet know how far he will go, but if what is already on the table comes to pass then it would raise average tariffs to their highest since the 1940s, signalling a new chapter for global trade.",
      "Since the end of World War Two in 1945, tariffs have been broadly viewed as leading to higher consumer prices, less choice and \u2013 amidst the inevitable retaliation -  backfiring on the industries they were meant to protect. But are we turning our backs on this era?",
      "I hosted a debate with two economic experts in trade policy to unpick the implications of Trump's policies on America and the world, and explore differing views on who among us might be the biggest winners or losers.",
      "Meet the participants",
      "Meredith Crowley is Professor of Economics at the University of Cambridge. She believes tariffs could lead to a much heavier economic burden on the lowest income people.",
      "Jeff Ferry is Chief Economist Emeritus at the Coalition for A Prosperous America. He believes tariffs can trigger growth and rebuild the US manufacturing industry.",
      "Trump's ambitions",
      "Dharshini David (DD): President Trump described tariffs as \"the most beautiful word in the dictionary\" - which is really intriguing. What's the attraction for him?",
      "Jeff Ferry (JF): I think Trump has made it pretty clear that he thinks tariffs are a 'beautiful' thing for several reasons.",
      "Firstly, because they can revive and rebuild the US manufacturing industry. He also sees the US is running a huge trade deficit. In 2024, we had a record goods trade deficit of $1.2 trillion which means the rest of the world, and particularly trade surplus countries, is generating large amounts of revenue by selling to the US market. This gives the US a powerful negotiating tool and we've seen him use that, regarding drugs and immigration with Canada and Mexico in the last few days.",
      "Meredith Crowley (MC): My presumption is that what is really concerning Trump is the decline in manufacturing jobs within the United States over the last 40 years.",
      "He observed that lots of jobs that used to exist in the US have migrated to other lower wage countries like Mexico and China and I think his hope would be that by imposing tariffs he could stimulate the creation of jobs.",
      "Retaliation",
      "DD: We know countries are thinking of retaliatory measures as well. To what extent will these measures impact Trump's economic goals?",
      "JF: There is no doubt that a tariff policy, coupled with an investment and growth strategy policy and a national security policy, will grow the US economy and do a better job of delivering productivity growth than we've seen in the last 25 years, which frankly have been abysmal by traditional US standards.",
      "Five hundred years of history shows that the economics profession, in its obsession with short term equilibrium, has done a disservice to not just American workers and the American people, but actually, to British people and British workers - and workers in many countries.",
      "DD: In the post-war era, we saw the tearing down of trade barriers and the idea that globalisation was good. Are we now seeing a backlash against this?",
      "JF: We are seeing a historic shift away from the post WW2 consensus, which stemmed from the period when America was way ahead of the rest of the world - and America was very worried about the Communist threat.",
      "So what you call 'free trade,' and I would call the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate consensus, was designed for America to support and even subsidise the growth of European economies and other economies.",
      "We've now moved to a new stage where it's well known the US economy started to falter in the 1970s, and China has risen to become the world's number one manufacturing power basically through exploiting all the rules in the system.",
      "We need a new system.",
      "MC: I have a different diagnosis of what happened in recent history.",
      "Over the past 40 years, it's clear more protection is very popular. Between 1981 and 1994, the US restricted imports of automobiles from Japan and that ultimately had two consequences.",
      "One, it raised the price of automobiles for Americans. Two, in the long run, it led to investment by Japanese manufacturers in the US, and today, the US has a vibrant automobile industry.  You could support US industry much more directly by having direct government support.",
      "Trump has now created uncertainty that Canadian manufacturers will have access to the US market in the future. And because Trump made good on his threats in 2018 to impose tariffs on China, major corporations might be revising plans to expand operations in Canada or Mexico to serve the US market. There will be a pullback on real economic activity in those trading partners.",
      "Higher prices",
      "DD: Meredith, Trump has acknowledged there may be 'a little pain' for Americans in the short term because as you mentioned, tariffs tend to mean higher prices.",
      "MC:  A study on what happened in round one of Trump's tariffs on China in 2018 showed, in the first two years, that most of the cost increase was absorbed by importers and distributors and it didn't get passed on to consumers. The price increases though, tend to come more gradually.",
      "Once you realise the tariff is in place permanently, the manufacturer realises everyone's going to have to pay it and they gradually raise their prices.",
      "One of the concerns economists have is people who buy a lot of goods rather than services tend to be lower income people. So when you put a tariff on things like kids' trainers, backpacks and clothing, these kinds of consumer items, you're really placing a much heavier tax burden on the lowest income people in the country, rather than somebody who's spending their money on vacations and private education for children.",
      "Trade war",
      "DD: Jeff, are you concerned about a global trade war that could backfire on Trump's aims?",
      "JF: We have been in a trade war since 2001, since China entered the world trading community. The trade war is long-standing. Now America is taking action and a lot of people are throwing up their hands, not because they are concerned about a trade war, but because they're concerned they might lose a valuable market for their own products.",
      "But I want to go back to consumer prices.",
      "People focus purely on the negative. The purpose of the tariff is to stimulate domestic industry, so on the positive side, you create brand new investments in domestic industry. On the negative side you get a price increase. So it depends critically on the numbers in both cases.",
      "What we know from round one of Trump's tariffs, between 2018 and 2019, is the price of tariff goods went up, such as steel, but companies committed to building new factories like steel mills which have hired several hundreds of people - great blue collar jobs for people who generally speaking do not have a college degree.",
      "The current phase of globalisation which began around 1990 was just a huge mistake. The idea that the US could compete with Mexico on salaries, particularly to manufacturing workers, was just crazy.",
      "DD: Lets get Meredith's view on this. Would you agree that for higher wage economies, frankly, globalisation has not been a great idea since the 1990s?",
      "MC: I understand Jeff's point, that the only concern of the president should be the wellbeing of Americans. But, between 1990 and 2023, the number of people around the world living in extreme poverty on less than $2.15 (\u00a31.75) a day fell from two billion to around 700 million. Over a billion people exiting poverty because of increasing globalisation is an astounding achievement of humanity.",
      "The tariff wars have begun - buckle up",
      "Faisal Islam: The 'Iron Chancellor' will have to flex to get the growth she wants",
      "'Not the ministry of fun': Troubling issues clatter onto Yvette Cooper's desk",
      "It is completely clear to everyone that within American society the benefits of globalisation have not been equal and so there is a real need within the US to think about how do we improve the wellbeing of less skilled people, and how do we get jobs into the economy to help them.",
      "Where I differ with Trump is I think there are more effective tools. You need an industrial policy or subsidies to production. American productivity is so high because we are constantly investing in labour saving technology but the consequence is that the less skilled have been left behind and their lives are materially worse than they were thirty years ago.",
      "JF: I agree one hundred percent with Meredith.",
      "Equality",
      "DD: This is fascinating. If we see the kind of trade barriers that Trump wants to put in place, what does that mean for this issue of equality?",
      "MC: Once you start putting barriers between countries you create a lot of opportunity for what in the economics world we call monopoly profits. Once you limit entry, the existing producers get to jack up their prices and exploit consumers.",
      "If the US goes into a trade war with China, what's going to happen to imports from countries the US isn't interested in having a trade war with?",
      "If the US and China deepen their trade war, this could affect the supply chain participation of sub-Saharan African countries with the US and China, meaning it is going to be one of the areas of the world that bears some of the brunt of this trade war.",
      "So the spillover effects could be very, very negative.",
      "DD:  Jeff, is this a price worth paying? What kind of impact could we see on growth?",
      "JF: I don't think of it as a price worth paying, I think of it as an evolution of the world system where hopefully we'll get higher growth everywhere. And this is where I differ with the mainstream economics view which focuses far too much on trade and on minor productivity gains.",
      "The world has grown through the success of industries. The US prosperity from 1900 to 1970 was due largely to the automobile industry. What you saw was huge productivity gains as Henry Ford and all his successors invented and developed mass production. You saw wage increases and spending increases and we had the most prosperous economy in the world.",
      "So what we need is industrial growth and when you look at a national security framework, we cannot be dependent on China for as many goods as we are today. We are far too dependent on China here in the United States, Europe is far too dependent on China. So what's the resolution? Well the resolution is pretty obvious - we need to make certain goods here in the US.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 01:43:56 GMT",
    "summary": "The growth is led by a tourism boom, with Spain nearing France as the world's most visited country.",
    "story": [
      "It's a chilly mid-winter afternoon in Segovia, in central Spain, and tourists are gathered at the foot of the city's Roman aqueduct, gazing up at its famous arches and taking selfies.",
      "Many of the visitors are Spanish, but there are also people from other European countries, Asians and Latin Americans, all drawn by Segovia's historic charm, gastronomy and dramatic location just beyond the mountains north of Madrid.",
      "\"There was a moment during Covid when I thought 'maybe tourism will never, ever be like it was before',\" says Elena Mir\u00f3n, a local guide dressed in a fuchsia-coloured beret who is about to lead a group across the city.",
      "\"But now things are very good and I feel this year is going to be a good year, like 2023 and 2024. I'm happy, because I can live off this job I love.\"",
      "Spain received a record 94 million visitors in 2024 and is now vying with France, which saw 100 million, to be the world's biggest foreign tourist hub.",
      "And the tourism industry's post-Covid expansion is a major reason why the eurozone's fourth-biggest economy has been easily outgrowing the likes of Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom, posting an increase in GDP of 3.2% last year.",
      "By contrast, the German economy contracted by 0.2% in 2024, while France grew by 1.1%, Italy by 0.5%, and the UK by an expected 0.9%.",
      "This all helps explain why the Economist magazine has ranked Spain as the world's best-performing economy.",
      "\"The Spanish model is successful because it is a balanced model, and this is what guarantees the sustainability of growth,\" says Carlos Cuerpo,  the business minister in the Socialist-led coalition government. He points out that Spain was responsible for 40% of eurozone growth last year.",
      "Although he underlined the importance of tourism, Mr Cuerpo also pointed to financial services, technology, and investment as factors which have helped Spain bounce back from the depths of the pandemic, when GDP shrank by 11% in one year.",
      "\"We are getting out of Covid without scars and by modernising our economy and therefore lifting our potential GDP growth,\" he adds.",
      "That modernisation process is being aided by post-pandemic recovery funds from the EU's Next Generation programme. Spain is due to receive up to \u20ac163bn by 2026 ($169bn; \u00a3136bn), making it the biggest recipient of these funds alongside Italy.",
      "Spain is investing the money in the national rail system, low-emissions zones in towns and cities, as well as in the electric vehicle industry and subsidies for small businesses.",
      "\"Public spending has been high, and is responsible for approximately half our growth since the pandemic,\" says Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Valdemoros, lecturer in economics at Spain's IESE Business School.",
      "Other major European economies have seen their growth stymied by their greater reliance than Spain on industry, which, she says, \"is suffering a lot at the moment due to factors such as the high cost of energy, competition from China and other Asian countries, the cost of the transition to a more sustainable environmental model and trade protectionism\".",
      "Since Covid, the other major economic challenge for Spain has been the cost-of-living crisis triggered by supply-chain bottlenecks and the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Inflation peaked at an annual rate of 11% in July of that year, with energy prices hitting Spaniards particularly hard, but by the end of 2024 it had fallen back to 2.8%.",
      "Madrid believes that subsidies it introduced to cut the cost of fuel consumption and encourage public transport use were key in mitigating the impact of the energy price rises, as well as several increases to the minimum wage.",
      "At the height of the European energy crisis, Spain and Portugal also negotiated with Brussels a so-called \"Iberian exception\", allowing them to cap the price of gas used to generate electricity in order to reduce consumers' bills.",
      "Mr Cuerpo argues that such measures have helped counter Spain's traditional vulnerability to economic turmoil.",
      "\"Spain is proving to be more resilient to successive shocks \u2013 including the inflation shock that came with the war in Ukraine,\" he said.  \"And I think this is part of the overall protective shield that we have put in place for our consumers and for our firms.\"",
      "The country's green energy output is seen as another favourable factor, not just in guaranteeing electricity, but also spurring investment. Spain has the second-largest renewable energy infrastructure in the EU.",
      "The latter is a boon for a country that is Europe's second-biggest car producer, according to Wayne Griffiths, the British-born CEO of Seat and Cupra. Although Spanish electric vehicle production is lagging behind the rest of Europe, he sees enormous potential in that area.",
      "\"[In Spain] we have all the factors you need to be successful: competitive, well-trained people and also an energy policy behind that,\" he says. \"There's no point in making zero-emission cars if you're using dirty energy.\"",
      "Despite these positives, a longstanding weakness of Spain's economy has been a chronically high jobless rate, which is the biggest in the EU and almost double the block's average. However, the situation did improve in the last quarter of 2024, when the Spanish jobless unemployment rate declined to 10.6%, its lowest level since 2008.",
      "Meanwhile the number of people in employment in Spain now stands at 22 million, a record high. A labour reform, encouraging job stability, is seen as a key reason for this.",
      "This reform increased restrictions on the use of temporary contracts by companies, favouring greater flexibility in the use of permanent contracts.  It has reduced the number of workers in temporary employment without hindering job creation.",
      "Also, although the arrival of immigrants has driven a fierce political debate, their absorption into the labour market is seen by many as crucial for a country with a rapidly ageing population.",

      "Schools across Stoke-on-Trent are caught up in an increasingly bitter row over repairs, with some telling the BBC they've had to fight to get work done while paying \"astronomical\" charges over 25 years.",
      "The city's schools are all locked into a multi-million-pound Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contract, meaning they pay a company to keep their buildings in good condition.",
      "The agreement is due to end in October, when schools fear the private firm will walk away, leaving behind a huge repair bill for work not completed.",
      "BBC News has been investigating the row for more than a year, visiting multiple schools in the city, using Freedom of Information (FOI) requests and analysing documents.",

      "None of the 88 schools in the contract have received any compensation for alleged failures, such as delays to repair buildings over the course of the 25-year contract",
      "The contract was signed in 2000 between Stoke-on-Trent City Council and a firm called Transform Schools (Stoke) Limited (TSSL). It uses multinational company Equans to maintain the facilities.",
      "The contract is the largest of its kind in England and will be among the first PFI deals in the country to expire. After the deal ends, the private company will have no further liability.",
      "What happens next has implications for the expiry of almost 600 similar deals covering schools and hospitals across England.",
      "Stoke City Council said its priority was to get the schools handed over \"safe, warm and dry\", while the main contractor engaged under the PFI contract, Equans, said the buildings had been well maintained.",
      "At Our Lady and St Benedict primary, more than half the children are from families on the very lowest incomes. When the BBC visited the school last month, part of one classroom was cordoned off with hazard tape because plaster was falling off the walls. There was a hole in the ceiling and the wall was damp to touch.",
      "The BBC has seen evidence the school has spent years chasing this and other repairs, which under the terms of the maintenance contract have to be done through Equans.",
      "Head teacher Sarah Clowes says the school's floors and windows are among almost 300 issues staff have identified - but the heating is her biggest headache.",
      "A new boiler, fitted under the contract last summer, broke down when the first cold snap arrived, and the youngest children had to be sent home for three days because the building was so cold. Pupils in Year 6 remained at school, but had to wear their coats during lessons. When the heating broke down again in January, the school was unable to open and all the pupils had to stay at home.",
      "Since the BBC approached Equans for comment last week, the damp plaster has been removed and repairs have begun. The school told us despite further repairs the heating is still not working in every classroom.",
      "A few miles away, at St Margaret Ward Catholic Academy, the exterior render on the building is stained green with damp and is coming away in places. Inside, there is a huge stain where water comes through from the roof to the ground floor.",
      "The BBC has also seen evidence of months of delays to fix three pumps that supply the school with water. Only one is working - and if it breaks the school says it will have to close because there would be no clean water for taps and toilets.",
      "BBC News contacted Equans about the issue and the school has since been assured the pumps will be replaced during a school holiday.",
      "Ian Beardmore, chief executive of Newman Catholic Collegiate - a group of six primaries and one secondary in the Stoke PFI contract - describes the charges his schools have been paying for the past 25 years as \"astronomical\".",
      "He says the annual maintenance fee for a plug socket installed in one primary school staff room was \u00a3400, and when he asked for the socket to be removed the school was charged \u00a3500.",
      "Mr Beardmore says there are \u00a31.8m of repairs that need to be carried out across his seven schools, which have been identified in expiry surveys carried out to assess their condition as the maintenance contract nears its end. Some work has already been classed as too expensive or not essential, he says.",
      "\"There's no money, there's no will to do it, and there's no time in order to put these things into place,\" he says. \"It's going to leave us severely out of pocket - and there's absolutely nothing we can do about it.\"",
      "The BBC has seen a letter, sent by Stoke-on-Trent City Council to all 88 schools in the Stoke contract, saying it \"remains concerned\" the PFI company \"may not have sufficient funding available to them to complete all of the handback works\".",
      "It will need to \"reprioritise\" work not already agreed, the letter continues, and target repairs which will leave all schools \"in a safe, warm and dry condition\" by the end of the contract.",

      "However, the BBC investigation suggests little money has been held back, despite concerns from the schools.",
      "The BBC analysed 25 years of published financial accounts for the PFI company TSSL and found \u00a3416,000 had been declared as deductions from the contract since 2014. In most years this was less than 1% of the fees.",
      "Using Freedom of Information (FOI) requests, BBC News also found that no money has been passed on to schools for contract failures over the last 25 years.",
      "Stoke-on-Trent City Council told us it was still working through these payments, and they would be paid to schools before October.",
      "The BBC shared its data with Ian Dennison, whose consultancy firm Inscyte is advising the schools fighting to get repairs done in Stoke. His company has worked on PFI school contracts across England.",
      "Mr Dennison told the BBC the level of deductions in Stoke were \"shockingly low\" compared with similar contracts for PFI schools across England.",
      "Time is running out for repairs to be carried out in Stoke's PFI schools and Mr Dennison is not confident the buildings will be handed back in a satisfactory condition.",
      "\"We believe that there's a really serious problem about to emerge around what works can be completed in time,\" Mr Dennison says.",
      "Putting buildings right at the end of contract is part of what the high yearly payments in PFI are intended to ensure.",
      "Inscyte says the expiry surveys carried out for Stoke City Council and TSSL show the total repairs would cost millions.",
      "The use of PFI deals increased significantly under Tony Blair's Labour government as a way of investing in public buildings without the government borrowing money up front. Under the deals, long-term agreements between the private and public sector were made.",
      "In Stoke, the contract mainly covered maintaining existing school buildings, with a bit of new build. Elsewhere, completely new schools were built under PFI.",
      "In 2018, the Conservative government scrapped the controversial PFI model after growing concerns it did not provide value for public money. But around 570 PFI contracts, including many to maintain and update school and hospital buildings, remained in place. Many are now nearing their end.",
      "Five years ago the National Audit Office (NAO) - which scrutinises value for public money - warned of a risk of schools and hospitals being handed back in a poor condition if the final stage of these maintenance contracts wasn't properly managed.",
      "As contracts begin to wind down, the NAO said there is a disincentive for the private companies to spend money before they hand over responsibility for maintaining the buildings to public bodies.",
      "In order to avoid this happening the government says \"expiry health checks\" should be carried out on buildings.",
      "In response to an FOI request, the Cabinet Office confirmed expiry health checks were carried out on Stoke's PFI schools in March 2021 and March 2024.",
      "Their condition was given the second worst rating, \"amber/red\", which means \"major additional work\" was needed.",
      "The BBC asked the council, Equans and TSSL to comment on its findings.",
      "Stoke-on-Trent City Council said there had been a \"large amount of investment to maintain and improve these schools over the last 25 years\", which it claims means they are in a better condition than many schools elsewhere.",
      "The council said recent high inflation had made repairs more expensive, but it would not agree to responsibility for buildings being handed back unless standards set out in the contract were met.",
      "The council said more than half the work by value had been completed, and it was drawing up plans in case not all the work can be finished.",
      "Equans said it has been \"committed to ensuring Stoke's schools have been well-maintained throughout the 25 years of the contract\". It said an average of 28,000 jobs have been completed across the schools every year, with 93% of planned and preventative tasks being completed on time and, for the rest of this year, \"a busy schedule of work for the school holidays was planned\".",
      "Some work on the damaged render at St Margaret Ward Catholic Academy is now due to be carried out over Easter, the BBC understands.",
      "Transform Schools (Stoke) Limited said the schools had been maintained \"in accordance with the contract\", adding that many of the school buildings were relatively old when it took over responsibility.",
      "It said \"all parties are working together to deliver the maintenance works by the contract expiry date\", adding that the schools were involved in the sign-off process and it was unaware of any dispute between the council and the schools and \"unaware of widespread issues with quality\".",

    "summary": "Pupil numbers are set to fall by 90,000 by 2040, but ministers want to maintain school staffing.",
    "story": [
      "Long-term plans need to be drawn up for Scotland's schools to reflect falling pupil numbers, a think tank has said.",
      "The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said there could be 90,000 fewer pupils in the country's classrooms by 2040 - and suggested that teacher numbers could be cut as a result.",
      "The group said this could eventually free up \u00a3500m per year, but the government has flatly rejected the idea.",
      "Teaching unions have hit out too, with the EIS saying cutting teacher numbers \"lacks any educational rationale\" and the NASUWT calling it a \"false economy\" that would damage life chances and Scotland's future prosperity.",
      "But when you consider the falling birth rate and demographic changes alongside the need to get the maximum benefit out of every pound spent on services, is it time to talk about teacher numbers?",
      "School staffing is a frequent topic of dispute between politicians - usually in terms of demands for more of them, not fewer.",
      "The SNP pledged in its 2021 manifesto to increase teacher numbers by 3,500.",
      "So when it was revealed in December that the figure had actually fallen, opposition leaders were quick to give the first minister a hard time about it.",
      "John Swinney pledged to get teacher numbers back to 2023 levels, and keeping them there is the government's new goal.",
      "But pupil numbers are already starting to plateau, and are projected to drop sharply over the coming decades.",
      "That's why the Institute for Fiscal Studies argues that perhaps it would be OK to allow teacher numbers to go down in line with that, rather than holding them at 2023 levels.",
      "The government has flatly rejected the report's conclusions.",
      "But much of the picture it paints is actually pretty positive.",
      "The IFS underlines that class sizes in Scotland are smaller than those elsewhere in the UK - averaging about 13 pupils per teacher, compared with 17 to 19 pupils per teacher down south.",
      "Spending per pupil is also rising, and is the highest in the UK - 20% higher than it is in England.",
      "But on both counts that can be explained in part by the number of pupils rising far more sharply south of the border. Scotland is set to have the opposite problem.",
      "The stickiest issue for the government is that these smaller class sizes and higher spending hasn't necessarily led to notably better outcomes.",
      "Scotland's struggle in international comparisons of school performance has been well documented. There has been a long-term decline in reading, maths and science, and Covid has hardly helped.",
      "The gap in attainment between pupils from more and less affluent backgrounds also remains stubbornly unclosed, almost a decade on from it being made the government's \"number one priority\".",
      "The IFS argument is that continuing to plough money into school staffing against a backdrop of falling school rolls isn't the most cost-effective way to improve things.",
      "Pupil numbers are projected to fall by 90,000 by 2040. If teacher numbers hold steady at 2023 levels, then the pupil-teacher ratio will fall closer to 12 - the lowest ever.",
      "But IFS research economist Darcey Snape says smaller class sizes \"only tend to have modest effects on pupil attainment\".",
      "Her analysis suggests that letting teacher numbers fall could free up funds - up to \u00a3500m per year by 2040 - either for other areas of schooling, or indeed for other badly-stretched budgets such as social care.",
      "Ms Snape accepts there would inevitably be \"practical difficulties\", like amalgamating classes and schools as rolls fall - but says local councils are arguably best placed to make these decisions, \"rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach across Scotland\".",
      "The latter point is already the subject of some dispute between schools and councils.",
      "Ultimately councils are the employers, and control the overall numbers - the government can only enforce its policy by holding carrots and sticks over them.",
      "Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth has clashed with council leaders by threatening to withdraw funding which was offered on the basis of keeping numbers at 2023 levels.",
      "A deal has just been struck with Glasgow City Council, which was planning on cutting 450 posts over a three-year period - which in turn had led to strike threats from unions.",
      "Groups representing teachers are predictably negative about the IFS's report, calling it a \"false economy\" and a \"race to the bottom\".",
      "The EIS and NASUWT say things aren't as straightforward in schools as the report might make out.",
      "Both make the point that the number of pupils with additional support needs has risen to record levels. They need more support, not less, and cutting teacher numbers would \"further entrench existing inequalities\" in their prospects.",
      "They also point to the fact teachers already have \"excessive workloads and working hours\", and face issues with anti-social behaviour and even violence in classrooms.",
      "It is absolutely fair to argue that long-term planning needs to be done, to take account of shifting demographics.",
      "The ever-increasing strain on care services provides a prime example of why we need to be ready for the ways in which society will change.",
      "Perhaps we do need to have a grown-up debate about the best and most cost-effective way to improve outcomes in schools.",
      "But when the headline is getting rid of teachers, it's always going to be difficult to sell the idea to politicians who face an election in just over a year.",
      "The Scottish government has already flatly rejected the idea, saying teachers play a central role in driving improvements in schools.",
      "And as noted above, opposition parties are chiefly interested in holding ministers to account on their promised increases. Nobody is going to put cutting teacher numbers on a leaflet.",
      "And it's particularly tough to get MSPs to stick their necks out when we're talking about something which will be an issue in 2040, which feels pretty distant.",
      "But a year is famously a long time in politics, and 15 of them is an eternity. Look back 15 years and Gordon Brown was prime minister and the SNP were being propped up by the Conservatives at Holyrood.",
      "If one thing is guaranteed, it's change; it's incredibly unlikely that we will reach 2040 with the current policy structure intact.",

    "title": "'Montoya, por favor!': Inside the Spanish reality show that broke the internet",
    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:00:34 GMT",
    "summary": "As clips from Spain's Temptation Island go viral, the BBC speaks to the show's executive producer.",
    "story": [
      "Reality TV gold has a new three-word definition: \"Montoya, por favor!\"",
      "If you've been anywhere near social media over the past fortnight, you'll know the raw drama setting the internet ablaze this award season hasn't come from Hollywood, but the love tragedy played out in clips posted from Spanish reality TV show Temptation Island.",
      "Contestant Jose Carlos Montoya's spiralling meltdown at watching his girlfriend Anita cheat with another man is like an uncensored Love Island on steroids.",
      "In Temptation Island, couples are taken to a tropical island, separated and sent to separate villas filled with attractive singles ready to test their loyalty. In a final twist, every move made is recorded for the other half to see.",
      "Forced to watch a graphic real-time stream of the betrayal, Montoya's emotions swell until he snaps, breaking all the show's rules.",
      "Blind to the now infamous pleas of host Sandra Barneda (\"Montoya, por favor!\"), he rampages down the beach to confront the pair, tugging at his shorts in anguish as lightning streaks across the sky.",
      "A second clip shows the resulting confrontation: Anita flips the script, calling out Montoya's own indiscretions before collapsing in tears, begging for forgiveness.",
      "\"This is cinema,\" wrote one X user, posting a clip that has now been watched on the platform a staggering 224m times since 4 February.",
      "\"Montoya. the tension \u2026 you don't need to speak Spanish to understand, this is insane.\"",
      "Yet those behind Spain's Temptation Island see its success as more than just shock value. Executive producer Juanra Gonzalo tells me they are overjoyed by the \"completely unexpected\" global reaction, and he believes the show's appeal lies in its relatability.",
      "\"In Love Island, all the people are single. In Temptation Island, there are real couples, and they are putting their love at risk,\" he says. \"I think [audiences] know it too. These emotions and reactions cannot be faked.\"",
      "\"Everyone wants to know what their boyfriend or girlfriend is doing when they are not with them. We can imagine, but we don't know. Temptation Island lets the audience ask: 'what would I do in that situation?'\"",
      "The magic ingredient to making this work is careful casting. \"Montoya and Anita were perfect - they are very emotive and expressive,\" he says.",
      "Gonzalo calls Montoya, a singer by trade with previous TV experience, a \"special man\". At 31, he told casters he'd \"never experienced love like this before\", having been with Anita \"every day for a year\".",
      "\"She's a strong woman with a lot of character,\" Gonzalo adds.",
      "The Sun's senior showbiz reporter Lottie Hulme says the programme's \"authentic emotion\" sets it apart from competitors like Love Island, Love Is Blind, Married At First Sight and Dating Naked.",
      "Seeing such unfettered and raw emotion may stand out to British and American viewers, who have become used to glossy and well-worn competitive reality formats like Love Island and semi-scripted reality shows like Made in Chelsea.",
      "\"It was refreshing and almost shocking to see something so raw, because it's something that we just don't see on the reality TV shows in Britain nowadays,\" Hulme says.",
      "\"We're at a point with reality TV culture where we're wondering 'what if' - are contestants really being their authentic self\u2026 or are they after followings and a brand deal?\"",
      "Alongside constructed storylines, the commercialised reality TV to influencer pipeline has made existing formats feel \"predictable\" adds Hulme.",
      "Audience figures reflect this.",
      "Love Island is currently airing its All Stars edition on ITV2, which started last year. The 2024 final attracted 1.3m viewers - a sharp drop from the six million peak of its 2019 heyday.",
      "While this season's figures remain solid, even matching BBC Two's audience on launch night, the show now usually only dominates non-terrestrial channels.",
      "'Never allowed' on UK TV?",
      "A curious quirk of the Montoya phenomenon is that the Spanish show isn't available to watch in the UK - an irony that has only fuelled its illicit appeal on social media.",
      "Previous UK and US versions failed to take off, and production company Banijay says it does not presently plan to broadcast the Spanish version in the UK.",
      "After Montoya's meltdown caught the eye of Love Island host Maya Jama, she posted: \"They would never allow this on UK TV. For so many reasons. But it's one of the best things I've ever seen\".",
      "When asked why, she simply replied: \"people would complain\".",
      "Like Big Brother before it, Love Island has been the subject of complaints to Ofcom.",
      "A heated confrontation between 2021 Love Islanders Faye and Teddy over Teddy's behaviour in Casa Amor (a segment similar to Temptation Island's premise) sparked 25,000 Ofcom complaints.",
      "Despite the shocked reactions Gonzalo's show has provoked, he says it operates within strict boundaries, suitable for its primetime slot.",
      "\"Not everything we record is aired,\" he says. \"We are very careful - we only show a few seconds of sexual content.\"",
      "Temptation Island is just the latest in a string of particularly high-octane Spanish dating shows.",
      "Take Falso Amor (or Deep Fake Love), for instance. Currently streaming on Netflix, it intensifies the premise of Temptation Island by asking couples to decide whether videos of each other are real or highly convincing AI deepfakes.",
      "So is content which British audiences find shocking viewed differently in Spain?",
      "When I raise Love Island's Zara Holland being stripped of her Miss Great Britain title after having sex on the show in 2016, Gonzalo is shocked and welcomes the internet's more light-hearted reaction to Anita's sexual scenes.",
      "\"As in other countries, things in Spain are progressing from the past - this is positive for our view of women and sexuality\" he says, adding no gender should face double standards.",
      "Montoya 'given the right help'",
      "In the UK, there has been heightened scrutiny and awareness of the impact reality TV can have on cast members' mental health, following the deaths of several former contestants.",
      "When I press Gonzalo on this, given the intensity of Montoya and Anita's experience, he says a team of psychologists monitor contestants before, during, and after filming.",
      "Montoya received particular support after his beach escapade.",
      "\"We made sure he was not alone, that he had a safe space to process everything. It was important for us to provide him with the right help,\" he says.",
      "Looking ahead, Netflix is to relaunch an American version of the show next month.",
      "Gonzalo is up for the fight. He laughs at the internet's playful suggestion that the beach scene should win an Oscar, then adds: \"My team deserve all the awards. An Oscar. And a Bafta!\""

    "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 09:38:04 GMT",
    "summary": "After the star kicked two fans out, we speak to UK comics about the \"chaos\" and \"magic\" of heckling.",
    "story": [
      "Peter Kay made the news last weekend when he kicked two hecklers out of his show at the Manchester Arena.",
      "Kay defended the move afterwards, saying he'd done his \"best to address the situation and made light of it, as any comedian would, but unfortunately their interruptions continued\".",
      "One heckler was removed for loudly ordering the Bolton comic's favourite \"garlic bread\" one too many times. He went on to tell the Daily Mail he felt he'd been \"treated like a terrorist\".",
      "Another had announced \"we love you, Peter\" in the aftermath, resulting in Kay calling her Lisa Riley as she was ejected, because of her resemblance to the actress.",
      "The woman later said on TikTok that she felt \"humiliated\" and thought his reaction was a bit \"over the top\".",
      "BBC News journalist Ellen Kirwin told the BBC the \"vibe was good\" in the place before the red cards, which \"seemed unjustified\".",
      "The incidents prompted a week-long discussion about when piping up can be fun, and how it can quickly get out of hand.",
      "With this in mind, we asked an English, a Welsh and Scottish comedian for their thoughts on the subtle art of dealing with hecklers.",
      "'Most brutal heckle ever'",
      "Larry Dean, who starts his UK tour on Wednesday 19 February in Cardiff, tells the BBC he \"felt sorry for the audience, not just Peter Kay\".",
      "\"It's a really hard thing to do because no one wants to see a comic go serious, you feel like a teacher sometimes,\" he says.",
      "\"It changes the atmosphere when a heckler goes too far, but it really is about gauging do the people around me want me to keep going?\"",
      "Last year, Dean found himself the victim of what he has described as \"the most brutal heckle ever\".",
      "When discussing the topic of ghosts, he overheard a woman loudly talking to someone else in the audience and decided to ask if she was okay.",
      "\"My dad bought me these tickets because he's dying and he wanted me to have a laugh,\" came the reply.",
      "\"We're not laughing\", she added, \"so I've said to my pal we're going to leave.\"",
      "Dean recalls his shocked response.",
      "\"Obviously I'm not gonna make fun of that,\" Dean tells the BBC.",
      "The Glaswegian looked so discombobulated by the heckle that another audience member asked him if he was okay.",
      "\"Looking at it, perspective-wise, Chris Rock [who was slapped on stage at the Oscars by Will Smith] and Peter Kay - who have the two most famous show interruptions from the past few years - they've had it easy!",
      "\"They need to get this woman from Dundee to know what a heckle really is.\"",
      "His second-worst heckle involved a man on the front row repeating the same whispered swear word at him, so low that only he could hear it. \"I just had to ignore it,\" he says.",
      "Arenas, like the ones Kay performs in, bring in more people but they can also bring problems for stand-ups, he says.",
      "\"They're harder to play than a theatre or comedy club because the laughter goes up, it doesn't come towards the stage,\" says Dean, who has played support slots in arenas.",
      "He says it's difficult for comedians in Kay's situation to hear what audience members are actually saying, and that their interjections are also distracting for others watching in different parts of the arena.",
      "\"People say, 'he should have said this...', but usually people who say that have never been on stage before and they don't know how hard it can be thinking that quickly in the moment about what the best thing for the show is; because you just want everybody to have a good time.\"",
      "Another British comic James Acaster last year released a special entitled Hecklers Welcome, not because he particularly enjoys the experience, but to face his biggest fear and, as he told GQ, \"run towards the thing I was scared of\".",
      "Dean feels that \"nothing will ever catch people's attention more\" than watching a comedian get heckled.",
      "But, he warns, if you're going to take a pop at a professional then you have to expect something to come back your way.",
      "Heckling versus crowd work",
      "Abi Clarke, who has almost a million followers on TikTok, thinks most comedians will be on Kay's side of the argument.",
      "Crucially though, the Bristolian notes: \"There's a difference betwen heckling and crowd work.",
      "\"With crowd work a comedian is inviting it, you're asking a question, you're wanting a chat and that's very different from somebody shouting out a random thing.",
      "\"Once is fine, or twice but if the comedian stops engaging with you or says that's enough, then at that point you're ruining it.\"",
      "New comic superstar Paul Smith made his name roasting crowds as an MC/compere in Liverpool, while Jimmy Carr is also famed for inviting and actively engaging with interruptions.",
      "For Clarke, heckling comes into its own when comics are workshopping new material. If someone joins in, it can create new \"source material\" that can be used as a fresh joke at the next gig.",
      "\"I've had hecklers who have interrupted multiple times but if they're engaging, joining in with what you're saying and being positive, I don't mind that, it's quite fun.",
      "\"If they're just derailing the gig because they like the sound of their own voice, then I think you should just chuck them out!",
      "\"'Garlic bread' - there's not much you can do with that.\"",
      "'Spontaneous moments'",
      "Clarke thinks if you're going to someone's headline show that they've honed and crafted - \"they've perfected the rhythm, set-up and punchline\" - then the time to interject has passed.",
      "\"I promise you, It will be a better show if they get to perform it how it's meant to be performed.\"",
      "The other time that heckling comes in handy, she says, is for promotional purposes online, as comics don't want to give away their best written material for free, when a great bit of crowd banter will show off their skills just as well.",
      "\"The ones we will post are the wonderful one-off spontaneous moments because they'll never happen again, so they won't ruin the show.\"",
      "She's \"quite lucky so far\", she says, having had only \"two or three horrible instances\" of bad heckling, and in those cases the audience had her back.",
      "\"It's easy to win an argument against a person that no one in the room likes.\"",

      "During these moments she finds other girls will supportively offer, \"no, it's fine\", which she really appreciates on a human level, but \"that's not what the joke is for!\".",
      "'Chaos and magic'",
      "Welsh comic Paul Hilleard, who won the BBC New Comedy Award last year, believes dealing with hecklers is \"part of the job\" and that Kay - a finalist in the same award in 1997 - may have \"thrown his toys out of the pram\" a bit, especially given he was playing to a room of \"people who love you\", he says.",
      "It's a bit different from some of the venues - or \"bear pits\" - that he plays as an up-and-coming comedian in Bristol, while also working as a teaching assistant.",
      "He sometimes performs in back rooms of pubs, where people don't always know that comedy is about to take place around them.",
      "\"Heckling is just part of the game, it's not fun... but it can be,\" he adds, mischievously.",
      "\"I've always been taught you've got to play the room. If it's chaotic, it doesn't matter if you've written the best 20 minutes ever, you've got to control that room of people who are intoxicated, and show them that you're funnier.\"",
      "Stag and hen dos, which tend to gravitate to comedy nights, can bring such chaos.",
      "Hilleard says he has spoken with other comics who agree that audiences \"are a little more feral\" since returning from the Covid lockdown, \"heightened\" by social media.",
      "\"One guy was on magic mushrooms, we found out, and it became part of the show, you lean into it,\" he says. \"That's the best thing you can do, until they become very abusive.\"",
      "\"There's a line,\" he continues. \"If you're ruining the show, that becomes the venue's problem.",
      "\"But it's our job as a comic to make that heckle part of the show, as that's where the magic is.\"",
      "He will perform at the Machynlleth Comedy Festival in May, and said there are \"tricks of the trade\" including certian \"jokes and comebacks\" that experienced comedians can lean on to deal with such situations.",
      "But it's all worth it, he says, \"if you can turn something on the fly that wasn't planned into something hilarous\".",
      "\"That's when people are like, 'oh my God, how did you do do that?'.\"",
      "Nine out of 10 hecklers, he believes, are not trying to ruin the show, they just think it's \"part of the fun\" or \"want to be acknowledged\".",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:01:45 GMT",
    "summary": "Archive documents show Manchester and Birmingham were considered as alternative settings for the soap.",
    "story": [
      "For 40 years, EastEnders has shown us life in a fictional community in east London - but from the iconic characters to the theme tune, could it all have been very different?",
      "In the early research stages of EastEnders, multiple cities were considered for the new soap, from Manchester to London to Birmingham, according to BBC archive documents.",
      "But one audience report recommended that a serial set in a working-class neighbourhood in London would probably have the most widespread appeal.",
      "This would also set the soap apart from other big series of the time, like Coronation Street (set in Greater Manchester), Emmerdale Farm (set in Yorkshire) and Crossroads (set in a Midlands motel).",
      "Though EastEnders creators Julia Smith and Tony Holland would eventually settle on the fictional Walford with its E20 postcode, at this point the show had a working title of East 8 - and it was to be based on a real street in the London borough of Hackney.",
      "In March 1984, Smith and Holland headed to Lanzarote for a working holiday where they created 23 character biographies, three years of storyline overviews and 20 detailed story breakdowns.",
      "Despite all their planning, however, some of the most important elements of EastEnders were last-minute accidents, including the iconic drum \"doof doofs\" in the theme tune, which have since become shorthand for the show's dramatic cliffhangers.",
      "\"In those days, if a theme tune was popular, you'd often release it as a single. So I would make longer versions of the themes to allow for that,\" says Simon May, the theme tune's composer, who would go on to write EastEnders-related singles for cast members Anita Dobson and Nick Berry.",
      "\"The longer version gets a bit more Cockney, so I asked the drummer to play something to transition into the end theme. He played those 'doof doofs' and Tony and Julia happened to be in the studio at the time.",
      "\"They said: 'We love that drum thing.'\"",
      "Another key ingredient of the early years of EastEnders also happened at the last minute: the pairing of the actors behind Angie and her bad-boy husband Den Watts, played by Leslie Grantham.",
      "After a read-through of the first six episodes, the producers thought that original Angie Watts actress Jean Fennell was not quite working in the role. Anita Dobson took on the character at the last minute.",
      "Actor and stuntman Derek Martin, who joined the soap 15 years later as Charlie Slater, explains he was also up for the role of Den.",
      "\"Leslie got it, and he was very good, he was the ladies' man, and I was more the hard man,\" the 91-year-old actor says.",
      "This pairing of Angie and Den proved popular with the public - and the Christmas Day 1986 episode that sees Den serve Angie divorce papers remains the only scripted programme to have been watched by more than 30 million people in the UK, according to Barb figures.",
      "'We might have something here'",
      "The first episode of EastEnders was broadcast on 19 February 1985, with 17 million people watching - making it the second most-watched episode on the BBC that week behind The Two Ronnies.",
      "This compared with the 18 million who watched the same week's Coronation Street.",
      "The episode started with a kick, as Den broke down a door to find the nearly dead body of Reg Cox (played by Johnnie Clayton) - and ended with a punch, as suspect number one in the attack, Nick Cotton (John Altman), put his fist through the glass of the Queen Vic doors.",
      "Though the press was quick to set up a rivalry between EastEnders and Coronation Street, the cast had their eye on another ITV soap.",
      "Actor Adam Woodyat, who played Ian Beale in that first episode, says: \"We were going out at the same time as Emmerdale Farm at 7pm. It felt like Emmerdale Farm gave us an absolute kicking in the ratings until they shifted us to half past seven.\"",
      "Newspapers of the time suggested reactions were mixed. A Sunday People poll of 600 viewers showed 56% of respondents didn't like the first episode, with complaints over \"coarse\" and \"bawdy\" dialogue.",
      "The Guardian, however, was more measured, with their critic Hugh Hebert predicting it would \"probably take a year before anyone knows whether the BBC has got it right\".",
      "The show would prove itself earlier than that. On 25 July 1985, the programme was the most-watched on the BBC that week. This coincided with the show's first blockbuster storyline that saw Michelle (played by Susan Tully) become pregnant by a mystery man, eventually revealed to be Den Watts.",
      "\"After the reveal of Den and Michelle,\" says Woodyat, \"that's when we started to realise we might have something here.\"",

      "In a new interview, Netflix's chief content officer Bela Bajaria said: \"I think it's really a bummer for the 100 incredibly talented people who made an amazing movie.\"",
      "Speaking to The Town podcast, Bajaria continued: \"If you look at the nominations, and all of this awards love that it's received, I think it's such a bummer that it distracted from that.",

      "After they were brought to light, Gasc\u00f3n said she was \"deeply sorry to those I have caused pain\", adding that she is not racist and that many of her comments had been taken out of context.",

      "\"A lot of people are reevaluating that... I do think it is raising questions for a lot of people about reevaluating that process.\"",
      "She highlighted the logistical difficulties of implementing a vetting process: \"I think you also have to [ask]: Are we going to actually look at the personal social media of tens of thousand of people, every single day around the world, [given the] amount of original film and TV and co-prods that we make and licence?",

      "Changing the promotional posters",
      "At this time of year, film studios take out advertisements intended to make a particular film more visible to awards voters.",
      "The movie will have already have had a separate promotional push at the time of its release, targeted at the public in the hope of securing high box office or streaming numbers.",
      "But the For Your Consideration (FYC) adverts which run during awards season are specifically intended to draw awards voters' attention to the categories the film has been nominated in at events such as the Baftas and Oscars.",
      "Previously, Gasc\u00f3n featured prominently in Netflix's publicity material, which reminded voters that she was nominated for best leading actress.",
      "But an updated FYC poster released last week almost entirely erased Gasc\u00f3n, instead making her co-stars Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Selena Gomez much more prominent.",
      "\"The shift suggests Netflix is trying to minimize Gasc\u00f3n's contributions so that the controversy around her remarks won't overshadow the film or the work of her co-stars and collaborators,\" suggested Variety's Clayton Davis.",
      "The CNN interview",
      "Gasc\u00f3n released several statements following the controversy, mostly via her social media accounts.",
      "But she also gave an emotional, hour-long sit-down interview to CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.",
      "It has since come to light that Gasc\u00f3n took part in the interview without the involvement or agreement of the film's PR team.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter said it had learned that the actress \"set up the interview on her own without the involvement of anyone working on the film, which was distributed by Netflix\".",
      "The fact that this line has been briefed to US journalists suggests Netflix is not only distancing itself from Gasc\u00f3n, but that the streamer's own PR team would not have signed off on such an interview being granted.",
      "Often, publicity teams advise a celebrity in crisis not to give too many interviews and statements, as it can keep a negative story alive for longer or even make the situation worse.",
      "Pulling out of events",
      "Gasc\u00f3n had been due to appear at several events in the final phase of awards season.",
      "These included the AFI Awards luncheon, the Critics Choice Awards, the Directors Guild of America Awards, the Producers Guild of America Awards, and the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.",
      "However, the actress pulled out of appearing as the turmoil continued.",
      "And that's not all. According to Variety, Netflix and the film's PR team have stopped talking directly with Gasc\u00f3n and are only communicating through an agent.",
      "The publication also reported the streamer \"is no longer covering expenses for her travel to the various awards shows or her styling for any appearances at these events\".",
      "It remains to be seen whether Gasc\u00f3n will attend the Oscars, which are scheduled to take place on 2 March.",
      "What happens to the 'Fab Five' Oscars format?",
      "Many film fans (ourselves included) love the so-called \"Fab Five\" format, which has been employed at some recent Oscars ceremonies.",
      "This sees five previous winners of a particular category take to the stage to present the latest winner with the same prize.",
      "For example, last year, Emma Stone was presented with the best actress trophy by previous winners Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Lawrence, Sally Field, Jessica Lange and Charlize Theron.",
      "Traditionally, this format sees each of the previous winners deliver a short speech, paying tribute to the current nominees, before revealing the winner.",
      "However, it's understood that the Academy has moved away from doing this in the acting categories this year, which means no actress will be asked to praise Gasc\u00f3n's performance from the stage.",
      "Despite speculation, the decision appears to have been unprompted by the recent controversy.",
      "Instead, Variety reports the Academy decided to ditch the fab five format for the acting categories several weeks ago, before the tweets came to light, and instead is deploying it in different categories this year, such as best director.",
      "How could this impact Gasc\u00f3n's co-stars",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez, a bonkers Spanish-language musical about a Mexican drug lord who changes gender, received 13 Oscar nominations, although it was not necessarily expected to be the biggest winner on the night.",
      "It has stiff competition in several categories, including best picture, but it was thought to be a frontrunner in a few in particular, such as best original song, and best supporting actress for Zoe Salda\u00f1a.",
      "It was widely thought Salda\u00f1a would run away with the trophy, not just for her acclaimed performance, but also because there is a lot of goodwill from voters because of her roles in box office smashes such as the Avatar and Marvel movies.",
      "After Gasc\u00f3n's tweets came to light, Salda\u00f1a said: \"It makes me really sad because I don't support [it], and I don't have any tolerance for any negative rhetoric towards people of any group.",
      "\"I can only attest to the experience that I had with each and every individual that was a part, that is a part, of this film, and my experience and my interactions with them was about inclusivity and collaboration and racial, cultural and gender equity. And it just saddens me.\"",
      "Later, Salda\u00f1a used her speech at the London Critics Circle Awards to tell the audience to be \"abstract with your idea of redemption\".",
      "Oscar voters and awards pundits will be watching forthcoming events such as the Bafta Film Awards and SAG Awards to see whether Salda\u00f1a can still follow through with her expected win.",
      "Meanwhile, director Jacques Audiard told Deadline he has avoided getting in touch with Gasc\u00f3n because \"right now she needs space to reflect and take accountability for her actions\".",
      "\"Very unfortunately, it is taking up all the space, and that makes me very sad,\" he said.",
      "\"It's very hard for me to think back to the work I did with Karla Sof\u00eda. The trust we shared, the exceptional atmosphere that we had on the set that was indeed based on trust.",
      "\"And when you have that kind of relationship and suddenly you read something that that person has said, things that are absolutely hateful and worthy of being hated, of course that relationship is affected. It's as if you fall into a hole. Because what Karla Sof\u00eda said is inexcusable.\"",
      "After his comments, Gasc\u00f3n posted on Instagram: \"Following Jacques' interview that I understand, I decided, for the film, for Jacques, for the cast, for the incredible crew who deserves it, for the beautiful adventure we all had together, to let the work talk for itself.\"",
      "She also reiterated her regret for her original tweets, saying that she wanted to \"sincerely apologise to everyone who has been hurt along the way\".",

      "Hollywood may be known as Tinseltown, a dream factory at the heart of the global entertainment industry. But nowadays crews are more likely to film in Atlanta, London, Toronto or Sydney than in Los Angeles.",
      "Cheaper labour and better tax breaks have lured producers away from the City of Angels for years. The wildfires, which killed at least 29 people and destroyed thousands of homes, have only added to this existential crisis.",
      "Now, many here are calling on the state - and studios and streaming services - to boost local production.",
      "\"The best thing the studios could do for fire relief is to bring work back for the rank and file LA film workers,\" says Mark Worthington, a production designer whose home burned down in Altadena.",
      "\"That's what we want.\"",
      "Mr Worthington had already been struggling to cope with the city's downturn, noting he hadn't set foot on an LA set in two years. Covid, labour strikes, and the inevitable end of the streaming boom had led many producers to try and save costs by skipping town - sometimes leaving the country altogether.",

      "Productions in the US decreased 26% last year compared to pre-strike levels in 2022, according to ProdPro, which tracks global production. In Australia and New Zealand, production was up 14% and in the UK it was up nearly 1%, with Canada up 2.8%.",
      "The loss clearly stings. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are a band synonymous with Los Angeles, with many love songs to the City of Angels. But a biopic about the band is being filmed in Atlanta, Georgia - which has become a major production hub due to its lucrative tax breaks - not LA.",
      "Before the fires, \"Survive until '25\" had become a kind of mantra for Mr Worthington and other filmmakers who hoped for a turnaround of fortune. Instead, their city went up in flames.",
      "\"It's crushing in terms of how you see yourself as a creative individual and just as a person, and then on top of that to have these fires,\" Mr Worthington says. \"This is adding a horrible other thing to pile on top of all the other difficulties and our own work situation over the last couple years.\"",

      "Mel Gibson, Jeff Bridges and other LA celebrities lose homes to wildfires",
      "'I have nothing to go back to' - LA fires heartbreak",
      "Hollywood's studios and streaming services have donated more than $70m (\u00a356m) to fire relief efforts and have turned the glitzy awards season parties and red carpets typical this time of year into major fundraisers.",
      "Many say these efforts are not enough and that Hollywood's biggest companies need to commit to filming in LA.",
      "But studios don't often make business decisions based on the greater good of workers in one city - ultimately, they care about the bottom line. The reality is LA is expensive and the vast majority of industry jobs here are union protected \u2013 so they come with high salaries and expensive health care and pensions.",

      "It's part of a grassroots campaign started by director Sarah Adina Smith and other filmmakers who want California to use its emergency powers to boost tax incentives for the next three years to make filming in LA more affordable and help heal Los Angeles. They also want studios to commit to making 10% more productions in Los Angeles.",
      "\"We need to bring production back to LA and get LA working again if we want to rebuild,\" says Ms Smith.",
      "Before the fires, California Gov Newsom had already proposed to more than double the tax credit the state offers to producers of films and TV shows that shoot in California \u2013 changing the annual credit from $330m to $750m, but that must be approved by the state legislature and might not come into effect until the summer.",
      "He says the incentives are good for the economy and that California's programme has generated more than $26bn in economic activity and supported more than 197,000 cast and crew jobs across the state.",
      "If passed, the subsidy would be the most generous offered by any US state except Georgia, which doesn't have a cap on the amount it gives to productions per year. Stay in LA wants the cap lifted now.",
      "President Donald Trump has also said he plans to make Hollywood great again with the help of actors Jon Voight, Mel Gibson, and Sylvester Stallone, who have been tapped to be \"special ambassadors\" for \"troubled Hollywood\".",
      "It's not yet clear what they have in mind - they did not agree to an interview - but several executives said the instability caused by the Trump administration's trade wars make risk-averse Hollywood studios nervous. The Canadian dollar recently hit 22-year lows making Canada even more attractive to Hollywood.",
      "On a rainy day more than a month after the fires, Mr Worthington, the production designer, and his partner Mindy Elliott, a film editor, inspected the remains of their home, wishing they'd taken some of their art when they evacuated. They marvelled that a cactus was regrowing next to where their SUV had melted.",
      "\"If only we'd had this rain in January,\" says Ms Elliott.",
      "Although he is critical that the tax breaks amount to \"corporate welfare\" for behemoth companies, Mr Worthington says they are a necessary evil if LA wants to compete - both Australia and the UK now have more lucrative tax breaks than California.",
      "Ms Smith, the co-founder of Stay in LA, likens the decline of Hollywood productions to the fall of Detroit, whose once formidable automotive industry collapsed, leaving much of the city desolate and impoverished.",
      "\"Once you ruin that infrastructure and that legacy, it's not so easy to build it back again,\" she says. \"If we let Hollywood die, it could be for good.\"",
      "Others think it's na\u00efve to think that any incentives will usher in a new Golden Age of Hollywood.",
      "Pointing out the melted remains of what used to be his piano and his drum set in the music studio of his incinerated Topanga Canyon home, composer Matthew Ferraro wipes away tears for what he and his wife have lost.",
      "His once spectacular hilltop home is now rubble and ash and Ferraro says he's still in shock, consumed with thoughts of where he will sleep on Tuesday, rather than his future in LA.",
      "\"I think it's wishful thinking for people who are still in love with, like yesteryear's dream of Hollywood, but that's just not how it works anymore,\" says Ferraro, who composed music for The Incredibles and The Minority Report among others.",
      "About a mile away, Jamie Morse's home also burned. Topanga Canyon has always attracted artists, musicians and dreamers - and Morse had just quit her sensible day job to devote 2025 to making it in Hollywood, working fulltime on her comedic writing and performing.",
      "She laughs when asked about the terrible timing - and says she's grieving along with everyone else in LA, but remains hopeful.",
      "\"Whether they're performers or studio execs - people love this city,\" says Ms Morse, who is now in an Airbnb temporary rental after staying at friends' homes with her dog between comedy gigs or classes with her improv troupe, The Groundlings.",
      "Ms Morse wishes she'd taken more sentimental things when she evacuated with her dog, like a Toronto Blue Jays T-shirt which reminded her of her grandfather and her native Canada. But she's astonished that some of her notebooks and journals survived with some of her comedy writing intact.",
      "\"Where an entire stone table is, is in pieces, is like, absolutely decimated, melted,\" she said. \"But pieces of paper survived\u2026 It's truly unbelievable.\"",
      "Does she think it's fate? A sign that she is meant to make it in Hollywood?",
      "\"I'm choosing to believe that this is a sign,\" she says, adding that there will be \"beautiful, creative things to come out of this very, very crappy time.\""

    "story": [
      "Rapper A$AP Rocky's assault trial is in full swing as his attorneys this week are mounting their defence against the charges that could derail his career.",
      "Pop star Rihanna, his partner with whom he shares two children, has been a repeated presence in the court as the trial delved into allegations that he pulled a gun out on his former friend and opened fire multiple times.",
      "The trial started late last month and will determine whether the rapper will face jail time on two charges of felony assault. He could face decades in prison.",
      "A$AP Rocky has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his lawyers have argued the weapon was a prop gun and his former friend is only after money.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the case.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky charged with?",
      "A$AP Rocky's assault trial began on 24 January in Los Angeles.",
      "The rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was charged with two felony assault charges relating to a 2021 shooting incident in the heart of Hollywood.",
      "Authorities allege A$AP Rocky and a former friend got into a heated discussion that turned violent and led to the rapper pulling out a gun and opening fire.",
      "Who is the accuser Terell Ephron?",
      "The victim in the case is fellow artist and childhood friend Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli. He is the star witness for prosecutors",
      "They were both part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective and have known one another since their time together at a New York high school.",
      "Their relationship eroded over time as A$AP Rocky's career took off and he became famous.",
      "It all led up to a disagreement between the pair in November 2021.",
      "Mr Ephron took the stand last week to describe their relationship and the moments of the alleged shooting.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky accused of doing?",
      "Authorities have said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November in 2021, a day after the pair got into a disagreement.",
      "They met outside a Hollywood hotel about a block from the iconic stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.",
      "Prosecutors say when the pair met things got physical. Mr Mayers is alleged to have whipped out a gun from his waistband and pointed it toward Mr Ephron, telling him \"I'll kill you right now\".",
      "Court documents outline that Mr Ephron told the rapper to fire the weapon, which Mr Mayers did not and instead started walking away.",
      "Mr Ephron followed behind and yelled at Mr Mayers about their disagreements, court documents show.",
      "That's when prosecutors allege Mr Mayers pulled out the gun again and opened fire.",
      "Court documents allege multiple bullets were fired, one of which is alleged to have grazed Mr Ephron's knuckles.",
      "Authorities say parts of the incident were captured on surveillance footage, including some footage that included audio of gunfire, although there is no video showing the shooting.",
      "Some of this footage has been played in court already for jurors.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky saying about the allegations?",
      "There are several key points of contention in the case: the weapon, police investigation and Mr Ephron's injuries.",
      "The rapper's lawyers have noted the weapon authorities say was the gun he pulled out was not usable - instead it was a prop weapon his security encouraged him to carry to ward off would-be attackers.",
      "His lawyers have also focused on Mr Ephron taking multiple days to report the incident to police, and how authorities found no trace of bullet casings or a shooting when they responded to the incident.",
      "Court documents detail that Mr Ephron returned to the scene later and gathered two shell casings he said he found in the area. He brought them when he reported the incident to police two days later.",
      "He also did not immediately go to hospital after the incident and instead sought medical treatment after flying back to New York.",
      "What's happened in court so far?",
      "Prosecutors finished presenting their case before jurors as to why they believe Mr Mayers is guilty.",
      "Prosecutors showed jurors footage of the incident, captured on surveillance, that included audio of gunfire but no video evidence showing the shooting itself.",
      "There were a number of tense and emotional exchanges, especially when Mr Ephron was on the stand and testified about being shot.",
      "At one point while on the witness stand, Mr Ephron called A$AP Rocky's attorney \"annoying,\" which led to a reprimand from the judge. Another tense moment came when A$AP Rocky screamed in court.",
      "Another associate of the pair, A$AP Twelvyy, was being questioned by prosecutors on the stand when they showed him a photo of Mr Mayers' bed with the letters \"AWGE\" emblazoned on furniture.",
      "When asked what the letters stood for, Mr Mayers interrupted and yelled out, \"Don't say!\"",
      "Twelvyy would only say, \"It means AWGE,\" which angered the prosecutor, who asked the judge to force the witness to be more forthcoming.",
      "Mr Mayers' defence attorney, Joe Tacopina, has asserted the case was one of \"extortion, plain and simple\".",
      "Mr Mayers' lawyer said Mr Ephron's claims were financially motivated and suggested that Mr Ephron sought monetary compensation in exchange for dropping the charges.",
      "The trial is nearly at its conclusion. Mr Tacopina told the judge on Monday that they expect to rest their arguments on Tuesday.",
      "After his defence is finished, both sides will be able to give their closing statements before a jury decides the rapper's fate.",
      "Will A$AP Rocky take the stand?",
      "The rapper waived his right to testify on Tuesday, meaning that he will not take the stand.",
      "Now, it is believed that the trial will conclude without comment from the famous rapper. Closing arguments are expected to begin on Thursday.",
      "The rapper is not legally obligated to testify, and it could have been a risky move. Taking the stand would have mean he would face questioning from prosecutors as well as his own lawyers.",
      "Speculation that he would speak at his own trial only arose when his attorney, Mr Tacopina, stated that the rapper was \"eager to tell his story\", and that \"he would love the opportunity to do so\".",
      "Had he testified, the rapper was expected to argue that the firearm involved in the 2021 fight was a starter pistol loaded with blanks, carried solely for security reasons.",
      "Could A$AP Rocky face prison time?",
      "Yes, the rapper could face up to 24 years in prison if found guilty in the trial, which is expected to go on for about three weeks.",
      "A panel of 12 jurors will decide his fate.",
      "Will Rihanna continue to be in court?",
      "Rihanna has continued to appear at the trial.",
      "Before the proceedings started, the rapper's lawyer had told the court that Mr Mayers had tried to keep his family away from all of this, but she has appeared multiple times during the trial to support him.",
      "At some points in the trial, she sat between the rapper's mother and sister in the courtroom, media reports indicate. The couple's two children have not appeared.",
      "During Rihanna's first appearance at the trial, news reporters and fans gathered outside the courthouse to try to catch a glimpse of the singer.",
      "She ended up using a non-public entrance used by judges and was already seated in the courtroom when media were allowed into the chamber.",
      "During jury selection, prosecutors questioned jurors about Rihanna and whether her connection to the case would affect their ability to deliver a fair verdict. While some described themselves as Rihanna fans, and many more had heard of Rihanna than A$AP Rocky, jurors said her presence in the courtroom would not influence their decision making.",
      "Rihanna's presence had attracted attention from jurors in a murder trial across the hall at the courthouse, with some commenting on her being so nearby.",
      "Rocky's trial is being televised, but Rihanna has sat out of view of cameras in the courtroom.",
      "A$AP Rocky's trial begins with prosecutors showing video of shooting",

      "\"I want to play their favourite song... but you know they love to sue,\" said Kendrick Lamar, a couple of minutes into his Super Bowl half-time show.",
      "Everyone knew what he was referring to. Not Like Us, his brutal takedown of rap rival Drake, was one of last year's breakout hits, earning one billion streams on Spotify and five Grammy Awards, including song of the year.",
      "But there were questions over whether Lamar would play it - or even could play it - at the Super Bowl, after Drake filed a defamation lawsuit for lyrics that branded him a sexual predator, which he denies.",
      "Lamar leaned into the dilemma, teasing the song over and over during his set, before finally giving the audience what they wanted.",
      "When the song finally played, Kendrick self-censored the most contentious lyric, in which he calls Drake a \"certified paedophile\".",
      "But he looked directly into the camera with a mischievous grin as he called out Drake's name; and left intact the song's notorious double-entendre: \"Tryin' to strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\"",
      "That lyric echoed around the Caesars Superdome in Louisiana, indicating that no amount of legal action could ever hope to diminish the song's popularity.",
      "In playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game in which the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 to deny them an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl.",
      "The performance was further heightened by the surprise appearance of tennis star Serena Williams, who performed the Crip Walk - a notorious Los Angeles dance move - as Lamar prowled the stage.",
      "Drake's lawyers are suing Lamar's record label Universal Music Group over the track, accusing it of trying to \"create a viral hit\" out of a song that made \"false factual allegations\" about the star.",
      "Sunday marked the first time that a solo rapper had headlined the Super Bowl, and Lamar brought an elaborate stage show, full of dancers, fireworks and special guests.",
      "But the rapper's lyrics have always explored the contradictions between ego and self-doubt, and his Super Bowl set put that conflict in the spotlight.",
      "He performed on a giant noughts and crosses board, flipping between introspective deep cuts (typically staged inside the Xs) and crowd-pleasing chart hits (which took place in the Os).",
      "Actor Samuel L Jackson, dressed as Uncle Sam, acted as emcee - berating Lamar when he became too self-indulgent, and praising his duets with R&B singer SZA.",
      "\"That's what I'm talking about,\" Jackson said, after the duo performed All The Stars, a ballad from the soundtrack to Marvel's Black Panther movie.",
      "\"That's what America wants, nice and calm.\"",
      "It was a caricature, critiquing the expectation that Lamar would tone down his act for the TV audience.",
      "\u201cToo loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\u201d scolded Jackson at one point - but Lamar wasn\u2019t prepared to compromise.",

      "And whatever Lamar performed, the energy was electrifying.",
      "Early highlights included Humble and DNA, both taken from the rapper's Pulitzer Prize-winning album DAMN, and whose tectonic beats rattled around the stadium.",
      "The set, which is available to watch on YouTube, also included Squabble Up, Man At The Garden and another Drake diss track, Euphoria.",
      "Unlike most Super Bowl performers, Lamar isn't much of a mover, but he had a charismatic swagger as he walked in step with his dancers; and clever staging gave the show momentum - especially on nervy, angular tracks like Peekaboo.",
      "SZA also gave the set a lift, with supple vocals and improbably flexible choreography that helped soften Lamar's edgier instincts.",
      "Not Like Us was the undoubted climax, but Lamar took a victory lap on the bouncy West Coast anthem TV Off, where he boasted, \"yeah, somebody gotta do it\".",
      "He was joined on stage by the song's producer, Mustard, who clutched a football while sporting the world's baggiest jeans - before Lamar pointed an imaginary remote control at the camera and intoned, \"Game Over\".",
      "For fans, it was a powerful performance, full of Easter eggs - including a snippet of the unreleased song Bodies.",
      "Casual viewers might have agreed more with Samuel L Jackson's plea for Lamar to keep it light; especially as some of his more densely-written lyrics were rendered unintelligible by the stadium's cavernous echo.",
      "And it was noticeable that Lamar omitted to play his civil rights anthem Alright, in a year where the NFL chose to remove the phrase \"end racism\" from the end zone of the football field.",
      "The phrase had been present at the Super Bowl since 2020, amid the Black Lives Matter protests - for which Alright had become the unofficial soundtrack.",
      "Many had expected Lamar to make a bigger statement, especially with President Donald Trump in attendance, but the star's performance remained resolutely uncontroversial - unless, of course, your name is Drake.",
      "On-stage protest",
      "Nonetheless, Lamar's show was sleek and streamlined - as many fans had expected, after audio of the backing track leaked on Thursday.",
      "The only interruption came at the climax of the 13-minute set, when a protester climbed on top of Lamar's black Buick GNX car and unfurled a combined Palestinian and Sudanese flag, before being tackled by security officers.",

    "story": [
      "Yu Hyuk was just nine years old when he started begging on the streets of North Hamgyong, one of the poorest provinces in North Korea, nestled along the northern border with China and Russia.",
      "Besides begging, he ran errands for soldiers and sold foraged mushrooms. Sometimes he stole food out of sheer hunger: once he snatched a lunchbox that sat unattended at an underground station. Inside was a scoop of spoiled rice.",
      "This was just \"part of everyday life\" for many North Koreans, he says, adding that his own life was so consumed with survival that it left little room for dreams.",
      "But dream he did. Later on this year, the 25-year-old will debut in the US as a member of a K-pop boy band.",
      "1Verse (pronounced \"universe\") is made up of five members: Hyuk, Seok who is also from North Korea, Aito from Japan, and Asian Americans Kenny and Nathan - all prefer to go by their first names. They are set to make history as the first K-pop boy band to debut with North Korean defectors.",
      "From scraps to rap",
      "Hyuk was born in a seaside village in Kyongsong county and raised by his father and grandmother, after his parents broke up when he was just four.",
      "Later, his mother fled the North to settle in the South and reached out to him in an attempt to get him to join her. But he refused as he was close to his father and did not want to leave him.",
      "Hyuk says his family was \"not extremely poor\" to begin with, but the situation quickly deteriorated after his parents separated. His father didn't want to work and his grandmother was too old, so Hyuk was left to his own devices to survive.",
      "Eventually, his father persuaded him to join his mother, and in 2013 Hyuk escaped from North Korea.",
      "It took months for him to arrive in the South, after going through several countries. He has chosen not to reveal specifics of the route, as he fears putting other future defectors at risk.",
      "Once in the South, he lived with his mother for just a year, before moving to a boarding school with his mum's financial support. However, he struggled to cope with South Korea\u2019s fiercely competitive education system, as Hyuk had barely finished primary school before his defection.",
      "Writing was the one thing he found solace in, he says.",
      "He started with short poems alluding to his past life in North Korea. \u201cI couldn\u2019t openly share what I\u2019d been through, but I still wanted to make a record of it.\u201d",
      "At first, Hyuk believed his story couldn\u2019t be understood by others, but was encouraged by friends and teachers in his school's music club - and eventually found his passion in rap.",
      "Growing up, music had been a luxury, let alone K-pop which was something he had barely heard of. But now, he channelled his thoughts of feeling lonely and of missing his father into music, referring to himself as \u201cthe loneliest of the loners\u201d - a line in Ordinary Person, a rap song he composed as a part of a pre-debut project.",
      "Hyuk graduated from high school aged 20. Afterwards, he worked part-time at restaurants and factories to support himself.",
      "But it was in 2018 when he was featured in an educational TV programme that his luck changed. His unique background and rapping talent caught the eye of music producer Michelle Cho, who was formerly from SM Entertainment, the agency behind some of K-pop's biggest acts. She offered him a spot in her agency, Singing Beetle.",
      "\"I didn't trust Michelle for about a year because I thought she was cheating me,\" Hyuk says, adding that defectors are often targeted by scams in the South.",
      "But gradually he realised that Ms Cho was \"investing way too much time and money\" for it to be anything but genuine.",
      "'I thought North Koreans might be scary'",
      "Kim Seok, 24, also defected and arrived in the South in 2019, though his experience was vastly different to that of Seok's.",
      "Coming from a relatively better-off family, Seok lived close to the border with China and had access to K-pop and K-drama through smuggled USBs and SD cards.",
      "Due to safety reasons, we are unable to reveal much more about his life in the North and how he came to the South.",
      "Both boys were described by Ms Cho as \"blank canvases\", adding that she had never encountered trainees quite like them.",
      "Unlike Aito and Kenny, who had been immersed in music and dance from an early age, Hyuk and Seok were complete beginners.",
      "\u201cThey had absolutely no grasp of pop culture,\" she said.",
      "But their ability to \u201cendure physical challenges\u201d astonished Ms Cho. They pushed through gruelling hours of dance practice with such determination that she was worried they were \u201coverdoing it\u201d.",
      "Apart from music and dance lessons, their training also covered etiquette and engaging in discussions, to prepare them for media interviews.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think they were used to questioning things or expressing their opinion,\u201d says Ms Cho. \u201cAt first, when a trainer asked the reasoning behind their thoughts, the only response was, \u2018Because you said so last time'.\u201d",
      "But after more than three years, Hyuk has made remarkable progress, she says.",
      "\"Now, Hyuk questions many things. For example, if I ask him to do something, he'll reply 'Why? Why is it necessary?' Sometimes, I regret what I've done,\" says Ms Cho chuckling.",
      "But what do the other two boys think of their bandmates?",
      "\u201cI was kind of afraid at first because North Korea has a hostile relationship with Japan. I thought North Koreans would be scary, but that turned out not to be true,\u201d says Aito, who at 20 is the youngest of the four.",
      "Kenny, who spent much of his life in the US, adds that there were also small cultural differences that have taken him time to get used to.",
      "\"Korean culture is very [communal] in that you eat together... that was a culture shock [to me]\", he said. \"I usually don't like eating with people, I prefer Netflix in my ear. But their joy comes from being collective.\"",
      "Late last year, the band added a fifth member, Nathan, an American of mixed Laotian and Thai heritage to the group.",
      "They aim to debut in the US later this year - a decision that the label hopes could attract more American fans.",
      "Playing one day - in North Korea?",
      "Dozens of K-pop groups make their debut each year and only a few, typically those managed by major labels, become popular.",
      "So it's still too early to say if 1Verse will go on to resonate with audiences. But Hyuk has big dreams, hoping that it might be possible one day for his fellow North Koreans to listen to his songs.",
      "With human rights activists often sending leaflets and USBs containing K-culture content via balloons and bottles towards the North, this may prove to be less of a pipe dream than it sounds, though Hyuk also has his worries.",
      "To avoid being seen as a vocal critic of North Korea, he refers to his homeland as \u201cthe upper side\u201d in interviews and avoids mentioning North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.",
      "Kim has in recent years been ratcheting up his crackdown on the inflow of K-culture. Since 2020, the consumption and distribution of such content has become a crime punishable by death.",
      "A rare video obtained by BBC Korean last year, believed to be filmed in 2022, shows two teenage boys publicly sentenced to 12 years of hard labour for watching and distributing K-dramas.",
      "One academic says it would cause a \"stir\" in North Korea should 1Verse's music become a hit.",
      "\"If a North Korean defector openly embraced their identity and went on to become a world-class activist, I think that would cause a stir in the North,\" said Ha Seung-hee, an academic specialising in music and media at Dongguk University's Institute of North Korean Studies.",
      "But his main motivation, Hyuk says, is to prove that defectors can be a success.",
      "\u201cMany defectors see an insurmountable gap between themselves and K-pop idols. It is hardly a career option for us,\" said Hyuk.",
      "\u201cSo if I succeed, other defectors might be encouraged [to] have even bigger dreams. That\u2019s why I am trying my hardest.\u201d"

      "As a young boy, film editor Nick Emerson's fascination with 1970s American political thrillers, and watching the unfolding peace talks in Northern Ireland, set him on a path that would lead to him working on one of the most acclaimed films of last year.",
      "Conclave, starring Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci and Isabella Rossellini, is leading this year's Bafta nominations, receiving nods in 12 categories, including Best Editing.",
      "The film is also thought to be a strong contender for the best picture award at next month's Oscars, and several of its stars, and Emerson, could also be in contention for individual prizes.",
      "Growing up in Lisburn, County Antrim, Emerson told BBC News NI that the talks which brought about the Good Friday Agreement gave him an appetite for this depiction of the election of a new pope, and the skills to put it together.",
      "\"Working in the BBC newsroom at the start of my career was a really exciting place to be,\" he said.",
      "\"There were a lot of peace talks and a lot of news.\"",
      "He describes Conclave - which follows a gossipy and scheming group of cardinals as they select the new Pope - in similar terms.",
      "\"It's essentially about the political machinations that go on... people with competing interests and competing ideologies.\"",
      "Emerson moved through the media industry, inspired by his experience in the BBC Newsroom in Belfast.",
      "\"I found myself doing factual TV and now feature films. Its the process, that's the joy of it for me.\"",
      "Conclave opens with the death of the Pope, prompting cardinals to gather in Rome to select a new head of the Catholic Church.",
      "But it comes with all the skullduggery, wheeling and dealing, and conspiracy one would expect, as the frontrunners try to improve their chances of becoming the Vicar of Christ.",

      "It's not the first time a papal conclave has been depicted on screen, and though the real world process is shrouded in mystery, there has been a number of notable attempts to dramatise what goes on.",
      "'Crisis of faith'",
      "Emerson told BBC News that he and Edward Berger - the acclaimed German-Austrian film-maker whose 2022 adaptation of All Quiet on the Western Front was nominated for nine Academy Awards - aspired to make something that would replicate the 70s thrillers they grew up on.",

      "Kendrick Lamar's show-stopping performance at Super Bowl on Sunday was, for many, a victory lap following his knock-out blow in a long-running beef with fellow rapper Drake.",
      "The Compton star's entire half-time set seemed to swiftly build to a performance of Not Like Us, his Grammy-winning takedown of Drake which was one of last year's biggest hits... but is also now the subject of a potential libel case brought by the Canadian.",
      "Drake was performing in Australia on Sunday, dishing out cash to several of his fans at a Melbourne show, before the whole world tuned in to watch his rival.",
      "The origins of the argument go back more than decade. But here's a quick reminder of where we are now and how we got here over a heated 12 months:",
      "'The big three'",
      "In March last year, producer and former Drake collaborator Metro Boomin' and rapper Future released a collaborative album called We Don't Trust You.",
      "Hidden in the tracklisting was a song called Like That with an uncredited verse by Kendrick Lamar... and it was explosive.",
      "In it, Lamar took aim at rapper J Cole's previous claim - that himself, Kendrick and Drake were \"the big three\" - proclaiming: \"[forget] the big three - it's just big me\".",
      "After years of tension, the fuse had been lit.",
      "Three become two",
      "Soon after, Drake appeared to address Kendrick's verse at a concert in Florida.",
      "He told the crowd: \"I know that no matter what, it's not a [person] on this earth that could ever [expletive] with me in my life!\"",
      "Two weeks later, J Cole offered his own reply to Kendrick's verse, on a track called 7 Minute Drill, but he soon realised it had been a huge \"mis-step\".",
      "Speaking on stage at the Dreamville Festival in North Carolina, he apologised for the song, praised Lamar's back catalogue and asked for forgiveness.",
      "Boiling point",
      "Drake then released a song called Push Ups (Drop and Give Me 50), in which he took aim at Lamar's height, calling him a midget (he's 5ft 4in tall) and a record label puppet who's forced to collaborate with pop artists.",
      "\"Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty / Then we need a verse for the Swifties,\" he cajoled.",
      "He also took issue with Lamar's position in the hip-hop hierarchy, suggesting other artists had overtaken him.",
      "More rappers, including Kanye West and Rick Ross got drawn into the feud. But Drake's attention was solely focused on Lamar.",
      "The Toronto star goaded his US adversary by dropping yet another diss track called Taylor Made Freestyle, which suggested Lamar was too cowardly to release music in the same week as Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department.",

      "Titled Euphoria (a reference to the HBO show where Drake serves as an executive producer), it saw him brand Drake as \"predictable\", a \"master manipulator\" and a \"habitual liar\",  while calling his sparring partner's parenting skills into question.",
      "\"Let me say I'm the biggest hater,\" he rapped. \"I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress.\"",
      "Less than 72 hours later, he followed up with a second song called 6:16 in LA.",
      "In it, he claimed that someone inside Drake's organisation was leaking damaging information.",
      "\"You must be a terrible person/ Everyone inside your team is whispering that you deserve it.\"",
      "Families embroiled",
      "In May, Drake shot back with a song called Family Matters, which took the feud to new heights.",
      "On the track, he speculated that Lamar might be a perpetrator of domestic abuse (the star has never faced such an allegation).",
      "Within 20 minutes, Lamar retaliated with a third diss track, Meet The Grahams, which opened with the ominous warning: \"You [messed] up the minute you called out my family's name\".",
      "Each verse was addressed to one of Drake's closest family members, listing the rapper's supposed failures.",
      "Among the claims, he said Drake had secretly fathered second child, and was addicted to gambling, sex and drugs.",
      "Drake responded on Instagram by asking whoever had his \"hidden daughter\" to hand her back, adding that Lamar's claims were a \"shambles\".",
      "But the Californian wasn't finished and he dropped a fourth diss track, Not Like Us, in which he accused Drake of having relationships with underage women.",
      "\"Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young / Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor,\" he rapped.",
      "Drake hit back a day later, angrily denying the accusations and daring Lamar to reveal proof.",

      "Club hit",

      "It went on to earn one billion streams on Spotify and later five Grammy Awards, at last month's ceremony, including song of the year.",
      "Things took a darker turn, when a security guard outside Drake's house was shot although there is no proof it was connected to the rappers' feud. However, the vandalism of Drake's OVO shop in London apparently was.",
      "At one star-studded gig in Los Angeles in June, which was intended as a show of unity for the West Coast rap fraternity, Lamar played his biggest diss track five times.",
      "Drake sues record label",
      "Fast forward to January this year, and Drake decided to sue the Universal Music Group (UMG) for defamation and harassment, over its release of Not Like Us.",
      "In papers filed in New York, Drake's lawyers accused the record label of launching \"a campaign to create a viral hit\" out of a song that made the \"false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal paedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response\".",
      "In response, Universal, which has been Drake's label for more than a decade said his claims were not only untrue but \"illogical\".",
      "It also accused the star of trying to \"silence\" Lamar, who shares the same label, by taking their rap battle to the courts.",
      "\"Throughout his career, Drake has intentionally and successfully used UMG to distribute his music and poetry to engage in conventionally outrageous back-and-forth 'rap battles' to express his feelings about other artists,\" the label said.",
      "\"He now seeks to weaponise the legal process to silence an artist's creative expression and to seek damages from [Universal] for distributing that artist's music.\"",
      "Super Bowl show",
      "Which brings us to the Super Bowl. A couple of minutes into his half-time show, Lamar said: \"I want to play their favourite song... but you know they love to sue.\"",
      "In the build-up to the big event, there had been questions over whether he would, or even could play it, legally-speaking.",
      "Lamar leaned into the dilemma, teasing the song during his set, before finally giving the audience what they wanted.",
      "When the song finally played, Kendrick self-censored the most contentious lyric. But he looked directly into the camera with a mischievous grin as he called out Drake's name; and left intact the song's notorious double-entendre: \"Tryin' to strike a chord and it's probably A minor.\"",
      "That lyric echoed around the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, indicating that no amount of legal action could ever hope to diminish the song's popularity.",
      "In playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game, as well as the likes of Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z, Taylor Swift, Sir Paul McCartney and Stormzy who were inside the stadium.",
      "The performance was further heightened by the surprise appearance of tennis star Serena Williams, who reportedly once dated Drake and whose name seemingly appears in the lyrics of the song in question.",
      "Williams, a Compton kid like Kendrick, performed the Crip Walk - a notorious Los Angeles dance move - as the headliner prowled the stage.",
      "In a review of the gig, the Guardian said the Pulitzer prize-winning rapper \"delivered the final blow to his diss track nemesis\".",
      "While over in the US, Variety noted how Lamar had quite literally declared \"game over\" in the battle.",
      "On Monday, Lamar announced a joint UK and Europe stadium tour with SZA, who joined him on-stage on Sunday night, which will take in Glasgow, Birmingham, London and Cardiff from July this year. Drake does not currently have any UK tour dates scheduled for 2025."

      "But \"Chitlin' Circuit\" might raise some questions in your mind.",
      "What's the Chitlin' Circuit?",
      "From the late 1880s until the 1960s, so-called Jim Crow laws enforced segregation against black Americans and saw them treated as second-class citizens.",
      "It meant that they were separated from white people - often prevented from living in certain neighbourhoods, forced to attend different schools and banned from public spaces.",
      "During this era, black musicians and performers created their own network of live performance venues across the United States.",
      "Known as the Chitlin' Circuit, it took its name from \"Chitterling\" - a dish made with pig's intestines popular in the south, where Jim Crow laws were most prevalent.",
      "Venues were considered safe and acceptable spaces for black musicians, comedians and audiences and gave many pioneering performers a platform to hone their craft.",
      "Almost every notable black musician of the time graced the circuit at some point, including stars such as Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross, Tina Turner, Jimi Hendrix and James Brown.",

      "\"They were on the road all the time.\"",
      "Prof Bay says the presence of the circuit was also \"very helpful to black communities\".",
      "Performers were drawn to \"black vacation spots\" and the theatres at those locations, Prof Bay says.",
      "\"This would in turn help the careers of these entertainers,\" she says.",
      "\"It was one of the more successful segregation-era businesses.\"",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 has often paid tribute to black performers, and Prof Bay feels the singer's Texas roots may have played a role in that.",
      "\"[It] was very much a segregated state, so this would be something that would be a very direct reference in terms of where she grew up and how she thinks about American history.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 06:38:57 GMT",
    "summary": "Spending on the NHS has been going up for decades and is set to rise further. BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers.",
    "story": [
      "The amount of money the UK spends on health, predominantly on the NHS, has been rising for decades.",
      "And as the UK population ages and people demand access to new medicines and treatments, there is every likelihood that the national bill will continue to grow.",
      "So how much could the NHS ultimately end up costing the nation? And is it possible to get better value for the money we collectively spend?",
      "BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers.",
      "How much do we spend on health?",
      "Shortly after the NHS was founded, in 1949-50, total UK health spending was around \u00a317bn in today's money.",
      "By 2023\u201324 it had grown to \u00a3226bn.",
      "Health spending per person in 2022-23 was around \u00a33,300 in England and Scotland, \u00a33,600 in Wales and \u00a33,500 in Northern Ireland.",
      "In the Autumn Budget last year, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced an additional \u00a326bn a year for the English health budget by 2025-26, which will automatically increase the resources available to the devolved nations.",
      "As a share of the overall economy - or GDP - spending on health has massively increased over the past 70 years.",
      "In 1949-50, health spending was only 3.6% of GDP. In 2023-24, it had more than doubled to 8.1% of GDP, after peaking at more than 10% in the Covid pandemic.",
      "Health spending jumped in the pandemic due to the costs of vaccinations and the \"test and trace\" programme.",
      "Around 80% of total health spending is funded by the government in the UK, mainly going to the NHS. The other 20% comes through private insurance schemes or out-of-pocket costs.",
      "That means health spending as a share of total government spending has also considerably increased.",
      "In the middle of the 1950s, health accounted for around \u00a31 in every \u00a38 the government spent.",
      "Today it's roughly \u00a31 in every \u00a33.",
      "How does that compare to other countries?",
      "Despite that surge in health spending in recent decades, the UK is by no means an outlier among rich countries.",
      "In 2022, using comparable data on public health spending, the UK was spending around 9.3% of GDP.",
      "That was higher than Canada (7.9%) and Italy (6.8%) as well as the EU average, but less than Germany (10.9%) and France (10.2%).",
      "The US was the real outlier, spending 14.1% of GDP on health, largely because America has a private insurance system with few of the cost controls of other nations.",
      "And those countries have, like the UK, seen health spending rise considerably in recent decades, driven up by growing demand for new medical treatments and ageing populations.",
      "What's going to happen to NHS spending in future?",
      "Last year, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the government's official forecaster, said there was every likelihood there would be continued upward pressure on UK public health spending, citing those same factors: an ageing population and more demand for new medicines and treatments.",
      "It also cites rising ill health among the population as one of the contributors to rising spending, albeit not the dominant one.",
      "The amount of health spending on an individual rises dramatically as they grow older. Average annual spending per person on those aged 45 is around \u00a32,000. For those aged 85 it is \u00a313,000 a year.",
      "The OBR projects that the proportion of the population aged 65 and over will rise from around one in five today to one in four by 2070.",
      "As people's incomes grow, research suggests they are typically willing to spend more of those incomes on healthcare, which in the UK is done mainly through the taxpayer-funded NHS.",
      "In its central forecast, the OBR projected UK public healthcare spending will rise by around 3% every year, after adjusting for inflation. This would be broadly in line with average growth over recent decades, although the rate has fluctuated under different governments.",
      "The OBR estimates this trend would add up to roughly an extra 1% of GDP going on public health spending every decade going forward.",
      "That would take public health spending from around 8% of GDP in 2024-25, up to 14.5% of GDP by 2073-74, equivalent to around \u00a3180bn in today's money.",
      "However, this would also depend on the long term growth rate of the economy. The OBR assumes public health spending will grow roughly twice as fast as the overall economy.",
      "If that path of spending transpired, it would also likely mean health spending accounting for an even larger share of total government public service spending.",
      "How do we get better value for money from health spending?",
      "Many politicians argue it's important for the NHS to deliver higher levels of productivity, in other words, to spend money more efficiently in order to keep the national bill under control.",
      "Productivity growth in the NHS has long lagged behind productivity growth in the rest of the UK economy.",
      "Last year, the OBR looked at what would happen if NHS productivity grew faster than currently expected in the coming decades.",
      "This, the OBR said, could curb the overall rise in public health spending. It might rise only to 11% of GDP by 2074, rather than to 14.5%.",
      "The recent indications of productivity growth in the NHS, however, are unclear.",
      "The latest estimates from the Office for National Statistics are that in the second half of 2024 NHS measured \"inputs\" - mainly in the form of more doctors and nurses hired - were 32% higher than they were before the pandemic in 2019.",
      "But measured \"outputs\" - things like operations completed and patients discharged - were only up by 7%.",
      "This meant that UK public sector health productivity was still around 19% lower than it was five years previously - and showing no signs of sustained growth.",
      "However, measuring productivity in the public services is far from simple and the ONS has stressed that these statistics are still only \"in development\".",
      "Other estimates from NHS England and the Institute for Fiscal Studies - the independent economic research institute - point to an improvement in productivity in hospitals in England more recently, suggesting a corner might have been turned in the delivery of health services after the shock of the pandemic.",
      "But regardless of the statistical discrepancy, most experts agree that improving productivity in the health sector in the medium and long term is an important objective. And the extent to which it is delivered will play a key part in determining how much the NHS ends up costing the nation in the coming years.",

      "The UK and US have a \"mutual interest\" in negotiating an exemption for the UK from President Trump's planned export tariffs on steel, the business secretary has said.",
      "Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC the impact of the 25% tariffs which could come into force in March \"would be negative for ourselves, it would be negative for the US as well.\"",
      "Speaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, he said the UK was in a different trading position to other nations and could offer \"very specialised\" steel and aluminium exports that the US needs, such as submarine casings made in Sheffield.",
      "Reynolds' comments on the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme came after the government announced a \u00a32.5bn cash injection into the UK steel industry.",
      "President Donald Trump has said the tariffs would be enforced \"without exceptions or exemptions\".",
      "Reynolds was asked about 2,000 jobs under threat at British Steel's Scunthorpe plant, where there is a plan to close blast furnaces.",
      "While he said that he would expect some guarantees on jobs if the government was investing in the industry, he accepted that there would be a \"reduction in head count.\"",
      "The government's Plan for Steel will include measures that seek to bring down the cost of production and encourage the use of domestic steel in infrastructure projects.",
      "The idea is to protect UK steel from \"unfair trading practices abroad\", including being undercut by cheaper suppliers.",
      "US President Donald Trump's saying he would impose a 25% tariff on all steel imports from 12 March is something the UK sector fears would cost it millions in trade.",
      "Reynolds launched a consultation on the Plan for Steel to look at long-term issues facing the industry, after committing to provide up to \u00a32.5bn in support.",
      "Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the \"uncertainty\" the steel industry faced due to US tariffs was something the government \"has been entirely silent on when instead they should be talking to the US, our closest trading partner\".",

      "These include:",

      "The UK is not a big supplier of steel to the US, with the country accounting for about 10% of British steel exports.",
      "But there are concerns within the industry the tariffs might not just hinder exports to the US, but also lead to excess steel being \"dumped\" in the UK.",
      "This could occur if other countries no longer exporting to the US decide to offload steel at cheaper prices, which could potentially lead to UK steelmaking businesses being undercut.",
      "The government hopes its plan will secure jobs in the UK's steel industry and secure its future.",
      "Financial support could benefit Scotland and areas such as Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, Rotherham in South Yorkshire and Redcar in North Yorkshire \"which have a strong history of steel production\", the DBT said.",
      "Help will be available through the National Wealth Fund, which partners the government with the private sector and local authorities to finance infrastructure and other projects.",
      "The DBT said it was \"wasting no time\" supporting UK steel, pointing to the government's backing of expanding Heathrow Airport, which it said would require 400,000 tonnes of steel.",
      "The UK steel industry has faced heavy job losses in recent years.",
      "Tata Steel said it was replacing traditional blast furnaces with an electric arc furnace at its largest UK site in Port Talbot, Wales. Traditional steelmaking at the site ceased in September, resulting in 2,800 job cuts.",
      "British Steel announced in 2023 it would close blast furnaces in Scunthorpe, and unveiled plans to roll out an electric arc furnace, which requires fewer workers to keep it going, with 3,000 jobs expected to be axed.",
      "The GMB union said the government's plan to support the \"beleaguered\" steel industry provided \"desperately needed\" funding after \"years of dithering\".",

      "Griffiths said he looked forward to seeing a detailed plan, but added \"a clear part must be steps to reduce the cost of energy which is placing an intolerable strain on UK steel\"."

    "title": "The Chancellor and her expenses before she became an MP",
    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 13:07:36 GMT",
    "summary": "BBC News has learnt that there was an expenses investigation into Rachel Reeves, and two other senior managers, when she worked at HBOS.",
    "story": [
      "Rachel Reeves has had a difficult start to her ministerial career.",
      "As well as Labour's new chancellor taking on the challenges of the UK economy, she has faced tricky questions about her past.",
      "They began with scrutiny of her online CV late last year.",
      "On the professional networking site LinkedIn, the Chancellor of the Exchequer claimed to have worked as an economist at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) immediately before becoming an MP.",
      "One of those who challenged it was a retired former colleague, Kev Gillett.",
      "In a public post on LinkedIn, which he asked followers to share, he wrote: \"Back in 2009 Rt Hon Rachel Reeves worked 3 levels below me. Just facts. She was a Complaints Support Manager at LBG/HBOS. Not an Economist. #factcheck.\"",
      "In fact it emerged that she had worked in a managerial role within the bank's complaint handling department and her LinkedIn profile was updated to remove the claim.",
      "Rachel Reeves's online CV exaggerated how long she spent working at the Bank of England",
      "Gillett also made another claim about Reeves's time at the bank from 2006 to 2009, writing that she: \"Nearly got sacked due to an expenses scandal where the 3 senior managers were all signing off each others expenses.\"",
      "Reeves's team vigorously denied the allegations.",
      "However, Labour's imminent victory in last summer's general election prompted a post on a private Facebook group for former HBOS employees that BBC News has seen asking if anyone remembered Reeves.",
      "One former employee replied: \"the expenses dept certainly do!\"",
      "Several others made reference to Reeves being investigated over her expenses spending.",
      "BBC News has been seeking the truth behind these suggestions, speaking to more than 20 people, many of whom were former colleagues, and gaining access to receipts, emails and other documents.",
      "We have learnt that there was an expenses investigation into Reeves and two other senior managers.",
      "A detailed six-page whistleblowing complaint and dozens of pages of attached evidence, which we have seen, raised concerns that the three managers were using the bank's money to \"fund a lifestyle\" with allegedly inappropriate spending on dinners, events, taxis and gifts, including for each other.",
      "We have not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was. Indeed it may not have concluded.",
      "But the initial part of the investigation, which was conducted by Internal Audit at the request of the bank's risk department, found that the three managers appeared to have broken the rules and the whistleblower's allegations were substantiated, according to a senior source with knowledge of the investigation.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said the Chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.",
      "Banking career",
      "Reeves was in her 20s and trying to become an MP when she took up a job at Halifax Bank of Scotland in West Yorkshire in 2006.",
      "The role required her to move north from London, where she had unsuccessfully stood as Labour's parliamentary candidate in what had been a safe Conservative seat.",
      "She initially worked in the mortgage department, but in late 2007 moved to become Head of Business Planning in the Customer Relations department, which handled complaints.",
      "Her career at HBOS coincided with what would prove to be a tumultuous time for the bank.",
      "The global financial crisis which began in late summer of 2007 would force the sector to embark on a massive programme of job cuts and cost savings.",
      "In September 2008, HBOS itself came close to collapse, requiring a government-brokered takeover by Lloyds and an emergency bailout which would total \u00a320.5bn of taxpayers' money.",
      "It was shortly after this near-collapse, by early 2009, that a whistleblower from her department raised concerns about the spending habits of Reeves and two other managers, one of whom was Reeves's boss.",
      "Reeves says she won't let critics get her down",
      "MPs raise questions about Rachel Reeves's CV",
      "Rachel Reeves: Playing Labour's first big gambit",
      "Before this, in late 2008, a memo was circulated to Reeves and others which called for tighter cost control in the department.",
      "Written by a planning and strategy manager, the document, \"Financial Risk Control within Customer Relations\", raised concerns about \"spending on travel\" and on corporate spending cards, including Motivation cards which were used to reward staff.",
      "It laid out proposals to \"improve cost controls\" which included monthly discussions with Reeves and another of the senior managers who the whistleblower claimed had mis-used expenses to \"give visibility of claims, invoices, Thanks card use and reports\".",
      "Separately, Reeves was emailed in mid-December 2008 about proposals for a presentation setting out how much had been spent on Motivation cards, recognising top performers and on taxi travel, to \"focus attention on particular aspects of travel that are costly and perhaps need more consideration\".",
      "Reeves replied to say that she was not sure a \"huge analysis\" was needed and she wanted to see the papers before they went any further.",
      "Whistleblower complaint and investigation",
      "The whistleblower's complaint submitted by early 2009 was a six-page document laying out a range of concerns about an alleged spending culture in the Customer Relations department.",
      "It focused on the behaviour of three individuals: Reeves, Reeves's boss, and another senior manager in the department. Reeves's boss, who we are not naming, was responsible for signing off the expenses of the other two managers.",
      "The report and attached receipts and other documents seen by BBC News show Reeves was accused of spending hundreds of pounds on handbags, perfume, earrings and wine for colleagues, including one gift for her boss. Concern was also expressed about her spending on taxis and on a Christmas party. The whistleblower believed the spending to be excessive.",
      "After a call to the whistleblowing hotline, the whistleblower was instructed to hand in a physical copy of their report and supporting evidence, two sources said.",
      "A separate source, who contacted BBC News themselves in the wake of an article on the furore around Reeves's CV last year, was also aware that someone had blown the whistle on Reeves and another colleague.",
      "The report was passed to the bank's risk department and, at their request, was taken on by the Internal Audit department.",
      "A source who worked in risk at the bank told us: \"Given the nature of the allegations \u2013 claiming expenses for things you wouldn't normally claim expenses for \u2013 and the relative seniority of the individuals, the matter was referred for investigation by a team outside of that department.\"",
      "The Internal Audit department, which had access to expenses claims and sign-offs, then assessed the complaint and supporting documents, according to two sources.",
      "It found that there was evidence of apparent wrongdoing by the three senior managers including Reeves, a senior source with direct knowledge of the investigation told BBC News.",
      "Internal Audit completed its involvement in the investigation and passed its findings to an investigative part of the Risk department in around April 2009. The normal process would then have been for the managers to be interviewed about the allegations. There would then be an assessment of potential disciplinary action if necessary.",
      "However it does not appear that this next interview stage took place, or that the investigation ever reached a formal conclusion. Reeves insisted she was never interviewed, as did her boss, who said she was \"not aware of an expenses probe and my departure was not related to any alleged investigation\". The other senior manager declined to comment.",
      "There is no evidence of which we are aware that the bank's internal investigation was completed, or that there was ever a concluding finding of any wrongdoing.",
      "Reeves left the bank in May 2009, as did her boss. The other senior manager was on sick leave in May and never returned to work at the bank.",
      "There is no suggestion any of the departures were linked to the investigation or spending issues and a spokesman for Reeves said the Chancellor left the bank on good terms.",
      "They also provided a statement from the lawyer who provided legal advice on the compromise agreement - a voluntary legal document ending an employee's employment - she signed on her departure.",
      "He said it was a \"standard-style agreement adopted by the company when a mutually agreed exit was made during the bank's restructure\".",
      "\"Absolutely no allegations of wrongdoing or misconduct were mentioned by the HBOS HR team during this process,\" he said.",
      "Expenses allegations",
      "What lay behind the whistleblower's complaint and the grumbles of other colleagues was unhappiness relating to several different areas of spending.",
      "One concern was the use of bank payment cards to pay for Christmas and birthday gifts.",
      "\"A culture developed among senior managers in Customer Relations where gifts were given freely to direct reports  - both upwards and downwards,\" one former colleague of Reeves claimed.",
      "\"[They had] a very cavalier attitude regarding the budget in the department.\"",
      "Reeves and the other senior managers had both a corporate credit card and another payment card known as a 'Motivation' or 'Thanks' card.",
      "The Motivation card was intended to be used to reward high-performers for good work.",
      "There was guidance about its use. In February 2008 a memo instructed HBOS employees on the correct use of Motivation cards, which were widely used within the Customer Relations department.",
      "It stated that the cards were to be used to \"reward/acknowledge colleagues who have gone the extra mile\".",
      "Suggested gifts included \"chocolates, flowers, wine, vouchers or you could simply log on and send a free e-card to say 'Thanks' for a job well done\", the memo said.",
      "It warned that managers would be \"responsible for all transactions on your card and will be held accountable if spending on your statement cannot be verified\".",
      "Spending in this area was scrutinised because the company incurred tax on it.",
      "The memo doesn't explicitly prohibit Christmas and birthday gifts.",
      "But 11 former employees told us they had never heard of colleagues being bought birthday gifts with the bank's money, and believed that doing so was in breach of the rules. Several said any birthday gifts were bought with their own money.",
      "However, one ex-staff member, Jane Wayper, a former HR business partner who was given permission to speak to us by Reeves's team, claimed that \"birthday gifts and Christmas presents could be purchased using Motivation cards\" and \"staff were encouraged to do so for their teams\".",
      "Reeves bought birthday presents for colleagues with HBOS's money throughout her time in Customer Relations, receipts show, with purchases including wine and cosmetics. Some were bought using a Motivation card, while others were reimbursed through an expenses claim.",
      "She also spent \u00a3152 on a handbag and perfume as a present for her boss using the bank's money, according to the whistleblower's report. The present was a joint gift from Reeves and one of the other managers who was later investigated alongside her.",
      "And she bought earrings as a present for her PA, which she claimed back on expenses.",
      "Her PA, Linda Barrowclough, said she had received Christmas and birthday gifts from Reeves but had assumed they were \"personal gifts [and] they'd have come out of her own pocket\".",
      "Reeves also used her Motivation card to spend more than \u00a3400 on a leaving meal for a colleague, which the whistleblowing complaint claimed was not a permitted use.",
      "Christmas gifts",
      "The situation around Christmas gifts, which Reeves also bought for her PA and others, was more complicated.",
      "That's because, according to internal bank guidance we have seen, these could be bought on expenses providing they were small gifts of \u00a325 or less and they were not bought using the Motivation card.",
      "The \u00a325 limit was based on tax advice as anything more substantial would attract tax.",
      "It appeared to her colleagues that Reeves had broken these rules.",
      "But there does appear to have been confusion about the policy. We have also seen emails showing that Reeves was encouraged by her boss to buy more expensive Christmas presents, and to pay for them with her Motivation card.",
      "In late October 2008, Reeves's manager wrote that \"after checking with other departments, it looks like the standard practice of buying\u202fChristmas\u202fgifts for direct reports using motivation bank will continue this year\", emails seen by the BBC show.",
      "She suggested spending \u00a350 to \u00a375 per person on the presents.",
      "A reminder titled \"further clarity\" about how to buy Christmas gifts and how much to spend was circulated by another HBOS employee in early December, emails show.",
      "Reeves and the other managers who were later investigated were all among the recipients of this email confirming the rules on Christmas gifts.",
      "While seasonal gifts, such as at Christmas, were allowed, the managers were explicitly told they could not use Motivation cards for these purchases. The cost of these \"trivial\" gifts was also not allowed to exceed \u00a325, in line with\u202fHMRC guidance, the email said.",
      "This is because rewards for performance at work are taxable whereas seasonal gifts such as those given for Christmas, providing they are not too costly, are exempt.",
      "Replying to the email, Reeves wrote that she didn't understand why the \"goal posts are shifting\" and said she had already ordered and paid for her presents using \"Motivation Bank/Thanks, and I do not intend to cancel them,\" claiming this would cost more time and money.",
      "A colleague responsible for finance acknowledged that the message on paying for Christmas gifts hadn't always been clear but said: \"I don't believe that the goalposts are being moved.\"",
      "Receipts show that gifts bought by Reeves at Christmas 2008 included a \u00a349 handbag for her PA, while she herself received \u00a355 worth of wine from her boss.",
      "Open secret?",
      "There was a widespread belief at the bank that there had been an expenses investigation into Reeves and two colleagues.",
      "But Reeves has said that she has no recollection of being investigated or having questions raised over her expenses.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said she was \"proud of the work she did at HBOS\" and was not aware of the claims about her expenses until approached by the BBC.",
      "\"She was not aware of an investigation nor was she interviewed, and she did not face any disciplinary action on this or any other matters. All expenses were submitted and signed off in the proper way,\" she said.",
      "The spokesman also said Reeves left in 2009 \"on good terms and received a severance payment, including her full notice pay and bonus\".",
      "\"HBOS allowed her to keep a company car for six months after she left and she was given a favourable reference.\"",
      "Reeves's team put forward several former HBOS employees for interview who they said corroborated her account that she had not been investigated.",
      "One said she hadn't seen evidence of senior managers misusing expenses and the bank had controls to prevent it but she left in February 2008, more than a year before Reeves departed. She also said that she had never heard of giving birthday and Christmas gifts at HBOS's expense as being part of the bank's policies.",
      "Another, Jane Wayper, the former HR business partner, said in a statement that she didn't recognise the accusations against Reeves and \"would have been aware of any investigation which concluded there was a case to answer\" as she would have been involved in the disciplinary process.",
      "She said there was \"extensive oversight of all expenses policies\" and claimed that \"birthday gifts and Christmas presents could be purchased using Motivation cards\". But this is at odds with a document seen by BBC News and the testimony of 11 sources we have spoken to.",
      "Many of Reeves' former HBOS colleagues were worried about the consequences of sharing confidential information with BBC News but believe it is in the public interest for what happened, and their concerns about the now-Chancellor's spending of the bank's money, to be reported.",
      "But, given their concerns about speaking out publicly, we have agreed not to name them.",
      "A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had no concerns about Reeves's conduct.",
      "Asked whether Sir Keir Starmer still thought the Chancellor had integrity after she updated her career history on LinkedIn, his official spokesman said: \"Yes. The Chancellor and the prime minister are working hand in hand to deliver on the priorities, the plan for change, and to deliver the higher growth and the improvements in living standards that the country needs.\"",
      "The Number 10 official added that the chancellor had gone through the declaration process, which all members of Cabinet go through, when asked if she disclosed that there had been an investigation into her expenses before she was an MP.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the investigation raised questions for the chancellor.",
      "She posted on X: \"Keir Starmer said 'restoring trust in politics is the great test of our era'. Until she [Reeves] comes clean - not just about her CV but about the circumstances in which she left HBOS, no one will take him seriously.\"",
      "The investigation at HBOS was not the last time Reeves would face scrutiny over her expenses.",
      "In 2015, it emerged that she was among 19 MPs who had had their official credit cards suspended by the parliamentary expenses watchdog after failing to show their spending was valid.",
      "Reeves owed more than \u00a34,000 in spending at the time when her card was blocked. She subsequently cleared her debt.",

    "summary": "The surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate tariffs prompts questions over the possible impact on British businesses.",
    "story": [
      "Concerns are growing the UK could be more exposed to US trade taxes after President Donald Trump announced he would target VAT in his latest move.",
      "Trump has instructed his staff to develop custom so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for individual countries based in part on trading agreements, including imports and exports, with the US.",
      "The UK's trading relationship with US had suggested it would be less exposed to tariffs than others, but the surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate potential tariffs has prompted questions over the impact on British businesses.",
      "Analysts have suggested tariffs of 20% or more could be placed on the UK as well as the European Union, but the outcome remains uncertain.",
      "The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) business group warned that cars, pharmaceuticals, and food and drink were specific goods which could be \"significantly hit\" by the measures, which were announced by the White House on Thursday.",
      "The latest announcement by Trump administration was wide-ranging and threatened retaliation by the US for not just trade tariffs, but for other \"unfair or harmful acts, policies or practices\".",
      "One of the justifications Trump has given to date for imposing tariffs on countries is whether they have a trade surplus with the US - i.e. they sell more to the US than they import from the country.",
      "The use of tariffs is part of Trump's efforts to protect American businesses and boost manufacturing.",
      "Trump launches plan to target countries with new tariffs",
      "UK not planning to hit back at US on steel tariffs",
      "UK signals it will seek US steel tariff exemption",
      "Both the UK and US claim to have trade surpluses with each other due to discrepancies in how the countries collect data. It remains uncertain whether Trump would exempt the UK from tariffs, but the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT) into the equation complicates matters.",
      "The president's latest announcement cited VAT as an \"unfair, discriminatory or extraterritorial tax\".",
      "VAT tax is the tax people have to pay when people buy most goods or services, apart from food and children's clothes. The standard rate in the UK is 20% and it is levied regardless of whether a product has been imported from overseas or not.",
      "George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, said if the US imposed taxes based on existing tariffs and VAT combined, British businesses exporting to the US could face charges of 21%.",
      "\"If reciprocal tariffs are applied on a VAT basis, European countries would be much higher on the list of impacted countries,\" he said.",
      "William Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the UK had a \"level of insulation\" due to it not exporting as many goods to the US in comparison to other countries.",
      "But he warned Trump's proposals would \"create more cost and uncertainty\" and \"upend established trade norms\".",
      "Fiona Conor, managing director of Trust Electric Heating, a Leeds-based radiator manufacturer which has plans to expand into the US, said if tariffs applied to her products, she would not want to pass on the costs through higher prices to customers.",
      "But she told the BBC's World At One that she was looking at starting production in the US \"because there is real, huge tax breaks for innovative companies like us to set up manufacturing in the US\".",
      "She said the government should \"be strong negotiators\", adding that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer needed to \"strengthen our partnership\" with the US.",
      "Paul Ashworth, chief UK economist for Capital Economics, said that most people would regard VAT as a non-discriminatory tax as it is applied to all goods whether they were produced domestically or imported.",
      "But he noted one of Trump's advisers had argued that given the US applied a much lower average sales tax at state level, VAT was a \"form of discriminatory tariff\".",
      "Mr Ashworth said it appeared the US president now favoured tariffs to be imposed on a \"country-by-country basis\" as opposed to his original idea of introducing universal tax on all imports to the US.",
      "'Difficult to predict'",
      "A tariff is a tax on imports collected by a government and it is paid by the company importing the good. Countries typically erect tariffs in a bid to protect certain sectors from foreign competition.",
      "But in protecting domestic businesses, prices for consumers can go up if a company importing goods from abroad passes higher costs on, rather than absorbing them or reducing imports.",
      "Caroline Ramsay, partner and head of international trade at law firm TLT, said it was \"difficult to predict\" what the latest announcement would mean for the UK.",
      "She suggested the word \"reciprocal\" did not mean what people might have first assumed, adding an assessment by the US would be made on what it considers to be fair.",
      "\"It does not mean that the USA is going to check what the UK tariff is on paper imports and match that tariff percentage for paper exports to the US from the UK,\" she added.",
      "Mr Bain argued it was \"vital\" that the UK government negotiated with Trump and did not get \"sucked into a trade war of tit-for-tat tariffs\".",
      "Senior UK government minister Pat McFadden said the government would wait before reacting.",
      "\"The most sensible thing to do with all of these announcements is to digest them, see if they actually come to pass, and then decide what you do.\""

    "summary": "They say the US should re-evaluate its cyber-security partnership with the UK unless the \"dangerous\" request is withdrawn.",
    "story": [
      "Two US lawmakers have strongly condemned what they call the UK's \"dangerous\"  and \"shortsighted\" request to be able to access encrypted data stored by Apple users worldwide in its cloud service.",
      "Senator Ron Wyden and Congressman Andy Biggs have written to national intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard saying the demand threatens the privacy and security of the US.",
      "They urge her to give the UK an ultimatum: \"Back down from this dangerous attack on US cybersecurity, or face serious consequences.\"",
      "The BBC has contacted the UK government for comment.",
      "\"While the UK has been a trusted ally, the US government must not permit what is effectively a foreign cyberattack waged through political means\", the US politicians wrote.",
      "If the UK does not back down Ms Gabbard should \"reevaluate US-UK cybersecurity arrangements and programs as well as US intelligence sharing\", they suggest.",
      "What is the UK seeking?",
      "The request for the data emerged last week.",
      "It applies to all content stored using what Apple calls \"Advanced Data Protection\" (ADP).",
      "This uses end-to-end encryption, where only the account holder can access the data stored. Apple itself cannot see it.",
      "It is an opt-in service, and not all users choose to activate it.",
      "The demand was first reported by the Washington Post, quoting sources familiar with the matter, and the BBC has spoken to similar contacts.",
      "The Home Office said then: \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.\"",
      "Apple declined to comment, but says on its website that it views privacy as a \"fundamental human right\".",
      "The order has been served by the Home Office under the Investigatory Powers Act, which compels firms to provide information to law enforcement agencies.",
      "Under the law, the demand by the Home Office cannot be made public.",
      "Senator Wyden and Congressman Biggs say agreeing to the request would \"undermine Americans' privacy rights and expose them to espionage by China, Russia and other adversaries\".",
      "They state that Apple does not make different versions of its encryption software for each country it operates in and, therefore, Apple customers in the UK will use the same software as Americans.",
      "\"If Apple is forced to build a backdoor in its products, that backdoor will end up in Americans' phones, tablets, and computers, undermining the security of Americans' data, as well as of the countless federal, state and local government agencies that entrust sensitive data to Apple products.\"",
      "The move by the UK government has stunned experts and worried privacy campaigners, with Privacy International calling it  an \"unprecedented attack\" on the private data of individuals.",
      "However the US government has previously asked Apple to break its encryption as part of criminal investigations.",
      "In 2016, Apple resisted a court order to write software which would allow US officials to access the iPhone of a gunman - though this was resolved after the FBI were able to successfully access the device.",
      "That same year, the US dropped a similar case after it was able to gain access by discovering the passcode of an alleged drug dealer.",
      "Similar cases have followed, including in 2020, when Apple refused to unlock iPhones of a man who carried out a mass shooting at a US air base. The FBI later said it had been able to \"gain access\" to the phones.",
      "It is understood that the UK government does not want to start combing through everybody's data.",
      "Rather it would want to access it if there were a risk to national security - in other words, it would be targeting an individual, rather than using it for mass surveillance.",
      "Authorities would still have to follow a legal process, have a good reason and request permission for a specific account in order to access data - just as they do now with unencrypted data.",
      "Apple has previously said it would pull encryption services like ADP from the UK market rather than comply with such government demands - telling Parliament it would \"never build a back door\" in its products.",
      "WhatsApp, owned by Meta, has also previously said it would choose being blocked over weakening message security.",
      "But even withdrawing the product from the UK might not be enough to ensure compliance - the Investigatory Powers Act applies worldwide to any tech firm with a UK market, even if they are not based there."

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 16:05:28 GMT",
    "summary": "It comes after more than 100 sites put themselves forward for consideration by a government taskforce.",
    "story": [
      "Work on a number of new towns will begin before the next general election after more than 100 locations across England were put forward, Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook has pledged.",
      "The government says most proposals are to extend existing towns or cities, alongside a \"smaller number\" of new standalone settlements.",
      "The aim is for each new town to have at least 10,000 homes, contributing towards Labour's 1.5 million five-year housebuilding target.",
      "Each should include infrastructure like public transport and schools, alongside affordable housing, ministers say.",
      "A visit to Milton Keynes by the PM to promote the policy was cut short earlier when farmers driving tractors staged a noisy protest.",
      "Ministers desperately want more housing - but are their plans radical enough?",
      "What's the new government's housebuilding target?",
      "Labour to select new town sites by end of first year",
      "The tractors' musical horns could be heard blaring across the building site shortly after Sir Keir Starmer arrived.",
      "It is the latest in a series of protests mounted by farmers against changes to inheritance tax on farms announced at October's Budget.",
      "Creating a new generation of new towns is a key element of the government's long-term plan for housebuilding, and part of its efforts to unlock economic growth.",
      "More than 100 potential sites across England have been suggested to a special taskforce set up to examine the options, after the government asked for expressions of interest from councils, housing developers and landowners.",
      "The sites have not been revealed, but London, the South East, the South West and the east of England have proved the most popular \u2013 though there were expressions of interest from every region.",
      "The taskforce will identify specific locations - as well as funding options - by the summer, with a view to construction on the first sites beginning by the time of the next election.",
      "Pennycook told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the aim was to build \"well-designed, affordable, attractive homes\" that would \"eventually house millions of people, just as the post-War waves of new towns did\".",
      "He described it as a \"transformational programme\" that he expected to \"make a contribution to housing numbers in this parliament\".",
      "However, speaking on Sky News, he conceded: \"These things take time to get off the ground. No one's pretending that the new towns programme is going to make up the bulk of that 1.5 million number.",
      "\"We're relying on the other changes we've made, including overhauling the national planning policy framework to get new sites coming through.\"",
      "He said he expected some of the construction to take place on greenfield - or undeveloped - land, but there would also be \"big expansions of existing towns and cities where that is appropriate\".",
      "\"There's got to be sustainable places, as I say, they've got to be well-connected, well-designed.\"",
      "The plan envisages an initial injection of government funding to buy land, which would be returned when sites were sold for a higher price to private developers, and would help pay for local infrastructure.",
      "Sir Keir said the construction of new towns would form part of \"the largest housebuilding programme since the post-war era\", and help offer \"working people...  the security and stability that owning your own home bring\".",
      "The Conservatives seized on the new towns announcement to attack the government on immigration.",
      "Shadow housing secretary Kevin Hollinrake said: \"Labour's housebuilding plans will do nothing to address the shortage of housing because immigration will just keep piling on the pressure.\"",
      "Spending review",
      "When the policy was originally unveiled at the party's conference in 2023, Labour set out a plan to use state-backed companies to construct a wave of new towns near English cities, echoing those built by Labour after World War Two.",
      "However, it is not clear how much public money will be allocated to the initiative.",
      "Pennycook told Today this would be decided in the government's spending review which will conclude in June and set spending plans for the next three years.",
      "The review, which is being conducted in a period of minimal economic growth against the backdrop of Labour's self-imposed fiscal constraints, will see ministers haggle for money for their departments.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has told departments to identify 5% \"efficiency savings\" as part of the process, to ensure key services are prioritised for funding.",
      "Polly Neate, chief executive of housing and homelessness charity Shelter, urged the government to provide \"serious investment\" in affordable social housing \"to drive up building to the scale the country desperately needs\".",
      "\"New towns are a huge opportunity for the government to tackle housing need and provide local communities with homes they can actually afford to live in. The government must commit serious investment at the Spending Review in June to drive up building to the scale the country desperately needs.\"",
      "Clement Attlee's 1945-51 government planned the first wave of new towns to relocate people from poor or bombed-out housing, with development corporations assigned responsibility for building them.",
      "Stevenage in Hertfordshire was the first such town created, with 10 others following by 1955, including Crawley in Sussex, Harlow in Essex, and Newton Aycliffe in County Durham.",
      "Most were intended to accommodate the overspill of people from London.",
      "Since the 1950s, Parliament has approved further developments in England, Scotland and Wales."

    "summary": "The economy expanded by 0.1% between October and December, official figures suggest.",
    "story": [
      "The UK economy unexpectedly grew in the final three months of last year following a boost to the construction and services sectors.",
      "The economy expanded by 0.1% between October and December, according to official figures, despite analysts predicting it would contract.",
      "Growth in the quarter was driven by a range of industries, from pubs and bars to machinery manufacturers, having a strong December.",
      "However, the figures also indicated living standards last year were slightly lower than in 2023 on average.",
      "With tax rises coming into force in April, concerns remain that economic growth will remain sluggish for sometime.",
      "Businesses have warned that paying more in National Insurance, along with minimum wages rising and business rates relief being reduced, could affect the economy's ability to grow, with employers expecting to have less cash to give pay rises and create new jobs.",
      "The Bank of England has also halved its growth forecast for the UK this year, amid concerns that higher costs for employers could hit hiring, profits, investment - and push up prices. Last week, it decided to cut interest rates to 4.5%.",
      "Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the economy was \"all-but stagnating\" as businesses adjusted for higher costs and \"more uncertainty overseas\" - pointing to the introduction of trade tariffs in the US by President Donald Trump.",
      "He said it was a clear that \"a lot of the weakness\" in the economy was due to the rise in taxes on firms announced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in her Budget last year, with \"business sentiment on the floor\" and investment and consumer spending down.",
      "\"Overall, the economy is unlikely to do more than move sideways over the next six months,\" he suggested.",
      "How fast is the UK's economy growing?",
      "Why are prices rising in the UK?",
      "But the latest figures showing a return to growth at the end of 2024 will be welcome news for the government, which has made growing the economy its top priority in its effort to improve living standards.",
      "A separate figure from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) measuring living standards fell 0.1% in 2024 compared with the year before. The measure - known as real GDP per head - calculates the volume of goods and services available to the average person in the UK and a person is deemed better off the more they have.",
      "When an economy grows, businesses on average have more money to spend to employ more people or give pay rises. Firms making more profits also pay more in tax to the government, which can be spent on public services.",
      "All this together, in theory, leaves people better off - but it takes time for the benefits to be felt, and it does not necessarily benefit everyone.",
      "In December alone, the economy was estimated to have grown by 0.4%.",
      "Film distribution firms, pubs and bars all had a \"strong month\", as did industries involved in machinery manufacturing, according to Liz McKeown, director of economic statistics at the ONS.",
      "However, this was offset by weak months in trade for computer programming, publishing and car sales businesses.",
      "In the construction sector, the final months of 2024 saw an increase in new work driven by new private housing projects, but repairs and maintenance work from private homes fell over the period, suggesting homeowners cut back.",
      "'People don't have the money'",
      "Sushma Solanki, the owner of Bolton catering firm Sushma's Snacks, told the BBC the economic situation was \"very worrying\" as she found trading at the end of last year very tough.",
      "\"I normally do about 20 to 30 Christmas office events,\" she said. \"Instead, I did two, which was very hard. People don't have the money.\"",
      "She said she had to let go an employee partly because of the upcoming rise in National Insurance.",
      "\"It's not just the policies, it's everything. Peppers for my chicken dish started off at 79p, they are \u00a31.85,\" she added.",
      "Chris Taylor, the owner of coffee shop Gran T's in Manchester, said he was \"shocked\" that there had been any growth in the economy.",
      "\"Going into last winter was one of the biggest struggles. I think a lot of people were naturally clinging onto their purse strings. Trade was not there,\" he said.",
      "\"This government's action plan, without hitting people directly with higher taxes, is hitting the level above and that effectively is going to hit people one way or another. It is really an indirect punch to the whole economy.\"",
      "Following the release of the new figures, the chancellor said she was still not satisfied with the performance of the economy.",
      "\"It's not possible to turn around more than a decade of poor economic performance in just a few months, but we are doing what is necessary to bring stability to the economy,\" she said.",
      "Reeves also said the government was going \"further and faster\" to \"put more money in people's pockets\".",
      "She also reiterated her self-imposed rules on borrowing and debt were \"non-negotiable\" after reports this week suggested the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, had downgraded growth forecasts.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said Reeves's Budget was \"killing growth\" in the UK.",
      "\"Working people and businesses are already paying for her choices with ever rocketing taxes, hundreds of thousands of job cuts and business confidence plummeting,\" he added.",
      "Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper said the chancellor's Budget was to blame for \"pitiful economic growth\".",
      "\"Her complete pig's ear of a jobs tax will hammer small businesses, the backbone of our economy.\"",

      "Rachel Reeves has had a bumpy first few months in government.",
      "Her tax-hiking Budget prompted criticism from businesses and farmers, and despite Labour putting a pledge to boost the economy at the centre of its plans, growth has been sluggish.",
      "Now the chancellor is facing questions about whether she exaggerated her experience on her online CV and her use of expenses while working in the banking sector before she became an MP.",

      "Reeves was born in south-east London in 1979, just months before Margaret Thatcher became prime minister at a time of immense social and economic change.",
      "She has previously told the BBC her mother would tick off items on a bank statement against receipts while sitting at the kitchen table: \"We weren't poor, but we didn't have money to waste.\"",
      "Her parents separated when she was at primary school, and she and younger sister Ellie, also a Labour MP, were shuttled between separate homes.",
      "During the school holidays, the sisters would spend time with their grandparents in the Northamptonshire town of Kettering.",
      "They would be taken to do the rounds of relatives' houses, who would give them a 20p or 50p piece each. At the end of their week, they were taken to the local toy shop to choose their goodies. While Ellie would spend all her cash, the young Rachel would allow herself a smaller treat and save most of the money.",
      "Decades later, Chancellor Reeves would say that kind of restraint defines her, and she has very much modelled herself on Gordon Brown\u2019s \"prudence\" in the lead-up to Labour\u2019s 1997 election win.",
      "Chess talent",
      "Reeves played chess from an early age, with her father teaching her the key moves. She became a national under-14 champion, and would \"quietly thrash\" any boys who might think they were in for an easy game, according to Ellie.",
      "She has credited chess with teaching her \"to think ahead, to plan a strategy\".",
      "A keen flute player, she took her music GCSE a year early at Beckenham's Cator Park School for Girls, a comprehensive, and would go on to gain four A grades at A-level.",
      "Seeing the extent of cuts at her school, where the library had been turned into a classroom and the sixth form consisted of \"two pre-fab huts in the playground\", she has said she was politicised by her own experience of public services. At the age of 16, she joined the Labour Party.",
      "She went on to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford University. As a student, she would host others before college discos, blasting out Destiny's Child songs and dressing up in her room.",
      "Despite her serious demeanour, colleagues and friends have suggested the Labour MP's public persona does not reflect her human side, including a loud laugh and a deep love of Beyonc\u00e9 tracks.",

      "The initial stage of the HBOS investigation found that a whistleblower's complaint was substantiated, and the three employees appeared to have broken the rules, according to a senior source with direct knowledge of the probe.",
      "The BBC has not been able to establish what the final outcome of the investigation was and it might not have concluded.",
      "A spokesman for Reeves said the chancellor had no knowledge of the investigation, always complied with expenses rules and left the bank on good terms.",
      "Reeves has also faced questions about the accuracy of her online CV, which the BBC found exaggerated the length of time she worked at the Bank of England.",

      "A former editor of the BBC's Newsnight programme was forced to issue a written apology to Reeves after calling her \"boring snoring\" on social media in a post that was meant to be a private message.",
      "While she said the incident was \"deeply humiliating\", her key objective after Sir Keir Starmer appointed her shadow chancellor was to portray Labour as a steady, pro-business hand on the economy.",
      "In October 2023, she admitted she \"should have done better\" after it emerged some passages in her book, The Women Who Made Modern Economics, had been lifted from other sources without acknowledgment.",

    "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 00:45:06 GMT",
    "summary": "The world's frozen oceans keep the planet cool, but they currently have less ice than ever recorded before.",
    "story": [
      "The world's frozen oceans, which help to keep the planet cool, currently have less ice than ever previously recorded, satellite data shows.",
      "Sea-ice around the north and south poles acts like a giant mirror by reflecting much of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "But as rising temperatures cause this bright layer to shrink, the dark ocean below can absorb more heat, warming the planet further.",
      "This latest sea-ice low appears to have been driven by a combination of warm air, warm seas and winds breaking apart the ice.",
      "Over the 5 days to 13 February, the combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice was 15.76 million sq km (6.08 million sq miles), according to BBC analysis of data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).",
      "This breaks the previous 5-day record low of 15.93 million sq km (6.15 million sq miles) from January-February 2023.",
      "Arctic sea-ice is currently at its smallest recorded extent for the time of year, while Antarctic sea-ice is close to a new low in satellite records going back to the late 1970s.",
      "The decline of Arctic sea-ice in response to a warming planet is well-established. Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s.",
      "But until the mid-2010s, Antarctic sea-ice had been remarkably resilient, defying predictions that it would shrink.",
      "Since then, Antarctica has shown a series of very low sea-ice extents, although there is still lots of natural variability.",
      "\"Every year, every data point that we get suggests that this isn't a temporary shift, but something more permanent, like what we've seen in the Arctic,\" Walter Meier, senior research scientist at NSIDC, told BBC News.",
      "\"It is indicating that the Antarctic has moved into a new regime of lower ice extents.\"",
      "Antarctic sea-ice is relatively thin and mobile - being surrounded by ocean rather than continents like the Arctic - so it can be particularly sensitive to winds breaking up the ice.",
      "But warmer air and warmer waters look to have played a key role in this latest 2025 low, towards the end of the southern hemisphere summer.",
      "The Antarctic ice-shelves \u2013 ice flowing off the Antarctic continent, rather than sea-ice \u2013 appear to have had a particularly extreme season of surface melting, driven by high air temperatures.",
      "\"Atmospheric conditions in December and January looked like they were strongly promoting surface melting on the ice-shelves,\" said Tom Bracegirdle, research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "\"That could also have contributed to what we've seen in Antarctic sea-ice, and ongoing ocean warming is setting the backdrop to all of this as well.\"",
      "Antarctica's record sea-ice low of 2023 would have been a one-in-2,000 year event without climate change, according to a recent study. Yet 2025 is not far from eclipsing it.",
      "At the other end of the planet, the Arctic should be reaching its annual maximum, with cold winter temperatures helping the oceans to freeze over.",
      "But current sea-ice extent is nearly 0.2 million sq km below anything previously recorded for the time of year, and has been tracking very low since late 2024.",
      "This is partly as a result of a late freeze-up of ice around Hudson Bay, with unusually warm ocean waters taking a long time to cool down.",
      "As well as warmer seas, some storms also disrupted ice around the Barents and Bering Seas, with the consequences likely amplified by long-term reductions in sea-ice thickness.",
      "\"A thinner ice cover is more responsive to weather [\u2026 so] weather events can have a stronger impact than they used to,\" said Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London.",
      "In recent weeks, Arctic sea-ice has moved even further below average. Temperatures around the north pole were about 20C above normal in early February, leading to melting conditions in places like Svalbard.",
      "This \"is quite astonishing\" for the time of year, according to Dr Bracegirdle.",
      "This very low winter extent doesn't necessarily mean the Arctic will end up with record conditions throughout 2025, as conditions can change quickly at the poles.",
      "But, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the global average, declines over the coming decades are almost inevitable.",
      "The Arctic is expected to be essentially free of sea-ice at the end of its summer at least once before 2050, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Some recent studies suggest it could happen sooner.",
      "Declining sea-ice at both poles not only has implications for local wildlife like polar bears and penguins, but also the Earth's climate.",
      "Polar sea-ice has already lost around 14% of its natural cooling effect since the early-to-mid 1980s, as the area of bright, reflective ice has declined, according to a study published last year.",
      "\"If you significantly change the sea ice distribution in and around Antarctica, you modify that part of the planet which is actually helping us fight against climate change,\" said Simon Josey, a professor at the National Oceanography Centre.",
      "Sea-ice also plays an important role in the great ocean conveyor, the mass movement of water that helps distribute heat around the planet and keeps places like the UK and north-west Europe relatively mild.",
      "\"If we see another strong winter loss [of Antarctic sea-ice], people are going to start to worry about what it's doing to the ocean circulation,\" said Prof Josey.",

      "Nearly 700 foreign seasonal agricultural labourers complained to the Worker Support Centre (WSC) charity in 2024 they were being treated unfairly by farmers who had brought them over to work, compared to just over 400 in 2023.",
      "One former fruit picker told the BBC more must be done to protect migrants from being treated like slaves.",
      "The UK government said it always took \"decisive action\" if abusive practices were found on farms.",
      "Bolivian Julia Quecano Casimiro came to the UK on a seasonal worker visa to pick cherries for Haygrove, a Herefordshire-based farm business.",
      "Ms Casimiro is currently taking the company to an employment tribunal over claims of unfair dismissal, discrimination and underpayment of wages, and now campaigns for better protection for seasonal farm workers.",
      "In an initial ruling, the Home Office found there were reasonable grounds to believe that Ms Casimiro could have been a victim of modern slavery.",
      "She told the BBC she feared the true scale of exploitation of workers was a \"hidden problem\", adding: \"Many seasonal workers continue to have their rights violated at this very moment.",
      "\"What is happening is very serious because we don't have access to any assistance or support.",
      "\"If the UK government does not take action to stop what is happening there will continue to be more victims of modern slavery.\"",
      "A spokeswoman for Haygrove said Ms Casimiro's discontent was prompted by a discrepancy in the face value of flight tickets and the amount loaned to workers for the tickets, and lower than typical hours of work available in the month of July, as a result of extraordinary weather conditions.",
      "The company added that her allegations are \"materially incorrect and misleading\" and that it has \"never had accusations of this nature before in the history of our business\".",

      "The WSC said its caseworkers dealt with 158 farm labourers in one month last summer and referred 19 cases involving 101 individuals to enforcement agencies. The workers were mainly Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tajik and Uzbek.",
      "The charity wants a review of the seasonal agricultural worker scheme and of any risks of exploitation it presents.",
      "A Home Office spokeswoman said its staff had visited 318 farms and carried out more than 2,100 worker interviews, with improvements made every year to stop exploitation and poor working conditions.",

      "A discovery underneath the basement of an office block has been described as one of the most important pieces of Roman history unearthed in the city of London.",
      "Archaeologists have found a substantial piece of the ancient city's first basilica - a 2,000 year old public building where major political, economic and administrative decisions were made.",
      "The excavation has so far revealed sections of stone wall that formed the base of the basilica, which would have been two-and-a-half storeys high.",
      "The site, which will eventually be opened to the public, sheds light on the city's beginnings.",
      "\"This is so significant - this is the heart of Roman London,\" said Sophie Jackson, from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola), who revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.",
      "\"This building will tell us so much about the origins of London, why London grew and why it was chosen as the capital of Britain. It's just amazing.\"",
      "The site was discovered at 85 Gracechurch Street, an office building that's about to be demolished and redeveloped.",
      "Earlier archaeological investigations revealed the ancient basilica's approximate location, so the team created several small test pits to see what was hidden beneath the concrete floor.",
      "On the third attempt, digging between the filing cabinets, they struck lucky.",
      "\"You can see a huge chunk of Roman masonry, and it's incredible that it survives this well. We're absolutely thrilled that there's so much of it here,\" said Sophie Jackson.",
      "The wall is made from a type of limestone from Kent, and formed an imposing building - the basilica would have been about 40m long, 20m wide and 12m high.",
      "Other artefacts have been found too, including a roof tile imprinted with the stamp of an official from the ancient city.",
      "The basilica was part of London's forum, a social and commercial hub with a courtyard that was about the size of a football pitch.",
      "\"The basilica is the town hall, and then in front of it was a big open market square with a range of shops and offices around the outside,\" explained Ms Jackson.",
      "\"It's the place you came to do business, to get your court case sorted out, it's where laws were made, and it's where decisions were made about London, but also about the rest of the country.\"",
      "It was built around 80 AD, just a few decades after the Romans invaded Britain and founded Londinium - the Roman name for the city.",
      "But the first basilica and forum were only in use for about 20 years. They were replaced by a much larger second forum, perhaps reflecting how quickly the city was growing in size and importance.",
      "The discovery has meant a change of plans for the building's owners, Hertshten Properties.",
      "The Roman remains, which will now be fully excavated, are to be incorporated into the new offices - pending planning approval - and opened up to the public.",
      "For the architects, redesigning a building around an archaeological site has had some technical challenges.",
      "\"The scheme has been comprehensively adjusted,\" explained James Taylor from architecture firm Woods Bagot.",
      "\"Simple things like the columns have had to literally move position, so you're not destroying all these special stones that we found in the ground.\"",
      "And so as not to disturb what's there, fewer lifts can now be installed - and this has meant that the team has had to reduce the height of the building.",
      "But Mr Taylor said the effort will be worth it.",
      "\"To actually see people using and enjoying the space, moving through the public hall and down to see the remains, will be absolutely incredible.\"",
      "This is the latest piece of Roman history to be discovered lying beneath the streets of London's Square Mile. And there's a growing effort to find innovative ways to show these sites to the public.",
      "Parts of an amphitheatre are on display under a glass floor at the Guildhall Art Gallery, and at Bloomberg's offices, people can visit the Temple of Mithras, which has been brought to life with an immersive sound and light installation.",
      "Chris Hayward from the City of London Corporation says he wants more people to experience the link between the past and the present.",
      "\"The fact that Roman London is beneath your feet is, frankly, quite a remarkable emotion to experience,\" he said.",
      "\"You can actually see and visualise how Roman London would have been in those times. And then you can walk outside and you can say, 'now look at the skyscrapers, now look at the office blocks', this is progress, but at the same time, progress combined with preservation.\""

    "story": [
      "The government has agreed a new funding arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station that it says will cut subsidies in half.",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in north Yorkshire, generates about 5% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds from the government and bill-payers because wood pellets are classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "Though there are plans to eventually capture the carbon emitted from Drax, its emissions from burning the pellets are currently unabated.",
      "Critics of the power station have called it one of the UK's leading emitters of the climate warming gas CO2, but Drax disputes that description.",
      "It argues that burning wood is carbon neutral because when trees are cut down for fuel, new trees can be planted that effectively re-absorb the carbon dioxide released.",
      "The new agreement will run from 2027 to 2031 and will see the power station only used as a back-up to cheaper renewable sources of power.",
      "The government says that will mean that when there's lots of wind and solar, Drax won't run at all.",
      "It says the company currently receives nearly a billion pounds a year in subsidies and predicts that figure will more than halve to \u00a3470m under the new deal.",
      "Michael Shanks, the Minister of Energy, said the previous subsidy arrangement had allowed Drax to make \"unacceptably large profits\" and that the new deal would be a \"step change in value for money and sustainability\".",
      "In a statement, Drax said the the new mechanism would represent a \"net saving\" for consumers and quoted analysis which suggested it would cut electricity system costs by between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a33.1bn over four years.",
      "A \"clawback mechanism\" in the new arrangement is designed to stop the company making excessive profits if electricity prices rise steeply.",
      "\"Under this proposed agreement, Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system,\" said Will Gardiner Drax's chief executive.",
      "Campaign group Greenpeace called the deal \"a dirty compromise with past failures\"  but said that it should hopefully limit the damage by restricting Drax's operations.",
      "\"The government is still far too trusting of big polluters asking for big subsidies to decarbonise,\" Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace's policy director, said. \"We have cheap, clean power sources available, and we shouldn't be left to gamble on schemes like this anymore.\"",
      "The new agreement also states that 100% of the wood pellets Drax burns must be \"sustainably sourced\" and that  \"material sourced from primary and old growth forests\"  will not be able to receive support payments.",
      "All the pellets Drax burns are imported, with most of them coming from the USA and Canada.",
      "BBC Panorama and BBC News has previously reported that Drax held logging licences in British Columbia, Canada, and used wood, including whole trees, from primary and old-growth forests for its pellets.",
      "In response to the BBC's reporting, Drax admitted it had taken wood from old-growth forests. But it told Panorama that 77% of the material for its Canadian wood pellets came from sawdust and sawmill residues, with the rest coming from forestry residues and low-grade logs.",
      "It says the company does not own forests or sawmills, no longer bids for logging licences and has stopped sourcing wood from some sites, where the British Columbia government has asked companies to pause further logging."

    "story": [
      "The world's frozen oceans, which help to keep the planet cool, currently have less ice than ever previously recorded, satellite data shows.",
      "Sea-ice around the north and south poles acts like a giant mirror by reflecting much of the Sun's energy back into space.",
      "But as rising temperatures cause this bright layer to shrink, the dark ocean below can absorb more heat, warming the planet further.",
      "This latest sea-ice low appears to have been driven by a combination of warm air, warm seas and winds breaking apart the ice.",
      "Over the 5 days to 13 February, the combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice was 15.76 million sq km (6.08 million sq miles), according to BBC analysis of data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).",
      "This breaks the previous 5-day record low of 15.93 million sq km (6.15 million sq miles) from January-February 2023.",
      "Arctic sea-ice is currently at its smallest recorded extent for the time of year, while Antarctic sea-ice is close to a new low in satellite records going back to the late 1970s.",
      "The decline of Arctic sea-ice in response to a warming planet is well-established. Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s.",
      "But until the mid-2010s, Antarctic sea-ice had been remarkably resilient, defying predictions that it would shrink.",
      "Since then, Antarctica has shown a series of very low sea-ice extents, although there is still lots of natural variability.",
      "\"Every year, every data point that we get suggests that this isn't a temporary shift, but something more permanent, like what we've seen in the Arctic,\" Walter Meier, senior research scientist at NSIDC, told BBC News.",
      "\"It is indicating that the Antarctic has moved into a new regime of lower ice extents.\"",
      "Antarctic sea-ice is relatively thin and mobile - being surrounded by ocean rather than continents like the Arctic - so it can be particularly sensitive to winds breaking up the ice.",
      "But warmer air and warmer waters look to have played a key role in this latest 2025 low, towards the end of the southern hemisphere summer.",
      "The Antarctic ice-shelves \u2013 ice flowing off the Antarctic continent, rather than sea-ice \u2013 appear to have had a particularly extreme season of surface melting, driven by high air temperatures.",
      "\"Atmospheric conditions in December and January looked like they were strongly promoting surface melting on the ice-shelves,\" said Tom Bracegirdle, research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "\"That could also have contributed to what we've seen in Antarctic sea-ice, and ongoing ocean warming is setting the backdrop to all of this as well.\"",
      "Antarctica's record sea-ice low of 2023 would have been a one-in-2,000 year event without climate change, according to a recent study. Yet 2025 is not far from eclipsing it.",
      "At the other end of the planet, the Arctic should be reaching its annual maximum, with cold winter temperatures helping the oceans to freeze over.",
      "But current sea-ice extent is nearly 0.2 million sq km below anything previously recorded for the time of year, and has been tracking very low since late 2024.",
      "This is partly as a result of a late freeze-up of ice around Hudson Bay, with unusually warm ocean waters taking a long time to cool down.",
      "As well as warmer seas, some storms also disrupted ice around the Barents and Bering Seas, with the consequences likely amplified by long-term reductions in sea-ice thickness.",
      "\"A thinner ice cover is more responsive to weather [\u2026 so] weather events can have a stronger impact than they used to,\" said Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London.",
      "In recent weeks, Arctic sea-ice has moved even further below average. Temperatures around the north pole were about 20C above normal in early February, leading to melting conditions in places like Svalbard.",
      "This \"is quite astonishing\" for the time of year, according to Dr Bracegirdle.",
      "This very low winter extent doesn't necessarily mean the Arctic will end up with record conditions throughout 2025, as conditions can change quickly at the poles.",
      "But, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the global average, declines over the coming decades are almost inevitable.",
      "The Arctic is expected to be essentially free of sea-ice at the end of its summer at least once before 2050, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Some recent studies suggest it could happen sooner.",
      "Declining sea-ice at both poles not only has implications for local wildlife like polar bears and penguins, but also the Earth's climate.",
      "Polar sea-ice has already lost around 14% of its natural cooling effect since the early-to-mid 1980s, as the area of bright, reflective ice has declined, according to a study published last year.",
      "\"If you significantly change the sea ice distribution in and around Antarctica, you modify that part of the planet which is actually helping us fight against climate change,\" said Simon Josey, a professor at the National Oceanography Centre.",
      "Sea-ice also plays an important role in the great ocean conveyor, the mass movement of water that helps distribute heat around the planet and keeps places like the UK and north-west Europe relatively mild.",
      "\"If we see another strong winter loss [of Antarctic sea-ice], people are going to start to worry about what it's doing to the ocean circulation,\" said Prof Josey.",

    "summary": "The oil giant is widely expected to say it will scale back on renewables later this month.",
    "story": [
      "Oil giant BP has said it will \"fundamentally reset\" its strategy as profits dropped sharply last year.",
      "It is widely expected to say later this month that it will scale back renewable projects and increase oil and gas production following similar moves from rivals including Shell and Equinor.",
      "BP's net income fell to $8.9bn (\u00a37.2bn) in 2024, down from $13.8bn the previous year.",
      "It said lower oil and gas prices, plus lower profits from its refineries, had dented how much money it had made.",
      "Five years ago BP set a target of 50GW of renewables generation capacity by 2030.",
      "That is expected to be abandoned on 26 February in a major change of strategy.",
      "BP has already been scaling back on renewables.",
      "In December it put the majority of its offshore wind assets into a joint venture with Japanese company Jera to separate them from the company's core fossil fuel business.",
      "It is expected to cut its previous $10bn commitment in renewables until 2030 by up to a half.",
      "BP also froze new wind projects in June last year.",
      "Activist shareholder Elliott Management has bought a stake in BP to push for more investment in oil and gas, with investors anticipating board changes.",
      "AJ Bell analyst Russ Mould said the sharp drop in profit \"provided plenty of fodder\" for hedge fund Elliott, with BP having done \"little to reassure other shareholders that the current plan is working\".",
      "He added that \"a clear and credible plan is desperately needed if BP is going to remain the master of its own destiny\".",
      "Profit-driven",
      "There is a scientific consensus that there is clear link between emissions from burning fossil fuels and climate change.",
      "But recently oil and gas firms have been making plans to ramp up production.",
      "Nick Butler, former head of strategy at BP, said big oil firms would invest in renewables \"when they can see a clear profit\".",
      "Last week Norwegian energy giant Equinor said it would halve investment in renewable energy over the next two years while increasing oil and gas production.",
      "Chief executive Anders Opedal said \"we don't see the necessary profitability in the future\" in renewables.",
      "He said the transition to lower carbon energy was moving more slowly than expected, costs had increased, and customers were reluctant to commit to long-term contracts.",
      "In December, Shell stepped back from new offshore wind investments.",
      "Paris withdrawal",
      "US President Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed support for fossil fuels.",
      "In January he once again vowed to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement, the world's most important effort to tackle rising temperatures.",
      "He also said the US would \"drill, baby, drill\", embarking on a new age of oil and gas exploration.",
      "After Trump's executive order requiring the body of water - which is bordered by the US, Cuba and Mexico - be renamed the Gulf of America, BP referred to its operations in the area accordingly. This was following guidance from the US government according to a company spokesperson.",
      "Human rights campaign group Global Witness said BP had invested nearly \u00a39bn in oil and gas last year, compared with \u00a31.3bn on renewables and low carbon energy.",
      "Lela Stanley, head of fossil fuels investigations at the group, said: \"As the world battles extreme weather disasters supercharged by fossil fuels, it is wrong that polluters such as BP can double down on the oil and gas that is driving climate breakdown.\"",
      "Elena Polisano, head of Greenpeace's climate justice campaign, said pressure was growing on governments \"to see these fossil fuel billions as fair game to be directed towards extreme weather recovery funds, as is already happening in Vermont and New York\".",
      "She added that oil majors including BP were fuelling the climate crisis, \"so it's only fair to make polluters pay\".",
      "Jeanne Martin from ShareAction, which campaigns for responsible investment, said it was \"deeply concerning\" that energy companies were walking back on renewable commitments as the effects of global heating, such as flooding and heatwaves, intensify.",
      "Doubling down on oil and gas was a \"financial risk that prudent and responsible investors must respond to decisively\", it added."

    "published": "Mon, 10 Feb 2025 08:49:58 GMT",
    "summary": "The government has agreed a new subsidy arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station in north Yorkshire.",
    "story": [
      "The government has agreed a new funding arrangement with the controversial wood-burning Drax power station that it says will cut subsidies in half.",
      "The power station, a converted coal plant in north Yorkshire, generates about 5% of the UK's electricity and has received billions of pounds from the government and bill-payers because wood pellets are classed as a source of renewable energy.",
      "Though there are plans to eventually capture the carbon emitted from Drax, its emissions from burning the pellets are currently unabated.",
      "Critics of the power station have called it one of the UK's leading emitters of the climate warming gas CO2, but Drax disputes that description.",
      "It argues that burning wood is carbon neutral because when trees are cut down for fuel, new trees can be planted that effectively re-absorb the carbon dioxide released.",
      "The new agreement will run from 2027 to 2031 and will see the power station only used as a back-up to cheaper renewable sources of power.",
      "The government says that will mean that when there's lots of wind and solar, Drax won't run at all.",
      "It says the company currently receives nearly a billion pounds a year in subsidies and predicts that figure will more than halve to \u00a3470m under the new deal.",
      "Michael Shanks, the Minister of Energy, said the previous subsidy arrangement had allowed Drax to make \"unacceptably large profits\" and that the new deal would be a \"step change in value for money and sustainability\".",
      "In a statement, Drax said the the new mechanism would represent a \"net saving\" for consumers and quoted analysis which suggested it would cut electricity system costs by between \u00a31.6bn and \u00a33.1bn over four years.",
      "A \"clawback mechanism\" in the new arrangement is designed to stop the company making excessive profits if electricity prices rise steeply.",
      "\"Under this proposed agreement, Drax can step in to increase generation when there is not enough electricity, helping to avoid the need to burn more gas or import power from Europe, and when there is too much electricity on the UK grid, Drax can turn down and help to balance the system,\" said Will Gardiner Drax's chief executive.",
      "Campaign group Greenpeace called the deal \"a dirty compromise with past failures\"  but said that it should hopefully limit the damage by restricting Drax's operations.",
      "\"The government is still far too trusting of big polluters asking for big subsidies to decarbonise,\" Dr Doug Parr, Greenpeace's policy director, said. \"We have cheap, clean power sources available, and we shouldn't be left to gamble on schemes like this anymore.\"",
      "The new agreement also states that 100% of the wood pellets Drax burns must be \"sustainably sourced\" and that  \"material sourced from primary and old growth forests\"  will not be able to receive support payments.",
      "All the pellets Drax burns are imported, with most of them coming from the USA and Canada.",
      "BBC Panorama and BBC News has previously reported that Drax held logging licences in British Columbia, Canada, and used wood, including whole trees, from primary and old-growth forests for its pellets.",
      "In response to the BBC's reporting, Drax admitted it had taken wood from old-growth forests. But it told Panorama that 77% of the material for its Canadian wood pellets came from sawdust and sawmill residues, with the rest coming from forestry residues and low-grade logs.",
      "It says the company does not own forests or sawmills, no longer bids for logging licences and has stopped sourcing wood from some sites, where the British Columbia government has asked companies to pause further logging."

    "summary": "The discovery has been described as one of the most important pieces of Roman history in the City of London.",
    "story": [
      "A discovery underneath the basement of an office block has been described as one of the most important pieces of Roman history unearthed in the city of London.",
      "Archaeologists have found a substantial piece of the ancient city's first basilica - a 2,000 year old public building where major political, economic and administrative decisions were made.",
      "The excavation has so far revealed sections of stone wall that formed the base of the basilica, which would have been two-and-a-half storeys high.",
      "The site, which will eventually be opened to the public, sheds light on the city's beginnings.",
      "\"This is so significant - this is the heart of Roman London,\" said Sophie Jackson, from the Museum of London Archaeology (Mola), who revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.",
      "\"This building will tell us so much about the origins of London, why London grew and why it was chosen as the capital of Britain. It's just amazing.\"",
      "The site was discovered at 85 Gracechurch Street, an office building that's about to be demolished and redeveloped.",
      "Earlier archaeological investigations revealed the ancient basilica's approximate location, so the team created several small test pits to see what was hidden beneath the concrete floor.",
      "On the third attempt, digging between the filing cabinets, they struck lucky.",
      "\"You can see a huge chunk of Roman masonry, and it's incredible that it survives this well. We're absolutely thrilled that there's so much of it here,\" said Sophie Jackson.",
      "The wall is made from a type of limestone from Kent, and formed an imposing building - the basilica would have been about 40m long, 20m wide and 12m high.",
      "Other artefacts have been found too, including a roof tile imprinted with the stamp of an official from the ancient city.",
      "The basilica was part of London's forum, a social and commercial hub with a courtyard that was about the size of a football pitch.",
      "\"The basilica is the town hall, and then in front of it was a big open market square with a range of shops and offices around the outside,\" explained Ms Jackson.",
      "\"It's the place you came to do business, to get your court case sorted out, it's where laws were made, and it's where decisions were made about London, but also about the rest of the country.\"",
      "It was built around 80 AD, just a few decades after the Romans invaded Britain and founded Londinium - the Roman name for the city.",
      "But the first basilica and forum were only in use for about 20 years. They were replaced by a much larger second forum, perhaps reflecting how quickly the city was growing in size and importance.",
      "The discovery has meant a change of plans for the building's owners, Hertshten Properties.",
      "The Roman remains, which will now be fully excavated, are to be incorporated into the new offices - pending planning approval - and opened up to the public.",
      "For the architects, redesigning a building around an archaeological site has had some technical challenges.",
      "\"The scheme has been comprehensively adjusted,\" explained James Taylor from architecture firm Woods Bagot.",
      "\"Simple things like the columns have had to literally move position, so you're not destroying all these special stones that we found in the ground.\"",
      "And so as not to disturb what's there, fewer lifts can now be installed - and this has meant that the team has had to reduce the height of the building.",
      "But Mr Taylor said the effort will be worth it.",
      "\"To actually see people using and enjoying the space, moving through the public hall and down to see the remains, will be absolutely incredible.\"",
      "This is the latest piece of Roman history to be discovered lying beneath the streets of London's Square Mile. And there's a growing effort to find innovative ways to show these sites to the public.",
      "Parts of an amphitheatre are on display under a glass floor at the Guildhall Art Gallery, and at Bloomberg's offices, people can visit the Temple of Mithras, which has been brought to life with an immersive sound and light installation.",
      "Chris Hayward from the City of London Corporation says he wants more people to experience the link between the past and the present.",
      "\"The fact that Roman London is beneath your feet is, frankly, quite a remarkable emotion to experience,\" he said.",
      "\"You can actually see and visualise how Roman London would have been in those times. And then you can walk outside and you can say, 'now look at the skyscrapers, now look at the office blocks', this is progress, but at the same time, progress combined with preservation.\""

    "story": [
      "Two US lawmakers have strongly condemned what they call the UK's \"dangerous\"  and \"shortsighted\" request to be able to access encrypted data stored by Apple users worldwide in its cloud service.",
      "Senator Ron Wyden and Congressman Andy Biggs have written to national intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard saying the demand threatens the privacy and security of the US.",
      "They urge her to give the UK an ultimatum: \"Back down from this dangerous attack on US cybersecurity, or face serious consequences.\"",
      "The BBC has contacted the UK government for comment.",
      "\"While the UK has been a trusted ally, the US government must not permit what is effectively a foreign cyberattack waged through political means\", the US politicians wrote.",
      "If the UK does not back down Ms Gabbard should \"reevaluate US-UK cybersecurity arrangements and programs as well as US intelligence sharing\", they suggest.",
      "What is the UK seeking?",
      "The request for the data emerged last week.",
      "It applies to all content stored using what Apple calls \"Advanced Data Protection\" (ADP).",
      "This uses end-to-end encryption, where only the account holder can access the data stored. Apple itself cannot see it.",
      "It is an opt-in service, and not all users choose to activate it.",
      "The demand was first reported by the Washington Post, quoting sources familiar with the matter, and the BBC has spoken to similar contacts.",
      "The Home Office said then: \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.\"",
      "Apple declined to comment, but says on its website that it views privacy as a \"fundamental human right\".",
      "The order has been served by the Home Office under the Investigatory Powers Act, which compels firms to provide information to law enforcement agencies.",
      "Under the law, the demand by the Home Office cannot be made public.",
      "Senator Wyden and Congressman Biggs say agreeing to the request would \"undermine Americans' privacy rights and expose them to espionage by China, Russia and other adversaries\".",
      "They state that Apple does not make different versions of its encryption software for each country it operates in and, therefore, Apple customers in the UK will use the same software as Americans.",
      "\"If Apple is forced to build a backdoor in its products, that backdoor will end up in Americans' phones, tablets, and computers, undermining the security of Americans' data, as well as of the countless federal, state and local government agencies that entrust sensitive data to Apple products.\"",
      "The move by the UK government has stunned experts and worried privacy campaigners, with Privacy International calling it  an \"unprecedented attack\" on the private data of individuals.",
      "However the US government has previously asked Apple to break its encryption as part of criminal investigations.",
      "In 2016, Apple resisted a court order to write software which would allow US officials to access the iPhone of a gunman - though this was resolved after the FBI were able to successfully access the device.",
      "That same year, the US dropped a similar case after it was able to gain access by discovering the passcode of an alleged drug dealer.",
      "Similar cases have followed, including in 2020, when Apple refused to unlock iPhones of a man who carried out a mass shooting at a US air base. The FBI later said it had been able to \"gain access\" to the phones.",
      "It is understood that the UK government does not want to start combing through everybody's data.",
      "Rather it would want to access it if there were a risk to national security - in other words, it would be targeting an individual, rather than using it for mass surveillance.",
      "Authorities would still have to follow a legal process, have a good reason and request permission for a specific account in order to access data - just as they do now with unencrypted data.",
      "Apple has previously said it would pull encryption services like ADP from the UK market rather than comply with such government demands - telling Parliament it would \"never build a back door\" in its products.",
      "WhatsApp, owned by Meta, has also previously said it would choose being blocked over weakening message security.",
      "But even withdrawing the product from the UK might not be enough to ensure compliance - the Investigatory Powers Act applies worldwide to any tech firm with a UK market, even if they are not based there."

    "story": [
      "French President Emmanuel Macron has used AI-generated deepfake videos to publicise the start of the AI Action Summit taking place in Paris.",
      "In a video posted on his social media accounts, Macron reacts to a montage of deepfaked videos of himself in popular films and TV series by saying \"nicely done\".",
      "Videos of Macron inserted into popular media, using AI, have been circulating on French social media for the past few months.",
      "In October, he told Variety that deepfakes \"can be a form of harassment\" for some people.",
      "Some experts have questioned the use of the deepfakes, saying normalising them makes it harder to spot fake news.",
      "The montage of deepfakes, which has been seen millions of times across the president's Instagram, X and TikTok accounts, shows him inserted into a 1980s euro disco hit, an influencer's hair tutorial and the action hero TV show MacGyver.",
      "Videos such as these have been popular of French social media for a while, so this is Macron acknowledging that he has become a meme among some social media circles.",
      "Then the real Macron says: \"It's pretty well done, it made me laugh.\"",
      "\"But more seriously, with artificial intelligence, we can do some very big things: change healthcare, energy, life in our society,\" the 47-year-old president said.",
      "He adds: \"France and Europe must be at the heart of this revolution to seize every opportunity and also to promote our own principles.\"",
      "The video was posted ahead of a two-day global AI summit starting in Paris on Monday.",
      "The aim of the summit is to unite world leaders, tech executives, and academics to examine AI's impact on society, governance, and the environment.",
      "\"President Macron's deepfake might seem like harmless fun to promote the AI Summit in Paris, but it is not in general a good thing,\" says Paul McKay, principal analyst at technology consultancy Forrester.",
      "\"Normalising deepfakes in this way should not be encouraged as it continues the difficulty with telling what is real and what isn't, and is ultimately helping to establish what is fact from fiction.\"",
      "Dr Richard Whittle from Salford Business School also warns of the risk of \"normalising\" deepfakes videos, \"both on social media and by scammers\".",
      "He adds: \"It is great to bring attention to this threat, but doing it in a way that shows how easy it is to create deepfakes risks their wider adoption.\"",
      "Prof Philip Howard, president of the International Panel on the Information Environment, says AI is increasingly being used \"in innovative, sometimes playful ways, as demonstrated by President Macron's recent video.\"",
      "But he adds: \"These kinds of videos are often released when the guidelines on public communication are not clear.\"",
      "There has been some debate in the French media over whether Macron should be trivialising deepfake videos when they can be used for harm.",
      "In October, Macron told Variety deepfakes \"can disinform, which can upset our democracies\".",
      "He said they should be regulated \"by imposing responsibility on the people who disseminate this content to moderate it\".",
      "The EU's newly implemented AI Act, which regulates the use of artificial intelligence, has faced criticism at the Summit for stifling innovation.",

      "The offer tabled at $97.4bn is much lower than the $157bn OpenAI was valued at in its latest funding round in October last year. Talks over a further funding round reportedly value it now at $300bn.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 00:08:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Researchers have given a robot a powerful radio-based vision system which can see through smoke.",
    "story": [
      "If you want to find out whether your robot can see through smoke, well, you're going to need some smoke.",
      "But a University of Pennsylvania student got a shock when they began setting up a late night experiment to test such a robot.",
      "Shortly after flicking the switch on the smoke machine, a loud fire alarm went off.",
      "\"The whole building got triggered,\" says Mingmin Zhao of the University of Pennsylvania, smiling. \"My student called me. He was very surprised.\"",
      "The incident was a minor setback for the team developing a robot equipped with a innovative radio-based sensing system.",
      "Radio waves could allow robots or autonomous vehicles to see through thick smoke, intense rain \u2013 or even around corners. Such waves can even detect concealed weapons.",
      "But simulating visual imagery based on radio waves is an unusual approach for robots and autonomous vehicles. Much more established in those fields are regular optical cameras, light detection and ranging (Lidar), and other sensors.",
      "However, Prof Zhao and his students have developed a potentially powerful way for robots to see using radio waves.",
      "Of course radar, which uses radio waves, has been used for decades to track aircraft, ships and the weather.",
      "But the spinning array on Prof Zhao's robot throws radio waves in all directions.",
      "An on-board artificial intelligence (AI) system then builds a 3D view of the environment with this information.",
      "\"What we have been trying to do here is basically help robots obtain superhuman vision \u2013 to see in scenarios where human eyes or traditional visual sensors cannot,\" explains Prof Zhao.",
      "He suggests the technology could help a future search-and-rescue robot save people from a burning building.",
      "Subsequent tests of the bot used a clear plastic box full of smoke placed around the its spinning equipment, in order to avoid triggering any nearby fire alarms.",
      "Although humans can't see them, radio waves are a form of light in the sense that they are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, which also includes X-rays and gamma rays. Only a small part the spectrum is classed as visible light.",
      "Being light, radio waves can reflect off surfaces and materials, though in a slightly different way to visible light. Prof Zhao and his colleagues have designed their robot so that it can sense these radio wave reflections.",
      "The crucial factor here is that radio waves are much longer than visible light waves meaning they are not blocked by tiny smoke particles.",
      "Prof Zhao says he has also been working on adapting the technology so that the robot can see part of the way round a corner. Think of it like a hall of mirrors, he suggests, just for radio waves rather than visible light.",
      "\"It's really very interesting work and quite impressive,\" says Friedemann Reinhard at the University of Rostock in Germany, who was not involved in the work. In 2017, Prof Reinhard and colleagues described how Wi-Fi signals could allow spies to see into private rooms.",
      "One slight limitation is that the spinning array cannot, by definition, see in all directions at once. Prof Reinhard says that a lot of data processing carried out by the system appears necessary to clean up the image that results from this spinning device.",
      "However, the robot sends out radio waves in the millimetre wave band (waves that are between one and ten millimetres long). This is the same technology used for some 5G installations.",
      "\"That's potentially very attractive, it's a very well understood, cheap technology,\" says Prof Reinhard. \"I certainly would love to see a self-driving car driving only on radar.\"",
      "But it is possible to avoid using spinning radio-emitting devices to get a full picture, says Fabio da Silva, founder and chief executive of US firm Wavsens, which is also developing radio-based sensing technology.",
      "\"We created an algorithm that allows you to sense the entire space instantaneously and continuously so we don't have to spin our antennas,\" he says.",
      "He describes the system as akin to echolocation, used by bats. It sends out radio waves and \"listens\" to how the waves come back, which reveals the shape of whatever they have hit.",
      "Some researchers have used radio waves to detect concealed weapons such as hidden handguns and knives.",
      "Radio waves can even \"fingerprint\" the details of a room. Then, if scanned again later, this would reveal whether any objects in the room have been moved.",
      "Last year, scientists in Germany proposed that countries use this method to scrutinise other countries' management of their nuclear weapons stockpiles. It would be one way of knowing whether someone had been moving the warheads around, for example.",
      "Separately, Luana Olivieri at Loughborough University has explored using a different form of non-visible electromagnetic radiation, terahertz waves. These are shorter than radio waves but longer than visible light waves. \"This wavelength is particularly unexplored,\" says Dr Olivieri.",
      "It is possible to see through objects and analyse materials using this form of radiation, she adds. Such a system could even, in theory, identify specific drugs by detecting their chemical structure.",
      "But while seeing through materials could help a rescue bot find a trapped person in some future disaster, it also has other applications. Police forces and militaries have access to radio-based technology that allows them to see through doors and walls, to some extent.",
      "\"Warfighting is definitely one market that it caters to. It can be used to find and kill someone,\" says Mr da Silva. He has exhibited Wavsens' technology to the US Department of Defense and the Israeli Ministry of Defense, he says.",
      "And yet these applications are not entirely surprising, suggests Prof Reinhard, who points out that a range of emerging technologies have, in principle, made it easier to detect and attack people.",
      "\"Maybe radar sounds scary \u2013 but drones and cheap cameras are the much more dangerous thing,\" he says."

      "The swap came days after Hamas said it would pause the release of hostages, accusing Israel of violating the terms of the deal - an allegation denied by Israel.",
      "Israel, backed by US President Donald Trump, said \"intense\" fighting would resume unless the hostages were handed over. Hamas later said it remained committed to the ceasefire, and that Israel was \"responsible for any complications or delays\".",

    "story": [
      "Mouldy half-finished food on bunk beds, discarded military uniforms and abandoned weapons - these are the remnants of an abrupt retreat from this base that once belonged to Iran and its affiliated groups in Syria.",
      "The scene tells a story of panic. The forces stationed here fled with little warning, leaving behind a decade-long presence that unravelled in mere weeks.",
      "Iran was Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's most critical ally for more than 10 years. It deployed military advisers, mobilised foreign militias, and invested heavily in Syria's war.",
      "Its elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) built deep networks of underground bases, supplying arms and training to thousands of fighters. For Iran, this was also part of its \"security belt\" against Israel.",
      "We are near Khan Shaykhun town in Idlib province. Before Assad's regime fell on 8 December, it was one of the key strategic locations for the IRGC and its allied groups.",
      "From the main road, the entrance is barely visible, hidden behind piles of sand and rocks. A watchtower on a hilltop, still painted in the colours of the Iranian flag, overlooks the base.",
      "A receipt notebook confirms the base's name: The Position of Martyr Zahedi -  named after Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a top IRGC commander who was assassinated in an alleged Israeli airstrike on Iran's consulate in Syria on 1 April, 2024.",
      "The supplies recently ordered - we found receipts for chocolates, rice, cooking oil - suggest daily life continued here until the last moments. But now the base has new occupants - two armed Uyghur fighters from Hayaat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist militant group whose leader Ahmed al-Sharaa has become the new interim president of Syria.",
      "The Uyghurs arrived suddenly in a military vehicle, asking for our media accreditation.",
      "\"Iranians were here. They all fled,\" one of them says, speaking in his mother tongue, a dialect of Turkish. \"Whatever you see here is from them. Even these onions and the leftover foods.\"",
      "Boxes full of fresh onions in the courtyard have now germinated.",
      "The base is a labyrinth of tunnels dug deep into white rocky hills. There are bunk beds in some rooms with no windows. The roof of one of the corridors is draped in fabric in the colours of the Iranian flag and there are a few Persian books on a rocky shelf.",
      "They left behind documents containing sensitive information. All in Persian, they have details of fighters' personal information, military personnel codes, home addresses, spouses' names and mobile phone numbers in Iran. From the names, it's clear that several fighters in this base were from the Afghan brigade that was formed by Iran to fight in Syria.",
      "Sources linked to Iran-backed groups told BBC Persian that the base houses mainly Afghan forces accompanied by Iranian \"military advisers\" and their Iranian commanders.",
      "Tehran's main justification for its military involvement in Syria was \"to fight against jihadi groups\" and to protect \"Shia holy shrines\" against radical Sunni militants.",

      "Yet, when the final moment came, Iran was unprepared. Orders for retreat reached some bases at the very last moment. \"Developments happened so fast,\" a senior member of an Iran-backed Iraqi paramilitary group tells me. \"The order was to just take your backpack and leave.\"",
      "Multiple sources close to the IRGC told the BBC that most of the forces had to flee to Iraq, and some were ordered to go to Lebanon or Russian bases to be evacuated from Syria by the Russians.",
      "An HTS fighter, Mohammad al Rabbat, had witnessed the group's advance from Idlib to Aleppo and Syria's capital Damascus.",
      "He says they thought their operation would take \"about a year\" and best, they'd \"capture Aleppo in three to six months\". But to their surprise, they entered Aleppo in a matter of days.",
      "The regime's rapid downfall was brought about by a chain of events after Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel.",
      "That attack led to an escalation of Israeli air strikes against the IRGC and Iran-backed groups in Syria and a war against another key Iranian ally \u2013 the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, whose leader was killed in an air strike.",
      "This \"situation of psychological collapse\" for Iran and Hezbollah was central to their downfall, says 35-year-old fighter Rabbat.",
      "But the most crucial blow came from within: there was a rift between Assad and his Iran-linked allies, he says.",
      "\"There was a complete breakdown of trust and military co-operation between them. IRGC-linked groups were blaming Assad of betrayal and believing that he is giving up their locations to Israel.\"",
      "As we pass through Khan Shaykhun, we come across a street painted in the colours of the Iranian flag. It leads to a school building that was being used as an Iranian headquarters.",
      "On the wall at the entrance of the toilets, slogans read: \"Down with Israel\" and \"Down with the USA\".",
      "It was evident that these headquarters were also evacuated at short notice. We found documents classified as \"highly sensitive\".",
      "Abdullah, 65, and his family are among the very few locals who stayed and lived here alongside the IRGC-led groups. He says this life was hard.",
      "His house is only a few metres away from the headquarters and in between, there are deep trenches with barbed wire.",
      "\"Movement at night was prohibited,\" he says.",
      "His neighbour's home was turned into a military post. \"They sat there with their guns pointing at the road, treating us all as suspects,\" he recalls.",
      "Most of the fighters didn't even speak Arabic, he says. \"They were Afghans, Iranians, Hezbollah. But we referred to them all as Iranians because Iran was controlling them.\"",
      "Abdullah's wife Jourieh says she is happy that the \"Iranian militias\" have left, but still remembers the \"stressful\" moment before their withdrawal. She had thought they would be trapped in crossfire as Iran-backed groups were fortifying their positions and getting ready to fight, but then \"they just vanished in a few hours\".",
      "\"This was an occupation. Iranian occupation,\" says Abdo who, like others, has just returned here with his family after 10 years. His house had also become a military base.",
      "I observed this anger towards Iran and a softer attitude towards Russia in many conversations with Syrians.",
      "I asked Rabbat, the HTS fighter, why this was.",
      "\"Russians were dropping bombs from the sky and other than that, they were in their bases while Iranians and their militias were on the ground interacting. People were feeling their presence, and many weren't happy with it,\" he explained.",
      "This feeling is reflected in Syria's new rulers' policy towards Iran.",
      "The new authorities have put a ban on Iranian nationals, alongside Israelis, entering Syria. But there is no such ban against Russians.",
      "Iran's embassy, which was stormed by angry protesters after the fall of the regime, remains closed.",
      "The reaction of Iranian officials towards developments in Syria has been contradictory.",
      "While supreme leader Ali Khamenei called on \"Syrian youths\" to \"resist\" those who \"have brought instability\" to Syria, Iran's foreign ministry has taken a more balanced view.",
      "It says the country \"backs any government supported by the Syrian people\".",
      "In one of his first interviews, Syria's new leader Sharaa described their victory over Assad as an \"end of the Iranian project\". But he hasn't ruled out having a \"balanced\" relationship with Tehran.",
      "For the moment, though, Iran is not welcome in Syria. After years of expanding its military presence, everything Tehran built is now in ruins, both on the battlefield and, it seems, in the eyes of a large part of Syria's public.",
      "Back at the abandoned base, Iran's military expansion was still under way even in the last days. Next to the camp were more tunnels under construction, apparently the beginnings of a field hospital. The cement on the walls was still wet and the paint fresh.",

      "Google says this data is already widely used by other companies, and it continues to encourage responsible data use.",
      "However the company had previously come out strongly against this kind of data collection, saying in a 2019 blog that fingerprinting \"subverts user choice and is wrong.\"",
      "But in a post announcing the new rule changes, Google said the way people used the internet - such as devices like smart TVs and consoles - meant it was harder to target ads to users using conventional data collection, which users control with cookie consent.",

      "What is fingerprinting?",
      "Fingerprinting collects information about a person's device and browser and puts it together to create a profile of that person.",
      "The information is not explicitly collected in order to advertise to people, but it can be used to target specific ads based on that user's data.",
      "For example, a person's screen size or language settings are legitimately needed in order to display a website properly.",
      "But when that is combined with their time zone, browser type, battery level - and many other data points - it can create a unique combination of settings which makes it easier to work out who is using a web service.",
      "These details along with someone's IP address - the unique identifier used by internet devices - were previously prohibited by Google for ad targeting.",
      "Privacy campaigners say that unlike cookies, which are small files stored on a local device, users have little control over whether they send fingerprinting information to advertisers.",
      "\"By explicitly allowing a tracking technique that they previously described as incompatible with user control, Google highlights its ongoing prioritisation of profits over privacy,\" said Lena Cohen, staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.",

      "Mr Wallace says allowing fingerprinting represents a shift in the industry.",
      "\"Fingerprinting feels like it's taking a much more business-centric approach to the use of consumer data rather than a consumer-centric approach,\" he says.",
      "\"This sort of flip-flopping is, in my opinion, detrimental to that route that the industry seemed to be taking towards this idea of really putting consumer privacy at the forefront.\"",
      "He adds that he hopes ad tech companies conclude \"that it isn't the appropriate way to use consumer data,\" but expects them to look at fingerprinting as an option in order to better target adverts.",
      "Advertising is the lifeblood of the internet business model, and allow many websites to be freely available to users without them having to directly pay to access them.",

    "story": [
      "For the final 15km (9.3 miles) of the journey from Toulouse to the hamlet of Les Pequi\u00e8s, you travel on narrow winding roads through hilly, dense woodlands. Without a reliable GPS system you can get lost very quickly, especially at night.",
      "I expected the home of Andrew and Dawn Searle, the British couple found dead earlier this month, to be remote. That's the suggestion from the photos of the crime scene I had seen. But I was surprised when I arrived to find it well within shouting distance of several homes.",
      "It's an important detail because Dawn's partly naked body was discovered outside the front of the house on Thursday morning last week. The prosecutor in charge of the case, Nicolas Rigot-Muller, said she had severe head wounds caused by a blunt weapon. Any screams would have been heard very clearly by neighbours.",
      "Her husband's body was found hanging inside the back of the house. The prosecutor says no weapon has been found, that there's no obvious sign of a burglary nor evidence that Andrew put up a fight, nor of a sex crime.",
      "A friend discovered Dawn's body when she came around to the house with her dog. The couple had two big dogs of their own, and they often walked with the friend or several other dog owners I talked to in the quiet hamlet.",
      "One woman, B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte, said the couple were \"absolutely adorable, we would often meet like this simply walking our dogs around the village\".",
      "\"We are very shocked, of course we are,\" she said.",
      "Lydie, a butcher, sells her produce at local markets with her husband. Their property overlooks the Searle's home, just a fallow field separates them.",
      "\"They were a great couple who smiled a lot and since I once lived in England I was able to talk to them in English,\" she told me. \"They were well integrated and every year invited everyone over for a party.\"",
      "But not everyone I approached wanted to talk. Their looks give away that this is a very difficult moment for this rural community in the glare of a criminal investigation.",
      "The railroad crossing next to the village doesn't have safety barriers, just a stop sign, which tells you how little traffic there is here normally. Now, you can feel the presence of the Gendarmerie, the branch of the French military which is leading the investigation.",
      "While I was providing live coverage for BBC Scotland a large car with tinted windows drove past me slowly, inside four stony-faced officers from the Toulouse homicide and organised crime branch.",
      "There is no question locals are scared. Several officers from the Gendarmerie photographed our car and asked to see our ID cards and urged us to be discreet. They said the residents were frightened and that their presence was partly to reassure them.",
      "There is bright yellow Gendarmerie tape strapped to the front gate of the Searle's home. The dogs are gone and their swimming pool has a cover over it. Two large candles have been lit in the driveway and a leaflet taped to the gate has a phone number for anyone who feels they need psychological counselling or moral support, provided by local social services. The same leaflet has been taped to a community board in the centre of the hamlet.",
      "The Searle couple retired to this region five years ago, and other mailboxes in the hamlet indicate they are not the only expatriates in the region. This isn't surprising: there are no official statistics but in the time I have been based in Toulouse, Foreign Office staff have told me at various times they believe around 30,000 Brits live full-time in the south west, making it the biggest British expat population in France outside of Paris.",
      "On top of that tens of thousands more have holiday homes in this region, called Occitanie, which is one of the fastest growing areas of France, attracting people from not just the UK but Belgium, the Netherlands and Paris.",
      "What attracts them here is the quality of life, wide open spaces, relatively cheap property and achingly beautiful countryside and architecture.",
      "The nearby town of Villefranche-de-Rouergue has one of the most beautiful medieval stone arcade-lined central squares in a region teeming with them. In summer, an open-air market in the square is crammed with holiday makers, including many Brits, carrying woven baskets filled with local produce.",
      "Various conspiracy theories circulate about how the couple died \u2013 I've been asked about them by countless French national TV and radio media outlets. But all we know for sure is that the prosecutor and his team are still trying to determine, as he reiterated to me on Wednesday night, \"whether the tragedy resulted from a domestic crime followed by suicide or involved a third party\".",
      "Ever since the deaths I've been speaking to the prosecutor leading the case, who revealed to me late this week that he was handing over the investigation to a senior judge in Montpellier with more resources available.",
      "I asked him if that means he was leaning towards the idea that the Searle couple were both murdered.",
      "He replied that he was not ruling anything out. He added that if they were murdered, and it goes to trial, he would lead the prosecution.",
      "Dr Remy Sevigne, the psychologist who answers the counselling hotline from the leaflets, told me that so far around a dozen people had called him for some sort of support. They were all local, he said, and all knew the couple personally.",

      "The controversial order has also brought back into the spotlight the issue of marital rape in a country which has stubbornly refused to criminalise it.",
      "Earlier this week, a high court judge in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh set free a 40-year-old man who was convicted by a trial court in 2019 of rape and unnatural sex with his wife, who died within hours of the alleged assault.",

      "\"It has shaken us to the core. This needs to change and change quickly.\"",

      "She added that this is not the first time a court has given such a judgement, and there is always anger.",
      "\"This time, the outrage is more because it is so gruesome and the woman died.\"",

      "A dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence.",
      "While convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated \"the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation\" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum.",
      "Justice Vyas, however, saw matters differently \u2013 he questioned the \"sanctity\" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India.",

      "The agency remains on \"high alert\" after the incident, with its director general Rafael Grossi saying there is \"no room for complacency\".",
      "Mr Titarchuk told Ukraine's state news agency that \"the situation is under control\".",
      "A catastrophic explosion at Chernobyl in 1986 sent a plume of radioactive material into the air, triggering a public health emergency across Europe.",
      "While the immediate disaster was mitigated and an area where people were told not to live established, the incident saw a rise in cancer rates in the surrounding population.",
      "The radiation shield is designed to prevent further radioactive material leaking out over the next century. It measures 275m (900ft) wide and 108m (354ft) tall and cost $1.6bn (\u00a31.3bn) to construct.",

      "The shield \"was never built to withstand external drone attack\", he told the BBC, but a \"complex piece of decommissioning kit\" built to contain the radioactive materials inside and to help safely deconstruct the broken reactor.",
      "The strike appeared to hit the maintenance system of a crane designed to remotely take the reactor apart, he said.",
      "There appears to be \"pretty serious\" damage to the outer and inner cladding, he added, but said a fuller assessment of the damage will be needed before the bank can determine its costs.",
      "Mr Evans said the mission to build the shelter was the \"world's largest ever collaboration on nuclear safety\", with more than 40 counties working together on it.",
      "\"Ever since the start of the war, it's been tragic to see that international co-operation undermined by reckless acts,\" he added.",

      "The rise comes after the US Supreme Court reversed a ruling in 2022 that made abortion up to foetal viability a national right, allowing individual states to decide on whether to allow the procedure.",
      "Alison Gemmill, co-leader of the study, said \"restrictive abortion policies\" could be \"reversing decades of progress\" in reducing infant deaths across the US.",
      "The study, published this week by researchers from the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, found an increase in mortality rates for babies born with congenital issues, as well as among groups where death rates already were higher than average.",
      "This included black infants, as well as for babies whose parents were unmarried, younger, did not attend college, and for those living in southern states.",

      "India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has hailed a \"mega partnership\" with the US, as he and US President Donald Trump agreed on a deal for Delhi to import more American oil and gas.",
      "Modi's two-day visit comes as Trump recently ordered that all the US'  trading partners - including India - should face sweeping reciprocal tariffs.",
      "While both men praised each other's leadership, Trump criticised India for having some of the highest trade tariffs in the world, calling them a \"big problem\".",
      "The Indian leader, seeking to soften impending trade barriers, said he was open to reducing tariffs on US goods, repatriating undocumented Indian nationals and buying military fighter jets from the US.",

      "Trump also added that India would be \"purchasing a lot of our oil and gas\" in an effort to close the trade deficit between both countries.",

      "\"The US is the largest export market for India's goods and services, which underscores the administration's willingness to pre-emptively smoothen trade relations and offer concessions to narrow the bilateral trade deficit that the US runs with India,\" she said.",

      "\"Reciprocal tariffs are likely to follow on India too at some stage. Hopefully for India, they won't turn out to be larger than expected,\" said Dr Palit.",
      "Trump also added that the US would increase sales of military hardware to India by millions of dollars, eventually supplying Delhi with F-35 fighter jets.",
      "The two also spoke about immigration - another pain point in bilateral relations - with Trump announcing that the US would extradite a man who allegedly plotted 2008 Mumbai terror attack to \"face justice in India\".",
      "Modi thanked Trump for allowing the extradition and vowed to accept repatriations of Indian nationals illegally living in the US.",

      "Shortly before his meeting with Modi, Trump had ordered his advisers to calculate broad new tariffs on US trading partners around the globe, warning they could start coming into effect by 1 April.",
      "He acknowledged the risks of his tariff policy but argued the policy would boost American manufacturing and the country would be \"flooded with jobs\".",

Pete Hegseth, who had no previous experience running a military or government or agency, was a Fox News weekend presenter and former National Guard major who aligns strongly with Trump's thinking and agenda.",

This may well be deliberate - Donald Trump using the \"madman\" theory of foreign relations - often attributed to former Republican President Richard Nixon.",

      "All the country's national sports teams are also nicknamed after the iconic bird, but in recent years it has gone into decline and conservationists say it may face extinction if more is not done to protect it.",
      "The bird is protected by law - it stipulates a life sentence and/or a fine of 20bn Ugandan shillings ($5m; \u00a34m) for those found to have killed one.",
      "Going back centuries, local Buganda cultural superstition also protected the elegant fowl, which was seen as a symbol of wealth, good fortune and longevity.",
      "It was believed that if one killed a crane, its kith and kin would flock to the killer's home, hold vigil and mourn by collectively honking until the person went mad or even died.",
      "\"Such stories instilled fear, and cranes would be respected and revered and not killed,\" Jimmy Muheebwa, a senior conservationist at Nature Uganda, a local non-governmental organisation (NGO), told the BBC.",
      "But for farmers in western Uganda, where the cranes mostly hang out, that fear has dissipated and often it is only conservationists who appear to know about the ban on killing them.",
      "\"I really don't see any value in these birds because all they do is raid our plantations and eat our crops. We are worried about food security in this area,\" Tom Mucunguzi, a maize farmer from a village near Mbarara city in Western Region, told the BBC.",
      "Another farmer near Mbarara, Fausita Aritua, agreed, saying when she goes to her maize plot she spends the whole day chasing away the cranes - and if she cannot get there, she tries to get someone else to stand guard.",
      "\"We no longer harvest as much as we used to do because these birds eat everything,\" she told the BBC.",
      "Also known as grey-crowned cranes, the birds are predominantly found in Uganda but are also in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe.",
      "They are non-migratory, but make local and seasonal movements depending on food resources, nest site availability and the weather.",
      "Standing at about 1m (3.2ft) tall, the waterfowl mostly live in wetland areas - riverbanks, around dams and open grassland - where they breed and feed on grass seeds, small toads, frogs, insects and other invertebrates.",
      "But with the increasing human population, the high demand for food is pushing farmers to cultivate in wetlands, leaving crested cranes with diminishing areas to call home.",
      "\"In eastern Africa, the population has declined terribly by over 80% in the last 25 years,\" Adalbert Ainomucunguzi, who leads the International Crane Foundation (ICF) in East Africa, told BBC.",
      "In the1970s, Uganda boasted a population of more than 100,000 crested cranes, but today that number has dwindled to a mere 10,000, according to Nature Uganda.",
      "This decline saw the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) put the crested crane on its red list of endangered bird species in 2012.",
      "\"Despite its serenity, beauty and popularity, the bird is facing a serious threat. It means that if no urgent measures are taken to reverse this trend, we might see the cranes pushed to extinction,\" Dan Sseruge, a Ugandan ornithologist, told the BBC.",
      "Around Mbarara we found it was difficult to track down the birds - and only saw them early in the morning just after dawn.",
      "Conservationists say they used to be much easier to find in the landscape surrounding Mbarara.",
      "Dozens of cranes have in recent years been found dead after they were poisoned by rice and maize farmers in Lwengo district, in south-central Uganda.",

      "Mr Tayebwa said he has been engaging farmers to use different deterrent methods like scarecrows to protect their crops from invading cranes.",
      "Farmers like Philip Ntare, from Lwengo, said the cranes were sometimes mistakenly poisoned after eating crops sprayed with agro-chemicals and other pesticides.",
      "\"I just chase them, because I grew up knowing the crested crane is not supposed to be killed. But government should consider compensating farmers for crop damage,\" he told the BBC.",
      "However, John Makombo, director of conservation at the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), said this was not possible.",
      "\"It is one of those precious species that have freedom to go anywhere and so unfortunately the government is not liable for any damage done by the cranes,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Sarah Kugonza, an ICF conservationist, said the cranes also face a host of other threats - not just from farmers. Without the protective cover of the wetlands, their chicks are more likely to be captured by eagles.",
      "Cranes are finding day by day that they are living in an increasingly hostile environment.",
      "\"Sometimes breeding areas are flooded and nowadays some cranes are killed by electricity lines when flying,\" Ms Kugonza told BBC.",
      "Their exceptional beauty has also put them at risk as people are increasingly capturing them to be pets, according to Mr Ainomucunguzi.",
      "But crested cranes, who can live for just over two decades, hardly ever breed in captivity as the birds are famously faithful.",
      "\"It is a highly monogamous bird as it pairs once, for life. This means that if one of them is killed or domesticated, the likelihood of finding a new mating partner is almost zero,\" said Mr Muheebwa.",
      "They attract a mate by dancing, bowing and jumping - and are often seen walking as couples or families. A pair will define their own territory and can be very aggressive to defend it.",
      "Scientifically called Balearica regulorum gibbericeps, the cranes also have unique nesting patterns as they usually return to the same location annually, often laying between two and five eggs that are incubated by both sexes for anywhere between 28 and 31 days.",
      "Any destruction to these nesting areas impacts on these breeding patterns.",
      "Their monogamy has also attracted the unwelcome attention of local traditional healers, who claim that the parts of crested crane may bring faithfulness from a partner - or good luck.",
      "\"Some people have been caught hunting cranes to take some of their body parts to witch doctors in a belief that they will get rich. Or, if you are a woman, your husband will never leave you,\" Mr Tayebwa from ICF said.",
      "This is also something conservationists are trying to counter - as well as alerting people to the law protecting cranes.",
      "And in an effort to reverse declining numbers, the Ugandan government and conservationist groups are now rallying communities to restore wetlands.",
      "President Yoweri Museveni, who comes from the Western Region, has been urging encroachers to vacate wetland areas and, according to local media, has declared 2025 a year of wetland conservation.",
      "The ICF has also recruited custodians to monitor and ensure that the cranes' breeding grounds are protected.",
      "Nature Uganda's Mr Muheebwa said these efforts were slowly helping to stabilise the situation but crane numbers remained \"very low\".",
      "For Mr Makombo, the UWA's future emphasis is going to be on setting an example when it comes to the law.",
      "\"We shall arrest and prosecute those who are poisoning the cranes,\" he said.",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Feb 2025 00:00:34 GMT",
    "summary": "As clips from Spain's Temptation Island go viral, the BBC speaks to the show's executive producer.",
    "story": [
      "Reality TV gold has a new three-word definition: \"Montoya, por favor!\"",
      "If you've been anywhere near social media over the past fortnight, you'll know the raw drama setting the internet ablaze this award season hasn't come from Hollywood, but the love tragedy played out in clips posted from Spanish reality TV show Temptation Island.",
      "Contestant Jose Carlos Montoya's spiralling meltdown at watching his girlfriend Anita cheat with another man is like an uncensored Love Island on steroids.",
      "In Temptation Island, couples are taken to a tropical island, separated and sent to separate villas filled with attractive singles ready to test their loyalty. In a final twist, every move made is recorded for the other half to see.",
      "Forced to watch a graphic real-time stream of the betrayal, Montoya's emotions swell until he snaps, breaking all the show's rules.",
      "Blind to the now infamous pleas of host Sandra Barneda (\"Montoya, por favor!\"), he rampages down the beach to confront the pair, tugging at his shorts in anguish as lightning streaks across the sky.",
      "A second clip shows the resulting confrontation: Anita flips the script, calling out Montoya's own indiscretions before collapsing in tears, begging for forgiveness.",
      "\"This is cinema,\" wrote one X user, posting a clip that has now been watched on the platform a staggering 224m times since 4 February.",
      "\"Montoya. the tension \u2026 you don't need to speak Spanish to understand, this is insane.\"",
      "Yet those behind Spain's Temptation Island see its success as more than just shock value. Executive producer Juanra Gonzalo tells me they are overjoyed by the \"completely unexpected\" global reaction, and he believes the show's appeal lies in its relatability.",
      "\"In Love Island, all the people are single. In Temptation Island, there are real couples, and they are putting their love at risk,\" he says. \"I think [audiences] know it too. These emotions and reactions cannot be faked.\"",
      "\"Everyone wants to know what their boyfriend or girlfriend is doing when they are not with them. We can imagine, but we don't know. Temptation Island lets the audience ask: 'what would I do in that situation?'\"",
      "The magic ingredient to making this work is careful casting. \"Montoya and Anita were perfect - they are very emotive and expressive,\" he says.",
      "Gonzalo calls Montoya, a singer by trade with previous TV experience, a \"special man\". At 31, he told casters he'd \"never experienced love like this before\", having been with Anita \"every day for a year\".",
      "\"She's a strong woman with a lot of character,\" Gonzalo adds.",
      "The Sun's senior showbiz reporter Lottie Hulme says the programme's \"authentic emotion\" sets it apart from competitors like Love Island, Love Is Blind, Married At First Sight and Dating Naked.",
      "Seeing such unfettered and raw emotion may stand out to British and American viewers, who have become used to glossy and well-worn competitive reality formats like Love Island and semi-scripted reality shows like Made in Chelsea.",
      "\"It was refreshing and almost shocking to see something so raw, because it's something that we just don't see on the reality TV shows in Britain nowadays,\" Hulme says.",
      "\"We're at a point with reality TV culture where we're wondering 'what if' - are contestants really being their authentic self\u2026 or are they after followings and a brand deal?\"",
      "Alongside constructed storylines, the commercialised reality TV to influencer pipeline has made existing formats feel \"predictable\" adds Hulme.",
      "Audience figures reflect this.",
      "Love Island is currently airing its All Stars edition on ITV2, which started last year. The 2024 final attracted 1.3m viewers - a sharp drop from the six million peak of its 2019 heyday.",
      "While this season's figures remain solid, even matching BBC Two's audience on launch night, the show now usually only dominates non-terrestrial channels.",
      "'Never allowed' on UK TV?",
      "A curious quirk of the Montoya phenomenon is that the Spanish show isn't available to watch in the UK - an irony that has only fuelled its illicit appeal on social media.",
      "Previous UK and US versions failed to take off, and production company Banijay says it does not presently plan to broadcast the Spanish version in the UK.",
      "After Montoya's meltdown caught the eye of Love Island host Maya Jama, she posted: \"They would never allow this on UK TV. For so many reasons. But it's one of the best things I've ever seen\".",
      "When asked why, she simply replied: \"people would complain\".",
      "Like Big Brother before it, Love Island has been the subject of complaints to Ofcom.",
      "A heated confrontation between 2021 Love Islanders Faye and Teddy over Teddy's behaviour in Casa Amor (a segment similar to Temptation Island's premise) sparked 25,000 Ofcom complaints.",
      "Despite the shocked reactions Gonzalo's show has provoked, he says it operates within strict boundaries, suitable for its primetime slot.",
      "\"Not everything we record is aired,\" he says. \"We are very careful - we only show a few seconds of sexual content.\"",
      "Temptation Island is just the latest in a string of particularly high-octane Spanish dating shows.",
      "Take Falso Amor (or Deep Fake Love), for instance. Currently streaming on Netflix, it intensifies the premise of Temptation Island by asking couples to decide whether videos of each other are real or highly convincing AI deepfakes.",
      "So is content which British audiences find shocking viewed differently in Spain?",
      "When I raise Love Island's Zara Holland being stripped of her Miss Great Britain title after having sex on the show in 2016, Gonzalo is shocked and welcomes the internet's more light-hearted reaction to Anita's sexual scenes.",
      "\"As in other countries, things in Spain are progressing from the past - this is positive for our view of women and sexuality\" he says, adding no gender should face double standards.",
      "Montoya 'given the right help'",
      "In the UK, there has been heightened scrutiny and awareness of the impact reality TV can have on cast members' mental health, following the deaths of several former contestants.",
      "When I press Gonzalo on this, given the intensity of Montoya and Anita's experience, he says a team of psychologists monitor contestants before, during, and after filming.",
      "Montoya received particular support after his beach escapade.",
      "\"We made sure he was not alone, that he had a safe space to process everything. It was important for us to provide him with the right help,\" he says.",
      "Looking ahead, Netflix is to relaunch an American version of the show next month.",
      "Gonzalo is up for the fight. He laughs at the internet's playful suggestion that the beach scene should win an Oscar, then adds: \"My team deserve all the awards. An Oscar. And a Bafta!\""

      "And its inclusion in a national inventory of cultural heritage currently being created looks set to reignite the jocular dispute.",
      "Antigua and Barbuda's traditional food is just one aspect of the work under way to preserve the twin isles' distinct features for posterity.",
      "The inventory will also include its unique dialect, bush medicine, games, crafts, architecture and boat-building techniques.",
      "The mammoth venture, being funded by the United Nations cultural body, Unesco, follows concerns that key elements of the country's cultural identity are being lost, explains project leader Dr Hazra Medica.",
      "\"There is no longer the traditional transmission of knowledge from older to younger people,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "\"Without that, we start to lose the sense of who we are. Outside influences can dilute indigenous culture and people fear that what is peculiarly Antiguan will be lost.\"",
      "More than two dozen specially trained data collectors have been tasked with interviewing residents from each parish, gathering stories, photos and information. The results will be meticulously entered into a publicly accessible database.",
      "Local author Joy Lawrence needed little encouragement to take part.",
      "The former schoolteacher's books focus heavily on the country's Creole/English dialect that weaves in many African words from Antiguans' ancestors.",
      "English may be the main language but patois, spoken at accelerated speed, is ubiquitous and routinely used to show kinship and camaraderie.",
      "\"When the British brought Africans here, they could not speak English and the British could not speak African languages. Because the Africans came from all over and spoke different languages, they could not even converse among themselves for the most part,\" Ms Lawrence says.",
      "\"To communicate, the Africans borrowed some vocabulary from the British and incorporated their own pronunciation and syntax to form a pidgin thing. Over the generations, it became perfected and developed structure and grammar.\"",
      "A couple of generations ago, Antiguan dialect was sneered at and children were commonly forbidden to speak it in school. There are still some who look down their nose at it today, Ms Lawrence scoffs.",
      "\"Our forebears worked hard to coin that language,\" she asserts. \"It's our first language; how can we not preserve what's ours? It's not a written language and we spell it any old how, but it has rhythm and I'm proud of it.\"",
      "The dialect is characterised by an \"economy of words\" and sparse pronouns, she continues.",
      "\"We don't waste time to say 'not at all'; we just say 'tarl'. Instead of 'come here', we say 'cumyah'. And we never say her or him; it's always she or he.\"",
      "In places such as school and church, dialect is used for \"emphasis, clarity and reinforcement\". \"Because we think in it,\" Ms Lawrence adds.",
      "Disagreements over the \"correct\" way of doing something is one reason for the decline of some cultural practices, Dr Medica believes.",
      "Varying methods of stirring \"fungee\", a cornmeal paste which also hails from the mother continent, and precisely what to add to it is another subject of friendly bickering.",
      "\"There's this idea that this is how it's done and should always be done. Sometimes younger people are turned off by not doing it 'right'.",
      "\"In the workshops, we saw the 'fungee war'. Antiguans say it should have okra in it, while Barbudans add peas, which made some gasp in shock,\" Dr Medica smiles.",
      "Novella Payne \u2013 who produces a range of teas, sauces and seasonings under her \"Granma Aki\" brand \u2013 learnt everything she knows from her mother and grandmother, but adds her \"own twist\" to time-honoured recipes.",
      "\"The seasoning is what sets Antiguan food apart \u2013 garlic, onion, thyme and seasoning peppers,\" she explains.",
      "Many of Ms Payne's creations feature local medicinal plants, long used to treat everything from coughs and fever to rashes and nausea. Soursop, lemongrass, noni and moringa regularly appear in her syrups and juices.",
      "\"Our food is delicious, nutritious and should be preserved because it's part of our culture and heritage,\" she adds.",
      "The project recently got under way in Antigua's sister isle, Barbuda, where Dwight Benjamin is striving to keep the art of traditional broom-making alive.",
      "Mr Benjamin uses palm leaves, which must be sun-dried for two days, to create the bristles before weaving them on to a stick crafted from a bay tree.",
      "The techniques were passed on to him by his grandfather and Mr Benjamin, an accountant by profession, is one of few people still making and selling the brooms.",
      "He says they remain in high demand among Barbuda's residents.",
      "\"I may be biased, but I find them more effective than store-bought brooms - you feel the difference when you use them. They cover more ground too,\" he says.",

      "By and large we filmed in an area of southern and central Gaza earmarked by Israel's army as a \"humanitarian zone\", where Palestinians were told to go for their own safety. Despite its designation, the zone itself was struck almost 100 times between May 2024 and January this year, according to analysis by BBC Verify. The Israel Defense Forces said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating there.",

One night it's in the CT scan room, another in the journalists' tent or the back of an ambulance.",

Last year, the chain served 500 per minute in the United States. The Frosty falls somewhere between soft serve and hard-packed ice cream, creating a frozen creamy treat that's stood the test of time.",

Instead of frozen pieces or chunks of cookie, Li and his team wound up developing a fudge-like cookie butter that can be swirled into a Frosty.",

Li said they initially thought about only offering one flavor, but decided that the swirl worked well in both.",

      "Dede was born a free Black man in New Orleans in 1827. He was educated and moved to France in 1855, leaving just before the Civil War. In France, he studied music at the Paris Conservatoire and performed at Bordeaux's Grand Theatre.

      "\"Lorne: The Man Who Invented Saturday Night Live,\"\u00a0by New Yorker articles editor Susan Morrison (to be published February 18 by Random House), is a biography of late-night comedy producer Lorne Michaels, who has guided \"Saturday Night Live\" for most of its 50 years. But it is also the history of a pop culture institution that has introduced phenomenal comic talents, rewritten the rules of live television, and captured or challenged the zeitgeist for a half-century.",

      "Prologue",
      "Every week at Saturday Night Live is just like every other week. Every week is the same because it's always intense, fueled by insanely hard work, full of triumphs and failures and backstage explosions, and because it's built around a guest host\u2014Jennifer Lopez or Lizzo or Elon Musk\u2014who often has no idea what they are doing. It has been Lorne Michaels's job for the last fifty years to make it seem as if they do, and to corral the egos and the talents on his staff into getting the show on the air, live. Since he created the show, in 1975, he has periodically tweaked and fine-tuned it, paying attention to how the cultural winds are drifting. But the formula has essentially remained the same. Michaels compares it to a Snickers bar: viewers expect a certain amount of peanuts, a certain amount of caramel, and a certain amount of chocolate. (\"There's a comfort level,\" he says.) The show has good years and bad years, like the New York Yankees, or the Dow, and the audience has come to feel something like ownership of it. Just about every person who has ever watched SNL believes that its funniest years were the ones when they were in high school. Michaels likes to say that everyone in the entertainment business has two jobs: their actual job and figuring out how to fix SNL. (When J. D. Salinger died, in 2010, letters surfaced in which even he griped about what was wrong with the show.)",
      "The show's cast members and writers have speculated for years about the secret behind Michaels's extraordinary tenure. \"It's him and Hitchcock,\" John Mulaney says. \"No one else has had this kind of longevity.\" Half of them believe that Michaels has repeatedly been able to remake the show for a new audience because he's a once-in-a-lifetime talent, a producer nonpareil. The other half wonders whether Michaels, gnomic and almost comically elusive, is a blank screen onto which they've all projected a lifetime of hopes and fears and dark jokes; whether he, like the cramped stages in SNL's Studio 8H, is just a backdrop for the ever-shifting brilliance of the country's best comic minds.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 14:44:47 -0500",
    "summary": "The beloved weekly magazine encompassing journalism, fiction, poetry and cartoons, is celebrating its centenary. New Yorker writer Kelefa Sanneh goes inside the magazine's history to explore its longevity, national reach, and idiosyncratic appeal.",
    "story": [
      "The New Yorker, the beloved weekly magazine, is celebrating its one-hundredth birthday. I have been a staff writer at the magazine since 2008, and Bruce Diones has been at The New Yorker since, well, not quite since the beginning. \"1978,\" he said. \"I was in the cradle. They left me on the doorstep and I came.\"",
      "Asked his title, Diones replied , \"I don't really have one. I aid and abet all the crimes that happen here. I'm that guy that's always around.\"",
      "\"An expert on both the people and the magazine?\"",
      "\"That's right.\"",
      "\"You can tell me what we published in 1979, but you can also tell me who's mad at whom?\"",
      "\"Yeah, and I can tell you why they're mad at them and why that thing in '79 didn't work out!\" he laughed.",
      "The New Yorker is known for its reporting, and for its idiosyncrasies. Each issue also includes cartoons, a short story, and a few poems. The front cover features not a photograph, but a painting.",
      "One of Diones' many responsibilities is to organize the magazine's archive. \"We have every magazine, every issue since the first one. We have scrapbooks, papers and all sorts of weird little ephemera from the people's offices. It's kind of fun, interesting stuff.\"",
      "The New Yorker may be America's leading literary magazine, but its story starts with an artist: Rea Irvin. \"All the artwork in The New Yorker is based on his work,\" Diones said.",
      "Irvin did the cover of the first issue published on February 21, 1925, of a fancy young man in a top hat, inspecting a butterfly. His name is Eustace Tilley, and he became the magazine's mascot, for better or worse.",
      "\"At long last, I'm gonna tell you that I'm ambivalent about Eustace Tilley,\" said editor David Remnick. \"Because some people look at it and they think it's a symbol of snobbery, or overweening pride. When it began, it was meant to be a joke about snobbery.\"",
      "Remnick was a 39-year-old reporter when, in 1998, he was named the fifth editor of The New Yorker. His job is to keep the writers happy, and, as he sometimes reminds me, productive. His job is also to figure how, and how much, to modernize a 100-year-old magazine that once specialized in light-hearted articles about Manhattan society.",
      "In that first issue of the magazine, founding editor Harold Ross wrote, \"It is not edited for the old lady in Dubuque.\"",
      "I asked, \"What did he have against Iowa?\"",
      "\"I don't know,\" Remnick laughed. \"To him, Dubuque included Queens, Los Angeles \u2026\"",
      "The magazine's reach, now, extends far past Manhattan. \"We have more readers in the state of California than we do in the state of New York, including the old lady in Dubuque,\" Remnick said. \"It's a magazine that has deep, deep reporting, and prides itself on accuracy and fact-checking.\"",
      "Fergus McIntosh leads the magazine's battalion of fact-checkers \u2013 more than two dozen.",
      "So, what is a fact-checker? \"Somebody who takes a story submitted by someone like you and, before we publish it, makes sure that it is accurate, balanced, fair, and as complete as it can be,\" McIntosh said.",
      "\"Fair? That seems like a hard thing to figure out,\" I said.",
      "\"I know that's hard for you. It's not hard for us,\" McIntosh laughed.",
      "And everything gets checked \u2013 not just articles, but also poems, short stories, even cartoons. Teresa Mathew, the department's associate director, remembers one cartoon about a penguin meeting his girlfriend's parents. \"He says, 'We prefer the term Arctic-American,'\" she recalled. \"And this is factually incorrect, because penguins live in the Antarctic.\"",
      "\"But Antarctic-American wouldn't have been as funny,\" I said.",
      "\"Not pithy enough, no,\" said Mathew. \"All of my emails to the wonderful cartoon editor about any potential issues I find, almost always I get a response of, 'Thank you so much, Teresa. We will not be taking that change.'\"",
      "Somewhere along the way, The New Yorker became a serious magazine, publishing writers ranging from J.D. Salinger to James Baldwin, from the film critic Pauline Kael to the investigative journalist Ronan Farrow.",
      "The New York Public Library will celebrate the magazine's anniversary with an exhibition later this month.",
      "So, what is The New Yorker in 2025? Remnick said, \"It's not just one thing. Sports illustrated was about one thing, and it's easy to understand, for advertisers and readers. [The New Yorker] is a more complicated thing. It may be a little bit tricky to invite people in.\"",
      "\"Is The New Yorker itself more political than it used to be?\"",
      "\"I think it's certainly more political than when it started out, that's for damn sure,\" said Remnick.",
      "\"Would it be wrong to describe The New Yorker as a liberal magazine?\"",
      "\"No, I don't think it would be wrong. I think there a wide range. I don't think it's an assertively ideological publication. I think reporting is at its center more than finger-wagging.\"",
      "These are anxious times for the media industry, and The New Yorker is not immune. The magazine had a round of layoffs in 2023. But The New Yorker has a steady base of around 1.2 million subscribers, many of whom read it on their phones. Remnick said, \"How do we write shorter, faster things, as well as do the other things? In addition to; it's not instead of. We have a pretty robust audio operation \u2013 four, five podcasts. We do video. But I'm thinking forward. I'm thinking about how do we have a New Yorker that has the possibility of celebrating 200 years? Because in American life, in the history of media, that's unusual. Just ask the people who used to read Life magazine.\"",
      "For Bruce Diones, The New Yorker's 100th birthday is a good excuse to revisit ancient history. He showed me a box left behind by a former employee named Fred Keefe: \"He was a little guy like me with a bow tie, and he would sit in the corner and type out 'letters to the editor' answers.\"",
      "One letter was a request to visit the magazine's offices. Keefe responded: \"Thank you for your letter. We're afraid there isn't much to see in our offices. The editors and writers are all shut away in little cubicles and are very upset if people pop in on them.\"",
      "In fact, those old editors and writers and artists and cartoonists are still here, in spirit, and also in these boxes. The party's been going for a hundred years, and new people are still being invited to join in.",
      "I said, \"maybe in another 100 years, someone will come and flip through whatever the newest version of that archives is?\"",
      "\"That's right, and I'm in it now,\" laughed Diones. \"And you're in it, too. That's kind of the thrill of it. You realize that, well, oh, this has always been going on, and we're all a part of it.\"",

      "Swift and Kelce have been a sports-and-entertainment power couple since early last season, when the four-time All-Pro tight end invited the now-14-time Grammy Award winner to watch him play in a matchup with the Bears. Kelce had famously tried to deliver a friendship bracelet to Swift when she played at Arrowhead Stadium, only to be thwarted.",
      "Their relationship blossomed as the Chiefs pursued their second consecutive Super Bowl last year, and Swift was part of the on-field celebration on a cold night in Baltimore when the Chiefs beat the Ravens to win the AFC championship.",
      "Then came Swift's star turn at the big game in Las Vegas.",
      "She was in the midst of her Eras Tour and had played a concert in Tokyo the same weekend. Swift made a mad dash from there to the airport, hopped a private jet to Los Angeles, and made it to Las Vegas with time to spare. Once inside Allegiant Stadium, fans and TV cameras watched Swift win a beer-chugging contest, party with celebrity friends such as Blake Lively and Lana Del Rey, and eventually make her way to the field following the Chiefs' 25-22 win over the 49ers.",
      "Kelce and Swift celebrated by locking lips as red and gold confetti fell around them like rain.",
      "There was no closely watched trip around the globe this week, though.",
      "Swift arrived in the Big Easy in time to join Kelce on a double date with Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany, on the players' night off Friday. The couples dined at Lilette, a French restaurant near the Garden District.",
      "On the eve of the big game, Swift was spotted with musicians Danielle and Alana Haim at Gianna Restaurant.",
      "The big question swirling Sunday was not whether Swift would make it to the game, like last year, but what could happen if she found herself on the field afterward, celebrating Kelce's third straight Super Bowl title and fourth overall. That didn't happen.",
      "The 35-year-old Kelce has been noncommittal about playing next year, and some within the Chiefs organization are bracing for his potential retirement. Kelce has been laying the groundwork for his post-playing career, building a lucrative podcast with his brother, retired Eagles center Jason Kelce, and appearing on \"Saturday Night Live\" and other TV shows.",
      "Then there's the question of whether Kelce might pop the question. According to BetMGM, those willing to gamble on his plans could get 8/1 odds that Kelce would propose to Swift with a Chiefs victory.",
      "The Chiefs were 19-3 with her in the crowd, including 9-0 this season. She had never seen them lose in the playoffs.",

    "story": [
      "Probationary workers across multiple federal health agencies in the Department of Health and Human Services received virtually identical letters Saturday evening informing them they would be terminated from their positions, sources told CBS News.",
      "\"Unfortunately, the Agency finds that you are not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency's current needs, and your performance has not been adequate to justify further employment at the Agency,\" read the letter obtained by CBS News.",
      "The letter was signed by Jeffrey Anoka, acting head of human resources for the Department of Health and Human Services. One health official told CBS News thousands of letters were sent out Saturday.",
      "Probationary workers are those that generally have less than a year on the job and are easier to fire than other federal staff.",
      "The move comes amid a government-wide effort to cut probationary workers by the Department of Government Efficiency task force, or DOGE, led by billionaire Elon Musk.",

      "Also not on the final list of cuts ordered by the Trump administration was the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service, the agency's \"disease detectives,\" CBS News learned. Officials overseeing the fellowship had initially warned health departments and those in their ranks that they would be halved.",
      "Fellowship programs elsewhere in the agency were not as lucky. Officials said CDC's Public Health Associate Program, which places recent graduates in health departments throughout the country, was cut.",

      "\"This isn't a haphazard effort of us axing whoever we can 'get away' with axing for the sake of it. This is a calculated effort to streamline bureaucracy,\" said the official.",
      "Calley Means, an adviser for newly sworn-in Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., defended the firings for reasons beyond cost savings, reiterating a criticism made during President Trump's presidential campaign that officials had not done enough to address drivers of sliding life expectancy in the U.S.",
      "\"It would be irrational not to make changes,\" Means wrote in a post to X.",
      "At the FDA, an employee said Saturday that scientists, engineers and an attorney had been among those terminated from the regulatory agency's ranks late Saturday.",
      "Cuts included parts of the FDA funded largely from fees that companies pay when they submit applications, not taxpayer dollars \u2014 like centers overseeing regulation of tobacco products and medical devices.",
      "The toll inflicted by this week's cuts stretches beyond probationary workers and fellows. Many contractors, who have fewer protections than agency staff, were suddenly told this week that they were being let go.",

Others had been on probation for staff roles after many years working for the same agency as a contractor.",

    "story": [
      "Ohio's health department confirmed Saturday that a farmer in the state was discharged from the hospital after being sickened by bird flu, marking the fourth American to have been hospitalized with the H5N1 virus.",
      "\"The individual had respiratory symptoms. He was previously hospitalized and has since been released,\" a spokesperson for Ohio's health department told CBS News in an email Saturday.",
      "Authorities in Ohio had previously refused to disclose the status of their bird flu case, which was first announced earlier this week in a man who had contact with sick poultry.",
      "News of the hospitalization comes a day after Wyoming announced the third U.S. hospitalization from bird flu, linked to exposure to an infected backyard flock.",
      "Wyoming's health department declined Saturday to release details of the patient's status, who is hospitalized in neighboring Colorado.",
      "\"We don't typically provide information on patient condition due to privacy concerns,\" spokesperson Kim Deti said in an email to CBS News.",
      "Deti said that the hospitalization in Colorado occurred within the last two weeks, \"just a couple of days\" after they had been exposed to sick poultry at their home in Wyoming's Platte County.",
      "The vast majority of human cases have been blamed on direct, often intensive exposure to sick cows or birds.",
      "Data reported so far by the CDC from testing labs suggests that this winter's record surge of influenza is being driven by seasonal strains of the virus, not human-to-human spread of a bird flu strain.",
      "However, investigations of a handful of human bird flu cases in the U.S. have so far not been able to identify a source of how they may have gotten sick.",
      "The first U.S. bird flu hospitalization was reported last year in Missouri, though health officials think the patient tested positive while hospitalized for other reasons, not bird flu. A second hospitalization was later reported in Louisiana, in a patient who died from the virus.",
      "Which bird flu strain sickened the new cases?",
      "It is unclear which strain of the H5N1 bird flu virus caused the Ohio and Wyoming cases. Answering that question has been a focus of experts and health officials for previous cases, as they track the evolution of the virus.",
      "Federal authorities usually take samples of the virus and analyze them for worrying mutations that might raise the risk of the virus spreading between humans or causing more severe disease.",
      "A spokesperson for Ohio's health department said that information was not immediately available. Wyoming has also not confirmed the genotype of their case, though the state's veterinarian says flocks in the county where the patient lived recently tested positive for the B3.13 strain of the virus.",
      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether that had occurred for these cases.",
      "Many human cases of bird flu in the U.S. to date have been in dairy workers after working with sick cows infected by the B3.13 strain of the H5N1 virus.",
      "Scientists suspect that B3.13 is less severe for humans. Until recently, it had been the only bird flu strain detected spreading between dairy herds and into some nearby poultry farms.",
      "But a new strain called D1.1 has grown to dominate the spread between wild migratory birds in recent months. That strain has also contributed to a surge of spillovers from wild birds to poultry flocks that have driven up egg prices nationwide.",
      "D1.1 was also behind the first confirmed U.S. fatality from bird flu, in the Louisiana patient. A child in Canada was also hospitalized with D1.1 last year.",
      "D1.1 has also spread at least twice now in recent weeks from birds to dairy herds, the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed Friday, dashing hopes that the spillover which started the B3.13 dairy herd outbreaks in late 2023 was a one-off.",

    "summary": "The NGO Doctors for America argued that HHS, CDC and FDA violated federal law in removing medical information from public-facing websites.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration to restore webpages and data that had been scrubbed in compliance with President Trump's executive order on gender ideology\u00a0while litigation moves forward.",
      "U.S. District Judge John Bates agreed to grant a temporary restraining order sought by the group Doctors for America, which argued that its members used the websites when treating patients and conducting research. The nonprofit organization said that the removal of the webpages by the Department of Health and Human Services and its components violated federal law.",
      "Bates found that the challengers were likely to succeed in their claims that the Department Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA acted unlawfully when they stripped medical information from public-facing websites.",
      "\"It bears emphasizing who ultimately bears the harm of defendants' actions: everyday Americans, and most acutely, underprivileged Americans, seeking healthcare,\" he wrote. Citing declarations from two doctors filed in the case, Bates said if they \"cannot provide these individuals the care they need (and deserve) within the scheduled and often limited time frame, there is a chance that some individuals will not receive treatment, including for severe, life-threatening conditions. The public thus has a strong interest in avoiding these serious injuries to the public health.\"",
      "His order directs the agencies to restore earlier versions of their websites by 11:59 p.m. Tuesday. It comes after Bates held a hearing on the matter Monday.",
      "Signed on his first day in office, Mr. Trump's executive order on gender ideology stated that the U.S. recognizes two sexes, male and female, and it directed agencies to remove \"all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.\"",
      "Days after the president issued his order, the Office of Personnel Management issued a memorandum ordering all agencies by 5 p.m. on Jan. 31 to take down all websites, social media accounts and other public-facing media \"that inculcate or promote gender ideology.\" In response to the memo, the CDC and FDA took offline numerous webpages and data sets, including recommendations on how physicians should treat sexually transmitted infections and adult immunization guidance.",
      "While the wording on some websites was adjusted to adhere to Mr. Trump's directive, allowing them to stay online, other information, like data from the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, was removed completely.",
      "The agency said in a banner on its main website that it was \"being modified to comply with President Trump's executive orders.\"",
      "Doctors for America filed its lawsuit against the health agencies on Feb. 4, alleging they violated a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process and another that requires federal agencies to ensure the public has \"timely and equitable access\" to their public information.",
      "The group argued in court papers that its members relied on the scrubbed information to provide treatment, conduct research and inform public health responses on topics like youth risk behaviors, adolescent health and HIV.",
      "Doctors for America said some of its members were already experiencing challenges as a result of losing access to information from the CDC. In one instance, it said a Chicago-based physician who works at a clinic serving low-income immigrant families could not consult the CDC's website for resources on how to address a chlamydia outbreak at a local high school and bolster STI testing and prevention efforts.",
      "Another doctor, who is also a researcher at the Yale School of Medicine, said in a declaration that she lost the ability to consult CDC resources about prescribing treatments.",
      "\"These doctors' time and effort are valuable, scarce resources, and being forced to spend them elsewhere makes their jobs harder and their treatment less effective,\" Bates wrote.",
      "He said that the Department of Health and Human Services, CDC and FDA face a minimal burden if required to store access to health resources, which have been available to the public for years.",
      "\"There is nothing in either the OPM memorandum or the record, and indeed defendants proffered no information at the hearing, to suggest the restoration of the removed webpages would pose a burden on the agencies' ability to engage in their work,\" Bates wrote. \"Similarly, there is no information to suggest that restoring public access would even interfere with the agencies' ongoing efforts to conform those resources with the president's executive orders.\"",
      "The order from Bates comes as Mr. Trump has faced numerous setbacks in the courts stemming from lawsuits targeting his administration's actions. On Monday alone, five different judges took action that favored challenges to Mr. Trump's directives on birthright citizenship, a freeze on federal funding, cuts to how medical research grants are funded and his deferred resignation program.",

      "Over the last month, pertussis infections have been rising again. While cases reported to the CDC by health departments dipped over the winter holidays, weekly infections have accelerated for a month straight since then.",
      "At least 360 pertussis cases were reported nationwide in last week's update to the CDC's tally of infections. Cases are up 27% from the week before.",
      "Weekly cases peaked at 577 late last year, before plummeting to less than 200 over the New Year's holiday.",
      "Florida reported 44 cases last week, the most of any state. That displaces Ohio, which had been the state with the most pertussis infections for many recent weeks.",
      "Cases have been reported in counties throughout Florida, according to data from the state's health department, with the largest tallies around Miami and Tampa.",
      "Similar to other states, most cases reported in Florida have been in children under 5 years old. More than a third of whooping cough cases have been in older kids.",
      "\"People of all ages are at risk for getting pertussis (whooping cough). Everyone who is not up to date with whooping cough vaccination should get vaccinated,\" CDC spokesperson Paul Prince said in a statement.",
      "Whooping cough can initially be difficult to separate from other cold-causing germs that surge over the colder months. Pertussis infections are called whooping cough because of the sound of severe coughing attacks, which can linger for weeks.",
      "Some people are at higher risk of life-threatening complications from whooping cough infections, including babies and people who are not up to date on their vaccines.",
      "Prince, the CDC spokesperson, said data on pertussis deaths for January 2025 was not available. Whooping cough deaths can take several weeks to be confirmed.",
      "A local health department earlier this month in Washington announced the first whooping cough death in the state since 2011. A 5-year-old had died in November 2024, but was only confirmed as a pertussis death by the CDC in recent weeks.",
      "The child had not completed the pertussis vaccine series, the Spokane Regional Health District said in a release, and also had \"other health factors that contributed\" to their death.",
      "\"This death serves as a stark reminder of the importance of vaccination, especially for those who are most vulnerable, including infants and young children,\" Dr. Francisco Velazquez, the county's health officer, said in a statement.",
      "Officials have warned for months that the U.S. was likely on track to see a major wave in whooping cough cases. While infections usually climb every three to five years, pertussis was among many germs that were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Other changes have also driven up pertussis cases in recent years, including a change in 2020 intended to cut down on missed cases by epidemiologists and waning immunity from pertussis vaccines.",
      "\"We have been seeing some increase in pertussis cases that are coming through our emergency departments. Not necessarily requiring admission, but coming in for evaluation and treatment,\" said Dr. Marcos Mestre, chief clinical operations officer at Nicklaus Children's Health System in Miami.",
      "He said it had been many years since they had seen a major outbreak of pertussis infections, as opposed to \"little pockets of increases\" around their system.",
      "Mestre said older pertussis patients often come into the emergency room after facing a persistent cough that does not go away after a week or so. Younger babies come in to get evaluated sooner and are at higher risk.",
      "\"They're coughing to the point that they can't catch their breath. And those are the children we really worry about, when infants are getting infected and that could cause more severe illness,\" said Mestre.",
      "Caregivers are urged to get up to date on their vaccines because that can reduce the risk of passing on an infection to young children, Mestre said. Pregnant moms who get vaccinated also pass on immunity to their children, protecting them as soon as they are born.",
      "\"It's important that people understand that immunity wanes, even if you are vaccinated as a child. And if you are going to be around infants, we recommend vaccination every 10 years,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Monday temporarily blocked the National Institutes of Health from implementing steep cuts to how medical research grants are funded, after 22 states sued to stop the change.",
      "The ruling by District Judge Angel Kelley, who was nominated by President Biden in 2021, halts the policy pending further court arguments from states and the Trump administration. A hearing is scheduled for Friday, Feb. 21.",
      "\"We will not allow the Trump Administration to unlawfully undermine our economy, hamstring our competitiveness, or play politics with our public health,\" had said Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell in a statement announcing the lawsuit.",
      "The pause is limited to research institutions in the states\u00a0that joined the lawsuit. Those include California, New York and North Carolina, which together with Massachusetts rank among the top five recipients of NIH grant funding\u00a0by state.",
      "Hospitals and universities criticized the move, first announced Friday by the Trump administration, which the National Institutes of Health said would save the federal government more than $4 billion a year.",
      "As outlined in an NIH memo, it would cap the amount of funding for what are called \"indirect costs,\" for general expenses like facilities and administration, at 15%, down from an average of around 27 to 28%.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump's pick to head the department that oversees the NIH, may undo the cuts, according to Sen. Susan Collins. The Senate is expected to vote by Thursday on whether to confirm Kennedy, after his nomination cleared the Senate's finance committee\u00a0last week.",
      "\"He has promised that as soon as he is confirmed, he will re-examine this initiative that was implemented prior to his confirmation,\" the Maine Republican said in a statement. Collins said she called Kennedy \"to express my strong opposition to these arbitrary cuts in funding for vital research\" in the state.",
      "Cancer research, heart disease and more",
      "The vast majority of medical research in the U.S. is supported by NIH funding, which \"includes over 2,800 hospitals, medical schools, universities, and other research institutions\" nationwide. Research for curing cancer and addressing chronic health conditions like diabetes and heart disease would be among the projects impacted, the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities warned.",
      "The cost-cutting move implements an idea floated by conservatives for years. During President Trump's first term, the White House proposed sharply limiting the indirect costs paid by the NIH to 10%.",
      "\"We tried this in term 1 and NIH LOBBIED AGAINST Trump's policies and got Congress to block it. The consequence for those employees was exactly nothing,\" Joe Grogan, former director of the White House's domestic policy council, posted on X.",
      "The NIH justified the cutback as being similar to rates paid for these costs by other nonprofit foundations that subsidize medical research.",
      "\"The United States should have the best medical research in the world. It is accordingly vital to ensure that as many funds as possible go towards direct scientific research costs rather than administrative overhead,\" said the NIH's memo.",
      "The new guidance was attributed to the NIH director's office. The agency is currently headed by acting director Dr. Matthew Memoli, pending the Senate confirmation of President Trump's pick to head the NIH, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya.",
      "Recipients of federal research dollars rejected characterizing the reimbursements as unnecessary, saying they are often needed to pay for costs like utility costs and lab maintenance and security.",
      "Those \"facilities and administration\" costs are difficult to attribute to on paper as direct costs of the research, they said, but are needed for the studies to continue.",
      "\"Make no mistake. This announcement will mean less research. Lights in labs nationwide will literally go out. Researchers and staff will lose their jobs,\" said the Association of American Medical Colleges in a statement.",
      "Calls for Congress to stop changes",
      "Some groups have called on Congress to step in. The cuts will affect institutions across the board, critics say, including in states that supported Republicans in the president's coalition.",
      "The Children's Hospital Association\u00a0asked\u00a0on Monday for lawmakers \"to prevent unilateral changes in the established processes\" for determining the indirect rates, citing \"current law and longstanding Congressional intent.\"",
      "\"Reducing the indirect cost rate will threaten the ability of children's hospitals to provide future groundbreaking cures for children,\" the association said.",
      "For years, lawmakers from both parties have opposed efforts to cut NIH's funding of indirect costs, including in a clause added to a budget bill passed by the Republican-controlled Congress in 2017.",
      "Grogan criticized the move, saying it blocked \"a rational discussion of how indirect cost rates should be calculated\" and efforts to ease unnecessary regulations.",
      "\"It's time for a transparent bipartisan discussion of whether taxpayers are getting cutting edge research out of NIH,\" said Grogan in an email.",
      "\"We fight like hell trying to keep the rates down\"",
      "Current and former health officials say they were blindsided by the guidance change, which upends a long-running system by which federal authorities already carefully scrutinize and negotiate down how much funding goes to indirect costs.",
      "\"We fight like hell trying to keep the rates down,\" said one former federal health official, who had worked with the team responsible for auditing indirect costs on NIH's behalf for years.",
      "That process starts with an extensive proposal submitted by researchers that goes through the federal Cost Allocation Services team within HHS, officials said, seeking to justify how they are planning to use the funds from a grant.",
      "The biggest portion of indirect costs usually goes towards paying for the facilities and equipment needed for biomedical research, not administrative costs. Federal research dollars cannot go towards paying for parts of the building and equipment that are not used for research.",
      "Federal health authorities often wage contentious negotiations with research institutions over those requests, resulting from inspections of the facilities and interrogations of the researchers working out of the buildings looking to \"poke holes\" in their submissions.",
      "\"We do not give away the farm. Whoever said that has never gone out on a site visit with us,\" said the former official.",
      "The former official said that artificially capping the rates below what they have negotiated with institutions ignores the work already done by health authorities to come up with current funding rates.",

    "story": [
      "A dairy worker in Nevada has been confirmed to be infected by a new bird flu strain found to be spreading among\u00a0cows in the state last week.",
      "That strain of the H5N1 bird flu virus, called D1.1 by scientists, is different from a previous variant called B3.13 which had infected at least 40 dairy workers in the U.S. to date.",
      "D1.1 was also behind a\u00a0fatal case in Louisiana in a person who was hospitalized last year, raising concerns that the strain might lead to more severe disease in humans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 14 other cases last year have also been linked to D1.1 from birds, which did not result in hospitalization.",
      "B3.13 has led to only symptoms of conjunctivitis \u2014 or pink eye \u2014 in many cases and research suggests it is less severe for humans than other bird flu strains.",
      "So far, health authorities in Nevada say the dairy worker, who tested positive after working with sick cows in the state's Churchill County, had only pink eye as their symptom and is now recovering.",
      "\"There is currently no evidence of person to person spread of this virus. Close contacts of the infected person and other workers exposed at the farm are being contacted and monitored for symptoms and are being offered personal protective equipment (PPE), testing and antiviral medication,\" the Central Nevada Health District said in a statement.",
      "Owen Truesdell, a spokesperson for the health district, said there is currently no evidence of other dairy workers showing symptoms.",
      "\"Please note that this is an evolving situation and we will continue to communicate with reporters and the public when relevant new information is learned,\" Truesdell said in an email.",
      "Health officials have said for months that while the spread of the virus in animals warrants stepping up precautions for workers dealing with sick cows and birds, the risk to the general public remains low.",
      "\"This case involving cow-to-human spread of H5 in a person with higher-risk occupational exposure does not change CDC's risk assessment, which remains low for the public but is higher for people with occupational or recreational exposures,\" a CDC spokesperson said in a statement.",

      "An analysis published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday found that one \"mammalian adaptation\" had been found in the virus from the D1.1-infected cows in Nevada last month, but said there was \"no evidence of onward transmission among humans.\"",
      "Will vaccines work for D1.1?",
      "While the seasonal flu vaccine is not designed to boost protection against H5N1, there are different kinds of vaccines that health authorities have prepared for a potential bird flu pandemic.",
      "Health authorities routinely test those pandemic vaccines against the bird flu virus to see if new strains have evolved to escape the protection from those shots.",
      "Previous testing by the CDC with D1.1 strains spreading in wild birds have found that the pandemic vaccines stockpiled by the U.S. government should still offer protection, two health officials told CBS News.",
      "Dr. Richard Webby, head of a World Health Organization influenza collaborating center at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, said those tests were done using antibodies after infection.",
      "\"It is anticipated that vaccination will induce an even better response,\" said Webby in an email.",
      "Why aren't we vaccinating for bird flu?",
      "Under the Biden administration last year, the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response moved to prepare enough vials to vaccinate 2.4 million people if needed \u2014 but so far those doses have not been distributed for use.",
      "Officials said at the time that there was not yet a need to roll out the immunizations, citing the largely mild symptoms in infected workers and lack of human-to-human spread.",
      "Virtually all U.S. human cases of bird flu have been linked to direct contact with sick animals, often during intensive exposures like caring directly for sick animals or culling large flocks of infected birds. That includes the person who died in the Louisiana case, who had direct contact with sick birds.",
      "But there have also been three cases over the past year with an \"unknown\" exposure, where investigators were unable to track down a likely explanation for how people got sick.",

    "story": [
      "Probational federal employees who lost their jobs on Thursday as part of the Trump administration's mass\u00a0firing of government workers\u00a0expressed shock and anger at the terminations, which they contend will hurt the government's ability to provide services.",
      "President Trump is moving quickly to shrink the U.S. federal government \u2014 the nation's largest employer \u2014 saying he is slashing wasteful spending and pushing to make the nation's civil workforce more responsive to his administration's policies. Federal workers in a probationary period typically have less than one year on the job and have not yet gained civil service protection.",
      "Federal workers who received termination notices on Thursday described receiving nonpersonalized emails informing them they had been removed from their position, with little communication from their supervisors. The workers said they had entered public service because of a commitment to serve the public interest, whether by helping protect consumers from predatory financial services or by supporting veterans.",
      "\"We had all received these notices that cites probationary regulations and says we're being let go because 'you are not fit for continued employment because your ability and skills do not fit the agency's needs,'\" Elizabeth Aniskevich, an attorney with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CBS News.",
      "A termination letter provided to CBS News by a former employee at the Department of Veterans Affairs informed the worker that his job was ending because \"you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the agency would be in the public interest.\"",
      "The VA worker, who had previously held federal jobs across different agencies for more than a decade, said he was dismayed to learn that he was considered a probationary worker after taking the Veterans Affairs job last fall, as it reset his government employment.",
      "\"Basically the gist [of the termination letter] is laying out I was a probationary employee, what my rights of appeal are, but my continued employment was no longer in the public interest,\" said the VA worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern that speaking publicly could jeopardize his chances of finding another government job. \"I came into the house \u2014 probably for a couple weeks my wife and I joked, 'Did I still have a job?' \u2014 I told her, and I lost it.

He added, \"The idea that the federal workforce is too bloated feels like a scapegoat more than anything else. Nobody joins the federal government to get rich.\"",

      "Mr. Trump's order \"directs agencies to promptly engage in RIFs for none of the specified, allowable reasons, but instead for the purpose of 'eliminating waste, bloat and insularity,'\" the lawsuit claims, citing the president's Feb. 11 executive order for widespread layoffs of government workers.",
      "Some experts are pushing back on the idea that the government workforce is too large, pointing out that federal employment has grown little since 1980. Prior to the firings, some agencies and services had already been grappling with staffing shortages, including the Veterans Health Administration.",
      "Impact on services",
      "The VA employee who was fired Thursday said he took exception to Mr. Trump's claim that the terminations would make the government more efficient, noting that his group, which had been trying to fill several empty positions, had more work than they could handle.",
      "\"We are under-resourced as it is, so cutting jobs won't do it,\" he said, adding that the firings will directly impact veterans. \"We have ongoing projects to try to construct and repair facilities to help veterans \u2014 we're already behind.\"",
      "A Food and Drug Administration employee \u2014 who also requested anonymity because she's in a probationary period in her job but hasn't received a termination letter \u2014 expressed concern that the firings would slow essential work, both because of the loss of skilled employees and a hit to employee morale.",
      "\"We're rather leanly staffed \u2014 the people on some of these teams have a tremendous workload,\" she said. \"It'll slow down things like drugs approvals ... it'll have a tremendous, terrible impact on access to drugs and generic drugs.\"",
      "Because many of the probationary workers are younger employees, the firings could add to long-term problems facing the federal workforce, where twice as many workers are over age 60 than under 30, said Elizabeth Linos, the Emma Bloomberg associate professor of public policy and management at Harvard's Kennedy School.",
      "\"This will exacerbate the existing human capital crisis if probationary employees are more likely to be young, and more likely to have the skills that a 21st century government operation needs,\" she said.",
      "Where jobs are getting cut",
      "As of May 2024, the most recent data available, about 216,000 federal employees had been in their jobs for less than one year, according to government data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.",
      "The government agency with the most probationary employees is the VA, with about 56,000 workers bearing that designation, OPM data shows. The VA on Friday said it had fired more than 1,000 employees. The agency didn't respond to a request for comment about whether more firings could be coming.",
      "\"Make no mistake \u2014 Trump is looking to fire probationary employees because it is easy, not because it is good for veterans or cost-effective,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut who serves on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, told CBS News in a statement. \"In fact, it is a massive waste of taxpayer dollars to fire employees the department just invested months into recruiting, vetting and training.\"",
      "Department of Health and Human Services officials expect most of the agency's roughly 5,200 probationary employees to be fired Friday, Feb. 14, under the Trump administration's move to get rid of nearly all probationary employees, according to an audio recording of a National Institutes of Health department meeting obtained by the Associated Press.",

    "summary": "Federal layoffs are starting with huge numbers of probationary workers, and there are warnings of bigger cuts on the way.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Thursday intensified its sweeping efforts to\u00a0shrink the size of the federal workforce, the nation's largest employer, by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who hadn't yet gained civil service protection \u2014 potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers.",
      "In addition, workers at some agencies were warned that large workplace cuts would be coming.",
      "The decision on probationary workers, who generally have less than a year on the job, came from the Office of Personnel Management, which serves as a human resources department for the federal government. The notification was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss it publicly.",
      "Even workers in the personnel office itself weren't immune: Dozens of probationary employees at OPM were told on a Thursday afternoon group call that they were being dismissed and then instructed to leave the building within a half-hour, according to another person who likewise spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "It's expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs. President Trump signed an executive order Tuesday that told agency leaders to plan for \"large-scale reductions in force.\"",
      "Elon Musk, to whom the president has given wide leeway to slash government spending with his Department of Government Efficiency, called Thursday for the elimination of whole agencies.",
      "\"I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,\" Musk said via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. \"If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back.\"",
      "Everett Kelley, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees representing federal workers, said the administration \"abused\" the probation status of workers \"to conduct a politically driven mass firing spree, targeting employees not because of performance, but because they were hired before Trump took office.\"",
      "Thursday's order was an expansion of previous directions from OPM, which told agencies earlier this week that probationary employees should be fired if they weren't meeting high standards. It's not clear how many workers are currently in a probationary period. According to government data maintained by OPM, as of March 2024, 220,000 workers had less than a year on the job \u2014 the most recent data available.",
      "The firing of probationary employees began earlier this week and has included the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Education workers.",
      "At least 39 were fired from the Education Department on Wednesday, according to a union that represents agency workers, including civil rights workers, special education specialists and student aid officials.",
      "The layoffs also hit Department of Veterans Affairs researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics and burn pit exposure, Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, said Thursday.",
      "Murray said in a statement that she heard from VA researchers in her state who were told to stop their research immediately, \"not because their work isn't desperately needed, but because Trump and Elon have decided to fire these researchers on a whim.\"",
      "The VA announced Thursday that it had laid off more than 1,000 non-\"mission critical\" probationary workers and the move would \"save the department more than $98 million per year, and VA will redirect all of those resources back toward health care, benefits and services for VA beneficiaries.\"",
      "Half of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention's Epidemic Intelligence Service officers \u2014 a group known as\u00a0the CDC's \"disease detectives\" \u2014 were among the cuts made Friday, multiple health officials tell CBS News.",
      "The Trump administration also moved Friday to fire more than 400 employees at the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, a group that defends government workers, said the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service would be hit especially hard by laying off probationary employees because it has trouble recruiting inspectors required to be present at all times at most slaughterhouses.",
      "The civilian federal workforce, not including military personnel and postal workers, is made up of about 2.4 million people. While about 20% of the workers are in Washington D.C. and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia, more than 80% live outside the Capitol region.",
      "Layoffs are unlikely to yield significant deficit savings. When the Congressional Budget Office looked at the issue, it found the government spent $271 billion annually compensating civilian federal workers, with about 60% of that total going to workers employed by the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs.",
      "The government could, in theory, cut all those workers and still run a deficit of over $1 trillion that would continue to grow as tax revenues are needed to keep up with the growing costs of Social Security and Medicare.",
      "Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said firing employees on probation is flawed because it targets younger workers.",
      "\"Baby Boomers are retiring right and left, so actually the people you want to keep are probably most of the people who are right now on probation,\" said Kamarck, who worked in former President Bill Clinton's Democratic administration when about 426,000 federal jobs were cut over more than eight years in a deliberative effort aimed at reinventing government. \"They're younger and presumably have better skills, and that's who you want.\"",
      "Mr, Trump's initial attempt to downsize the workforce was the deferred resignation program, commonly described as a \"buyout,: which offered to pay people until Sept. 30 if they agreed to quit. The White House said 75,000 people signed up, and a federal judge cleared a legal roadblock for the program Wednesday.",
      "However, the number of workers who took the offer was less than the administration's target, and Mr. Trump has made it clear he would take further steps.",
      "Employees at the National Science Foundation and Housing and Urban Development Department were told this week that large reductions, in some cases a halving of the workforce, would be coming, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it.",
      "The order the president signed Tuesday stipulated that government functions not required by law would be prioritized for cuts and hiring will be restricted. With exceptions for functions such as public safety, only one employee can be added for every four who leave. In addition, new hires would generally need approval from a representative of the DOGE, expanding the influence of Musk's team.",
      "Mr. Trump has praised Musk's work to slash federal spending.",
      "The Republican president has also been sharply critical of federal workers, especially those who want to keep working remotely, though his administration is simultaneously working to cut federal office space and ordering the termination of worksite leases throughout the government.",
      "\"Nobody is gonna work from home,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"They are gonna be going out, they're gonna play tennis, they're gonna play golf, they're gonna do a lot of things. They're not working.\"",

      "The daughters of one of the cofounders of Target are expressing their alarm and shock at the discounter's recent moves to roll back its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that have come under attack from conservative activists and as of last month, the White House.",
      "In letters to the editor published Thursday in The Financial Times and the Los Angeles Times, Anne and Lucy Dayton said their father, Bruce Dayton, along with his four other brothers, expanded the Minneapolis department store into a massive brand that became Target that was built on two principles: a focus on the customer and the well-being of the community.",
      "Bruce Dayton died in 2015 at 97.",
      "\"We are alarmed how quickly the business community has given in to the current administration's retaliatory threats,\" the daughters wrote. \"It is not 'illegal' for a company to create a business model based on what it believes to be important ethical and business standards.\"",
      "They added that, \"By cowering, Target and others are undermining the very principles that have made their companies a success.\"",
      "Target couldn't be immediately reached for comment.",
      "In late January, Target said the changes to its \"Belonging at the Bullseye\" strategy would include ending a program it established to help Black employees build meaningful careers, improve the experience of Black shoppers and to promote Black-owned businesses following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.",
      "Target, which operates nearly 2,000 stores nationwide and employs more than 400,000 people, said it already had planned to end the racial program this year. The company also said that it would conclude the diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, goals it previously set in three-year cycles.",
      "Following the announcement, activists called for a nationwide boycott of Target stores. Speakers at a Minneapolis rally in late January said they felt it was not a coincidence that Target rolled back on its diversity initiatives a week before Black History Month.",

    "summary": "The federal government is the nation's largest employer, yet the size of its workforce hasn't kept up with U.S. population growth, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is moving swiftly to shrink the U.S. federal government \u2014 the nation's largest employer \u2014 a move that he has said will slash wasteful spending and make the nation's civil workforce more responsive to his administration's dictates.",
      "Mr. Trump has described the federal government as \"bloated\" and filled with \"people that are unnecessary.\" While the federal government has inefficiencies, as do all large and complex organizations, some experts are pointing out that the government workforce has grown little since 1980, and that some agencies and services had already been grappling with staffing shortages, including the Veterans Health Administration and the FAA's air traffic control centers.",
      "\"There's no indication that the government is particularly bloated in terms of numbers of federal workers \u2014 that number hasn't really changed over the past decades,\" Elizabeth Linos, the Emma Bloomberg associate professor of public policy and management at Harvard's Kennedy School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The problem we were facing over the past decades isn't one of bloat, but of vacancies.\"",
      "On Thursday, the Trump administration ordered agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees\u00a0\u2014 who generally have less than a year on the job and who aren't yet covered by civil service protections \u2014 potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers.",
      "As Mr. Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency push to slash spending, here's what to know about the nation's federal workforce and the potential impact on Americans of scaling back government.",
      "What are Trump and Musk doing to shrink the federal workforce?",
      "Working with billionaire Elon Musk, Mr. Trump has offered a \"deferred resignation\" plan to more than 2 million federal employees, that would grant pay through the end of September while not working, in exchange for agreeing to step down. A federal judge on Tuesday cleared the program to proceed after it had been paused.",
      "About 75,000 workers have accepted the offer, and the Trump administration said that the deferred resignation program was closed as of 7 p.m. Feb. 12. The offer excludes members of the armed forces, U.S. Postal Service workers, and those who work in jobs related to immigration enforcement and national security.",
      "In another move aimed at remaking the federal workforce, Mr. Trump this week also signed an executive order to reduce the number of government employees and limit hiring.",
      "The administration's order on Thursday to cut probationary workers is expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs. According to federal data, there are about 220,000 federal workers with less than a year on the job, representing about 9% of the government workforce.",
      "\"I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,\" Musk said via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. \"If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back.\"",
      "Is the federal workforce growing?",
      "As Mr. Trump and Musk charge ahead, some policy experts note that the federal workforce has decreased relative to the U.S. population when compared with earlier decades. The upshot: There are fewer government workers providing services to more U.S. residents than in prior years, according to new research from the Center for Economic and Policy Research.",
      "The federal workforce has waxed and waned over the years, but its size today puts it on the same footing as during the 1980s, when the U.S. population was about 220 million. Today, there are more than 330 million U.S. residents.",
      "How big is the federal workforce?",
      "The U.S. has more than 2.4 million federal workers, excluding those who work for the U.S. Postal Service, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (As a self-funded agency, the USPS relies on sales of stamps and other products and services to support its operations.)",
      "\"In absolute terms, the federal workforce is slightly smaller than it was 50 years ago, even though the U.S. population has increased by two-thirds during that time period,\" noted Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who managed the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review, an effort to cut government spending in the 1990s, in a Jan. 28 report.",
      "In the 1940s, the federal workforce represented 4.5% of non-farm workers, a share that's dwindled to 1.5% today, according to CEPR's analysis.",
      "How efficient is the federal workforce?",
      "There's no overarching measure of the efficiency of the federal workforce, Linos of Harvard's Kennedy School noted. But agencies typically review their own operations to identify gaps that affect their ability to provide services.",
      "The federal workforce's efficiency should be measured on whether agencies are delivering the services they've been tasked to handle, she added. In recent years, many agencies have added data-driven measurements to determine whether they are providing those services to Americans.",
      "For instance, the Social Security Administration's most recent annual performance report identified long wait times for callers as a trouble spot, and added that it would like to shave the hold times to 12 minutes on average from its 34 minute on-hold time for fiscal year 2024. But that \"aspirational goal\" was being evaluated amid a hiring freeze, the report added.",
      "The Social Security Administration, which last year served a record 68 million beneficiaries, is working with its smallest staff in 50 years, former Social Security Commissioner Martin O'Malley said in November congressional testimony.",
      "To be sure, the U.S. government suffers from various types of inefficiencies, with a 2024 U.S. Government Accountability Office\u00a0report\u00a0estimating that as much as $521 billion annually is lost to fraud, or about 8% of federal spending.",
      "Federal spending also has ballooned in recent years, although much of the increase is due to higher spending on Social Security and paying interest on federal debt,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",
      "What agencies have the most federal workers?",
      "The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has the most federal workers, with more than 487,000 employees, according to data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, or OPM. That's followed by the Department of Homeland Security, with more than 222,000 workers; and the U.S. Army, with 221,000 employees.",
      "Some of the agencies that have been targeted by Mr. Trump are relatively small by comparison. For instance, the president is considering an executive order to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, which has about 4,200 employees.",
      "Where are federal workers based geographically?",
      "Only about 7% of federal workers are located in Washington, D.C., proper, according to a 2024 Congressional Research Service report. But when adding the federal workers located in Virginia and Maryland, the larger Washington, D.C., metro area represents about 20% of the entire government workforce.",
      "Roughly 80% of federal workers are located outside the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, and civil service employees are employed in every U.S. state, the CRS report noted.",
      "While Washington, D.C., proper has the largest number of federal workers, at about 162,000, other states aren't far behind: California employs about 147,000 federal workers, while Texas has about 130,000.",
      "Additional states with sizable federal workforces include Florida, at about 94,000, and Georgia, with almost 80,000 federal workers, the analysis found.",
      "What does the typical federal worker earn?",
      "The average annual salary of federal workers tops $106,000, Pew Research Center found, citing OPM data.",
      "Federal salaries skew into the six figures because many civil service workers hold college or professional degrees, and are highly trained. The largest share of federal workers are employed in the medical field \u2014 physicians and nurses who work for the VA, for instance.",
      "Others are professionals such as accountants and attorneys who might be able to earn more if they worked for private employers. For instance, the Commodity Future Trading Commission, which regulates futures contracts and other derivatives, pays its employees an average of $235,910. About 40% of its workforce is comprised of attorneys, Pew found.",
      "How could a much smaller federal workforce affect Americans?",
      "Services could degrade if enough federal workers are cut or resign, Harvard's Linos said. But Americans would still expect a certain level of service, such as getting their benefits paid on time or getting a passport on a timely basis.",
      "To address that issue, the federal government could turn to private-sector contractors to pick up the slack, she added. \"That's more costly \u2014 you end up paying a higher wage to private sector workers with less accountability,\" she noted.",
      "A hit to public services could heighten negative public sentiment about the federal government, Linos added. Public trust in the federal government has declined for decades, falling from about 77% of people in the 1960s who trust the government to do what is right to about 22% today, according to the Pew Research Center.",
      "\"We tell people the government is bloated, the day-to-day experience gets worse, and that feeds the narrative that the government is useless,\" she said.",

      "\"I've decided for purposes of fairness that I will charge a reciprocal tariff,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office at a proclamation signing. \"It's fair to all. No other country can complain.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued that its tariff policies would level the competitive playing field for U.S. and foreign manufacturers, although the new taxes would probably be shouldered by U.S. shoppers and businesses either directly or indirectly.",
      "Tariffs, which act as a tax on foreign goods, could lead to higher prices, which are rarely if every welcomed by Americans, and having more import duties on the horizon comes against a backdrop of inflation flaring up once again. Consumer prices in January\u00a0accelerated\u00a0to 3% on an annual basis, signaling the Federal Federal's push to drive inflation down to a 2% annual rate has petered out, at least for now.",
      "Deutsche Bank analysts said in a research note earlier this week that proceeding with reciprocal U.S. tariffs poses \"additional upside risks to the inflation outlook.\"",
      "Trade negotiations",
      "The tariff hikes would vary for affected countries, with a goal of starting new trade negotiations, the Associated Press reported. A senior White House official who spoke to the wire service on condition of anonymity said the reviews required to move forward with the tariffs could be finished within a number of weeks, although the process could take longer.",
      "The plan \"will seek to correct long-standing imbalances in international trade and ensure fairness across the board,\" the White House said in a statement about the tariffs. \"Gone are the days of America being taken advantage of: this plan will put the American worker first, improve our competitiveness in every area of industry, reduce our trade deficit, and bolster our economic and national security,\" it proclaimed.",
      "The announcement came before a meeting between Mr. Trump and Narendra Modi, prime minister of India, a country that could be targeted by U.S. tariffs. Modi has recently sought to assuage the Trump administration's concerns regarding trade issues, moving to cut import India's tariffs on some motorbikes and bourbon whiskey, while also agreeing to receive planes carrying undocumented migrants.",
      "President Trump has placed an additional tariff on Chinese imports for what he says is that nation's role in producing opioid fentanyl. He has also readied tariffs on Canada and Mexico that could take effect next month, after being paused 30 days. Mr. Trump also this week announced 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum that are scheduled to take effect in March.",
      "Applying a matching tariff against select U.S. trading partners is likely an alternative to imposing a more sweeping levy, according to economists. Argentina, Brazil, India and Turkey have the biggest gaps in tariffs with the U.S., trade data shows.",
      "\"While most developed markets would come out relatively unscathed, emerging markets would suffer a greater loss of competitiveness, with India, Brazil and Turkey looking among the most exposed,\" Shilan Shah, deputy chief emerging markets economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a report. \"It is probable that their governments (among others) would provide concessions to President Trump in an attempt to prevent reciprocal tariffs from being imposed.\"",
      "Trump administration officials say tariffs can protect domestic manufacturers and also spur both American and foreign companies to create more jobs in the U.S.",
      "\"America has helped many Countries throughout the years, at great financial cost. It is now time that these Countries remember this, and treat us fairly \u2013 A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR AMERICAN WORKERS,\" Mr. Trump wrote Thursday on Truth Social.",

      "Thousands of Californians who lost their homes in the Los Angeles fires last month are now grappling with insurance claims. And with research showing that extreme weather today\u00a0poses a threat to nearly half of all U.S. homes, it's important to know exactly how much coverage you have so that when disaster strikes, you're not left standing in the rubble.",
      "Indeed, as many as 3 in 4 U.S. homeowners could be underinsured, reports CBS News national consumer correspondent Ash-har Quraishi. That means more Americans should get to know their insurance policies, said Jennifer Gray Thompson, CEO of the nonprofit After the Fire USA.",
      "\"Well, the first thing you have to do is actually read your policy, and most of us don't do that, and so really encourage you to either sit down with somebody who is an expert in insurance \u2014 your underwriter [the insurance company] will be able to do this with you,\" Thompson told Quraishi.",
      "How much coverage do I need?",
      "Determining how much insurance you have, versus what you need to rebuild your a home in case of a disaster, is relatively straighforward. Start by taking the dollar amount of your policy coverage limit and dividing that by the square footage of your house or apartment.",
      "The resulting figure should equal the average construction cost per square foot in your area \u2014 a dollar amount Quraishi said you can find by doing an online search for \"construction cast per square foot,\" along with your zip code.",
      "For those who discover they have no protection of any kind of natural disaster, or after doing the math find that they're not sufficiently covered, the next step should be to get the maximum amount of coverage they can.",
      "\"Do go to your underwriter and ask,\" Thompson said. \"Max out on your insurance \u2014 it does cost us a little bit more every single month, but it's just incredibly important. Some people won't call because they're afraid of being dropped. Do not do that.\"",
      "Make a list of all your things",
      "Your home insurance policy should also cover possessions, also known as contents insurance. To be sure you're fully covered, make a list of all of your belongings, along with their estimated value. Update the list every year and let your agent know about any large purchases, from jewelry to cars.",
      "\"Most people don't even know they have contents insurance as part of their insurance policy,\" Thompson said. \"See how much it is.\"",
      "When to call Fema",
      "If you find yourself in the middle of a crisis while underinsured, you can contact the Federal Emergency Management Agency at 800-621-3362 from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Pacific time seven days a week. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security also may be able to provide assistance and negotiate with your insurance company.",
      "What if you think you're underinsured?",
      "If after reading your policy and calculating your coverage you determine you're underinsured, but your insurance provider insists that you're fine, Thompson suggests having them put that in writing.",
      "\"Ask them to actually put it in writing \u2014 an email or something back to you that is official saying that you are adequately insured,\" she said. \"You must have it in writing and in some way that you can easily access it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Egg prices continue to soar \u2014 if shoppers can even find them in grocery stores.",
      "In January alone, the cost of eggs around the U.S.\u00a0jumped more than 15%\u00a0from a year ago, to roughly $4.95 a dozen. That's\u00a0five times the overall U.S. inflation rate of 3%, Consumer Price Index data showed on Wednesday. In 2019, consumers could pick up a dozen eggs for around $1.54, but by last year the price had soared to $4.15 \u2014 a 170% increase, according to CBS News' price tracker\u00a0of everyday goods.",
      "The spike in egg prices last month underscores the devastating impact of avian flu, which killed more than 40 million egg-laying birds last year. Including ducks and chickens, 148 million birds have been ordered euthanized since the current strain of bird flu, H5N1, began spreading around the U.S. in 2022.",
      "If there's any good news, it's that egg prices are at least expected to rise more slowly over the course of the year. The January surge \"is likely a one-off,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco. But that may come as small consolation for the millions of consumers who continue to grapple with higher food costs both at home and in restaurants due to record-high egg prices.",
      "Why are egg prices so high?",
      "The price spike in eggs is largely driven by the bird flu, which continues to hit farms and wipe out flocks. When demand remains steady for a product that isn't easily substituted and supply diminishes, prices tend to rise.",
      "\"If you don't have a bird you don't have an egg,\" Sharon Linsenbardt, founder and owner of Barn Buddies Rescue and Sanctuary in Las Vegas, told CBS News reporter Andres Gutierrez. The millions of egg-laying hens killed by avian influenza can't be replaced easily and quickly, added Linsenhardt, who has limited sales to two dozen eggs a family.",
      "\"High egg prices are due to the avian flu issue, which cuts the supply in the available eggs for sale,\" Columbia Business School professor Yiming Ma told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you have less supply, that drives up the prices.\"",
      "Egg supplies are likely to remain constrained as long as bird flu outbreaks continue, according to David Anderson, an agricultural economics professor at Texas A&M University.",
      "Anderson, noting a cultural shift that may be exacerbating the problem, also said he has noticed that Americans are leaning toward more protein-heavy diets, driving demand for eggs.",
      "\"We have this nutritional trend, and as people incorporate more protein in their diets, that increases overall egg demand and sets a higher base for demand,\" he said. \"Then when we get this supply shock, low and behold, we get higher prices.\"",
      "Retailers rationing eggs",
      "Ongoing egg shortages and rising prices recently prompted 24-hour breakfast chain Waffle House to add a 50 cent surcharge per egg, while some major grocery chains are imposing limits on how many eggs shoppers can buy at a time.",
      "Walmart is curtailing purchases of 60-count cartons to two per purchase \"to ensure more customers can have access to eggs,\" a spokesperson for the retailer said.",
      "\"Although supply is very tight, we're working with suppliers to try and help meet customer demand, while striving to keep prices as low as possible,\" the spokesperson added. At Sam's Club, a division of Walmart, the warehouse club is limiting the number of egg purchases to two per item at its nearly 600 stores across the U.S.",
      "As of Wednesday, most of Target's nearly 2,000 U.S. stores had eggs in stock, and the retailer only has purchase limits in place in its Hawaii stores, according to a spokesperson for the retailer. \"We'll continue to monitor and adjust as needed,\" they added.",
      "Kroger, which operates about 2,700 U.S. grocery stores, hasn't imposed a company-wide cap on egg purchases, though some stores are limiting customers to buying two dozen per visit.",
      "Giant Eagle said it was selling conventional shelled eggs \"at or below our cost across all our supermarkets\" to limit the impact of rising egg prices on its customers. The regional grocery, which operates more than 470 stores in Indiana, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, is encouraging shoppers to limit their purchase to a maximum of three egg cartons per visit.",
      "Amazon-owned Whole Foods and Costco did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "When will egg prices drop?",
      "Egg prices are expected to rise a total of 20% in 2025, according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Despite the rising costs, consumer demand remains firm and could even increase as Easter approaches, offering little hope for respite on prices.",
      "Two things have to happen for prices to ease, according to experts. The U.S. must contain the bird flu, and older chickens that are past their productive primes, as well as diseased chickens, have to be replaced. Exactly how long all of this will take is uncertain.",
      "\"it's not clear that we've fully controlled the spread of bird flu. That's the first step, and it'll be a few months after that before you can breed and replace the laying population,\" Bryan Spillane, Bank of America senior food and beverage analyst, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He expects it will be at least another three to six months before prices moderate. If restaurants continue to implement surcharges for eggs, that could eventually put a damper on demand.",
      "In the near-term, Anderson expects eggs to continue hitting consumers' wallets. \"I wouldn't be surprised to see prices continue to go up, because we continue to have outbreaks,\" he said.",
      "Cost-conscious consumers can comparison shop among grocery stores, noted NerdWallet spokesperson Sara Rathner, but be aware that if price differences aren't substantial, you could eat up any cost savings on gas.",

      "\"This is not a good number,\" Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings, said in an email of January's CPI data. \"This is almost starting to look like a re-run of the first half of 2024, when inflation surprised everyone (including the Fed) on the upside.\"",
      "He added, \"And it illustrates how the Fed has not completed the job of getting inflation back down just as new inflation risks - from tariff hikes and a squeeze on labor supply growth - start to emerge.\"",
      "The new data shows that inflation picked up speed at the start of the President Trump's second administration, which has signaled its intention to enact broad-based tariffs, including newly announced 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports.",
      "Because tariffs are essentially taxes on imports that are largely passed through to U.S. consumers, Mr. Trump's import duties, if enacted, could push inflation higher in 2025, economists are forecasting.",

      "Higher borrowing costs for longer: With the Fed pausing on additional rate cuts, consumers are likely to pay more for loans and other debt, ranging from credit cards to auto loans.",
      "\"Today's stronger than expected CPI release is likely to further cement the [Federal Reserve's] cautious approach to easing,\" said Whitney Watson, global co-head and co-chief investment officer of fixed income and liquidity solutions within Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in an email. \"We think the Fed is likely to remain in 'wait and see mode' for the time being and anticipate the Fed staying on hold at next month's meeting.\"",

He also said the law was \"draining resources\" from law enforcement and harming U.S. national interests because companies were being held back from deals that would give the U.S. access to deep water ports, critical minerals and other assets.",
      "Duncan Levin, a criminal defense attorney, said he expects Mr. Trump to essentially kill the law by neglect.",
      "\"He can't get rid of the law, but he can refuse to enforce it,\" said Levin, who has represented high profile defendants Harvey Weinstein and Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. \"I don't think this is just a pause.\"",
      "What is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act?",
      "The FCPA is a federal law that makes it illegal for U.S. companies and individuals to make payments to foreign government officials \"to secure any improper advantage\" in order to win or retain business. It was enacted in the 1970s to address concerns of global corruption after investigators at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission found hundreds of American companies making questionable or illegal payments to foreign officials to win business. The law doesn't require that the bribe is actually paid, but only offered.",
      "Over the past nearly 50 years, prosecutions under the law have brought to light a long and varied list of bribes.",
      "Last year, the military contractor RTX, formerly Raytheon, paid more than $300 million to settle charges it had allegedly bribed officials in Qatar by using a sham contract and other devices to hide its tracks.",
      "In 2019, Walmart paid $282 million to settle charges from a seven-year investigation into allegations it won approval to open stores in Mexico, India and Brazil by bribing local officials, including one contact called the \"sorceress\" who had an uncanny ability to make permitting problems disappear.",
      "Who enforces the FCPA?",
      "The FCPA is jointly enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which handles civil enforcement of bribery-related acts, and the Department of Justice, which is responsible for civil and criminal enforcement for the law.",
      "Only criminal cases carry the threat of prison time, according to the National Whistleblower Association, adding that the burden of proof is lower for civil cases. In criminal bribery cases, punishment for conviction is imprisonment of up to 20 years, and companies face fines double their profits from the illicit deal.",
      "Why is the FCPA important?",
      "The FCPA was enacted to protect U.S businesses from global corruption costs as a result of bribery.",
      "By prohibiting companies from unfair advantages through the illegal payment of foreign officials, and by requiring that companies covered by the law to keep accurate records of payment transactions and devise and maintain an adequate internal accounting controls, the FCPA protects U.S. businesses from global corruption costs stemming from bribery and helps ensure fair competition.",
      "Criticisms against the FCPA",
      "President Trump said the law is being enforced in \"excessive, unpredictable\" ways that U.S. companies are competing on an uneven \"playing field\" with foreign rivals. He also said the law was \"draining resources\" from law enforcement and harming U.S. national interests because companies were being held back from deals that would give the U.S. access to deep water ports, critical minerals and other assets.",
      "Since the FCPA was enacted nearly 50 years ago, U.S. businesses have complained that it was hurting more than helping and unfair because bribes were commonplace in some countries. Then under U.S. pressure, allies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development started enacting their own laws, especially after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and African and Asian countries formerly in the communist orbit opened their borders to business.",
      "Eventually, 40 wealthy countries adopted anti-bribery laws based on the FCPA, according to University of Basel's Pieth, including the ability to prosecute foreign companies operating in their countries for acts committed in a third country.",
      "Therein lies another danger of Mr. Trump weakening the FCPA, according to Pieth.\"If a U.S. company bribes because Trump is giving them the green light, the French and the British will jump on that company,\" he said. \"It will be a mess.\"",

    "story": [
      "Almost $500 million in food aid is at risk of spoilage as it sits in ports, ships and warehouses after funding for the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, was paused by the Trump administration, according to a Feb. 10 report from a government watchdog.",
      "The report from USAID's inspector general highlighted the risks of \"safeguarding and distribution\" of $8.2 billion in unspent humanitarian aid after the Trump administration ordered almost all staff to be placed on leave and ordered a review of U.S. foreign assistance programs.",
      "USAID, which\u00a0provides humanitarian aid\u00a0to more than 100 countries, buys food directly from U.S. farmers and manufacturers, which have typically provided about 40% of international food assistance, according to a 2021 report from the Congressional Research Service. With USAID funding paused, there is concern among U.S. farmers about the market for some of their products, including Kansas sorghum producers, according to the Topeka Capital-Journal.",
      "While the future of USAID's funding and its purchases from U.S. farmers remains unclear, there is currently $489 million worth of food sitting \"at ports, in transit, and in warehouses at risk of spoilage, unanticipated storage needs, and diversion,\" the Feb. 10 USAID inspector general report said.",
      "An additional 500,000 additional metric tons of food is currently on ships or ready to be shipped abroad, the report added. USAID typically buys commodities such as wheat, soybeans, sorghum and split peas from U.S. farmers.",
      "\"When the food doesn't get to where it needs to go, it winds up in a landfill, and that has devastating effects,\" Ashley Stanley, the CEO of Spoonfuls, which redirects excess food from grocers and other companies to aid organizations in Massachusetts, told CBS Boston.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, which has been tasked with overseeing USAID, said on Feb. 12 that Secretary Marco Rubio has coordinated with the Department of Agriculture to resume USAID's food aid program, called Food for Peace.",
      "\"This includes $396 million in agricultural commodities (542,000 metric tons) currently in the supply chain from the U.S. to countries in crisis around the world,\" the State Department spokesperson said.",
      "Separately, President Trump on Tuesday\u00a0fired the USAID inspector general one day after he released the report detailing the potential food spoilage. Paul Martin, the ousted inspector general, was given no reason for his dismissal in a two-sentence email from Trent Morse, deputy director of the White House's Office of Presidential Personnel.",
      "The Trump administration has\u00a0targeted USAID\u00a0as President Trump and billionaire\u00a0Elon Musk, the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, or\u00a0DOGE, seek to cut the size of the federal government. Musk has said the agency should be shut down, calling it \"beyond repair.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Feb 2025 14:10:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump and other critics of the agency say it needs to be shut down. Supporters of the agency point to its record of protecting consumers.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's Feb. 8 order that employees of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau halt much of their work amounts to an existential crisis for a government agency that itself was born from crisis.",
      "The CFPB was launched in 2011 under President Barack Obama following the housing industry meltdown that devastated the global economy. The agency's mission: to protect Americans from abuse by financial firms; ensure that industry players follow consumer protection rules governing everything from home loans to credit cards; and help regulate a sector implicated in the biggest U.S. economic collapse since the Great Depression.",
      "Republican lawmakers and other critics have long attacked the CFPB, saying it lacked accountability and imposed burdensome regulations on the financial industry. Supporters of the agency say it has played a vital role safeguarding consumers.",
      "Why was the CFPB created?",
      "The CFPB is an independent government agency that was established by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis as lawmakers implemented financial reform. The economic spiral that followed the subprime mortgage meltdown, dubbed the Great Recession, proved devastating for millions of Americans and caused cascading economic problems around the world. The disaster\u00a0wiped out\u00a0almost $8 trillion in stock market wealth and $6 trillion in home value.",
      "Set up to protect consumers from questionable financial products, corporate fraud and scams, the CFPB was created as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that was signed into law by Obama in 2010.",
      "What does the CFPB do?",
      "The CFPB implements and enforces a range of consumer finance laws, such as the Fair Credit Reporting\u00a0Act, which among other things helps ensure the accuracy and privacy of people's credit reports. The agency also issues and enforces financial regulations.",
      "As part of its duties, the CFPB also issues refunds to consumers harmed by financial firms, works to arrange loan and debt relief for eligible borrowers, and imposes fines on companies found to have broken the rules. Some of the agency's achievements, according to the CFPB and consumer advocates:",
      "Securing $20 billion in relief for consumers, including reducing loan balances and erasing debt, since the agency's launchImposing $5 billion in civil monetary penalties against businesses and individuals who violate consumer protection lawsPenalizing banks and other companies for activities such as opening fake accounts and improperly charging \"junk\" feesBanning excessive credit card late-payment fees (a federal judge in 2024 moved to block that CFPB rule)Tightening rules for \"buy now, pay later\" loans, ensuring that consumers who use this increasingly form of credit are protectedSafeguarding U.S. servicemembers from illegal loansBanning medical debt from from consumers' credit report",

      "\"It's a law enforcement agency. It takes big financial institutions to court who cheat consumers, whether it's a credit reporting agency, or a large bank or a credit card giant,\" Rohit Chopra, who was\u00a0fired by President Trump as director of CFPB earlier this month, said in an interview\u00a0aired\u00a0on NPR on Monday. \"The CFPB has been recovering billions of dollars for consumers who were wronged.\"",
      "In the weeks leading up to Chopra's departure, the CFPB targeted a number of large institutions in a flurry of legal actions. That included suing Capital One for\u00a0allegedly misleading people\u00a0about its offerings for high-interest savings accounts and accusing Experian of\u00a0improperly investigating consumer complaints of errors in credit reports. Both Capital one Experian dispute the allegations.",
      "The CFPB in December also said that more than 4 million Americans\u00a0allegedly gouged by credit repair companies including Lexington Law and CreditRepair.com would soon collectively be refunded $1.8 billion.",
      "What do the CFPB's critics say?",
      "Funded by the Federal Reserve, the CFPB has weathered multiple legal challenges from opponents over its short life as a regulatory agency. The Supreme Court\u00a0in May upheld\u00a0its funding structure, which had been challenged by the payday lending industry.",
      "The CFPB had been \"a woke & weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time. This must end,\" acting CFPB director Russ Vought wrote in a Feb. 9 social media post. Vought previously served as Office of Management and Budget director in the first Trump administration and was involved in writing the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, which called for\u00a0eliminating the agency.",
      "According to a slew of published reports, Mr. Trump on Tuesday picked Jonathan McKernan to head the agency. McKernan on Monday resigned from the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Vought will continue to lead the agency until the Senate confirms a nominee.",
      "That said, what the president has in mind for the agency is unclear, as Mr. Trump signaled a willingness to shut the CFPB down one day earlier.",
      "\"That was a very important thing to get rid of,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Monday from the Oval Office. Asked if his intention was to eliminate the agency, he Trump replied, \"I would say, yeah, because we're trying to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "The White House press office declined further comment. Spokespeople at the CFPB and the Heritage Foundation also didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "If one is looking to root out redundancy in federal government, the CFPB is a \"great place to start,\" Norbert Michel, vice president and director of the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"It's completely untrue that there was no consumer protection in financial markets prior to the CFPB,\" said Michel, who lists the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as among the regulators already on hand.",
      "Still, while long an advocate of pulling the plug on the agency's operations, Michel was unclear on the White House's tactics.",
      "\"Congress created this thing, and I don't understand how that's possible for the executive branch to truly get rid of a federal agency that Congress created, whether I like it or not,\" said Michel. \"I don't know what the end game is \u2014 I don't know what they are trying to do,\" the economist and statistician said of the Trump administration's efforts at pulling the plug on the CFPB's work.",
      "What could happen to the CFPB?",
      "One financial analyst believes the CFPB will survive, even as it drops its defense of rule changes now being challenged in the courts.",
      "\"We expect to see the repeal of the credit card late fee, the overdraft late fee, the open banking and the credit bureau rules reversed by the courts,\" Jaret Seiberg wrote, an analyst at TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a report on Tuesday, referencing consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB during Chopra's time at the agency's helm.",
      "A union representing employees at dozens of federal agencies is suing to block the agency's shutdown. Democrats including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who proposed the idea of the CFPB before entering Congress when she was still a law professor at Harvard University, are pushing to keep the CFPB running.",
      "\"If you have a bank account, or credit card or mortgage or student loan, this is code red. I am ringing the alarm bell. Elon Musk and the guy who wrote Project 2025, Russ Vought, are trying to kill the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

    "story": [
      "Beijing \u2014 Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father's panicked voice: The brakes don't work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier.",
      "Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: Tesla sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car's brakes \u2014 and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1.1 trillion company.",
      "Zhang isn't the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk,\u00a0among the richest men in the world\u00a0and a self-described \"free speech absolutist.\" Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.",
      "The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review by The Associated Press  of public court documents and Chinese media reports. Tesla won all eleven cases for which the AP could track down the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang's, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.",
      "It isn't common practice for automakers \u2014 in China or elsewhere \u2014 to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China's ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.",
      "The AP review of Tesla's record in China comes as Musk is wielding significant influence in President Trump's new administration, leading an effort to rapidly shrink the size of the federal government and oust employees deemed disloyal to the president. His actions have raised concerns that Musk is weakening the U.S. system of checks and balances, in part, to benefit Tesla and his other companies.",

      "Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans and large tax breaks. With a few pointed exceptions, Tesla has enjoyed largely ingratiating coverage in the Chinese press, and journalists told the AP they've been instructed to avoid negative coverage of the automaker.",
      "Tesla's windfall has extended to the courts \u2014 and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, the AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality or contract disputes brought by customers.",
      "\"The government gave Tesla a super status that put consumers in a very vulnerable position,\" said Qiao Yudong, a former lawyer for American sports car company Saleen Automotive in China. \"That's why some consumers had to resort to extreme actions.\"",
      "Customer's tough times",
      "One of those desperate customers was Zhang.",
      "The February 2021 crash in central China's Henan province sent Zhang's mother and father, who had a concussion, to the hospital for four days, medical records show. Zhang \u2014 who was unharmed in the accident, as was her baby niece \u2014 wanted to understand what had happened: How could her dream car have turned into such a nightmare?",
      "Traffic police determined that the crash was her dad's fault because he hadn't maintained a safe following distance. Zhang, however, insisted that the brakes had malfunctioned, sending the car out of control. She filed a complaint with a local market regulator, requesting a refund and compensation. Teslas are among the most computerized cars on the market, so Zhang asked the automaker to turn over the full pre-crash data from her car, hoping it might help explain what went wrong. Tesla refused.",
      "\"Tesla's employees were very arrogant and tough in dealing with my complaints,\" Zhang said in an interview. \"I was burning with anger.\"",
      "After weeks of stewing, she draped her damaged car with a banner proclaiming \"Tesla brake failure\" in front of the Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, some 124 miles from her home. She sat on the Tesla's roof and blared her protest through a bullhorn: \"Tesla Model 3 brakes failed,\" she said. \"A family of four almost died.\" The next month, she parked her damaged car outside an auto show in Zhengzhou. It was all to no avail \u2014 Tesla refused to turn over the full data and mediation went nowhere.",
      "Figuring that top Tesla officials would attend an April auto show in Shanghai, she and a friend \u2014 who had also had a problem with her Tesla \u2014 donned matching T-shirts with the phrase \"Brakes fail\" and headed for Tesla's booth, determined to buttonhole executives. The automaker's officials avoided them, Zhang said, and they couldn't get anyone to hear them out.",
      "Her friend, who was six months pregnant, started shouting, \"Tesla brakes fail!\"",
      "Zhang clambered on top of a shiny red display model and started hollering, too.",
      "\"Things escalated,\" said Zhang.",
      "The moment \u2014 captured on cell phone videos shot by onlookers \u2014 went viral on Chinese social media. Burly security guards hauled Zhang out and she was detained for five days.",
      "Some observers speculated that Zhang's protest had been orchestrated \u2014 perhaps by a competitor or by the Chinese government itself to pressure Tesla to conform with Chinese regulations. Tesla alleged that Zhang hadn't acted on her own. A top executive speculated to Chinese media that she \"had someone behind her\" and said Zhang was making a fuss because she just wanted higher compensation.",
      "Zhang insisted she acted on her own \u2014 and out of anguish. Outraged, she sued Tesla for defamation, arguing that the executive's comments unjustly cast her as a troublemaker to deflect attention from the company's own shortcomings.",
      "And then she found herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by Tesla.",
      "Tesla said Zhang had deliberately spread false information that damaged the brand and asked for 5 million yuan ($684,000) in damages.",
      "The case, which a court took up in October 2021, came as Tesla faced a barrage of criticism in China.",
      "Tesla's numerous alleged issues",
      "Dozens of Tesla owners had been publicly complaining about alleged brake failures, battery fires, unintended acceleration and other defects, as well as what they claimed were misleading sales practices. The same month as Zhang's crash, Chinese regulators summoned Tesla to respond to quality concerns raised by such reports.",
      "Zhang's emotional protest sparked a rare burst of criticism of Tesla in Chinese media. Under pressure from regulators, Tesla finally released the data from her car, which the company said showed her father had been driving nearly 120 km per hour (75 mph) and that the brakes had functioned to reduce the magnitude of the collision.",
      "Tesla had finally given Zhang what she'd been asking for, but they'd published the data publicly and included her vehicle identification number. She said she and her family started getting threatened and doxed online. Besides, she wondered, how could she be sure Tesla hadn't modified or redacted the data from her car? It was less than the victory she'd hoped for. Feeling besieged, she sued Tesla a second time, in March 2022, for invading her privacy.",
      "Zhang lost both cases she brought against Tesla.",
      "Meanwhile, the defamation case against her was grinding along. Back in court as a defendant, Zhang was unable to prove that the brakes on her Tesla had indeed failed. In a closed trial, a Shanghai court ruled in May 2024 that Zhang's public complaints went beyond what magistrates considered reasonable, factual criticism and ordered her to publicly apologize and pay 170,000 RMB ($23,000) to cover damages and the legal costs of the world's most valuable car company.",
      "Zhang appealed the ruling. She maintains that her lawsuit is a cry for transparency and accountability and that a company as rich and powerful as Tesla should be able to tolerate legitimate criticism from its customers.",
      "\"I refuse to accept it,\" Zhang told the Associated Press, \"As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.\"",
      "Odds stacked against Tesla owners in court",
      "Her odds of winning the appeal against Tesla do not look good. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it's also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.",
      "An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgements in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.",
      "In a statement to AP, the Shanghai High People's Court said that judgments are the result of a \"fair trial\" based on \"the objective facts of the case.\"",
      "\"It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,\" the court wrote.",
      "While some auto industry experts in China say it's generally difficult for customers to win cases against car companies, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.",
      "\"For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,\" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd., an advisory firm based in Shanghai, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. \"The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.\"",
      "Tesla and Bejing's win-win",
      "Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping. It was under his watch, in 2019, that Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital.",
      "With Li's support, Tesla became the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture and got low-interest loans and generous tax breaks. China also adopted an emissions credit scheme modeled after a U.S. program that's generated billions in income for Tesla.",
      "In January 2020, one year after breaking ground, Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history that year, and Musk was declared the world's richest person in January 2021.",
      "China got what it wanted, too: Tesla was a potent catalyst for domestic production and consumption. Before Tesla's arrival, new energy vehicles accounted for around five percent of China's auto market. Today, analysts say, more than half of passenger vehicles sold retail in China are powered by an electric motor. Chinese battery maker CATL, a key Tesla supplier, has embedded itself in global supply chains to become the world's largest EV-battery maker. China's BYD is now the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer and a growing competitive threat to legacy carmakers in the West.",
      "\"Tesla had a large part to play in that,\" said Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. Tu said the way the government smoothed the way for Musk's factory was critical. \"It was a swampy field on the outskirts of Shanghai. A year later, they're rolling cars off the line,\" he said. \"I don't know if that happens anywhere else in the world.\"",
      "Requests for comment to the State Council, which is run by Li Qiang and oversees China's government ministries, went unanswered.",
      "Musk's enormous influence in China and U.S.",
      "Musk still swings by to meet Li when he goes to China. Their encounters underscore the complexity of Musk's overlapping interests as a businessman and the most China-friendly member of Mr. Trump's inner circle.",
      "Musk's \"greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,\" said Russo, the auto strategist in Shanghai. \"He's done a good job of it in China and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.\"",
      "Safety advocates worry about the implications of Musk's proximity to power in the United States. Federal investigations and safety initiatives Musk has long railed against could be easily snuffed out by the new administration.",
      "In the U.S., Tesla also has been subject to a raft of customer safety complaints and lawsuits over autopilot function, battery charging, alleged suspension defects, sudden braking or acceleration, faulty airbags and allegedly monopolistic practices on repairs and parts. Judges have dismissed some cases. In others, Tesla settled out of court or paid hefty settlements.",
      "Tesla hasn't publicly sued any of its U.S. customers for speaking out, though in January, Musk said on X that \"maybe it is time\" to sue media outlets for coverage that could stain Tesla's brand. His post has been viewed more than 22 million times.",
      "Tesla has already successfully done that in China.",
      "Tesla targets journalists in China",
      "Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told the AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.",
      "\"We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,\" a tech reporter told AP.",
      "Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. It was unhappy about PingWest's report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a \"sweatshop.\" The news website ifeng.com drew Tesla's ire over a story that explored the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla. PingWest had to apologize and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). AP couldn't determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com.",
      "Tesla isn't the only company in its industry to sue its critics. BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.",
      "Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors \u2014 in going after car owners who suffered crashes.",
      "\"Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,\" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,200) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. He has appealed the verdict. \"Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.\"",
      "Chen Junyi got the message. He lost control of his Model 3 and plowed into a dozen cars in a parking lot at high speed in August 2020. He claimed the brakes had failed. He told Chinese media at the time that he broke his back and four ribs and had to have 12 inches of his small intestine removed. Chen took to social media and warned people not to buy Tesla, raising his shirt to reveal the long, gnarled scar that runs up his abdomen.",
      "Tesla maintained the accident was Chen's fault, citing a technical review that found the car was accelerating and not braking in the seconds before the crash, and sued him for making false claims.",
      "\"Tesla should proactively respond to consumers instead of using its superior resources and filing lawsuits against consumers who are at a disadvantage,\" Chen said in a court statement reviewed by the AP. \"I almost lost my life because of the car accident. I lost my job and income. I am under tremendous economic pressure.\"",
      "Chen declined to speak with the AP, citing fear of retaliation. A Chinese court ordered Chen to pay the carmaker 50,000 yuan ($6,800) as compensation \u2014 and to issue an apology.",
      "\"I deeply regret the serious negative impacts I have had on Tesla and its cars,\" he wrote. \"I hereby sincerely apologize to Tesla and to the people who were misled by my remarks.\"",
      "A month later, he apologized for his apology, saying the words were not his own.",

    "summary": "A new lawsuit filed by Missouri's attorney general alleges that Starbucks is unlawfully relying on \"race-and-sex-based hiring practices.\"",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks faces a new lawsuit filed by Missouri's attorney general alleging the restaurant chain relies on \"race-and-sex-based hiring practices\" that violate federal and state laws. The complaint\u00a0also claims the coffee chain's hiring policies have led to slower service and higher prices for consumers because it isn't recruiting the most qualified workers.",
      "The lawsuit, filed Tuesday by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, claims Starbucks' diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, policies are \"mere pretext for its actual commitment to unlawful discrimination.\"",
      "The litigation comes just weeks after President Trump signed an executive order\u00a0banning diversity, equity and inclusion\u00a0programs across the U.S. government, while also directing the U.S. attorney general to \"encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.\"",
      "A number of major retailers and other companies, along with other organizations, have recently rolled back their DEI initiatives amid pushback from conservative activists, including Ford, Google, McDonald's, Meta, Target and Walmart.",
      "In a statement to CBS News responding to Missouri's suit, Starbucks said, \"We disagree with the attorney general, and these allegations are inaccurate. We are deeply committed to creating opportunity for every single one of our partners (employees). Our programs and benefits are open to everyone and lawful.\"",
      "The company added, \"Our hiring practices are inclusive fair and competitive and designed to ensure the strongest candidate for every job every time.\"",
      "Critics of DEI say employers should make their hiring decisions based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other legally protected categories. The Missouri lawsuit echoes those arguments, alleging that Starbucks' hiring practices discriminates against residents of the state.",
      "\"Starbucks' policies harm the many Missourians whom work, or would like to work, at Starbucks, but have been, are being or will be discriminated against as future victims on the basis of their race, sex, or inclusion in other protected groups,\" the complaint alleges.",
      "While Starbucks' prices and wait times have been a focus of consumer complaints in recent years, experts haven't generally blamed hiring practices for the chain's problems. Instead, analysts have pointed to inflation, which has pushed up the prices of ingredients like coffee and milk, as well as Starbucks' vast number of drink customizations, which can slow orders.",
      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol has vowed to tackle some of those issues, pledging last year to simplify beverage customizations and saying customers should receive their drinks in four minutes or less.",
      "Niccol, who was hired from Chipotle last year to revitalize the struggling coffee chain, has also said he wants to make Starbucks' locations \"inviting places to linger.\"",
      "As part of that goal, Starbucks reversed its open-door policy last month after almost seven years, now requiring that people make a purchase if they want to hang out in its stores or use restrooms. The company adopted those policies in 2018 after two Black men were arrested at a Philadelphia Starbucks where they had gone for a business meeting.",
      "Negative publicity over the incident, which was caught on video and widely shared over social media, embarrassed the company and led to its now abandoned open-door policy.",

Still, the company added, it received feedback about some other missing events and countries.",

      "President Trump's tariffs on aluminum could make Coca-Cola more expensive.",
      "Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said the company imports aluminum for its cans from Canada, and is looking for ways to mitigate any price increases that new tariffs could bring. Mr. Trump on Monday announced a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum.",
      "Quincey said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that if the tariffs go into effect, making aluminum cans more expensive, the company could start selling more beverages in plastic bottles.",
      "\"As it relates to our strategies around ensuring affordability and ensuring consumer demand, if one package suffers some increase in input costs, we continue to have other packaging offerings that will allow us to compete in the affordability space,\" Quincey said. \"For example, if aluminum cans become more expensive, we can put more emphasis on PET [plastic] bottles, et cetera.\"",
      "Quincey also said the impact of the new tariffs could be negligible.",
      "\"I think we're in danger of exaggerating the impact of the 25% increase in the aluminum price relative to the total system,\" he said on the company's earnings call. \"It's not insignificant, but it's not going to radically change a multibillion dollar U.S. business, and packaging is only a small component of the total cost structure.\"",
      "Coke could also start sourcing aluminum domestically, and raise consumer prices. Quincey noted that Coke already has \"hedging programs\" in place.",
      "\"As the relative prices of different sources of ingredients and imports change, of course we look at mitigation, productivity, efficiency, adjusting where we get our materials from. All of that goes into the equation to constantly manage how this goes through,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump's aim in announcing the tariffs is to protect U.S. manufacturing. \"Our nation requires steel and aluminum to be made in America, not in foreign lands. We need to create in order to protect our country's future resurgence of U.S. manufacturing and production, the likes of which has not been seen for many decades,\" Mr. Trump said on Monday.",

      "Probationary workers across multiple federal health agencies in the Department of Health and Human Services received virtually identical letters Saturday evening informing them they would be terminated from their positions, sources told CBS News.",
      "\"Unfortunately, the Agency finds that you are not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency's current needs, and your performance has not been adequate to justify further employment at the Agency,\" read the letter obtained by CBS News.",
      "The letter was signed by Jeffrey Anoka, acting head of human resources for the Department of Health and Human Services. One health official told CBS News thousands of letters were sent out Saturday.",

      "More than 5,000 probationary workers at health agencies had initially been slated to be let go, though not all received letters of termination Saturday. Some letters were also sent in error to people not intended to be let go, officials said.",
      "Some agencies have also been granted exemptions for a portion of their staff on the chopping block, as backlash has mounted over cuts at agencies like the Indian Health Service.",
      "Also not on the final list of cuts ordered by the Trump administration was the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service, the agency's \"disease detectives,\" CBS News learned. Officials overseeing the fellowship had initially warned health departments and those in their ranks that they would be halved.",
      "Fellowship programs elsewhere in the agency were not as lucky. Officials said CDC's Public Health Associate Program, which places recent graduates in health departments throughout the country, was cut.",
      "Other agencies losing staff Saturday include the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, which oversees the nation's pandemic stockpiles, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the National Institutes of Health.",

      "\"This isn't a haphazard effort of us axing whoever we can 'get away' with axing for the sake of it. This is a calculated effort to streamline bureaucracy,\" said the official.",
      "Calley Means, an adviser for newly sworn-in Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., defended the firings for reasons beyond cost savings, reiterating a criticism made during President Trump's presidential campaign that officials had not done enough to address drivers of sliding life expectancy in the U.S.",
      "\"It would be irrational not to make changes,\" Means wrote in a post to X.",
      "At the FDA, an employee said Saturday that scientists, engineers and an attorney had been among those terminated from the regulatory agency's ranks late Saturday.",

    "summary": "The Justice Department's motion to drop charges against Mayor Adams ends a days-long public over the decision to abandon the case.",
    "story": [
      "Federal prosecutors in New York have filed a motion to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, bringing to a close a days-long battle that has upended the Justice Department over the decision to abandon the case.",
      "The motion to dismiss the five-count indictment was filed on the court's public docket on Friday and said, \"The Acting Deputy Attorney General has determined, pursuant to an authorization by the Attorney General, that dismissal is necessary and appropriate, and has directed the same, based on the unique facts and circumstances of this case.\"",
      "\"The Acting Deputy Attorney General concluded that dismissal is necessary because of appearances of impropriety and risks of interference with the 2025 elections in New York City,\" the filing said, adding, \"the Acting Deputy Attorney General also concluded that continuing these proceedings would interfere with the defendant's ability to govern in New York City.\"",
      "The judge overseeing the case must approve the motion before the charges are officially dropped.",
      "A senior career attorney from the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section, the acting head of the Justice Department's criminal division and, notably, the acting deputy attorney general who is second in charge at the Justice Department jointly signed the motion.",
      "The decision to drop the case against Adams originated at Justice Department headquarters when former Trump attorney and Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove sent a memo instructing prosecutors in Manhattan to abandon the five-count indictment that was filed in September.",
      "In a statement, Justice Department chief of staff Chad Mizelle said of the refusal by several department prosecutors to file for dismissal of Adams' case, \"The fact that those who indicted and prosecuted the case refused to follow a direct command is further proof of the disordered and ulterior motives of the prosecutors. Such individuals have no place at DOJ.\"",
      "Bove, in his directive, cited Adams' \"restricted\" ability to help the Trump administration enforce its immigration policies, and the case was to be dropped without prejudice, so the charges could be revived at a later time. He also made accusations that the charges stemmed from political weaponization. The move followed meetings between senior Justice Department officials, Southern District of New York prosecutors and Adams' attorneys about dropping the charges, a source familiar with the discussions confirmed to CBS News.",
      "What followed was an extraordinary internal revolt from Justice Department leadership and federal prosecutors in Manhattan, pushing back on the decision to drop the charges against New York's mayor. The internal disagreements burst into public view on Thursday, when the acting head of the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of New York, Danielle Sassoon, resigned in protest.",
      "In a letter addressed to Attorney General Pam Bondi and reviewed by CBS News, Sassoon offered her resignation and said the request to drop Adams' case \"raises serious concerns that render the contemplated dismissal inconsistent with my ability and duty to prosecute federal crimes without fear or favor and to advance good-faith arguments before the courts.\"",
      "Sassoon's letter to the attorney general alleged that during a meeting with Justice Department officials last month, Adams' attorneys \"urged what amounted to a quid pro quo,\" allegedly offering the mayor's cooperation with Trump administration priorities in exchange for the dismissal of the charges.",
      "\"It is a breathtaking and dangerous precedent to reward Adams's opportunistic and shifting commitments on immigration and other policy matters with the dismissal of a criminal indictment. Nor will a court likely find that such an improper exchange is consistent with the public interest,\" Sassoon wrote.",
      "Bove and Adams' legal team both rejected this assertion.",
      "In a statement Friday, Adams claimed he is \"solely beholden to the 8.3 million New Yorkers that I represent,\" denying allegations that he offered to enact Mr. Trump's large-scaled deportation agenda in New York City in exchange for his case to be dropped.",
      "\"I want to be crystal clear with New Yorkers: I never offered \u2014 nor did anyone offer on my behalf \u2014 any trade of my authority as your mayor for an end to my case. Never,\" Adams said.",
      "Bove wrote a letter back to Sassoon and accused her of insubordination. The acting deputy attorney general said he and Justice Department leadership stood by the decision to drop Adams' case, and Sassoon's refusal to comply interfered with the \"interests of justice.\"",
      "Bove wrote that because of the prosecution against Adams, the mayor \"is unable to communicate directly and candidly with City officials he is responsible for managing, as well as federal agencies trying to protect the public from national security threats and violent crime.\"",
      "He said his directive to drop the charges \"reflected a determination by the Justice Department that these public safety risks greatly outweigh any interest you have identified.\"",
      "The line prosecutors who worked on Adams' case have been placed on paid leave, pending investigations into Sassoon's conduct, Bove's letter revealed.",
      "Following Sassoon's resignation, supervision of the Adams case was transferred from Manhattan to Justice Department headquarters in Washington, D.C., where two additional leadership members \u2014 Kevin Driscoll of the Criminal Division and John Keller, acting head of the public integrity section \u2014 also resigned in protest, sources confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Three additional senior officials in the public integrity unit in Washington, D.C., also resigned in the aftermath, two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "And on Friday, a line prosecutor in the Southern District of New York stepped down from his position and pushed back against the Trump administration's decision. In a scathing letter to Bove, Hagan Scotten defended Sassoon's work and the work of prosecutors who worked the Adams case, according to a copy of the letter obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"Any assistant U.S. attorney would know that our laws and traditions do not allow using prosecutorial power to influence other citizens, much less elected officials in this way,\" he wrote. \"If there is no lawyer within earshot of the President who is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion.\"",
      "\"But it was never going to be me,\" Scotten said.",
      "And in a joint statement late Friday, a group of seven former U.S. attorneys for the Southern District of New York, including former FBI Director James Comey, said they \"commend\" Sassoon \"on her decision to resign.\"",
      "\"Her commitment to integrity and the rule of law reflects the finest traditions of the Southern District United States Attorney's Office and the Department of Justice,\" they wrote. \"The Department's announced intent to investigate Ms. Sassoon and some of the career prosecutors who served alongside her is a stark departure from those traditions, and that should concern everyone committed to the pursuit of justice without fear or favor.\"",
      "Along with Comey, the statement was signed by Robert B. Fiske Jr., John S. Martin Jr., Mary Jo White, David N. Kelley, Geoffrey S. Berman and Audrey Strauss.",
      "Adams made history as the first sitting New York City mayor to be indicted on five counts of corruption back in September. The charges included bribery, conspiracy and campaign finance violations. He pleaded not guilty, and has stridently asserted his innocence ever since.",
      "He was to stand trial in April, and if convicted could have faced up to 45 years in prison.",
      "Dismissal comes after Adams meetings with Trump",
      "The stunning turn of events comes after Adams had high-profile meetings with President Trump. The two met in Florida while Mr. Trump was still president-elect. After that meeting, Adams said the two had not discussed his legal case at all.",
      "Adams then went on to cancel his plans to attend Martin Luther King, Jr. Day celebrations in New York City and instead attend Mr. Trump's inauguration, after receiving a last-minute invitation.",
      "When he was previously asked about the case against Adams, Mr. Trump said he thought Adams \"was treated pretty unfairly,\" and said he would consider a pardon. The dismissal of the case negates the need for any pardon.",
      "On Thursday, Mr. Trump said he was not involved with the decision to drop the case, telling members of the press, \"I didn't. I know nothing about it. I did not.\"",
      "Prosecutors recently appeared to be ramping up their case",
      "In her resignation letter, Sassoon, Manhattan's former top prosecutor, revealed her office had considered bringing additional charges against Adams focused on the alleged destruction of evidence and providing false statements to the FBI. Those charges were never filed.",
      "Early in January, prosecutors wrote in court documents that they had uncovered \"additional criminal conduct\" by the mayor. They didn't disclose what that other alleged criminal conduct was, however.",
      "At the time, Adams blasted the disclosure.",
      "\"You know, even Ray Charles can see what's going on. And I have an attorney, Alex Spiro, he is handling that. I've said over and over again, I've done nothing wrong,\" Adams said.",
      "Spiro called the move by prosecutors \"amateur hour,\" and accused them of \"looking for a headline instead of doing the right thing.\"",
      "Shortly after the initial charges against Adams were announced last fall, prosecutors said additional charges were \"quite likely.\"",
      "What's next for Adams",
      "The dismissal of the charges means Adams can fully focus his attention on running the city, as well as run for reelection.",
      "He faces challenges from Comptroller Brad Lander and Lander's predecessor, former Comptroller Scott Stringer, as well as State Sen. Jessica Ramos, State Sen. Zellnor Myrie and Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani \u2014 to name just a few.",
      "Adams is also facing calls from constituents and other lawmakers for him to resign. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who holds the power to remove Adams, told CBS News New York that she's in discussions with colleagues in government about what to do next.",

    "summary": "The requests by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission mark a major departure from its prior interpretation of civil rights law.",
    "story": [
      "Signaling a major shift in civil rights enforcement, the federal agency that enforces workplace anti-discrimination laws has moved to dismiss six of its own cases on behalf of workers alleging gender identity discrimination, arguing that the cases now conflict with President Donald Trump's recent executive order, court documents say.",
      "The requests by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission mark a major departure from its prior interpretation of civil rights law, and a stark contrast to a decade ago when the agency\u00a0issued a landmark finding\u00a0that a transgender civilian employee of the U.S. Army had been discriminated against because her employer refused to use her preferred pronouns or allow her to use bathrooms based on her gender identity.",
      "Just last year, the EEOC\u00a0updated its guidance\u00a0to specify that deliberately using the wrong pronouns for an employee, or refusing them access to bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, constituted a form of harassment. That followed a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that gay, lesbian and transgender people are protected from employment discrimination.",
      "Nearly all workplace discrimination charges\u00a0must pass through the EEOC \u2014 at least initially \u2014 and the agency's decision to drop at least six of the cases raises serious questions about whether its protections will continue to extend to\u00a0transgender and gender nonconforming\u00a0people going forward.",
      "The EEOC is seeking to dismiss three cases in Illinois as well as one in Alabama, New York and California. In each instance, the original complaints allege discrimination against transgender or gender nonconforming workers. The agency cites Trump's Jan. 20 executive order declaring that the government would recognize only two \"immutable\" sexes \u2014 male and female \u2014 as the reason for why it no longer intends to pursue the cases.",
      "The Alabama case charged that Harmony Hospitality LLC discriminated against an employee who identifies as a gay nonbinary male by firing him hours after co-owners learned of his gender identity. The New York lawsuit alleged that Boxwood Hotels LLC fired a transgender housekeeper who complained that a supervisor repeatedly misgendered them and made anti-transgender statements, referring to the housekeeper as a \"transformer\" and \"it.\"",
      "Another suit alleged that Wendy's franchisee Starboard Group, Inc. subjected three transgender employees to pervasive sexual harassment at a Wendy's restaurant in Carbondale, Illinois, claiming a supervisor demanded to know if one employee had a penis. In another Illinois case, a transgender Reggio's Pizza cashier at Chicago O'Hare International Airport was \"outed\" by her manager, called a racist, homophobic slur by coworkers, and fired when she complained. In southern Illinois, at a hog farm called Sis-Bro, Inc., a coworker allegedly exposed his genitals to a transgender employee and touched her breasts.",
      "And in Santa Clara, California, the EEOC charged that a Lush Handmade Cosmetics store manager sexually harassed three gender nonconforming employees with \"offensive physical and verbal sexual conduct.\"",
      "Former EEOC General Counsel and Professor and Co-Dean Emeritus at Rutgers Law School David Lopez, who served in the agency for more than 20 years, on Friday said in his experience, the EEOC has never dismissed cases based on substance rather than merit \u2014 until now.",
      "For the country's anti-discrimination agency \"to discriminate against a group, and say, 'We're not going to enforce the law on their behalf' itself is discrimination, in my view,\" Lopez said. \"It's like a complete abdication of responsibility.\"",
      "The EEOC's requests to dismiss the cases come just weeks after Trump\u00a0dismissed two Democratic commissioners of the five-member EEOC before their terms expired, an unprecedented decision that removed what would have been a major obstacle to his administration efforts to upend interpretation of the nation's civil rights laws. Had the commissioners been allowed to carry out their terms, the EEOC would have had a Democratic majority well into Trump's term. The administration also fired Karla Gilbride as the EEOC's general counsel, replacing her with Andrew Rogers as acting counsel.",
      "Shortly after their dismissals, acting EEOC chair Andrea Lucas, a Republican, signaled her intent to put the agency's resources behind enforcing Trump's executive order on gender. She announced in a statement that one of her priorities would be \"defending the biological and binary reality of sex and related rights.\" Later, she ordered that the EEOC would continue accepting any and all discrimination charges filed by workers, although complaints that \"implicate\" Trump's order should be elevated to headquarters for \"review.\"",
      "\"Biology is not bigotry. Biological sex is real, and it matters,\" Lucas said in her statement. \"Sex is binary (male and female) and immutable. It is not harassment to acknowledge these truths \u2014 or to use language like pronouns that flow from these realities, even repeatedly.\" She removed the agency's \"pronoun app,\" which allowed employees to display their pronouns in their Microsoft 365 profiles, among other changes.",
      "The EEOC in fiscal year 2023 received more than\u00a03,000 charges\u00a0alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, \"the most since the agency started tracking these charges in FY 2013, and up more than 36% from the previous year,\" according to the agency's website, which also provides a link for more information on discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. But the information appears to have been removed and the link now leads to a blank page with the message: \"The requested page could not be found.\"",
      "Jocelyn Samuels, one of the Democratic EEOC commissioners who was fired last month, said via email that Trump's executive order and the EEOC's response to it \"is truly regrettable.\"",
      "\"The Administration's efforts to erase trans people are deeply harmful to a vulnerable community and inconsistent with governing law,\" she said.",
      "Sarah Warbelow, vice president of legal at LGBTQ+ rights group Human Rights Campaign, added in an emailed statement: \"This is the inevitable outcome when the EEOC is weaponized to greenlight discrimination against American workers.",

    "published": "Sat, 15 Feb 2025 08:48:53 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is firing thousands of federal workers on probationary status, or those without civil service protections.",
    "story": [
      "Probational federal employees who lost their jobs on Thursday as part of the Trump administration's mass\u00a0firing of government workers\u00a0expressed shock and anger at the terminations, which they contend will hurt the government's ability to provide services.",
      "President Trump is moving quickly to shrink the U.S. federal government \u2014 the nation's largest employer \u2014 saying he is slashing wasteful spending and pushing to make the nation's civil workforce more responsive to his administration's policies. Federal workers in a probationary period typically have less than one year on the job and have not yet gained civil service protection.",
      "Federal workers who received termination notices on Thursday described receiving nonpersonalized emails informing them they had been removed from their position, with little communication from their supervisors. The workers said they had entered public service because of a commitment to serve the public interest, whether by helping protect consumers from predatory financial services or by supporting veterans.",
      "\"We had all received these notices that cites probationary regulations and says we're being let go because 'you are not fit for continued employment because your ability and skills do not fit the agency's needs,'\" Elizabeth Aniskevich, an attorney with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CBS News.",
      "A termination letter provided to CBS News by a former employee at the Department of Veterans Affairs informed the worker that his job was ending because \"you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the agency would be in the public interest.\"",
      "The VA worker, who had previously held federal jobs across different agencies for more than a decade, said he was dismayed to learn that he was considered a probationary worker after taking the Veterans Affairs job last fall, as it reset his government employment.",
      "\"Basically the gist [of the termination letter] is laying out I was a probationary employee, what my rights of appeal are, but my continued employment was no longer in the public interest,\" said the VA worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern that speaking publicly could jeopardize his chances of finding another government job. \"I came into the house \u2014 probably for a couple weeks my wife and I joked, 'Did I still have a job?' \u2014 I told her, and I lost it. It's devastating.\"",
      "Another VA employee, who told CBS News his work was rated as \"outstanding\" in his most recent performance review, said receiving an impersonal termination letter was hurtful.",
      "\"It feels like a copy/paste mass firing that takes nothing into account of the people, the human cost,\" said Greg House, 34, a disabled veteran who was terminated from his job at the VA's public affairs office in Salt Lake City, a job that he started in March 2024. He added, \"The idea that the federal workforce is too bloated feels like a scapegoat more than anything else. Nobody joins the federal government to get rich.\"",
      "The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has instructed agencies to report their final numbers of fired probationary employees by 8 p.m Eastern time on Tuesday, according to a source familiar with the matter.",
      "The White House press office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Unions claim firings are illegal",
      "Five unions for government employees have sued Mr. Trump and other officials in his administration over the firing of probationary workers, alleging the move is illegal because it violates procedures for making \"reductions in force,\" a formal process used by government agencies to dismiss employees.",
      "Reductions in force, or RIFs, can be made based on a number of issues, such as if there's not enough work or funding for federal workers, according to OPM.",
      "Mr. Trump's order \"directs agencies to promptly engage in RIFs for none of the specified, allowable reasons, but instead for the purpose of 'eliminating waste, bloat and insularity,'\" the lawsuit claims, citing the president's Feb. 11 executive order for widespread layoffs of government workers.",
      "Some experts are pushing back on the idea that the government workforce is too large, pointing out that federal employment has grown little since 1980. Prior to the firings, some agencies and services had already been grappling with staffing shortages, including the Veterans Health Administration.",
      "Impact on services",
      "The VA employee who was fired Thursday said he took exception to Mr. Trump's claim that the terminations would make the government more efficient, noting that his group, which had been trying to fill several empty positions, had more work than they could handle.",
      "\"We are under-resourced as it is, so cutting jobs won't do it,\" he said, adding that the firings will directly impact veterans. \"We have ongoing projects to try to construct and repair facilities to help veterans \u2014 we're already behind.\"",
      "A Food and Drug Administration employee \u2014 who also requested anonymity because she's in a probationary period in her job but hasn't received a termination letter \u2014 expressed concern that the firings would slow essential work, both because of the loss of skilled employees and a hit to employee morale.",
      "\"We're rather leanly staffed \u2014 the people on some of these teams have a tremendous workload,\" she said. \"It'll slow down things like drugs approvals ... it'll have a tremendous, terrible impact on access to drugs and generic drugs.\"",
      "Because many of the probationary workers are younger employees, the firings could add to long-term problems facing the federal workforce, where twice as many workers are over age 60 than under 30, said Elizabeth Linos, the Emma Bloomberg associate professor of public policy and management at Harvard's Kennedy School.",
      "\"This will exacerbate the existing human capital crisis if probationary employees are more likely to be young, and more likely to have the skills that a 21st century government operation needs,\" she said.",
      "Where jobs are getting cut",
      "As of May 2024, the most recent data available, about 216,000 federal employees had been in their jobs for less than one year, according to government data from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.",
      "The government agency with the most probationary employees is the VA, with about 56,000 workers bearing that designation, OPM data shows. The VA on Friday said it had fired more than 1,000 employees. The agency didn't respond to a request for comment about whether more firings could be coming.",
      "\"Make no mistake \u2014 Trump is looking to fire probationary employees because it is easy, not because it is good for veterans or cost-effective,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut who serves on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, told CBS News in a statement. \"In fact, it is a massive waste of taxpayer dollars to fire employees the department just invested months into recruiting, vetting and training.\"",
      "Department of Health and Human Services officials expect most of the agency's roughly 5,200 probationary employees to be fired Friday, Feb. 14, under the Trump administration's move to get rid of nearly all probationary employees, according to an audio recording of a National Institutes of Health department meeting obtained by the Associated Press.",
      "In that meeting, an NIH office director told employees that some probationary staff with specialized skills might retain their positions. Probationary staff being terminated would receive an email Friday afternoon, the AP reported, citing the recording.",
      "Among those being cut are nearly 1,300 probationary employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or roughly one-tenth of the agency's workforce.",

      "The U.S. Army will no longer allow transgender people to enlist, and will stop providing gender-affirming care for service members, it announced on social media Friday.",
      "\"The #USArmy will no longer allow transgender individuals to join the military and will stop performing or facilitating procedures associated with gender transition for service members. Stay tuned for more details,\" the post said.",
      "The Army later commended troops with \"gender dysphoria\" in a\u00a0follow-up post, stating they \"volunteered to serve our country and will be treated with dignity and respect.\"",
      "The announcement follows an executive order signed by President Trump on Jan. 27 that directed the Pentagon to determine a policy for transgender service members within 30 days.",
      "The president's order stated that expressing \"a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life\" and that those doing so \"cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\"",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had paused bringing in recruits who have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria and paused all gender-affirming care, according to a memo issued Feb. 7.",
      "The memo appears in the docket for the case in the D.C. District Court challenging the president's executive order, which could lead to a renewed ban on transgender troops. Mr. Trump previously disqualified most transgender people from serving openly in the military during his first term, a move that former President Joe Biden rescinded\u00a0shortly after taking office in January 2021.",

    "story": [
      "Amid a swirl of resignations, charges and calls for New York City Mayor Eric Adams to step down, one person who remains in the mayor's corner is his predecessor.",
      "Bill de Blasio, the former New York City mayor and a fellow Democrat, believes the case against Adams should never have been brought. The charges, which include bribery and campaign finance allegations, \"were flimsy,\" de Blasio said in an interview Friday with CBS News.",
      "\"From Day One, I thought the charges against him were very weak,\" de Blasio said. \"I believe in my heart, and this is from personal experience, that we've got to have maturity to know that just because some prosecutor brings a charge doesn't mean it's true.\"",
      "On Monday, Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove sent a memo instructing former New York U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon's office to abandon the five-count indictment against Adams. Bove wrote that the case \"restricted\" Adams' ability to help the Trump administration enforce its immigration policies.",
      "Sassoon, who was Manhattan's top career federal prosecutor until Thursday, was among at least half a dozen Justice Department officials to resign after her office was directed to drop its criminal case against Adams.",
      "Adams, who pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing, was set to go to trial in April. Prosecutors said in a sprawling September indictment that Adams abused his power for years, using his influence to obtain illegal campaign contributions and free or discounted travel.",
      "Sassoon wrote in a letter to the attorney general Thursday that Adams' attorneys had \"urged what amounted to a quid pro quo,\" allegedly offering the mayor's cooperation with Trump administration priorities in immigration enforcement in exchange for dismissal of the charges.",
      "An attorney for Adams called that \"a total lie,\" and in a statement Friday, Adams also denied the allegation.",
      "\"I want to be crystal clear with New Yorkers: I never offered \u2014 nor did anyone offer on my behalf \u2014 any trade of my authority as your mayor for an end to my case. Never,\" Adams said.",
      "Adams on Thursday announced an executive order allowing federal immigration agents to enter the city's Rikers Island jail complex \u2014 a major reversal of city policy. But de Blasio said he is skeptical that decisions like that are evidence of a deal with the White House.",
      "De Blasio said he didn't believe that was indicative of a quid pro quo arrangement. He called the move \"consistent with his previous positions that had nothing to do with his legal case.\"",
      "\"I've had my differences with Eric Adams, but I've known him a long time. He was a police officer for 20 years. He understands the law,\" de Blasio said. \"I am not surprised that he takes a different position on immigration than the rest of us (New York Democrats).\"",
      "De Blasio was broadly critical of the case and the prosecutors who brought it, saying the plan to go to trial just two months before the city's crucial Democratic primary was irresponsible.",
      "However, Sassoon, in her resignation letter Thursday, noted that the Justice Department had indicted Adams earlier. \"The Department of Justice correctly concluded that bringing charges nine months before a primary election was entirely appropriate,\" Sassoon wrote.",
      "De Blasio said he knows from experience the toll of being under investigation. He weathered his own federal probe related to campaign fundraising. It did not lead to charges. De Blasio said \"the process of defending yourself from a potential charge is time consuming\" and often means extra hours spent fundraising.",
      "He said an upcoming election was the elephant in the room.",
      "\"They were explicit that there was a clock in mind. They either had to prove their case or pull it,\" de Blasio said.",
      "In March 2017, acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim announced no charges would be brought against de Blasio. The announcement noted that Kim's office wanted to avoid influencing that year's race for City Hall.",
      "\"Although it is rare that we issue a public statement about the status of an investigation, we believe it appropriate in this case at this time, in order not to unduly influence the upcoming campaign and Mayoral election,\" Kim said.",
      "Adams and Bove called the case against him politically motivated, echoing complaints made about other cases by Bove's former defense client, President Trump.",
      "De Blasio thinks the parallel ends there.",
      "\"It's apples to oranges. For all things related to Trump, there was massive evidence in public view. No one's ever shown evidence of bribery (against Adams),\" de Blasio said.",
      "Mr. Trump was convicted in New York last year of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. He is appealing that conviction. A criminal case in Georgia is on indefinite hold, and a federal case against Mr. Trump was dropped after he was elected in November, because pursuing it further would have violated Justice Department policy regarding sitting presidents. Another federal case was dismissed last summer.",
      "Mr. Trump has denied all allegations and accused various prosecutors of charging him for political gain.",
      "Adams' critics have accused him of cozying up to Trump in order to make his case go away. De Blasio said Adams can show that's untrue through open opposition to Trump policies.",

      "Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a high-stakes meeting at this year's Munich Security conference to discuss the Trump administration's efforts to end the war in Ukraine. Vance said the U.S. seeks a \"durable\" peace, while Zelenskyy expressed the desire for extensive discussions to prepare for any end to the conflict.",
      "\"We want the killing to stop, but we want to achieve a durable, lasting peace,\" Vance said. \"Not the kind of peace that's going to have Eastern Europe in conflict just a couple years down the road.\"",
      "Zelenskyy thanked Vance for the meeting, but stressed the need to address guarantees of Ukraine's security in negotiating an end to the conflict, which is about to enter its fourth year.",
      "\"Really, what we need is to speak more, to work more and to prepare the plan of how to stop Putin and finish the war,\" Zelensky said. \"We want this very much, but we need real security guarantees.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, special envoy for Ukraine and Russia Keith Kellogg, and deputy special envoy for the Middle East Morgan Ortagus were at the table with Vance.",
      "President Trump spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy Wednesday and directed his national security team to begin work on negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent met with Zelenskyy in Kyiv Wednesday, the first top Trump administration official to meet in person with the Ukrainian president since the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term.",
      "After that meeting, Zelenskyy said Ukraine would prepare an agreement to strengthen Ukraine's security and economic relations with the U.S., related to the country's rare earth minerals.",
      "Mr. Trump indicated before the Munich meeting that aid to Ukraine could be conditioned on access to rare earth minerals in the country.",
      "\"We are going to have all this money in there, and I say I want it back. And I told them that I want the equivalent, like $500 billion worth of rare earth,\" the president recently told Fox News. \"They have essentially agreed to do that, so at least we don't feel stupid.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said Friday that the U.S. should arm Ukraine with \"a bunch\" of F-16 fighter jets in exchange for the minerals.",
      "\"How do you deter Putin? You arm this guy to the teeth,\" Graham said in Munich while appearing alongside several of his Senate colleagues and Zelenskyy on a panel. \"So let's arm this guy. Let's do the minerals agreement, so we'll have our American business interest. Putin doesn't understand what's going on. If we sign this minerals agreement, Putin is screwed, because Trump will defend the deal.\"",
      "Graham also said NATO membership for Ukraine should stay on the table as a threat to Putin.",
      "\"If we can't agree they should be in NATO like right now, can we agree that if there's ever another invasion, the moment they invade, they'd go into NATO,\" Graham said. \"I think we'll let Putin know that if he ever does this again, they're going into NATO really quick.\"",
      "At last year's gathering in Munich, Vance, then a U.S. senator, declined to meet with Zelenskyy, telling\u00a0Politico\u00a0at the time that he didn't think he \"would learn anything new.\"",

      "Vance did not respond to questions from reporters when asked if Ukraine should be able to join NATO.",
      "Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office on Wednesday that he was \"OK\" with taking the idea of Ukraine joining NATO off the negotiating table, characterizing the proposal as \"not practical.\"",
      "In remarks at the conference, Vance reiterated that Mr. Trump would like to see European allies in NATO contribute at least 5% of their gross domestic product to increased security spending, and he also made that point in meetings with European leaders.",
      "\"While the Trump administration is very concerned with European security, and believes that we can come to a reasonable settlement between Russia and Ukraine, we also believe that it's important in the coming years for Europe to step up in a big way to provide for its own defense,\" Vance said.",
      "Vance lectured Europeans at the conference, telling them, \"The threat that I worry the most about vis-\u00e0-vis Europe is not Russia; it's not China.\"",
      "\"What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America,\" the vice president said.",

      "The cuts are among the thousands of probationary workers being let go this week across the federal government as part of efforts to shrink the federal workforce overseen by President Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, task force headed by billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "The CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service or EIS officers are hired in annual classes through a competitive process.",

    "story": [
      "San Salvador \u2014 It takes about 90 minutes to drive from El Salvador's capital, San Salvador, to the most notorious prison in the country.",
      "Opened in 2023, the Center for the Confinement of Terrorism, known as CECOT, was designed to hold the most dangerous gang members in what used to be the country with the highest murder rate in the world.",
      "Prisoners cannot receive visitors, and hearings happen only via zoom. Cell signal is blocked within a mile-and-a-half radius surrounding the prison to keep any information from getting out in an effort to contain the power of gangs which authorities said used to control 85% or the country's territory. Today, El Salvador has the lowest homicide rate in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Starting in 2022, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador declared a state of exception, which empowered police and the military to arrest people on suspicion of gang affiliation, without any evidence of committing crimes. The state of exception has led to the imprisonment of more than 80,000 people, making El Salvador the country with the highest incarceration rate in the world, at 2%. But the crackdown has earned Bukele an approval rating of more than 90%.",
      "Many inmates are serving sentences that are centuries long, while others still have not been convicted. But the prison's director affirms no prisoner there will ever step outside.",
      "Last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that Bukele had agreed to accept deportees from the U.S., including U.S. citizens. Those convicted of crimes would be held in prisons like CECOT.",
      "\"We have offered the United States of America the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system,\" Bukele wrote in a Feb. 3 social media post. \"We are willing to take in only convicted criminals (including convicted U.S. citizens) into our mega-prison (CECOT) in exchange for a fee.\"",
      "Bukele added that the fee would be \"relatively low,\" but would help make the country's prison system \"sustainable.\"",
      "CECOT has a stated capacity of 40,000, and while prison authorities would not disclose the exact number of inmates housed in it, citing safety concerns, they said it is at least at half-capacity, with around 80 to 100 inmates in each cell. They sleep on metal slabs and are only allowed outside the cells for 30 minutes per day. If they need medical attention, they are treated within the modules so no prisoner ever leaves the premises alive.",
      "Inmate Marvin Vazquez belongs to the infamous MS-13 gang. He was arrested in El Salvador after the government declared war on the gangs in 2022.",
      "Vazquez explains that he expects to be incarcerated in CECOT \"for the rest of my life.\"",
      "\"We murdered a lot of people, and this is the consequence of what happened to us, is like the Titanic,\" Vazquez said. \"That we were a big and strong gang. But we got hit with the iceberg.\"",
      "He adds, \"We try to act strong in the day and cry in the nighttime.\"",
      "Most Salvadorans support Bukele's efforts to lock up gang members. But advocates for migrants in the U.S. worry this is no place for any but the most dangerous people.",
      "\"I worry about the idea that people who are undesirable in the United States can just be sent to, basically, a transnational penal colony, without any guarantees of rights or due process,\" said Noah Bullock, executive director of Cristosal, a human rights organization that used to serve the victims of criminal gangs, and now serves people fleeing persecution by the state.",
      "CBS News spoke with journalists, activists and even first responders who say they have been unfairly persecuted by the state, some going months into hiding. One woman who has not heard from her husband since he was taken to a prison without evidence of gang affiliation says she is as afraid of the government as she used to be of the gangs.",
      "Bullock said CECOT and the full-body tattooed gang members held in it are the face of the president's security strategy, but it's a misrepresentation of the majority of the people who have been detained and the conditions that they're held in. He says the rest of the maximum security prisons are far worse, and most of people held in them indefinitely are not gang members.",

    "summary": "Federal layoffs are starting with huge numbers of probationary workers, and there are warnings of bigger cuts on the way.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Thursday intensified its sweeping efforts to\u00a0shrink the size of the federal workforce, the nation's largest employer, by ordering agencies to lay off nearly all probationary employees who hadn't yet gained civil service protection \u2014 potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of workers.",
      "In addition, workers at some agencies were warned that large workplace cuts would be coming.",
      "The decision on probationary workers, who generally have less than a year on the job, came from the Office of Personnel Management, which serves as a human resources department for the federal government. The notification was confirmed by a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss it publicly.",
      "Even workers in the personnel office itself weren't immune: Dozens of probationary employees at OPM were told on a Thursday afternoon group call that they were being dismissed and then instructed to leave the building within a half-hour, according to another person who likewise spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "It's expected to be the first step in sweeping layoffs. President Trump signed an executive order Tuesday that told agency leaders to plan for \"large-scale reductions in force.\"",
      "Elon Musk, to whom the president has given wide leeway to slash government spending with his Department of Government Efficiency, called Thursday for the elimination of whole agencies.",
      "\"I think we do need to delete entire agencies as opposed to leave a lot of them behind,\" Musk said via a videocall to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. \"If we don't remove the roots of the weed, then it's easy for the weed to grow back.\"",
      "Everett Kelley, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees representing federal workers, said the administration \"abused\" the probation status of workers \"to conduct a politically driven mass firing spree, targeting employees not because of performance, but because they were hired before Trump took office.\"",
      "Thursday's order was an expansion of previous directions from OPM, which told agencies earlier this week that probationary employees should be fired if they weren't meeting high standards. It's not clear how many workers are currently in a probationary period. According to government data maintained by OPM, as of March 2024, 220,000 workers had less than a year on the job \u2014 the most recent data available.",
      "The firing of probationary employees began earlier this week and has included the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Department of Education workers.",
      "At least 39 were fired from the Education Department on Wednesday, according to a union that represents agency workers, including civil rights workers, special education specialists and student aid officials.",
      "The layoffs also hit Department of Veterans Affairs researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics and burn pit exposure, Sen. Patty Murray, a Washington state Democrat, said Thursday.",
      "Murray said in a statement that she heard from VA researchers in her state who were told to stop their research immediately, \"not because their work isn't desperately needed, but because Trump and Elon have decided to fire these researchers on a whim.\"",
      "The VA announced Thursday that it had laid off more than 1,000 non-\"mission critical\" probationary workers and the move would \"save the department more than $98 million per year, and VA will redirect all of those resources back toward health care, benefits and services for VA beneficiaries.\"",
      "Half of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention's Epidemic Intelligence Service officers \u2014 a group known as\u00a0the CDC's \"disease detectives\" \u2014 were among the cuts made Friday, multiple health officials tell CBS News.",
      "The Trump administration also moved Friday to fire more than 400 employees at the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, a group that defends government workers, said the Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service would be hit especially hard by laying off probationary employees because it has trouble recruiting inspectors required to be present at all times at most slaughterhouses.",
      "The civilian federal workforce, not including military personnel and postal workers, is made up of about 2.4 million people. While about 20% of the workers are in Washington D.C. and the neighboring states of Maryland and Virginia, more than 80% live outside the Capitol region.",
      "Layoffs are unlikely to yield significant deficit savings. When the Congressional Budget Office looked at the issue, it found the government spent $271 billion annually compensating civilian federal workers, with about 60% of that total going to workers employed by the departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs.",
      "The government could, in theory, cut all those workers and still run a deficit of over $1 trillion that would continue to grow as tax revenues are needed to keep up with the growing costs of Social Security and Medicare.",
      "Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said firing employees on probation is flawed because it targets younger workers.",
      "\"Baby Boomers are retiring right and left, so actually the people you want to keep are probably most of the people who are right now on probation,\" said Kamarck, who worked in former President Bill Clinton's Democratic administration when about 426,000 federal jobs were cut over more than eight years in a deliberative effort aimed at reinventing government. \"They're younger and presumably have better skills, and that's who you want.\"",
      "Mr, Trump's initial attempt to downsize the workforce was the deferred resignation program, commonly described as a \"buyout,: which offered to pay people until Sept. 30 if they agreed to quit. The White House said 75,000 people signed up, and a federal judge cleared a legal roadblock for the program Wednesday.",
      "However, the number of workers who took the offer was less than the administration's target, and Mr. Trump has made it clear he would take further steps.",
      "Employees at the National Science Foundation and Housing and Urban Development Department were told this week that large reductions, in some cases a halving of the workforce, would be coming, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it.",
      "The order the president signed Tuesday stipulated that government functions not required by law would be prioritized for cuts and hiring will be restricted. With exceptions for functions such as public safety, only one employee can be added for every four who leave. In addition, new hires would generally need approval from a representative of the DOGE, expanding the influence of Musk's team.",
      "Mr. Trump has praised Musk's work to slash federal spending.",
      "The Republican president has also been sharply critical of federal workers, especially those who want to keep working remotely, though his administration is simultaneously working to cut federal office space and ordering the termination of worksite leases throughout the government.",
      "\"Nobody is gonna work from home,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"They are gonna be going out, they're gonna play tennis, they're gonna play golf, they're gonna do a lot of things. They're not working.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Friday moved to fire more than 400 employees at the Department of Homeland Security, the latest effort in a government-wide campaign to dramatically reduce the federal workforce.",
      "Officials at DHS said they had fired hundreds of employees across several of its agencies after supervisors identified \"non-mission critical personnel in probationary status\" within the nation's top cybersecurity agency, known as CISA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which administers the nation's legal immigration system, among others.",
      "\"Under President Trump's leadership, we are making sweeping cuts and reform across the federal government to eliminate egregious waste and incompetence that has been happening for decades at the expense of the American taxpayer,\" DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "McLaughlin said the personnel cuts will result in roughly $50 million in savings, and be \"incalculably valuable\" to the administration's efforts to cut red tape, adding that the department is \"actively identifying other wasteful positions and offices that do not do not fulfill DHS' mission.\"",
      "In total, over 200 personnel have been fired from FEMA, the nation's disaster relief agency. The eliminations follow DHS' announcement earlier this week that four FEMA employees would be terminated over payments to reimburse New York City for hotel costs for migrants. The workers were accused of circumventing agency leadership to make the transactions, which have been part of a routine reimbursement program that offsets costs to care for a spike in migration along the southern border.",
      "The mass firings also include over 130 cuts within the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Among the newest federal agencies, CISA was established during the first Trump administration in 2018 to spearhead a national effort to oversee cyber and physical risk to U.S. critical infrastructure. Among other duties, the top cyber agency partners with states and local jurisdictions to secure U.S. election infrastructure.",
      "The department has also offered a dozen members of the U.S. Coast Guard currently placed on administrative leave a new assignment at the southwest border in support of border security efforts. Those service members previously worked on a team dedicated to diversity, equity and inclusion efforts within the Coast Guard workforce.",
      "The cuts include nearly 50 workers at USCIS, which processes a broad class of applications for immigration benefits, including requests for citizenship, green cards, asylum and work permits, plus an additional ten employees from DHS' Science and Technology Directorate.",
      "Notably, two large DHS agencies spearheading President Trump's highly-publicized crackdown on illegal immigration, Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, were spared in Friday's firings.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order Tuesday informing agency leaders to plan for \"large-scale reductions in force.\"",
      "Office of Personnel Management officials convened a meeting with agency leaders across government Thursday, instructing them to begin terminating employees still in their probationary period, according to administration officials. Federal employees typically remain on probation between one to two years after being hired, a status that offers some workplace protections but also makes them easier to remove from their posts.",
      "The Trump administration has moved aggressively to fire federal employees, most of them recent hires, in different agencies, including at the departments of Veterans Affairs and Education and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the U.S. Forest Service.",
      "It has also overseen a sweeping employee purge at the U.S. Agency for International Development, which distributes the foreign aid the Trump administration has sought to pause.",
      "Trump appointees have carried out the mass firings in concert with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, the initiative led by billionaire Elon Musk that has installed officials across different agencies to cut the federal bureaucracy and freeze funding deemed to be wasteful.",
      "From the Oval Office on Tuesday, Mr. Trump claimed that his administration had found \"billions and billions of dollars in waste, fraud and abuse,\" though offered little evidence to reporters.",
      "On Thursday, Musk called for the U.S. to \"delete entire agencies\" at home and \"mind its own business\" at times abroad.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in Seattle put a pause on President Trump's directive that seeks to restrict access to gender-affirming care for young people under the age of 19, becoming the second in so many days to halt the president's efforts to target access to the treatments.",
      "The order from U.S. District Judge Lauren King was issued Friday as part of a legal challenge brought one week ago by a group of three states \u2014 Washington, Minnesota and Oregon \u2014 and three physicians who provide the care for transgender patients being treated for gender dysphoria.",
      "King, appointed by former President Joe Biden, held a hearing earlier Friday on the states' bid to temporarily bar enforcement of Mr. Trump's order limiting access to gender-affirming care for young people. A brief entry on the court's docket indicated that King had agreed to grant a temporary restraining order and would issue a written order.",
      "The block will remain in place while legal proceedings move forward.",
      "King's decision follows a similar move by a federal judge in Maryland, who on Thursday\u00a0temporary halted Mr. Trump's executive action for 14 days. His order came in a case brought by the ACLU on behalf of a group of seven transgender youth and two LGBTQ rights organizations.",
      "The president's directive, issued in his first week in office, threatens research and education grants awarded to medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to patients under the age of 19. Treatments covered by the order include puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical procedures.",
      "The Democrat-led states that sued the Trump administration over the order said it deprives transgender youth of life-saving medical care. They called it a \"cruel and baseless broadside against transgender youth, their families, and the doctors and medical institutions that provide them this critical care.\"",
      "\"It is an official statement of bigotry from the president that directs agencies to openly discriminate against vulnerable youth on the basis of their transgender status and sex,\" state officials wrote in their lawsuit. \"It is also a blatant abuse of power. The order usurps spending and legislative powers belonging exclusively to Congress, and seizes the States' historic police powers to regulate the practice of medicine in violation of the Tenth Amendment.\"",
      "But the White House has defended the order as part of an effort to protect children from treatments that can have negative health consequences and that lack evidence as to their efficacy. Justice Department lawyers wrote in a court filing that the suit is also premature, as federal agencies have not threatened to revoke any particular grants at issue in the executive order.",
      "Additionally, the Justice Department said Article II of the Constitution gives the president the authority to direct agencies to take steps to further his administration's policies.",
      "\"That sort of order \u2014 cutting off at the jump the ability of the Executive Branch to even pursue a general course of action \u2014 would be a remarkable intrusion on a separate branch of government, in conflict with Article II,\" they argued in the filing. \"The president has the constitutional authority to direct his subordinates to pursue a general policy goal, consistent with all applicable law.\"",
      "Half of the states have enacted laws in recent years that limit access to gender-affirming care for minors. The Supreme Court is currently considering the constitutionality of one of those laws, from Tennessee, and will likely issue a decision in the challenge brought by former President Joe Biden's administration, three families and a doctor by the beginning of July.",

      "The White House is barring all Associated Press journalists from accessing spaces such as the Oval Office and Air Force One, a top White House official announced Friday, after the White House shut the AP out of the Oval Office and a formal news conference earlier in the week.",
      "The decision to limit AP's access stems from its decision not to recognize the Trump administration's name change from Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America on federal maps, websites and documents. Instead, the White House says it will open AP's spot in the White House press pool to other reporters.",
      "\"The Associated Press continues to ignore the lawful geographic name change of the Gulf of America,\" wrote White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich. \"This decision is not just divisive, but it also exposes the Associated Press' commitment to misinformation. While their right to irresponsible and dishonest reporting is protected by the First Amendment, it does not ensure their privilege of unfettered access to limited spaces, like the Oval Office and Air Force One. Going forward, that space will now be opened up to the many thousands of reporters who have been barred from covering these intimate areas of the administration. Associated Press journalists and photographers will retain their credentials to the White House complex.\"",
      "The AP is a regular representative in the White House press pool, the rotating group of reporters, videographers and photographers who cover the president daily and travel with him whenever he leaves White House grounds. The AP is a news wire service that covers the globe, and local newspapers have increasingly relied on it and other syndicated news outlets as local newsrooms undergone staffing reductions. The AP estimates 4 billion people read its news every day, and it has journalists in nearly 100 countries.",
      "The AP style guide, which many newsrooms across the country follow, published an update on Jan. 23, two days after the president signed his executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico. It noted that Mr. Trump's order only carries authority within the U.S. and other countries did not have to recognize the change. The wire service's guide said that as an international agency, \"the AP must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.\"",
      "In his executive order, Mr. Trump had also reverted the name of Alaska's Mt. Denali back to Mount McKinley. AP said it would refer to it as Mount McKinley because it \"lies solely in the United States,\" adding that \"as president, Trump has the authority to change federal geographical names within the country.\"",
      "The White House Correspondents Association, which represents hundreds of reporters who cover the White House, criticized the White House after it barred AP reporters from a news conference with President Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday.",
      "\"The White House's decision to bar Associated press reporters from today's press conference with President Trump and Prime Minister Modi is outrageous and a deeply disappointing escalation of an already unacceptable situation,\" the WHCA said. \"Let me be clear: the White House is seeking to curtail press freedoms enshrined in our Constitution, and has publicly admitted they are restricting access to events to punish a news outlet for not advancing the government's preferred language.\"",
      "The WHCA also said the White House's decision constituted a \"textbook violation of not only the First Amendment, but the president's own executive order on freedom of speech and ending federal censorship.\"",
      "After AP's ban from the Trump-Modi news conference, AP executive editor Julie Pace also called the White House's decision a \"plain violation of the First Amendment,\" and she urged the Trump administration \"in the strongest terms possible to stop this practice.\"",
      "\"This is now the third day AP reporters have been barred from covering the president \u2014 first as a member of the pool, and now from a formal press conference \u2014 an incredible disservice to the billions of people who rely on the Associated Press for nonpartisan news,\" Pace wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was confirmed and sworn in\u00a0as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services this week, but his promise to \"Make America Healthy Again\" may prove challenging to achieve \u2014 due both to the limits of his role as well as actions already being taken by the administration to make cuts to health agencies.",
      "On CBS News 24/7 Friday, Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said widespread firings at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ordered by the Trump administration, could hamper progress on health issues for years to come.",
      "\"Over 1,200 (new hires) are expected to be fired,\" she said. \"...That's a huge proportion of the CDC workforce.\"",
      "Beyond that, she said, \"Another group that is being targeted here are senior scientists. These are some of the top of the top talent, and then also the very youngest, the pipeline of new talent. And so this is very concerning when you have your top talent, your new talent, being fired in one big purge.\"",
      "How CDC cuts could affect Americans and their health",
      "These firings come as the nation is currently dealing with a deadly second surge of the flu this season, measles outbreaks in parts of the country, and mounting worries about bird flu.",
      "\"We're going to see a couple things. One, it's a chilling of the Public Health Service. So people will be afraid to do the work that they need to do in terms of informing the public, in terms of warning the public,\" Gounder said. \"We've also seen in some states like Louisiana pulling back on mass vaccinations. I think we'll continue to see moves like that, and that policy may not be guided by science, but rather by politics and ideology.\"",
      "Already, vaccine skepticism in the country is threatening public health. Health experts have seen these views on vaccines, which have become increasingly politicized, contributing to lower vaccination rates across the country, leading to outbreaks of otherwise\u00a0preventable diseases",
      "Kennedy has a\u00a0long history\u00a0of\u00a0raising doubts\u00a0about\u00a0vaccines\u00a0\u2014 despite decades of evidence showing they've saved millions of people from debilitating illness or death.",
      "What does RFK Jr. actually control?",
      "With his confirmation, Kennedy sits at the helm of the sprawling HHS department, which includes the CDC, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration \u2014 but, despite his passion for changing the way Americans eat, he doesn't have much direct control over that.",
      "\"HHS does not have a ton of levers in terms of improving and making the food supply more healthy,\" Gounder said, since that's largely the role of the United States Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "\"In fact, during the Senate confirmation hearings, one of the senators kind of took him to task on this and essentially told him, you're going to need to stay in your lane and acknowledge that this is not under your purview, that some of these issues are under the purview of USDA and EPA when it comes to tackling chemicals in the environment,\" she added. \"And so, whether he can deliver on his promises, I am very skeptical.\"",
      "One concrete thing he could help move forward is preliminary guidance at the FDA on front-of-package food labeling, Gounder said.",
      "\"(These labels) would make it very clear to consumers whether something's healthy, but whether that rule will be finalized under this administration remains very unclear,\" she said.",
      "Gounder pointed out the MAHA movement is also not focusing on a large chunk of what harms children in the U.S.",
      "\"It's great to say we want our children to be healthy. What are the number one and number two causes of death among kids in this country? It's gun violence and it's motor vehicle accidents,\" she said. \"There's nothing about that in the MAHA executive order that was signed by President Trump.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 16:57:34 -0500",
    "summary": "The head of planetary defense at the European Space Agency discusses 2024 YR4, an asteroid with a small chance of striking Earth eight years from now.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or, even less likely, the moon \u2014 and astronomers have so far set the probability of a crash at around 2%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's planetary defense office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation,\u00a0 which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 2%, it's still around 98% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 2%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 2% is a 98% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 98% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

      "The images were captured by the rover's Mastcam, which NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory compared to the rover's eyes. The clouds were spotted on Jan. 17, and the photos were taken over the course of 16 minutes, the space agency said in a news release.",
      "The clouds, known as noctilucent or twilight clouds, contain frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice. They are tinted with colors when the setting Sun scatters light. That color has led to them being nicknamed \"mother-of-pearl\" clouds.",
      "While Mars' atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide, few of its clouds are at a high enough atmosphere and low enough temperature to contain frozen carbon dioxide. Most clouds on the planet are made of water ice. The clouds photographed by Curiosity are at an altitude of 37 to 50 miles above the planet's surface. Other images show the clouds as white plumes falling through the atmosphere, before evaporating about 31 miles above Mars.",
      "Did you know that Mars has *iridescent* clouds?Spotted by the @MarsCuriosity rover, these unique clouds are made of carbon dioxide ice and are only observed at twilight. What this helps us learn about the Red Planet: https://t.co/Snqyo49n1W pic.twitter.com/anXG7hf61K",
      "The twilight clouds have only been spotted in some areas of Mars' southern hemisphere. NASA's Perseverance Rover, which landed on Mars' northern hemisphere in 2021, has not seen the clouds since it landed, but Curiosity has seen them in the southern hemisphere in four different Mars years.",
      "Mark Lemmon, an atmospheric scientist with the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told NASA that he believes certain regions of the planet are more likely to form the clouds. Gravity waves, which cool a planet's atmosphere, could be a factor, he said.",
      "\"Carbon dioxide was not expected to be condensing into ice here, so something is cooling it to the point that it could happen,\" Lemmon said in NASA's news release. \"But Martian gravity waves are not fully understood and we're not entirely sure what is causing twilight clouds to form in one place but not another.\"",
      "Even though researchers don't totally understand how the clouds are formed, they can predict when and where they will appear. Lemmon, who was a lead researcher on a 2024 paper detailing Curiosity's first two years of cloud observations, said the phenomenon has \"become so predictable that we can plan our shots in advance.\"",
      "The new cloud photos aren't the only data Curiosity has sent back to NASA in recent weeks. The rover recently investigated a place called the Gediz Vallis channel, the space agency said.",

      "NASA plans to bring the two Starliner astronauts back to Earth, along with their two space station crewmates, around March 19-20, shortening their long-extended stay in orbit by about two weeks, the agency announced Tuesday.",
      "The slightly earlier-than-planned trip home was made possible by a tentative decision last week to switch the next set of station fliers \u2014 Crew 10 \u2014 to a different Crew Dragon spacecraft, one that can be ready for launch as early as March 12, with weather and other factors considered.",
      "After a five-to-seven-day handover to bring their Crew 10 replacements up to speed on the ins and outs of space station operation, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, will undock and head back to Earth.",
      "They'll come home aboard the Crew Dragon that carried Hague and Gorbunov to the station last September, along with two empty seats reserved for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "Assuming the dates hold up, Wilmore and Williams will have logged nearly 290 days in orbit since launch June 5 on a mission originally expected to last a little more than one week. That's how long Boeing and NASA managers thought it would take to complete the Starliner's first piloted test flight.",
      "As it turned out, the Starliner, built as part of a NASA program to develop independent commercial crew ships to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, ran into propulsion problems and propellant leaks that prompted weeks and then months of tests and analysis.",
      "In the end, NASA managers decided the risks were too high to bring Wilmore and Williams down aboard the Starliner. Instead, they opted to bring the ship down by remote control, without its crew, and to keep Wilmore and Williams aboard the station until they could ride home with Hague and Gorbunov at the end of the Crew 9 expedition.",
      "NASA originally planned to bring all four back to Earth in February, but late last year, another month was added to the mission because of work needed to ready the Crew 10 Dragon for launch.",
      "President Trump last month blamed the Starliner crew's overall mission extension on the Biden administration, which he said had \"abandoned\" the two astronauts in space. He said he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" Wilmore and Williams. Musk also blamed Biden in a post on X.",

      "The samples of saliva left along potential migration routes were sent to a lab at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, where researchers looked for environmental DNA - or eDNA - to confirm that the bats cycle through Arizona and consider the region their part-time home.",
      "The Mexican long-nosed bat has been listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act since 1988 and is the only one in Arizona with that federal protection. It's an important species for pollinating cactus, agave and other desert plants.",
      "Officials from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Arizona Game and Fish Department announced the discovery in late January. While expanding Arizona's list of bat species to 29 is exciting, wildlife managers say the use of this novel, noninvasive method to nail it down also deserves to be celebrated.",
      "\"If we were trying to identify the species in the absence of eDNA, biologists could spend hours and hours trying to catch one of these bats, and even then, you're not guaranteed to be successful,\" said Angie McIntire, a bat specialist for the Arizona's Game and Fish Department. \"By sampling the environment, eDNA gives us an additional tool for our toolkit.\"",
      "Every spring, Mexican long-nosed bats traverse a lengthy migratory path north from Mexico into the southwestern U.S., following the sweet nectar of their favorite blooming plants like breadcrumbs. They return along the same route in the fall.",
      "The bat conservation group recruited ordinary citizens for the mission, giving them kits to swab samples from bird feeders throughout the summer and fall.",
      "Inside the university lab, microbiology major Anna Riley extracted the DNA from hundreds of samples and ran them through machines that ultimately could detect the presence of bats. Part of the work involved a steady hand, with Riley using a syringe of sorts to transfer diluted DNA into tiny vials before popping them into a centrifuge.",
      "Sample after sample, vial after vial, the meticulous work took months.",
      "\"There's a big database that has DNA sequences of not every animal but most species, and so we could compare our DNA sequences we got from these samples to what's in the database,\" Riley said. \"A little bit like a Google search - you've got your question, you're asking Google, you plug it into the database, and it turns up you've got a bat, and you have this kind of bat.\"",
      "Kristen Lear, of the conservation group, said the collection of eDNA has been used successfully for determining the presence of other kinds of wildlife in various environments, so the group proposed trying it with bats.",
      "\"They do apparently leave behind a lot of spit on these plants and hummingbird feeders,\" Lear said."

    "published": "Thu, 13 Feb 2025 16:57:34 -0500",
    "summary": "The head of planetary defense at the European Space Agency discusses 2024 YR4, an asteroid with a small chance of striking Earth eight years from now.",
    "story": [
      "An asteroid capable of flattening a mid-sized city could potentially collide with Earth eight years from now, as its orbit around the sun briefly intersects the path of our planet. Named 2024 YR4, the space rock carries with it very slim odds of striking land \u2014 either on Earth or, even less likely, the moon \u2014 and astronomers have so far set the probability of a crash at around 2%.",
      "International space organizations like NASA are taking the possible threat seriously, however small it might be. Richard Moissl, the head of the European Space Agency's planetary defense office, said their attentiveness shouldn't unduly raise public concern. He shared key facts about the asteroid with CBS News during the below conversation,\u00a0 which has been edited for clarity.",
      "When would the asteroid hit Earth?",
      "This asteroid passes us by every four years. Every time we go four times around the sun, it has almost precisely completed one turn. It has just recently had a flyby in December 2024, which means the next flyby is in December 2028, and we know already that this one is no problem.",
      "The critical one is in 2032, on the 22nd of December, somewhere around the middle of the day in Universal Time. That is when the asteroid is passing, really, through a part of the orbit of the Earth. So, it's really going through the path of Earth, so to speak.",
      "And the question is, whether Earth will be there at this point in time, or whether it will have already passed or is still approaching that point. It's the question, where will it pass by? There's an uncertainty region that spans, right now, the entire Earth-Moon system \u2014 which is not to say that we don't know a lot about it. In fact, we know a lot about it.",
      "Now, we're looking at a closing moment in time on the 22nd of December, 2032, and the question is about fractions of a meter per second, which will make all the difference.",
      "There's about a 20-something-minute window in which the Earth can be in the way of this before it's no longer in the path of the asteroid, or the asteroid cannot come in contact with the Earth anymore.",
      "How is the asteroid risk being managed?",
      "Until recently, we did daily measurements with different telescopes. Then, we had to pause a little bit for one or two days because of the full moon, and the object being too close to the full moon, and the moon illuminating the sky too much to see it.",
      "From now on, we will not monitor it daily, but it will be constantly monitored in the best way possible, with ever larger telescopes. And the idea is to measure its path around the sun in ever higher positions, so you will see this uncertainty region shrink, and shrink, and shrink. And we are trying to constrain the uncertainty so much that we can say whether it passes by Earth safely, or whether there is still some chance left in the middle of April.",
      "What happens in April?",
      "We will be so far away from the object that we cannot observe it from Earth anymore. And then, the James Webb Telescope will take measurements. It will actually take one in March, primarily infrared observations that give us more insight about the size of the object, and then one more in May to do additional measurements. The most likely scenario is that, by that time, you will be able to say, look, we can prove it's not going to hit Earth, but there is a chance that we cannot eliminate it completely. And that will be the more interesting bit, because then we have to wait until mid-2028, when we can observe it again. We will not let that time pass by without action.",
      "When was the last time an asteroid had similar odds of hitting Earth?",
      "This is only the second time that impact prediction systems have rated any asteroid with an impact probability of more than 1%. The last time was about 20 years ago, with the asteroid Apophis in 2004, which reached a couple of percent for a brief period in time before the uncertainty region could be constrained.",
      "That shows how unusual 1% is, and that means that we, as experts, have to take this seriously. However, with the current probability estimated at around 2%, it's still around 98% likely that nothing bad will happen at all. So, that needs to be kept in mind all the time. This is something that merits attention, but it's not perceived as an imminent threat. It's just, we need to find out more about it.",
      "Have asteroids this size actually crashed into Earth?",
      "We are aware of a recent example in history where this has happened. It was 1908 in Siberia. There was an event where 2,000 square kilometers of forest had been flattened by a big explosion, high up in the atmosphere. And this is very consistent with a body about 50 meters in diameter, plus or minus 10 meters, entering Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The body itself was, then, likely not a solid piece of rock. It was more like, what we call a pile of smaller pieces of rock. And this burst several kilometers above the surface and had this effect, that 2,000 square kilometers of forest was flattened, that seismic waves went out from this and could be detected far away, that people witnessed this event, also from very far away.",
      "We don't know if anyone was hurt in that accident. Nothing is reported. But the size, the footprint of the destruction is comparable to a major urban area, or a big city on Earth. So, this is basically the scenario that we would expect from this.",
      "Another example not recorded in human history was an object believed to have been about 50 meters in diameter, a massive chunk of iron that formed the Barringer meteor crater in Arizona. It's a 1.2-kilometer crater. If you look at this and think about it, if that were to hit in a city, the city would look very, very different afterward.",
      "The estimated size of this asteroid ranges from about 40 to 90 meters. Wouldn't there also be a big difference between the damage caused by something 40 meters wide versus 90 meters?",
      "Absolutely. I mean, the 40 to 90 meters is a standard estimate, because we cannot know at this point in time what the surface brightness is. Current data indicate it's more toward the 40- or 50-meter size. So, luckily, on the smaller size range, which is why I cited these popular examples for this.",
      "But, indeed, size matters for asteroids. Size matters a lot. If we're talking about the doubling of the radius of an asteroid, that means eight times the mass, eight times the energy, and that is a significant difference, of course. While on the lower end of the scale, with about 40 meters, it would be threatening to, let's say, a middle-sized city, on the 90-meter edge, it might be comparable to the biggest urban areas.",
      "Why has the probability of 2024 YR4 hitting Earth increased since it was first discovered?",
      "The good news is, this increase does not mean that the asteroid has become more dangerous. The path of the asteroid is defined by physical laws. It's already clear. It's just our knowledge of where that path would be, in reality, is not perfect yet.",
      "The percentage can be compared to the size of the uncertainty area, compared with the size of the Earth. If you look at the fraction, the size of the Earth \u2014   which is inside the uncertainty area \u2014   is compared to the entire area of the uncertainty of where the asteroid could be in that critical moment in time. This equated to about 1% when we reached this threshold for international awareness.",
      "Since then, the size of the uncertainty region has basically shrunk by half. And the size of Earth, luckily, remains the same. So, that means Earth is now occupying twice the amount of space in the uncertainty region. And it means our estimate for the impact risk has risen from 1% to 2%. It doesn't mean that anything has changed.",
      "Again, 2% is a 98% chance of missing. So what will happen is, with our gaining knowledge, uncertainty will shrink further and further and further, and the expected case is that we will manage to shrink it so much that Earth is no longer inside this uncertainty region, and then the impact probability will drop to zero.",
      "In the case of this being a close flyby to Earth, if it's reasonably close, it's entirely possible that the impact probability will continue to rise a little bit on a modest path. This is still no cause for alarm.",
      "The asteroid has been assigned a Level 3 ranking, out of 10, on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale. How uncommon is that?",
      "It's the first time ever that an object is officially classified as a Level 3 on the Torino scale. The only other object that was ever classified with a level higher than 1 was Apophis. Because of its larger size, Apophis has been classified as a 4 on the Torino scale, which is really just indicating that it's a larger object. [Apophis has an estimated diameter of 350 meters, which is much larger than the asteroid 2024 YR4.]",
      "What else should people know?",
      "Well, the most important thing is, don't panic. Always good advice, but it's definitely applicable advice in this situation. I think this gives us a chance to prove that we, as a planet, can still rise above things on Earth that are between people, between countries, between parts of Earth. That if we are facing a completely outside threat, that we can all come together, join forces and face these kinds of threats together.",
      "This one is a manageable challenge. Even if it were to be headed towards Earth, which is by no means certain, 98% it's clear that it will miss us. So, not much to be afraid of, but a good chance to show that we can stand united on this planet.",

      "The risk assessment kept climbing, and on January 29, the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN), a global planetary defense collaboration, issued a memo.",

      "\"If you put it over Paris or London or New York, you basically wipe out the whole city and some of the environs,\" said Betts.",
      "The best modern comparison is the 1908 Tunguska Event, when an asteroid or comet fragment measuring 30-50 meters exploded over Siberia, flattening 80 million trees across 770 square miles.",
      "Like that impactor, 2024 YR4 would be expected to blow up in the sky, rather than leaving a crater on the ground.",
      "\"We can calculate the energy... using the mass and the speed,\" said Andrew Rivkin, a planetary astronomer at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.",
      "For 2024 YR4, the explosion from an airburst would equal around eight megatons of TNT \u2014 more than 500 times the power of the Hiroshima bomb.",

      "Time to prepare",

      "Vance said the U.S. wants to ensure that the internet is a safe place, but suggested the European Union's Digital Services Act had gone too far, enacting \"massive regulations\" and \"policing so-called misinformation.\"",
      "\"It is one thing to prevent a predator from preying on a child on the internet, and it is something quite different to prevent a grown man or woman from accessing an opinion that the government thinks is misinformation,\" Vance said.",
      "The Digital Services Act seeks to hold platforms more accountable for protecting European users from harmful or illegal content on their sites and imposes fines on violators. Last July, the EU found that the social media platform X, owned by Department of Government Effficiency head and Trump ally Elon Musk, did not comply with the act's transparency or accountability requirements.",

      "And another discrepancy: Danny's claim that he and Brandon poured drain cleaner on Justine doesn't match the autopsy findings. Instead, those results indicate she ingested methanol, a toxic chemical compound found in a variety of products, but not drain cleaners.",

Defense attorney Evan Franzel claims that running into Amie in January 2020 at that awards show had sent Pursehouse into \"a deep debilitating depression\" and the only way out of it was to talk to Amie on Valentine's Day 2020.",

Franzel then shows the jury two images: a screenshot of the reconstruction showing an animated figure hanging from the balcony and an undated photo of Amie posing on top of a balcony railing.",

      "The defense's opening concludes with this damning admission:",
      "EVAN FRANZEL (in court): Yes, Gareth Pursehouse was waiting in her home. He broke into her home. Had he not been there she wouldn't have died that night. That is not in dispute. He set a chain of actions into motion that led to her death, but the evidence will show that he never intended on killing her.",
      "Over the course of 10 days, the prosecution presented its evidence to prove that Pursehouse did intend to kill Amie Harwick. Dozens of witnesses testified for the state, including Masterson \u2013 now retired, Coshland and, of course, Amie's roommate, Michael Herman \u2014 the man who heard it all. Herman described for the jury how after that incident on the red carpet, Amie had been concerned about those French doors that Pursehouse would later use to break into her home.",

      "Victor Avila: I think that's \u2026 one piece of evidence \u2026 to show a consciousness of guilt. \u2026 So he knows what's coming. \u2026 because the evidence shows what he did. \u2026 It proves what he did.",
      "When it was the defense's turn to present its case and call its expert witness to show how Amie's fall from the balcony was an accident, the defense suddenly rested without calling a single witness.",

      "Dr. Ryan Brook, a professor in the University of Saskatchewan's College of Agriculture and Resources, has been tracking them for years. He says they're in the search area for sure.",
      "\"No question,\" Brook told CBS News. \"And like, lots of them, not just two, three, there's a lot of pigs out there. It's kind of mildly alarming just how many pigs there are around us right now.\"",
      "These super pigs have American border states on guard. Experts say they pose a multibillion-dollar threat to the U.S. economy if they ever cross from Canada into the U.S.",
      "Brook, one of Canada's leading authorities on super pigs, calls them an \"ecological trainwreck.\" They're crossbreeds \u2014 wild boars deliberately bred with domestic pigs. They're big, smart and prolific breeders. And their population is now spreading out of control.",
      "\"I think there's two challenges in Canada,\" Brook explains on why they have become so difficult to eradicate. \"One is their biology makes them very, very hard to get rid of. They reproduce faster than you can shoot them.\"",
      "They will eat anything to survive, according to Brook. They tear up land and reproduce quickly, with devastating consequences to ranchers and farmers.",
      "For Saskatchewan farmers fed up with the damage, Alain Guillet is the man they call. He catches and kills nearly five super pigs a week.",
      "\"They've eaten that's of value off of it, so he's lost all this,\" Guillet said as he showed CBS News farmland which was ravaged by the super pigs.",
      "\"As these populations get bigger and bigger, we're going to see more crop damage,\" Brook explains. \"We're gonna see potential disease spread. These pigs can spread disease to humans, to pets, to wildlife, and to livestock.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 Americans have reason to worry. Wild pigs already cause around $2.5 billion in damage to U.S. crops every year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. And they can be aggressive toward humans.

So much for hay, so much for diesel, we can't afford pigs.\"",

    "summary": "The requests by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission mark a major departure from its prior interpretation of civil rights law.",
    "story": [
      "Signaling a major shift in civil rights enforcement, the federal agency that enforces workplace anti-discrimination laws has moved to dismiss six of its own cases on behalf of workers alleging gender identity discrimination, arguing that the cases now conflict with President Donald Trump's recent executive order, court documents say.",
      "The requests by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission mark a major departure from its prior interpretation of civil rights law, and a stark contrast to a decade ago when the agency\u00a0issued a landmark finding\u00a0that a transgender civilian employee of the U.S. Army had been discriminated against because her employer refused to use her preferred pronouns or allow her to use bathrooms based on her gender identity.",
      "Just last year, the EEOC\u00a0updated its guidance\u00a0to specify that deliberately using the wrong pronouns for an employee, or refusing them access to bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, constituted a form of harassment. That followed a 2020 Supreme Court ruling that gay, lesbian and transgender people are protected from employment discrimination.",
      "Nearly all workplace discrimination charges\u00a0must pass through the EEOC \u2014 at least initially \u2014 and the agency's decision to drop at least six of the cases raises serious questions about whether its protections will continue to extend to\u00a0transgender and gender nonconforming\u00a0people going forward.",
      "The EEOC is seeking to dismiss three cases in Illinois as well as one in Alabama, New York and California. In each instance, the original complaints allege discrimination against transgender or gender nonconforming workers. The agency cites Trump's Jan. 20 executive order declaring that the government would recognize only two \"immutable\" sexes \u2014 male and female \u2014 as the reason for why it no longer intends to pursue the cases.",
      "The Alabama case charged that Harmony Hospitality LLC discriminated against an employee who identifies as a gay nonbinary male by firing him hours after co-owners learned of his gender identity. The New York lawsuit alleged that Boxwood Hotels LLC fired a transgender housekeeper who complained that a supervisor repeatedly misgendered them and made anti-transgender statements, referring to the housekeeper as a \"transformer\" and \"it.\"",
      "Another suit alleged that Wendy's franchisee Starboard Group, Inc. subjected three transgender employees to pervasive sexual harassment at a Wendy's restaurant in Carbondale, Illinois, claiming a supervisor demanded to know if one employee had a penis. In another Illinois case, a transgender Reggio's Pizza cashier at Chicago O'Hare International Airport was \"outed\" by her manager, called a racist, homophobic slur by coworkers, and fired when she complained. In southern Illinois, at a hog farm called Sis-Bro, Inc., a coworker allegedly exposed his genitals to a transgender employee and touched her breasts.",
      "And in Santa Clara, California, the EEOC charged that a Lush Handmade Cosmetics store manager sexually harassed three gender nonconforming employees with \"offensive physical and verbal sexual conduct.\"",
      "Former EEOC General Counsel and Professor and Co-Dean Emeritus at Rutgers Law School David Lopez, who served in the agency for more than 20 years, on Friday said in his experience, the EEOC has never dismissed cases based on substance rather than merit \u2014 until now.",
      "For the country's anti-discrimination agency \"to discriminate against a group, and say, 'We're not going to enforce the law on their behalf' itself is discrimination, in my view,\" Lopez said. \"It's like a complete abdication of responsibility.\"",
      "The EEOC's requests to dismiss the cases come just weeks after Trump\u00a0dismissed two Democratic commissioners of the five-member EEOC before their terms expired, an unprecedented decision that removed what would have been a major obstacle to his administration efforts to upend interpretation of the nation's civil rights laws. Had the commissioners been allowed to carry out their terms, the EEOC would have had a Democratic majority well into Trump's term. The administration also fired Karla Gilbride as the EEOC's general counsel, replacing her with Andrew Rogers as acting counsel.",
      "Shortly after their dismissals, acting EEOC chair Andrea Lucas, a Republican, signaled her intent to put the agency's resources behind enforcing Trump's executive order on gender. She announced in a statement that one of her priorities would be \"defending the biological and binary reality of sex and related rights.\" Later, she ordered that the EEOC would continue accepting any and all discrimination charges filed by workers, although complaints that \"implicate\" Trump's order should be elevated to headquarters for \"review.\"",
      "\"Biology is not bigotry. Biological sex is real, and it matters,\" Lucas said in her statement. \"Sex is binary (male and female) and immutable. It is not harassment to acknowledge these truths \u2014 or to use language like pronouns that flow from these realities, even repeatedly.\" She removed the agency's \"pronoun app,\" which allowed employees to display their pronouns in their Microsoft 365 profiles, among other changes.",
      "The EEOC in fiscal year 2023 received more than\u00a03,000 charges\u00a0alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, \"the most since the agency started tracking these charges in FY 2013, and up more than 36% from the previous year,\" according to the agency's website, which also provides a link for more information on discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. But the information appears to have been removed and the link now leads to a blank page with the message: \"The requested page could not be found.\"",
      "Jocelyn Samuels, one of the Democratic EEOC commissioners who was fired last month, said via email that Trump's executive order and the EEOC's response to it \"is truly regrettable.\"",
      "\"The Administration's efforts to erase trans people are deeply harmful to a vulnerable community and inconsistent with governing law,\" she said.",
      "Sarah Warbelow, vice president of legal at LGBTQ+ rights group Human Rights Campaign, added in an emailed statement: \"This is the inevitable outcome when the EEOC is weaponized to greenlight discrimination against American workers.",
      "\"Instead of standing up for the rights of everyone to a workplace free from discrimination, including harassment and bias, the Trump administration is making it abundantly clear they will not protect working people.\"",

      "Wyoming's health department declined Saturday to release details of the patient's status, who is hospitalized in neighboring Colorado.",
      "\"We don't typically provide information on patient condition due to privacy concerns,\" spokesperson Kim Deti said in an email to CBS News.",
      "Deti said that the hospitalization in Colorado occurred within the last two weeks, \"just a couple of days\" after they had been exposed to sick poultry at their home in Wyoming's Platte County.",
      "The vast majority of human cases have been blamed on direct, often intensive exposure to sick cows or birds.",
      "Data reported so far by the CDC from testing labs suggests that this winter's record surge of influenza is being driven by seasonal strains of the virus, not human-to-human spread of a bird flu strain.",
      "However, investigations of a handful of human bird flu cases in the U.S. have so far not been able to identify a source of how they may have gotten sick.",
      "The first U.S. bird flu hospitalization was reported last year in Missouri, though health officials think the patient tested positive while hospitalized for other reasons, not bird flu. A second hospitalization was later reported in Louisiana, in a patient who died from the virus.",
      "Which bird flu strain sickened the new cases?",
      "It is unclear which strain of the H5N1 bird flu virus caused the Ohio and Wyoming cases. Answering that question has been a focus of experts and health officials for previous cases, as they track the evolution of the virus.",
      "Federal authorities usually take samples of the virus and analyze them for worrying mutations that might raise the risk of the virus spreading between humans or causing more severe disease.",
      "A spokesperson for Ohio's health department said that information was not immediately available. Wyoming has also not confirmed the genotype of their case, though the state's veterinarian says flocks in the county where the patient lived recently tested positive for the B3.13 strain of the virus.",
      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether that had occurred for these cases.",
      "Many human cases of bird flu in the U.S. to date have been in dairy workers after working with sick cows infected by the B3.13 strain of the H5N1 virus.",
      "Scientists suspect that B3.13 is less severe for humans. Until recently, it had been the only bird flu strain detected spreading between dairy herds and into some nearby poultry farms.",
      "But a new strain called D1.1 has grown to dominate the spread between wild migratory birds in recent months. That strain has also contributed to a surge of spillovers from wild birds to poultry flocks that have driven up egg prices nationwide.",
      "D1.1 was also behind the first confirmed U.S. fatality from bird flu, in the Louisiana patient. A child in Canada was also hospitalized with D1.1 last year.",
      "D1.1 has also spread at least twice now in recent weeks from birds to dairy herds, the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed Friday, dashing hopes that the spillover which started the B3.13 dairy herd outbreaks in late 2023 was a one-off.",

      "William \"Jay\" Bosanko served as chief operating officer for the National Archives when the FBI served a search warrant on Mar-a-Lago in August 2022 in order to seize boxes of Trump records, including classified material, that the agency said had not been properly transferred to the Archives at the conclusion of Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "Mr. Trump was\u00a0federally indicted\u00a0in the case in June 2023, but following a long legal saga, the charges were\u00a0formally dismissed\u00a0earlier this week. Mr. Trump has been publicly critical of the National Archives since the case was brought.",
      "Bosanko also held the same position when\u00a0it was revealed\u00a0in January 2023 that classified documents were found at the Delaware home of then-President Joe Biden, along with at the Penn Biden Center.\u00a0No criminal charges\u00a0were brought in that case.",
      "Bosanko has worked for the National Archives since 1993, and has served as deputy archivist since December 2023. In that role, he runs the day-to-day operations of the agency.",
      "\"When an individual controls the records, they control the story,\" Bosanko said in an interview with \"60 Minutes\" last September. \"They control what the American people can know or not know about their presidency.\"",
      "He also reflected on what he believes is lost when presidential records are not transferred at the end of an administration.",
      "\"That strikes at the very heart of the historical record, the completeness of it, the ability to understand decisions,\" Bosanko said. \"And so it's important for historians, and ultimately the American people to understand all of the pieces that came in and made up that decision making.\"",

A third, a shadowy figure known online as \"Ziz,\" remains missing after authorities linked their cultlike group to six deaths in three states.",
      "Officials have offered few details of the\u00a0cross-country investigation, which broke open after the Jan. 20 shooting\u00a0death of a Border Patrol trooper\u00a0in Vermont during a traffic stop. Associated Press interviews and a review of court records and online postings tell the story of how a group of young, highly intelligent computer scientists, most of them in their 20s and 30s, met online, shared anarchist beliefs, and became increasingly violent.",
      "Their goals aren't clear, but online writings span topics from radical veganism and gender identity to artificial intelligence.",
      "At the middle of it all is \"Ziz,\" who appears to be the leader of the strange group, who called themselves \"Zizians.\" She has been seen near multiple crime scenes and has connections to various suspects.",
      "She was even declared dead for a time, before reappearing amid more violence.",
      "Who is Ziz?",
      "Jack LaSota moved to the San Francisco Bay area after earning a computer science degree from the University of Alaska Fairbanks in 2013 and interning at NASA, according to a profile on a hiring site for programmers, coders and other freelance workers. NASA officials did not respond to a request to confirm LaSota's internship, but a Jack LaSota is listed on a website about past interns.",
      "In 2016, she began publishing a dark and rambling blog under the name Ziz, describing her theory that the two hemispheres of the brain could hold separate values and genders and \"often desire to kill each other.\"",
      "LaSota used she/her pronouns, and, in her writings, says she is a transgender woman. She railed against perceived enemies, including so-called rationalist groups, which operate mostly online and seek to understand human cognition through reason and knowledge. Some are concerned with the potential dangers of artificial intelligence.",
      "LaSota began promoting an extreme mix of rationalism, ethical veganism, anarchism and other value systems, said Jessica Taylor, an AI researcher who met LaSota both in person and online through the rationalist community and knew her as Ziz.",
      "When LaSota left the rationalists behind, she took with her a group of \"extremely vulnerable and isolated\" followers, Anna Salamon, executive director of the Center for Applied Rationality, told the San Francisco Chronicle.",
      "Taylor said Ziz adherents use the rationalist ideology as a reason to commit violence. \"Stuff like, thinking it's reasonable to avoid paying rent and defend oneself from being evicted,\" she said.",
      "Poulomi Saha, a professor who has studied cults, said LaSota's beliefs and writings may have made readers feel seen, an often central factor in the formation of groups commonly labeled cults. That's especially true in the era of online communities, in which it's easier for marginalized people to seek fellow believers.",
      "\"For the person who feels hailed by that blog post, there is likely to be a kind of dual experience,\" said Saha, co-director of the program in critical theory at the University of California, Berkeley. \"One where they feel like 'I have been saying this, or thinking this, all along, and no one has believed me.'\"",
      "LaSota, 34, has not responded to multiple Associated Press emails in recent weeks, and her\u00a0attorney Daniel McGarrigle\u00a0declined to comment when asked whether she is connected to any of the deaths. She has missed court appearances in two states, and bench warrants have been issued for her arrest. Associated Press reporters have left numerous phone and e-mail messages with LaSota's family and received no response.",
      "Ziz and followers' first run-in with the law",
      "In November 2019, LaSota was arrested along with several other people at a protest outside a Northern California retreat center where the Center for Applied Rationality was holding an event. Sheriff's deputies called in a SWAT team and armored vehicle after the mask-wearing group blocked the property's exits and handed out fliers railing against the rationalist organization. The group said they were protesting sexual misconduct inside the rationalist group.",
      "The case against LaSota,\u00a0Emma Borhanian, 31, Gwen Danielson and Alexander Leatham, 29,\u00a0was pending in August 2022 when the U.S. Coast Guard responded to a report that LaSota had fallen out of a boat in San Francisco Bay. Her body wasn't found, but her mother confirmed the death and an\u00a0obituary\u00a0was published.",
      "It wasn't long before Ziz surfaced again.",
      "A landlord is attacked in California",
      "By the autumn of 2022, LaSota had moved with other group members, including Borhanian and Leatham, into vans and box trucks on property owned by Curtis Lind in Vallejo, about 30 miles north of San Francisco.",
      "\"Emma's van was amazing,\" said someone who knew Borhanian. \"It had a refrigerator and freezer and microwave. It was truly a work of art.\"",
      "The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of fears for her safety, described Borhanian as a kind and loving young woman so smart that she worked at Google while in college. Google did not respond to an inquiry about Borhanian's employment there.",
      "Prosecutors say she was among those who attacked Lind on Nov. 13 when he tried to evict the group for not paying rent.",
      "Impaled by a sword and partially blinded, Lind fought back, fatally shooting Borhanian. Concluding that Lind acted in self-defense, officials charged Leatham and Suri Dao, 23, with murder in Borhanian's death, as well as the attempted murder of Lind.",
      "A person reached by an Associated Press reporter at a phone number listed for Alex Leatham's father declined to comment. Attempts to reach family members for Dao were not successful.",

Oh, God, God!\" according to a Pennsylvania state police affidavit. Police found the couple shot in the head in an upstairs bedroom after they failed to show up to take care of Rita's mother.",
      "Police questioned the couple's daughter, Michelle, at her home in Vermont, and a few weeks later, took her into custody at a Pennsylvania hotel. She wasn't arrested or charged with anything. LaSota was at the hotel, too, and was arrested after refusing to cooperate with officers, and charged with obstructing law enforcement and disorderly conduct.",
      "Six months later, LaSota was released on bail but stopped showing up for court.",

      "Maximilian Snyder, 22, who is charged with murder, appeared in court on Feb. 6, only long enough to request a new attorney. It's not clear how he was identified as a suspect; he has ties to a woman who just days later would be involved in a shootout.",

      "A Border Patrol agent dies in a shootout Vermont",
      "On. Jan 20, in Vermont, U.S. Border Patrol agents stopped a vehicle carrying two people connected to the Ziz group. A hotel worker had called authorities after seeing one of them, Teresa Youngblut, with a gun.",
      "Youngblut was driving the car when it was pulled over on Jan. 20, and authorities say she quickly opened fire on officers. The passenger, Felix Bauckholt, a German national who is also listed in court documents as Ophelia, died, along with the border patrol agent, David Maland.",
      "Youngblut was wounded and arrested and has pleaded not guilty to firearms charges.",
      "Authorities who searched the car found a ballistic helmet, night-vision goggles, respirators and ammunition, the FBI said. They also found two-way radios and used shooting range targets.",
      "Youngblut applied for a marriage license with Snyder, the man accused of murdering the elderly landlord. He was a childhood friend; it was unclear if they were married. Authorities say the\u00a0gun she was carrying\u00a0was purchased by a person of interest in the Zajko killings.",
      "The last sighting of Ziz",
      "Youngblut and Bauckholt had been living at the two condos in North Carolina, where the landlord and neighbors now say they saw the odd behavior.",
      "LaSota also had been living there as recently as this winter, said the landlord, who reviewed LaSota's 2019 police booking photo. He spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because he was concerned for his safety.",
      "Expressing similar concerns, a neighbor who lived on the other side of Bauckholt's duplex until September 2023 recalled seeing three people wearing long black robes and tactical clothes.",
      "\"They rarely came out during the day but would walk around the neighborhood and in the woods at night,\" the former neighbor said, who also spoke only on condition of anonymity because of concerns for their safety. \"Sometimes all three of them would go for a walk and they all held hands.

      "WADA, which was seeking to ban the three-time Grand Slam champion from the sport for at least one year, had challenged a decision last year by the International Tennis Integrity Agency\u00a0not to suspend Sinner\u00a0for what the ITIA judged was accidental contamination by a banned anabolic steroid last March.",
      "Sinner's explanation \u2014 that trace amounts of Clostebol in his doping sample was due to a massage from a trainer who used the substance after cutting his own finger \u2014 had been accepted.",

On that basis I have accepted WADA's offer to resolve these proceedings on the basis of a three-month sanction.\"",

      "Binaghi adds that the settlement \"demonstrates Jannik's innocence\" and that \"all of Italy\" will welcome him back at the Italian Open.",
      "The ITIA said it acknowledged the settlement but in its statement Saturday reiterated that \"we were satisfied that the player had established the source of the prohibited substance and that the breach was unintentional. Today's outcome supports this finding.\"",
      "Sinner's London-based lawyer, Jamie Singer commented: \"I am delighted that Jannik can finally put this harrowing experience behind him. WADA has confirmed the facts determined by the Independent Tribunal. It is clear that Jannik had no intent, no knowledge, and gained no competitive advantage. Regrettably, errors made by members of his team led to this situation.\"",
      "The handling of Sinner's case had raised questions about double standards. The positive tests weren't publicly revealed until August because Sinner successfully appealed against being provisionally banned from playing. He then won the U.S. Open in September.

      "\"A Different Russia\" by Marvin Kalb",
      "Kennedy proved to be Khrushchev's last chance for a meaningful boost in Soviet-American relations.\u00a0 They met for one summit in Vienna in June 1961. After two days in the Austrian capital, gloom replaced their earlier hopes for a radically improved relationship.\u00a0 Suspicions deepened, as both leaders stumbled into dangerous miscalculations about Berlin and Cuba.\u00a0 Soon an ugly wall would be running through the divided German capital and, not too many months later, Khrushchev would foolishly decide to try to slip nuclear-tipped missiles and troops into Cuba.",
      "Kennedy had once appealed to Khrushchev as a genuine partner for peace. He saw in the young president an adversary with whom he thought he could do business. For a brief time, one month on the 1963 calendar, shortly after signing the historic atmospheric nuclear test ban agreement with the U.S., he allowed himself to live inside a beautiful bubble of hope. Every now and then, with closest advisers or family members, he would imagine six more years of other major U.S.-Soviet agreements that would, among other things, control the spread of nuclear weapons, settle the Berlin crisis and lead to a period of genuine peace.",
      "Why six years? he was asked.",
      "Well, he'd reply, Kennedy has two more years in his current term, and then another four in his next term, which Khrushchev was certain he would win.",
      "What Khrushchev did not know\u2014could not know\u2014was that within a month Kennedy would be dead and within a year he'd be ousted from power.",
      "When Khrushchev heard Kennedy had been shot, he cried. His dreams for a new and glorious era in Soviet-American relations had just come to a tragic end.",

      "\"Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs without our involvement, and the same rule should apply to all of Europe,\" Zelenskyy said. \"A few days ago, President Trump told me about his conversation with Putin.

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 08:50:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Researchers who sniffed mummified remains in the name of science described them as \"woody,\" \"spicy,\" and \"sweet,\" with floral notes.",
    "story": [
      "At first whiff, it sounds repulsive: sniff the essence of an ancient corpse.",
      "But researchers who indulged their curiosity in the name of science found that well-preserved Egyptian mummies actually smell pretty good.",
      "\"In films and books, terrible things happen to those who smell mummified bodies,\" said Cecilia Bembibre, director of research at University College London's Institute for Sustainable Heritage. \"We were surprised at the pleasantness of them.\"",
      "\"Woody,\" \"spicy\" and \"sweet\" were the leading descriptions from what sounded more like a wine tasting than a mummy sniffing exercise. Floral notes were also detected, which could be from pine and juniper resins used in embalming.",
      "The study published Thursday in the Journal of the American Chemical Society used both chemical analysis and a panel of human sniffers to evaluate the odors from nine mummies as old as 5,000 years that had been either in storage or on display at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.",
      "The researchers wanted to systematically study the smell of mummies because it has long been a subject of fascination for the public and researchers alike, said Bembibre, one of the report's authors. Archeologists, historians, conservators and even fiction writers have devoted pages of their work to the subject \u2014 for good reason.",
      "Scent was an important consideration in the mummification process, which used oils, waxes and balms to preserve the body and its spirit for the afterlife. The practice was largely reserved for pharaohs and nobility. Pleasant smells were associated with purity and deities, while bad odors were signs of corruption and decay.",
      "Without sampling the mummies themselves, which would be invasive, researchers from UCL and the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia were able to measure whether aromas were coming from the archaeological item, pesticides or other products used to conserve the remains, or from deterioration due to mold, bacteria or microorganisms.",
      "\"We were quite worried that we might find notes or hints of decaying bodies, which wasn't the case,\" said Matija Strli\u010d, a chemistry professor at the University of Ljubljana. \"We were specifically worried that there might be indications of microbial degradation, but that was not the case, which means that the environment in this museum, is actually quite good in terms of preservation.\"",
      "Using technical instruments to measure and quantify air molecules emitted from sarcophagi to determine the state of preservation without touching the mummies was like the Holy Grail, Strli\u010d said.",
      "\"It tells us potentially what social class a mummy was from and and therefore reveals a lot of information about the mummified body that is relevant not just to conservators, but to curators and archeologists as well,\" he said. \"We believe that this approach is potentially of huge interest to other types of museum collections.\"",
      "Barbara Huber, a postdoctoral researcher at Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Germany who was not involved in the study, said the findings provide crucial data on compounds that could preserve or degrade mummified remains. The information could be used to better protect the ancient bodies for future generations.",
      "\"However, the research also underscores a key challenge: the smells detected today are not necessarily those from the time of mummification,\" Huber said. \"Over thousands of years, evaporation, oxidation, and even storage conditions have significantly altered the original scent profile.\"",
      "Huber authored a study two years ago that analyzed residue from a jar that had contained mummified organs of a noblewoman to identify embalming ingredients, their origins and what they revealed about trade routes. She then worked with a perfumer to create an interpretation of the embalming scent, known as \"Scent of Eternity,\" for an exhibition at the Moesgaard Museum in Denmark.",
      "Researchers of the current study hope to do something similar, using their findings to develop \"smellscapes\" to artificially recreate the scents they detected and enhance the experience for future museumgoers.",
      "\"Museums have been called white cubes, where you are prompted to read, to see, to approach everything from a distance with your eyes,\" Bembibre said. \"Observing the mummified bodies through a glass case reduces the experience because we don't get to smell them. We don't get to know about the mummification process in an experiential way, which is one of the ways that we understand and engage with the world.\"",

    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance hammered home the United States demand that the NATO alliance step up defense spending on Friday, ahead of a security meeting in Europe at a time of intense concern and uncertainty over the Trump administration's foreign policy.",
      "The future of Ukraine is the top item on the agenda at the Munich Security Conference following a phone call between U.S. President Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin this week, when they pledged to work together to end the 3-year-old Russia-Ukraine conflict.",
      "Vance is expected to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy later Friday for talks that many observers, particularly in Europe, hope will shed at least some light on Trump's ideas for a negotiated settlement to the war.",
      "Vance started his day in Munich meeting separately with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and British foreign secretary David Lammy. He used the engagements to reiterate the Republican Trump administration's call for NATO members to spend more on defense. Currently, 23 of NATO's 32 member nations are hitting the Western military alliance's target of spending 2% of the nation's GDP on defense.",
      "\"NATO is a very important military alliance, of course, that we're the most significant part of,\" Vance told Rutte. \"But we want to make sure that NATO is actually built for the future, and we think a big part of that is ensuring that NATO does a little bit more burden sharing in Europe, so the United States can focus on some of our challenges in East Asia.\"",
      "Rutte said he agreed that Europe needs to step up. \"We have to grow up in that sense and spend much more,\" he said.",
      "Hours before Vance and Zelenskyy were set to meet, a Russian drone with a high-explosive warhead hit the protective confinement shell of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in the Kyiv region, the Ukrainian president said. Radiation levels have not increased, Zelenskyy and the U.N. atomic agency said.",
      "Zelenskyy in Munich told reporters that he thinks the Chernobyl drone strike is a \"very clear greeting from Putin and Russian Federation to the security conference.\"",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Friday denied Ukraine's claims. And Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said the Munich organizers haven't invited Russia for several years, a decision she called \"strange and politicized.\"",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was supposed to join Vance and Zelenskyy but was delayed when his Air Force plane had to return to Washington after developing a mechanical problem en route to Munich. He took a different aircraft, but it was unclear whether he would arrive in time for the meeting.",
      "Trump, who upended years of steadfast U.S. support for Ukraine during his call with Putin on Wednesday, has been vague about his specific intentions - other than suggesting that a deal will likely result in Ukraine being forced to cede territory that Russia has seized since it annexed Crimea in 2014.",
      "\"The Ukraine war has to end,\" Trump told reporters Thursday. \"Young people are being killed at levels that nobody's seen since World War II. And it's a ridiculous war.\"",
      "Trump's musings have left Europeans in a quandary, wondering how - or even if - they can maintain the post-WWII security that NATO afforded them or fill the gap in the billions of dollars of security assistance that the Democratic Biden administration provided to Ukraine since Russia's February 2022 invasion.",
      "Trump has been highly skeptical of that aid and is expected to cut or otherwise limit it as negotiations get underway in the coming days.",
      "Both Trump and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this week undercut Ukraine's hopes of becoming part of NATO, which the alliance said less than a year ago was \"irreversible,\" or of getting back its territory captured by Russia, which currently occupies close to 20% including Crimea.",
      "\"I don't see any way that a country in Russia's position could allow ... them to join NATO,\" Trump said Thursday. \"I don't see that happening.\"",
      "But British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told Zelenskyy on Friday that Ukraine must be allowed to join NATO.",
      "Trump in recent days said he wants to reach an agreement with Ukraine to gain access to the country's rare earth materials as a condition for continuing U.S. support for Ukraine's defense against Russia. He confirmed earlier this week that aides were working toward striking such a deal.",
      "Asked Friday if a deal might be completed in Munich, Vance responded, \"We'll see.\"",
      "Vance, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, said that the U.S. would hit Moscow with sanctions and potentially military action if Putin won't agree to a peace deal with Ukraine that guarantees Kyiv's long-term independence.",
      "The warning that military options \"remain on the table\" was striking language from a Trump administration that's repeatedly underscored a desire to quickly end the war.",
      "The U.S. reassurances may have somewhat allayed Zelenskyy's fears, although they will not replace any lost military or economic support that President Joe Biden's administration had provided.",
      "The Ukrainian leader conceded Thursday that it was \"not very pleasant\" that Trump spoke first to Putin. But he said the main issue was to \"not allow everything to go according to Putin's plan.\"",
      "\"We cannot accept it, as an independent country, any agreements (made) without us,\" Zelenskyy said as he visited a nuclear power plant in western Ukraine.",
      "The track Trump is taking also has rocked Europe, much as his dismissive comments about France and Germany did during his first term.",
      "French Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Haddad described Europe as being at a turning point, with the ground shifting rapidly under its feet, and said Europe must wean itself off its reliance on the United States for its security. He warned that handing a victory to Russia in Ukraine could have repercussions in Asia, too.",

      "Obesity and metabolic disease",
      "\"I think the No. 1 problem in America is the chronic disease of obesity,\" Prato said, largely due to \"insulin receptor sensitivity issues,\" which is when the body\u2019s cells become less responsive to insulin.",

      "\"The answer to that is building good immunity in the body and having good response so that our bodies can fight these subacute infections,\" he said.",
      "Toxins and chemicals",
      "The third major health hazard, according to Prato, are the chemical toxins and heavy metals that are found in the food and water Americans consume, as well as the air they breathe.",
      "\"We keep adding pills, but we're not getting to the core of what's causing the disease.\"",
      "\"Our bodies are just not designed to detoxify or eliminate these problems,\" he said. \"We also know that chemical toxins are carcinogenic.\"",
      "Americans\u2019 food supply is a \"very important part\" of eliminating toxicity, Prato added. \"A lot of these foods we eat are laced with carcinogens.\"",
      "Barriers to good health",
      "The biggest obstacle that is keeping Americans from living healthier lives, Prato said, is lack of motivation to make changes.",
      "In many cases, he said, patients think they\u2019re healthy but just don\u2019t have the right information.",

      "\"We put people on long-term management and we keep adding pills, but we're not getting to the core of what's causing the disease,\" the doctor said. (iStock)",

      "Norwitz noted there are several research studies showing the benefits of the carnivore diet, including a Harvard study of 2,029 participants that found \"high levels of satisfaction and improvements in overall health, well-being and various medical conditions.\"",

      "\"These trials will need to be completed before conventional medicine can recommend a carnivore diet as a metabolic health prevention for any specific disorder,\" he says in his video.",
      "Myth No. 2: The diet increases the risk of scurvy",
      "Some claim that a carnivore diet could increase the risk of scurvy due to a vitamin C deficiency, Norwitz said.",
      "\"While it\u2019s true it's difficult to meet the RDA daily dose of 75 to 90 milligrams of vitamin C by eating only meat, there are about 25 micrograms per gram of vitamin C in fresh, grass-fed beef, so eating about 2 pounds of meat daily should give you about 18 milligrams of vitamin C.\"",
      "MEAT 'CHEAT MEALS' AMONG VEGETARIANS, VEGANS 'MORE COMMON THAN YOU MIGHT THINK'",

      "When Norwitz himself did a six-month carnivore diet experiment and then tested his vitamin C levels, he found they were normal, even bordering on being high. He explains the science behind that result in the video.",
      "Myth No. 3: Lack of fiber will cause constipation",
      "While it is true that a majority of the nutrition a person consumes on a carnivore diet will be absorbed in the small intestine, leading to an overall decline in fecal mass, \"you will still poop,\" Norwitz said in the video.",
      "\"Some studies suggest that fiber elimination can actually help manage the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation,\" he added.",
      "Norwitz (left) noted there are several research studies showing the benefits of the carnivore diet. (Nick Norwitz/iStock)",
      "This doesn\u2019t mean fiber is bad or that long-term zero-fiber diets wouldn't have negative consequences on the microbiome, he noted.",
      "\"Your microbiome are generally most resilient and healthy when they're diverse,\" he said. \"There are many, like me, who feel better on low- or no-fiber diets, so it's a legitimate individual choice.\"",

      "\"Your microbiome are generally most resilient and healthy when they're diverse.\"",
      "Norwitz goes into greater detail about the association between diet and athletic performance in his video, as does another doctor.",
      "Myth No. 5: The diet will lead to heart attacks",
      "While Norwitz acknowledges that a diet rich in red meat and saturated fat can increase LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol and its associated marker (ApoB), which is a risk factor for heart disease, the extent to which a carnivore diet affects those levels is \"highly individual.\"",
      "Norwitz recommends that people track their biomarkers and consider their individual cases rather than making assumptions. \"I'm not saying dismiss risk \u2014 I'm saying get informed about your personal risk.\"\u00a0 (iStock)",

      "New York City plans to file a lawsuit against the Trump administration after the federal government pulled more than $80 million in funding for illegal immigrant shelters, but it appears the city's lawyers could be acting without Mayor Eric Adams' blessing.",
      "The city's law department sent a letter Friday to city Comptroller Brad Lander saying that it planned to take legal action by the end of next week to have the $80.5 million in FEMA payments taken earlier this week returned, according to the New York Post. Lander is running against Adams in June's Democratic Party primary election for the city's mayor. Adams, meanwhile, has shown a willingness to work with the Trump administration, which has dropped a criminal case against him.",
      "\"The Law Department is currently drafting litigation papers with respect to this matter,\" corporation counsel Mureil Goode-Trufant told Lander in a letter, the outlet reported.",
      "\"We intend to initiate legal action by February 21, 2025. As the Law Department is representing the City of New York in this matter, there is no need for an authorization for the Comptroller\u2019s Office to engage external legal counsel,\" the letter reads.",

      "The letter came after Lander urged the Adams administration to either file a lawsuit or authorize him to hire his own attorneys to sue Trump and Elon Musk, who leads the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "\"Given the gravity of the situation, we cannot afford to waste any more time. If the Mayor would prefer to spend his days advancing President Trump\u2019s agenda instead of fighting for New Yorkers, then the Law Department must allow me to do so,\" Lander said in a statement Friday.",
      "\"Recovering these funds is imperative, and any action, or non-action, allowing the Trump administration to proceed without consequence would set a dangerous precedent and make our City a target for the next four years,\" he added.",
      "The revocation of FEMA funds from New York City\u2019s accounts happened Tuesday and was first discovered by Lander the following day.",

      "New York City Mayor Eric Adams departs Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse in New York City on Friday, November 1, 2024. (Adam Gray for Fox News Digital\u00a0)",
      "\"Let's be crystal clear: This is highway robbery. Elon Musk, with no legal authority, illegally seized federal funds from New Yorkers,\" Lander said Wednesday.",
      "Musk claimed that DOGE found a $59 million FEMA payment to New York City was being used on luxury hotels to house illegal migrants. Trump later repeated Musk's claim and argued that \"massive fraud\" was happening.",
      "New York City was awarded two separate grants during the Biden administration \u2014 one for $58.6 million and another for $21.9 million \u2014 as the city attempted to pay to house migrants, many of whom were sent by Texas officials who were frustrated with the Biden administration's handling of the influx of migrants entering the U.S. through the Southern Border.",
      "The payments were made under the Shelter and Services Program that Congress appropriated $650 million for last year to help local governments respond to the migrant crisis.",

      "The FEMA money, which was funded by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, paid $12.50 a night reimbursement for each hotel room. The city said most of the hotels used to house migrants are not luxurious. The remainder of the funds went toward security, food and other services for migrants.",
      "This came after the Department of Justice ordered prosecutors to drop their federal corruption case against Adams, who had been indicted on charges of fraud, bribery and soliciting campaign contributions from foreigners. Some have raised concerns that Adams may be beholden to the president because his case was dropped."

      "One of the most pervasive scams today is the so-called \"pig butchering\" scheme. Originating in China and spreading across Southeast Asia, this scam involves criminals building trust with victims through social media or messaging apps. Once trust is established, victims are lured into fraudulent cryptocurrency investment schemes. These scams are meticulously crafted to appear legitimate, often involving fake trading platforms and simulated profits. Victims are encouraged to invest more until they are \"slaughtered,\" losing their\u00a0entire savings when the scammers vanish with their funds.",

These \"scam centers\" operate in lawless regions controlled by rebel groups or corrupt officials, making international intervention challenging.

      "Why America is a prime target",
      "Cyberscams have taken hold in the U.S. for several reasons that make it particularly vulnerable. As an American, you\u2019re likely connected to the digital world through social media platforms, messaging apps and other online tools. This high level of connectivity makes it easier for scammers to reach you directly, whether through a text message, email or social media chat. The sheer number of people online in the U.S. creates a vast pool of potential targets for cybercriminals.",
      "Additionally, the growing popularity of cryptocurrency in the U.S. has made it a\u00a0prime medium for fraud. Cryptocurrency transactions are fast, anonymous and difficult to trace, which makes them ideal for scammers looking to steal funds without leaving a trail. Many scams are designed to exploit this lack of transparency, leaving victims with little chance of recovering their money once it\u2019s gone.",
      "Another major issue is the lack of a centralized reporting system for cyberscams in the U.S. If you\u2019ve ever been scammed or know someone who has, you might have noticed how confusing it can be to figure out where to report the crime \u2014 whether to the FBI, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or another agency. This fragmented system not only makes it harder for victims to seek help but also prevents authorities from gathering comprehensive data to tackle the problem effectively. These factors combined have made Americans some of the most targeted individuals in the world when it comes to cyberscams.",

This system effectively blocks unregistered SMS senders, significantly reducing impersonation scams. In fact, cases involving scam SMSes in Singapore fell by 70% over three months after mandating the SSIR.",
      "Britain has taken a different approach by establishing a dedicated \"159\" hotline, allowing residents to instantly verify suspicious calls. This simple yet effective system provides a quick way for individuals to check the legitimacy of unexpected communications, potentially preventing many scams before they occur.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Many nations have also implemented stricter authentication measures, such as biometric checks and in-app verifications, which have proven highly effective in reducing fraud. For example, Singapore has required facial verification for higher-risk transactions through Singpass since 2022, resulting in no further reports of malware-enabled scams involving unauthorized CPF withdrawals since its implementation in June 2023.",
      "Some countries are exploring ways to slow down cryptocurrency transactions or cap transfer amounts, which could significantly hinder scammers who rely on quick, anonymous transfers. These measures, combined with a coordinated global response involving major victim nations like the U.S. and China, could prove instrumental in dismantling criminal networks more effectively.

      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson walks you through the process.",
      "Every tech expert will tell you the App Store is safer than Google Play Store. Some might even claim it is impossible to download a malicious app from the App Store, but they are wrong.",
      "While I admit the App Store is a secure and tightly controlled ecosystem, it cannot completely shield you. Security researchers have found that hackers are targeting several apps on the App Store to spread malware that steals information from screenshots saved on a device.",
      "The issue also affects those downloading apps from the Google Play Store.",

      "A person holding an iPhone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson\u00a0)",
      "How the malware works and what makes it different",
      "According to\u00a0researchers at Kaspersky, this malware campaign is more advanced than typical info stealers, both in how it works and how it spreads. Instead of relying on social engineering tricks to get users to grant permissions like most banking trojans or spyware, this malware hides inside seemingly legitimate apps and slips past Apple and Google\u2019s security checks.",
      "One of its standout features is Optical Character Recognition. Instead of stealing stored files, it scans screenshots saved on the device, extracts text and sends the information to remote servers.",
      "Once installed, the malware operates stealthily, often activating only after a period of dormancy to avoid raising suspicion. It employs encrypted communication channels to send stolen data back to its operators, making it difficult to trace. Plus, it spreads through deceptive updates or hidden code within app dependencies, an approach that helps it evade initial security screenings by app store review teams.",
      "The infection vectors vary between Apple and Google\u2019s ecosystems. On iOS, the malware is often embedded within apps that initially pass Apple\u2019s rigorous review process but later introduce harmful functionality through updates. On Android, the malware can exploit sideloading options, but even official Google Play apps have been found to carry these malicious payloads, sometimes hidden within SDKs (software development kits) supplied by third-party developers.",
      "Messaging app in the App Store designed to lure victims.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "What's being stolen, and who's responsible?",
      "The scope of stolen information is alarming. This malware primarily targets crypto wallet recovery phrases but is also capable of exfiltrating login credentials, payment details, personal messages, location data and even biometric identifiers. Some versions are designed to harvest authentication tokens, allowing attackers to access accounts even if users change their passwords.",
      "The apps serving as malware carriers include ComeCome, ChatAi, WeTink, AnyGPT and more. These range from productivity tools to entertainment and utility apps. In some cases, malicious developers create these apps with full knowledge of the malware\u2019s purpose. In others, the issue appears to be a supply chain vulnerability, where legitimate developers unknowingly integrate compromised SDKs or third-party services that introduce malicious code into their applications.",
      "We reached out to Apple for a comment but did not hear back before our deadline.",
      "Messaging app in the App Store designed to lure victims. (Kaspersky)",
      "Apple's response to screenshot-scanning malware discovered in App Store",
      "Apple has removed the 11 iOS apps mentioned in Kaspersky's report from the App Store. Furthermore, they discovered that these 11 apps shared code signatures with 89 other iOS apps, all of which had been previously rejected or removed for violating Apple's policies, resulting in the termination of their developer accounts.",
      "Apps requesting access to user data such as Photos, Camera or Location must provide relevant functionality or face rejection. They must also clearly explain their data usage when prompting users for permission. iOS privacy features ensure users always control whether their location information is shared with an app. Also, starting in iOS 14, the PhotoKit API \u2014 which allows apps to request access to a user\u2019s Photos library \u2014 added additional controls to let users select only specific photos or videos to share with an app instead of providing access to their entire library.",
      "The App Store Review Guidelines mandate that developers are responsible for ensuring their entire app, including ad networks, analytics services and third-party SDKs, complies with the guidelines. Developers must carefully review and choose these components. Apps must also accurately represent their privacy practices, including those of the SDKs they use, in their privacy labels.",
      "In 2023, the App Store rejected over 1.7 million app submissions for failing to meet its stringent privacy, security and content standards. It also rejected 248,000 app submissions found to be spam, copycats or misleading and prevented 84,000 potentially fraudulent apps from reaching users.",

Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Installing strong antivirus software can add an extra layer of protection by scanning apps for malware, blocking suspicious activity and alerting you to potential threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Stick to trusted developers and well-known apps:\u00a0Even though malware has been found in official app stores, users can still minimize their risk by downloading apps from reputable developers with a long track record. Before installing an app, check its developer history, read multiple reviews and look at the permissions it requests. If an app from an unknown developer suddenly gains popularity but lacks a strong review history, approach it with caution.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Review app permissions carefully:\u00a0Many malicious apps disguise themselves as legitimate tools but request excessive permissions that go beyond their stated purpose. For example, a simple calculator app should not need access to your contacts, messages or location. If an app asks for permissions that seem unnecessary, consider it a red flag and either deny those permissions or avoid installing the app altogether. Go to your phone settings and check app permissions on your\u00a0iPhone and\u00a0Android.",
      "4. Keep your device and apps updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in outdated software to distribute malware. Always\u00a0keep your operating system and apps updated to the latest versions, as these updates often contain critical security patches. Enabling automatic updates ensures that you stay protected without having to manually check for new versions.",
      "5. Be wary of apps that promise too much:\u00a0Many malware-infected apps lure users by offering features that seem too good to be true \u2014 such as free premium services, extreme battery optimizations or AI-powered functionality that appears unrealistic. If an app\u2019s claims sound exaggerated or its download numbers skyrocket overnight with questionable reviews, it\u2019s best to avoid it. Stick to apps with a transparent development team and verifiable functionalities.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The new malware campaign highlights the need for stricter vetting processes, continuous monitoring of app behavior post-approval and greater transparency from app stores regarding security risks. While Apple and Google have removed the malicious apps upon detection, the fact that they made it onto the platform in the first place exposes a gap in the existing security framework. As cybercriminals refine their methods, app stores must evolve just as quickly or risk losing the trust of the very users they claim to protect.",

      "SpaceX's Starship exploded during an unmanned test flight. Debris from the explosion streaked through the sky, leaving people on the ground amazed and confused. (Greg Munch /TMX)",
      "The European Space Agency (ESA) said Monday that its Euclid space telescope has detected a rare bright halo of light around a nearby galaxy.",
      "Known as an Einstein ring, the halo was captured in photos encircling a galaxy nearly 590 million light-years away, which is considered close by cosmic standards. A single light-year is measured at 5.8 trillion miles.",
      "While astronomers have known about the galaxy where the phenomenon was captured for over a century, they were surprised when Euclid revealed the bright glowing ring,",

      "GIANT STELLAR NURSERY REVEALED IN NEW IMAGES FROM ESA'S SPACE TELESCOPE",
      "A sea of colorful stars and galaxies appear to swim in the vast blackness of space around a hazy halo at center stage. In the middle of the image, the fuzzy-looking bulb of light in a warm shade of yellow extends around a small bright spot, nestled within a thin light circle that appears to be drawn closely around it. (ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre, G. Anselmi, T. Li)",
      "But before the space telescope could begin its survey of the universe, scientists had to ensure everything onboard was working properly. During the early phase of testing, which took place in September 2023, Euclid sent images back to Earth.",
      "The ESA said the images were deliberately out of focus, but in one of the images, Euclid Archive Scientist Bruno Altieri saw what he believed was a very special phenomenon and decided to look at it a bit closer.",
      "\"I look at the data from Euclid as it comes in,\" Bruno said in a press release from the ESA. \"Even from that first observation, I could see it, but after Euclid made more observations of the area, we could see a perfect Einstein ring. For me, with a lifelong interest in gravitational lensing, that was amazing.\"",

They stand out against a uniformly colored background of a hazy dark gray. (ESA/Euclid/Euclid Consortium/NASA, image processing by J.-C. Cuillandre, G. Anselmi, T. Li)",
      "When a distant galaxy is observed through a telescope, the light from that galaxy may encounter another galaxy on its way to the telescope. When that happens, the foreground galaxy acts like a magnifying glass, and gravity causes the traveling light rays to bend. When light rays bend, scientists call that gravitational lensing, according to the ESA.",
      "When the background galaxy, lensing galaxy and telescope are in perfect alignment, the image appears as a ring, also known as an Einstein Ring.",
      "The galaxy, called NGC 6506, is about 590 million light-years away, and this is the first time the ring of light around its center has ever been detected.",
      "\"All strong lenses are special, because they're so rare, and they're incredibly useful scientifically,\" Conor O\u2019Riordan of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics said. \"This one is particularly special, because it\u2019s so close to Earth and the alignment makes it very beautiful.\"",
      "POWERFUL WEBB TELESCOPE CAPTURES PHOTOS OF ONE OF THE EARLIEST SUPERNOVA EVER SEEN",
      "The text paragraph explains the principle behind the Einstein rings. (ESA)",
      "Einstein rings are based on physicist Albert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity, which predicts that light will bend around objects in space, so they focus the light like giant lenses, ESA said. The phenomenon allows scientists to sometimes see the light from distant galaxies that would otherwise be hidden.",
      "\"I find it very intriguing that this ring was observed within a well-known galaxy, which was first discovered in 1884,\" Valeria Pettorino, ESA Euclid project scientist, said. \"The galaxy has been known to astronomers for a very long time. And yet this ring was never observed before. This demonstrates how powerful Euclid is, finding new things even in places we thought we knew well. This discovery is very encouraging for the future of the Euclid mission and demonstrates its fantastic capabilities.\"",

After that, you are \"hired\" and asked to submit your details, often through a Google Doc requesting personal info like your social security or tax number.

      "2) Check for red flags in job offers: If you receive a job offer that seems too good to be true or involves an interview conducted entirely via chat with no phone call or video meeting, it's likely a scam. Legitimate companies typically conduct interviews using multiple forms of communication.",
      "A job offer that insists on only text-based conversations is a major red flag. Other warning signs include being asked to provide personal information through Google Docs, being asked to pay for equipment, paying fees to secure the job or purchasing gift cards as part of the hiring process.",
      "3) Use strong, unique passwords: Ensure your Microsoft 365 and other accounts are protected with strong passwords. Consider using\u00a0two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of protection against unauthorized access. Also, you might want to use a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4) Be cautious with personal information: Never share sensitive personal details, like social security numbers or tax information, through unsecured or unsolicited channels, such as Google Docs or messages on Teams. Always verify the legitimacy of such requests.",
      "5) Report suspicious activity: If you notice any suspicious activity on your Microsoft Teams account or receive unusual job offers, report it immediately. Prompt action can prevent a potential breach or further compromise. Notify your IT department or relevant authorities so they can investigate and take appropriate measures.",
      "6) Verify IT support requests: Be cautious of unsolicited messages or calls claiming to be from IT support, especially those asking you to install software or grant remote access. Cybercriminals often impersonate IT staff to deploy ransomware or steal sensitive data. Always verify such requests with your actual IT department before taking any action. If in doubt, contact your IT team directly using official channels, not through the message or call you received.",

If something feels off, like a job that sounds too good to be true, a random Teams message with a sketchy link or an interview that is just a chat, trust your instincts. You should always be careful with external messages and invites that you to receive on Microsoft Teams. Even if it seems like it is from someone you know, it is best to double-check, especially if it involves a file, a link or an invitation to a chat you were not expecting to receive.",

      "Construction of former President Barack Obama's long-awaited library and museum in Chicago began with ambitious plans for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) but is now plagued by huge cost overruns, delays and a $40.75-million, racially charged lawsuit filed by a minority contractor.",
      "From the outset, the endeavor touted DEI as a key part of enshrining Obama's legacy at the 19.3-acre site, where costs have ballooned from an initial $350 million to $830 million in 2021 based on its previous annual reports, with no publicly available figures available for updated projected costs. The project set out \"ambitious goals\" for certain construction diversity quotas, with its contracts to be allocated to\u00a0\"diverse suppliers,\" 35% of which were required to be minority-based enterprises (MBEs).",
      "\"With these aggressive goals, the foundation is hoping to set a new precedent for diversity and inclusion in major construction projects in Chicago and beyond,\" the Obama Foundation wrote in a 2017 press release.",
      "Former President Obama and his presidential center. (Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg, left, and Eileen T. Meslar/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images, right.)",
      "The importance of DEI was cited on several occasions in an explosive lawsuit filed last month by Robert McGee, the Black co-owner of II in One Construction. The firm is a minority-owned business subcontractor that provided concrete and rebar services for the center.",
      "McGee alleged that he and his firm were racially discriminated against by Thornton Tomasetti, a New York-based company that oversees structural engineering and design services.",
      "In the lawsuit, McGee claims that Thornton Tomasetti changed standards and imposed new rules around rebar spacing and tolerance requirements that differed from the American Concrete Institute standards. The suit claims these changes resulted in his firm running up massive overruns in excess of $40 million, which put it on the verge of bankruptcy.",
      "McGee's lawsuit stems from a memorandum Thornton Tomasetti wrote to the project\u2019s leading construction partners about a year ago claiming that II in One \u2014 and the contracting firm it teamed up with on the project \u2014 were responsible for numerous challenges during the project.",
      "The memorandum contained images of cracked slabs and exposed rebar to support its claims. Thornton Tomasetti said it spent hundreds of hours reviewing, analyzing, re-designing, and responding to corrective work and that subcontractors caused \"a multitude of problems in the field.\"",
      "\"The construction issues were all unequivocally driven by the underperformance and inexperience of the concrete subcontractor,\" the memorandum states.",
      "Thornton Tomasetti said the challenges with the concrete were due solely to the subcontractors and wrote that it \"cannot stand by while contractors attempt to blame their own shortcomings on the design team.\"",
      "The memo goes on to state that Thornton Tomasetti and an architectural firm, \"bent over backwards to assist what everyone knows was a questionably qualified subcontractor team in areas where a more qualified subcontractor would not have required it.\"",
      "The Obama Presidential Center pictured this week. (Fox News)",
      "That memorandum served as the basis of McGee\u2019s lawsuit last month, as he alleges it contained \"baseless criticisms and defamatory and discriminatory accusations.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that Thornton Tomasetti undermined the project\u2019s diversity and inclusion goals, which were outlined in the project's general contract. The lawsuit also cites a DEI report by the project's construction manager in 2022, which outlines the project as \"achieving significant diverse business participation.\" A report breaking down the demographics of those involved in the project was also released in April.",
      "The suit claims the plaintiffs were \"subjected to unjustified and discriminatory conduct\u2026 which directly undermined the Obama Foundation\u2019s DEI goals and commitments, and mission to bring transformative change to the construction industry and local community by providing solutions to barriers that have historically prevented disadvantaged businesses from participating on projects of this magnitude.\"",
      "The lawsuit claims that Thornton Tomasetti violated the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and that its alleged \"defamatory and discriminatory statements and actions,\" caused II in One, Bob McGee and the other subcontractors to suffer extreme financial losses and potential bankruptcy.",
      "The suit alleges that Thornton Tomasetti discriminated against II In One \"on the basis of race.\"",
      "McGee claims Thornton Tomasetti falsely accused II in One of lacking sufficient qualifications and experience to perform its work, while stating in the memo that non-minority-owned contractors were sufficiently qualified.",
      "The lawsuit also claims the Obama Foundation relied on Thornton Tomasetti\u2019s memo for not paying the subcontracting firms around $40.75 million for \"additional costs incurred\" at the site near Jackson Park in\u00a0Chicago.",
      "McGee's lawsuit refutes the allegations in Thornton Tomasetti's memo that his firm was inexperienced or questionably qualified, pointing to II in One\u2019s 40-year track record in the industry and its completion of major Chicagoland projects, including Millennium Park, Harold Washington Cultural Center, and the American Airlines terminal at O\u2019Hare Airport.",
      "In a memo, Thornton Tomasetti shared images of cracked slab and exposed rebar. (Lawsuit)",
      "\"Moreover, Bob McGee was aware and supportive of the Obama Foundation\u2019s diversity and inclusion goals for the project and never imagined that the Obama Foundation\u2019s structural engineer would single out a minority-owned subcontractor for unfair criticism and falsely accuse II in One of lacking sufficient qualifications and experience to perform its work, while, in the same letter, stating that the non-minority-owned contractors were sufficiently qualified,\" the memo reads.",
      "\"In a shocking and disheartening turn of events, the African American owner of a local construction company finds himself and his company on the brink of forced closure because of racial discrimination by the structural engineer,\" the lawsuit reads. \"II in One and its joint venture partners \u2026 was subjected to baseless criticisms and defamatory and discriminatory accusations by the Obama Foundation\u2019s structural engineer, Thornton Tomasetti.\"",
      "The Obama Foundation said it is not a party to this lawsuit, and insisted that it will not cause any delays in the concrete work, which it says has already been largely completed.",
      "\"If the Foundation believed that any vendor was acting with a racist intent, we would immediately take appropriate action,\" Emily Bittner, the vice president of communications at the Obama Foundation, told Fox News Digital in a statement recently. The foundation has not responded to requests for information on the updated cost of the project.",

      "A South Carolina death row inmate who is the next person scheduled to be put to death by the state is again requesting that his execution be postponed because his lawyers have not received the autopsy report from the last execution two weeks ago.",
      "Brad Sigmon, 67, whose execution is scheduled for March 7, had made a similar request that the state Supreme Court rejected earlier this month, but his attorneys said in a motion Friday that the situation is now more urgent because of the Feb. 21 deadline to decide his execution method, as he can choose to be killed by lethal injection, firing squad or electric chair.",
      "Sigmon was convicted in the 2001 baseball bat killings of his ex-girlfriend's parents at their home in Greenville County. The two were in separate rooms, investigators said, and Sigmon went back and forth between the rooms as he beat them both to death.",
      "After killing the couple, Sigmon kidnapped his ex-girlfriend at gunpoint, but she managed to escape from his car. He shot at her as she ran away but missed.",

      "\"I couldn\u2019t have her, I wasn\u2019t going to let anybody else have her,\" he said in a confession.",
      "If he does not choose an execution method, Sigmon would be killed by the electric chair, which his attorneys say he does not want to die from. Sigmon plans to choose next week between lethal injection and the firing squad.",
      "He remains hesitant to choose lethal injection because witnesses to the three previous executions in the past several months since the state began using a massive dose of the sedative pentobarbital have said that despite the inmates appearing to stop breathing and moving in only a few minutes, they were not declared dead for at least 20 minutes.",
      "The autopsy report has been released for only one of the executions. Prison officials said Richard Moore was given two large doses of pentobarbital 11 minutes apart on Nov. 1.",
      "A defense expert who reviewed the results reported that fluid found in Moore\u2019s lungs likely made him feel like he was consciously drowning and suffocating during the 23 minutes it took for him to be pronounced dead.",

      "Another anesthesiologist who reviewed the autopsy for the state said fluid is often found in the lungs after a lethal injection, also arguing that witness accounts and other evidence gave no indication that Moore was conscious beyond 30 seconds after the sedative was first injected.",
      "Prison officials have not disclosed the reason why Moore needed a second massive dose or whether that is part of their normal procedures, pointing to a 2023 shield law that keeps the providers of lethal injection drugs, the identities of members of execution teams and the procedures used a secret.",
      "In a sworn statement issued after an execution date is scheduled, Corrections Director Bryan Stirling certifies that each method is available. He said \"lethal injection is available via a single dose of pentobarbital.\"",
      "Sigmon\u2019s lawyers have yet to see the autopsy report on Marion Bowman, who was executed by lethal injection Jan. 31. There was no autopsy after the execution of Freddie Owens on Sept. 20 at his request, citing religious reasons due to his Muslim faith.",
      "Additional information is being sought by Sigmon's lawyers about the lethal injection drug. Requests had been rejected before the previous three executions.",
      "The room where inmates are executed in Columbus, South Carolina. (South Carolina Department of Corrections via AP)",
      "His lawyers also want his execution date postponed until they can review the autopsy results.",
      "Once one of the busiest for executions, South Carolina resumed executions in September after a 13-year pause caused in part by the state having difficulty obtaining lethal injection drugs after its supply expired due to pharmaceutical companies' concerns that they would have to disclose they had sold the drugs to state officials. The state legislature then passed the shield law allowing officials to keep lethal injection drug suppliers private.",

      "The state Supreme Court agreed to set executions at least five weeks apart, but Sigmon's lawyers, who also represent others on death row, want to extend that time between to 13 weeks so they can fully review previous autopsies and other reports.",
      "South Carolina has executed 46 inmates since the death penalty was resumed in the U.S. in 1976. In the early 2000s, the state was carrying out an average of three executions per year. Only nine states have killed more inmates.",

      "U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee ruled Thursday that Nance had failed to prove that the injection would result in excruciating pain due to his medical history. Because of this, Boulee did not weigh in on whether a firing squad is a possible alternative.",

Nance had just robbed a bank in Gwinnett County and abandoned his own car after dye packs hidden in the stolen money exploded. Balogh was backing out of a parking space at a liquor store across the street when Nance pulled open the car door and fatally shot him.",
      "Nance's lawyers argued that his veins are tough to locate by sight and that the ones that can be seen are compromised. They said there is a substantial risk that his veins could \"blow\" during an execution, causing the drug to leak into surrounding tissue and cause intense pain.",
      "His lawyers also argued that his longtime use of a medication to treat back pain could result in the pentobarbital used in lethal injections being ineffective or less effective.",

      "Addressing whether Nance's longtime use of a pain medication could interfere with the lethal injection drug, Boulee pointed to the testimony of a doctor called by Nance's lawyers who said \"no one actually knows\" what the impact would be.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court has said that for an inmate to challenge an execution method under the Eighth Amendment, they must prove that it creates \"a substantial risk of serious harm\" and that there are \"known and available alternatives\" that are \"feasible, readily implemented\" and that will significantly reduce the risk of severe pain, which is why Nance's lawyers suggested the firing squad.",
      "Boulee ruled in March 2020 that Nance's arguments were procedurally barred because he had waited too long to bring them and that he had failed to prove how his constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment would be violated.",
      "Nance appealed and a panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that since lethal injection is the only method of execution authorized by Georgia law, he was effectively challenging the validity of his death sentence, which the panel said he was procedurally barred from doing.",

      "UNITED NATIONS \u2013 President Donald Trump has made major foreign policy moves in his first few weeks in office, including cutting off U.S. funding to the controversial United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). UNRWA has long faced accusations of ties to terrorists, which have intensified over the course of the Israel-Hamas war that began with the massacre on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Former President Joe Biden initially cut off U.S. funding to UNRWA in January 2024, months into the war, after Israel accused members of the U.N. agency of taking part in Hamas\u2019 brutal attacks.",
      "U.N. Watch Executive Director Hillel Neuer said Americans need to know that some U.N. agencies, such as UNRWA, are founded on \"altruistic good intentions,\" but have \"morphed into something which is the complete opposite of what it was supposed to be.\"",

      "UNRWA was founded in 1949 \"to carry out direct relief and works programs for Palestine refugees,\" according to the agency\u2019s website. However, Neuer disputes Palestinians\u2019 refugee status and says that President Trump\u2019s proposed Gaza takeover uncovered a \"truth that has been hidden.\"",
      "Neuer points out that UNRWA supporters and critics of the president\u2019s proposal have accused Trump of \"uprooting them [Palestinians] from their homes and lands,\" which would mean that \"they\u2019re not refugees.\" Gaza, which the U.N. recognizes as part of the \"State of Palestine,\" would be considered their home under this criticism, negating their refugee status.",
      "However, the problems with UNRWA go beyond ambiguous definitions. Neuer told Fox News Digital that the agency \"systematically employed individuals who were supporting terrorism.\" He pointed to Fathi al-Sharif, who served as the principal of a school run by UNRWA, as well as the agency\u2019s teachers\u2019 union in Lebanon.",
      "\"We know that the head of UNRWA's education system, namely, teacher, school principal and head of the teachers\u2019 union of 2,000 teachers in Lebanon, was a man named Fathi al-Sharif\u2026 he was the head of Hamas in Lebanon,\" Neuer said, adding that American taxpayers\u2019 money funded al-Sharif and \"the entire education system that he oversaw.\"",
      "In the case of Suhail al-Hindi, UNRWA\u2019s former head of a \"local staff union in Gaza,\" the agency insists that it suspended and fired al-Hindi after an announcement that he had been \"elected to political office with Hamas.\"",
      "In response to a request for comment, UNRWA told Fox News Digital that it \"prohibits any type of involvement of staff in a militant or armed group.

      "UNRWA referenced al-Hindi's case specifically, noting it \"also dismissed another staff member whose name appeared in the list of those newly elected to Hamas political office in Gaza.\"",
      "Contrary to critics\u2019 claims, Neuer told Fox News Digital that Israel was not always trying to shut down UNRWA, saying that the Jewish State first saw the agency as \"convenient\" in the late 1960s.

      "While Israel\u2019s views on the agency have changed, prompting action from the country\u2019s government, Neuer points out that several countries, including the U.S., failed to \"take any meaningful action\" against UNRWA.

      "A protester holds a flag outside the United Nations Relief and Works Agency during the demonstration. (Ahmed Zakot/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)",
      "When asked about what Americans need to know about UNRWA, Neuer says that the agency is \"a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing,\" adding examples of U.N. officials who he says have gone against their mission. He also compared it to a social issue commonly debated here, namely anti-racism.",
      "\"Just like Americans were told for at least the past 5 years - maybe more - that anti-racism means you have to discriminate against white people, against heterosexuals, you know, all kinds of categories, we were told that's tolerance, that's equality. We were told that racism and discrimination was anti-racism and anti-discrimination. We were fed a pack of lies,\" Neuer told Fox News Digital.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Department of Justice fired multiple immigration judges on Friday, according to two sources familiar with the decision and a statement from one of the judges on LinkedIn. The move threatens to throw sand in the gears of an already strained immigration system as the Trump administration moves to rapidly reshape the federal workforce.",
      "The terminations were enacted by the acting director of the Executive Office of Immigration Review at the Justice Department, which oversees immigration courts.",
      "A union representing immigration judges said that since the start of the Trump administration, more than two dozen immigration judges, managers and new hires have been fired.",
      "Five midlevel assistant chief immigration judges and 13 candidates to become new judges received termination notices on Friday, according to the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers.",
      "\u201cYou have a president now who campaigned on immigration and removing people from the country on the one hand. And on the other hand, he\u2019s actually firing the very judges that have to hear these cases and make those decisions. So, it makes no sense. It\u2019s a head scratcher,\u201d said Matt Biggs, the president of the IFPTE.",
      "Since President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, the administration has fired at least four top managers in the Executive Office of Immigration Review as well as a fifth senior manager, the union said.",
      "Kerry Doyle, a recently appointed immigration judge, said on LinkedIn she and others appointed by then-President Joe Biden received an email on Friday telling them they had been fired. Doyle previously served as deputy general counsel of the Department of Homeland Security during the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cThis firing occurred despite the fact that the Immigration Court currently has in the neighborhood of 3.5 MILLION pending cases and DOJ is asking Congress for more money to hire more people at EOIR!\u201d Doyle said in a statement on LinkedIn, referring to the Executive Office of Immigration Review.",
      "Doyle alleged that the \u201cfiring was political,\u201d noting that she and colleagues who were fired had been hired during the Biden administration. NBC News cannot independently verify the claims, as the number of fired judges remains unclear.",
      "The Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The decision to fire the immigration judges risks adding to a case backlog that reached record levels during each of the last three years, according to the Congressional Research Service.",
      "Record-high levels of enforcement encounters at the southwest border last year resulted in more than 1.8 million new cases being filed, according to the CRS. The new cases boosted the total immigration case backlog to 3.6 million by the end of 2024, despite an effort by the Biden administration to hire more immigration judges and decrease processing times.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s bipartisan support across the board to actually hire more immigration judges. I mean, there\u2019s a backlog of almost 4 million cases as it is, so this administration, with these firings, they\u2019ve been very successful in increasing the backlog,\u201d Biggs said.",
      "The Trump administration has instead focused its efforts on hiring staff to aid in mass deportations, which Trump has promised will result in \u201cmillions and millions\u201d of people being removed from the country.",
      "Trump\u2019s \u201cborder czar\u201d Tom Homan has recruited staff from several federal agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to aid ICE in making immigrant arrests.",

      "NBC News previously reported the administration is considering using Defense Department funding to hire contractors that would vastly expand the scale of immigrant arrests and deportations. The new funding would go toward paying civilian-run companies to expand and staff temporary detention facilities.",
      "The firings also come on the heels of a series of terminations at the Department of Justice, which marked a departure from the typical turnover between administrations. During previous administrations, the Department of Justice has asked politically appointed U.S. attorneys to resign. But this time, the administration fired as many as 12 U.S. attorneys. The total number of U.S. attorneys impacted was not immediately clear.",
      "Last month, the Justice Department also fired multiple career lawyers who had been involved in federal cases surrounding Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and alleged mishandling of classified documents. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges, and the cases were dropped after Trump was elected to a second term.",
      "Trump\u2019s first few weeks in office have been marked by the mass upheaval of the federal workforce, with the administration initiating large-scale firings across the government. A federal judge gave a green light earlier this week to Trump\u2019s mass buyout plan, allowing the administration to persuade millions of people to resign their positions but get paid through September. The Office of Personnel Management also advised agency leaders this week to terminate probationary employees who have been in their positions for a short period of time.",

    "summary": "Uncertainty is running high on Main Street after a deluge of economic policy changes, with some entrepreneurs reporting unpaid invoices and other funding worries.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s first weeks in office have brought a flurry of changes from funding freezes and tariffs to a crackdown on diversity efforts. While courts have halted some of them, small businesses faced with higher costs, steep interest rates and more cautious consumers share a similar message: This isn\u2019t helping.",
      "David Funk said he was stunned when the U.S. Department of Agriculture rejected his $65,000 invoice for work his company had completed since October.",
      "The founder of Zero Emissions Northwest, a Spokane, Washington-based consultancy, Funk connects farmers with federal grants to subsidize equipment purchases and energy bills. A week after his invoice denial, agency representatives confirmed it was because of Trump\u2019s \u201cUnleashing American Energy\u201d order, which halted many projects funded through the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "\u201cWhat it\u2019s resulting in is jobs lost, projects canceled and more jobs lost,\u201d said Funk, who furloughed all three of his employees about two weeks ago. Many of his clients are now stuck with equipment they can\u2019t finance on their own. \u201cIt is shocking to some of them who have voted for Trump to realize that this might directly impact them,\u201d he added.",
      "Weeks after the Office of Management and Budget rescinded the sweeping freeze on grants and loans it had issued days earlier, Shaundell Newsome, founder of Sumnu Marketing in Las Vegas, said his agency\u2019s internships could still be on the chopping block. The program, with space for four interns per year, is sustained by a Labor Department grant.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of confusion about what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not real,\u201d he said of the federal directives. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have those dollars to offset the training now, we\u2019ve got to make a business decision.\u201d",
      "Newsome still plans to make his next hire in March, after the agency that disburses the funds said they remained on track to reach him on schedule. But he\u2019s concerned about funding for the rest of the year, including a summer program for high schoolers.",
      "Funk shared that sense of urgency. \u201cNot getting paid due to a canceled contract and not getting paid due to a paused contract has the same result: We\u2019re not getting paid,\u201d he said.",
      "While small businesses remain broadly optimistic about the months ahead, the National Federation of Independent Business\u2019 latest survey also found that members\u2019 uncertainty hit its third-highest level on record. Many reported curtailing plans to invest in their businesses, wary of tapping cash reserves should economic conditions deteriorate.",
      "Not getting paid due to a canceled contract and not getting paid due to a paused contract has the same result: We\u2019re not getting paid.",
      "David Funk, founder of Zero Emissions Northwest",
      "Meanwhile, the leaders of major tech firms have been personally courting the president\u2019s favor, and there are signs of executives warming up to an administration promising deeper tax cuts and deregulation. But the nation\u2019s 33 million small businesses, which employ nearly half the U.S. workforce and account for over 43% of economic output, typically have less lobbying clout or margin to adapt to federal policy swings, advocates say.",
      "\u201cWe want to see more parity,\u201d said Richard Trent, executive director of Main Street Alliance, a coalition of more than 30,000 small businesses. Trent criticized the \u201coligarchic acolytes\u201d who he said appeared to be in Trump\u2019s \u201cinner circle\u201d and called for a more \u201cnuanced conversation where everyone\u2019s included.\u201d",
      "A White House spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump\u2019s business-friendly reputation was one of the leading factors that helped return him to the White House. While the U.S. averaged 443,302 monthly business applications during the first three years of the Biden administration as the economy recovered from Covid-19, compared with 282,362 in the equivalent period of Trump\u2019s first term, many entrepreneurs recall the current president\u2019s earlier time in office favorably. The NFIB\u2019s optimism index soared at the time, buoyed in part by Trump\u2019s tax cuts, and interest rates and inflation both remained historically low until the pandemic hit.",
      "Still, some small-business owners are now taking steps to insulate themselves from the potential negative impacts of recent White House efforts \u2014 including those that remain in limbo \u2014 before waiting to see how it all shakes out.",
      "Shortly after the election, Beatrice Barba told NBC News she was looking to purchase $200,000 worth of her regular inventory ahead of Trump\u2019s promised tariff. The sippy cups she sells at Tabor Place, her San Francisco Bay Area e-commerce line of children\u2019s goods, rely on a durable borosilicate glass from a Chinese manufacturer.",
      "But in recent weeks, Barba has opted to gamble on less cash-intensive measures. She\u2019s reduced the order to $100,000 to avoid having the products sit idle for too long, and while some of her other items need to be restocked \u2014 at an expected $50,000 cost \u2014 she\u2019s holding off for now. Barba said she suspects Trump\u2019s 10% additional tariffs on China could change or go away in trade negotiations.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s an extra 5,000 bucks. I don\u2019t want to have to spend that,\u201d she said. \u201cTen percent is a lot. There is no company, retail or otherwise, that would not be forced to pass that margin on to their customers.\u201d",
      "Barba said there are ways the administration could help small businesses directly, such as by offering loans to build more U.S. factories so companies like hers could rely less on components made overseas. She\u2019d also like to see tariff exemptions for employers of fewer than 50 people.",
      "The full effects of Trump\u2019s economic policies remain to be seen. In a note to clients this month, JPMorgan analysts posed the question, \u201cIs this a business friendly administration?\u201d",
      "They highlighted the potential economic drag created by abrupt, sweeping changes to U.S. policy, including mass deportations that the White House is looking to ramp up. The impact of moves like these could be magnified \u201cthrough a tightening in labor markets that constrains Fed easing,\u201d they said, flagging the risk that more uncertainty could delay interest rate cuts.",
      "The longer steep borrowing costs persist, the more Main Street entrepreneurs could suffer a disproportionate squeeze, said Joe Seydl, senior markets economist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank.",
      "\u201cSmall businesses tend to be more leveraged than larger businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cThey tend to borrow more at the short end of the yield curve, rather than the long end, and they tend to have significantly less cash holdings.\u201d",
      "Corrine Hendricks, owner of a day care center in New Glarus, Wisconsin, said she has \u201can extra layer of concern because I don\u2019t have access to capital.\u201d She began scrambling upon learning of last month\u2019s funding freeze, unsure if she could sustain her business without the Child Care and Development Block Grant that subsidizes care for a number of her clients.",
      "\u201c[One parent] saw the news and was concerned she wouldn\u2019t get the funding, and wasn\u2019t sure how they would pay me the next month, and what that would mean. Would I expel him?\u201d she said.",
      "Hendricks said the subsidies resumed on Feb. 1, soon after the White House lifted its funding freeze following a court ruling that halted it. But she\u2019s nervously watching as Republicans pursue deep spending cuts to accommodate Trump\u2019s agenda, with one proposal calling for potential cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that helps fund the healthy meals Hendricks provides.",
      "She\u2019s also worried that the child care grant itself, which is run through the Department of Health and Human Services, could be on the chopping block. Hours after his confirmation as head of the department this week, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hinted at firings in a televised interview.",
      "An HHS representative said in an email that \u201cthere are no current cuts, pauses, or disruptions to the Child Care and Development Block Grant.\u201d",
      "Still, Hendricks said she\u2019s wondering, \u201cDo I continue to do this, or do I look for a different job?\u201d She added: \u201cIt really just makes me nervous that I will be able to maintain my program and my business, and my life\u2019s work.\u201d"

      "\u201cNow that the war in Cambodia has finished, people need to make a living,\u201d Oum said. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t clear out the mines, there will always be a risk.\u201d",
      "While slowed by the aid freeze, demining continues in Cambodia. The same can\u2019t be said in Laos, where the U.S. provided almost 90% of international funding for unexploded ordnance clearance in 2022, according to the Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor.",
      "The freeze in funding is pushing Laos into \u201cuncharted territory,\u201d said Danae Hendrickson, chief of mission advancement and communications at Legacies of War, a U.S.-based advocacy group for mine action in the region.",
      "\u201cI fear this pause in funding will undo decades of progress, not only in mine action, but also in U.S.-Laos relations, which have been difficult in the past few decades,\u201d Hendrickson said.",
      "Since aid was frozen in late January, four unexploded ordnance accidents have been reported in Laos \u2014 leading to two deaths and five injuries across three provinces, according to local authorities. NBC News was unable to independently confirm that figure.",
      "\u201cI refuse to live in a world where we don\u2019t continually strive to help our neighbors, especially when we have been part of the problem,\u201d Hendrickson said. \u201cThis is our shared history. The U.S. has dropped these bombs and it is our duty, our moral obligation, to clean that up.\u201d"

      "The timing of the travel was not specified, and it is unclear whether the trio have already departed.",
      "The move comes just days after President Donald Trump said he spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy about the prospect of beginning negotiations to end the war.",
      "\u201cWe agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other\u2019s Nations,\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Wednesday after the call. \u201cWe have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately.\u201d",
      "Senior Trump administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance, Rubio and U.S. special envoy to Ukraine Keith Kellogg, have been huddling in Germany this weekend for the Munich Security Conference, a forum for international security policy where the Russia-Ukraine war remains a critical topic of discussion.",
      "Rubio spoke by phone with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Saturday. Their discussion included the war in Ukraine and other topics, according to readouts of the call from both countries.",
      "During a speech at the security conference Saturday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine must be involved with any negotiations to end the war.",
      "\"Ukraine will never accept deals made behind our backs,\" he said. \"No decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine, no decisions about Europe without Europe.\"",
      "During a panel discussion Saturday on the sidelines of the conference, Kellogg said that \u201cof course\u201d Ukrainians would be at the table in discussions to end the war. However, he said \u201cthe answer is no\u201d when asked whether he could assure Europeans that they too would have a seat at the table.",
      "\u201cWhen you sit at the table, there\u2019s really, there\u2019s two protagonists when you look at it, and there\u2019s one, hopefully it\u2019ll be an intermediary,\u201d Kellogg added. When the moderator asked for clarification, he indicated that Ukrainians, Russians and Americans would be \u201cat the table talking.\u201d",
      "He later said that a group not being at the table \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean the interests are not taking a part of, they\u2019re not considered, they\u2019re not used, they\u2019re not developed.\u201d",
      "Kellogg on Saturday defended the prospect of engaging with Putin in an effort to achieve peace between Russia and Ukraine, saying in Munich, \u201cWhether you like it or not, you have to talk to adversaries.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs a great secretary of defense, Gen. Mattis, once said: I may not like this son of a b----, but I got to talk to him,\u201d he added.",
      "Kellogg also said that Western leaders need to do more to enforce sanctions against Russia, adding that negotiations about ending the war could focus on Russia\u2019s willingness to cede territory and targeting Putin\u2019s oil revenue.",
      "But some members of the administration have seemed reluctant in recent days to specify any particular concessions from Russia ahead of potential negotiations.",
      "Asked Thursday what Russia should give up in order to reach a deal with Ukraine, Trump declined to name specifics.",
      "\u201cAs far as the negotiation, it\u2019s too early to say what\u2019s going to happen. Maybe Russia will give up a lot, maybe they won\u2019t, and it\u2019s all dependent on what is going to happen,\u201d Trump said during a news conference alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has signaled the U.S. would be opposed to Ukraine joining NATO as part of a negotiated peace, indicated that the U.S. is likely to support negotiations in which Ukraine cedes territory that\u2019s\u00a0already been seized by the Kremlin.",
      "\u201cWe want, like you, a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine. But we must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine\u2019s pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective,\u201d Hegseth said in a speech during a trip to NATO\u2019s headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday."

    "summary": "The Trump administration indicated U.S. troops could be deployed to provide security in connection with the minerals if there's a peace deal with Russia, sources told NBC News.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has suggested to Ukraine that the United States be granted 50% ownership of the country\u2019s rare earth minerals, and signaled an openness to deploying American troops there to guard them if there\u2019s a deal with Russia to end the war, according to four U.S. officials.",
      "Rather than pay for the minerals, the ownership agreement would be a way for Ukraine to reimburse the U.S. for the billions of dollars in weapons and support its provided to Kyiv since the war began in February 2022, two of the officials said.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent presented the proposal for the U.S. to own half of Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a draft contract he brought to their meeting on Wednesday in Kyiv, according to eight U.S. officials briefed on the meeting.",
      "After that meeting, Bessent said the draft of a U.S.-Ukraine rare earth minerals agreement reflected the president\u2019s goal, but he did not provide details of what the administration had proposed.",
      "Zelenskyy declined to sign the document when Bessent presented it during their meeting, saying he needed to study it and consult others about it, the eight U.S. officials briefed on the meeting said.",
      "The Ukrainian leader said at the time that he and his team \u201cwill do everything to review all details of the document\u201d before his arrival in Munich, where he met Friday with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as well as U.S. lawmakers on the sidelines of a global security conference.",
      "The Ukrainian Embassy in Washington and a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday.",
      "Zelenskyy said in his speech at the security conference Friday that his lawyers would weigh in on the document Bessent presented to him in Kyiv with advice and some changes. He referred to the proposal as a memorandum between the U.S. and Ukraine, not a security agreement.",
      "In recent months, President Donald Trump has expressed interest in striking a deal with Ukraine that would grant the U.S. significant access to its rare earth minerals, which are used to make a variety of technology products.",
      "In a recent interview with Fox News, Trump said he wanted the U.S. to get $500 billion worth of Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals, and signaled Kyiv had \u201cessentially agreed to do so.\u201d",
      "Trump told reporters in the Oval Office this month that he would view access to the minerals as a form of \u201csecurity.\u201d",
      "\u201cI want to have the security of rare earth. We\u2019re putting in hundreds of billions of dollars. They have great rare earth, and I want security of the rare earth, and they\u2019re willing to do it,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Many of Ukraine\u2019s minerals are in areas now controlled by Russian troops, three U.S. officials said.",
      "Ukrainian officials have said Zelenskyy has long backed the idea of exchanging \u201ccritical resources\u201d for continued U.S. support, calling the idea part of the \u201cVictory Plan\u201d that he presented to Trump during a meeting last fall.",
      "In an exclusive interview Friday at the Munich Security Conference, Zelenskyy told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker that it would be \u201cvery, very difficult\u201d for Ukraine to survive without U.S. military support.",
      "\u201cIn all the difficult situations, you have a chance. But we will have low chance \u2014 low chance to survive without support of the United States. I think it\u2019s very important, critical,\u201d Zelenskyy said.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said this week that U.S. troops would not be deployed to Ukraine as part of any security guarantees for the country. Vance told The Wall Street Journal on Thursday that the U.S. sending troops to Ukraine is \u201con the table\u201d if Russia does not negotiate a peace agreement in good faith.",
      "Trump has long bristled at the amount of American support for Ukraine, referring to Zelenskyy at a past campaign event as \u201cthe greatest salesman of all time.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery time Zelenskyy comes to the United States, he walks away with $100 billion,\u201d Trump said in September. \u201cI think he\u2019s the greatest salesman on Earth. But we\u2019re stuck in that war unless I\u2019m president.\u201d"

    "summary": "U.S. troops have for the first time, tried out new equipment that has been developed and tested using information from the real life battlefield in Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "HOHENFELS, Germany \u2014 As the morning fog lifted over rolling, wooded hills in Bavaria, southeast Germany, a drone swept down to the grassy clearing and two U.S. infantrymen ran out of a nearby forest to change two long, black batteries.",
      "Under the cover of trees nearby, another soldier was on a laptop monitoring the activity of that drone and several others, tracking an enemy vehicle several miles away.",
      "Developed and tested using information from the real-life battlefield in Ukraine, the drone was one of several pieces of technology including light vehicles and updated communication devices that were being tested for the first time by the U.S. Army in Europe.",
      "\u201cThese drones are definitely smarter than they\u2019ve ever been,\u201d 1st Lt. Jake Baumert told NBC News earlier this month as his new unmanned systems platoon experimented with the new\u00a0equipment to figure out how best to use it in traditional infantry fighting.",
      "\u201cThey have missions and they are semiautonomous, not fully autonomous, but you plan it, and you can direct it if you want to,\u201d added the 28-year-old from Dallas.",
      "Deploying multiple drones including short-range quadcopters similar to those available in stores to the public, his platoon observed the opposing force\u2019s tactical vehicles. They also sent up larger unmanned aerial vehicles that flew semiautonomously.",
      "As well as being able to start and land them with a click of a button on their laptop, operators could also hand control of the drones to other units hidden in dense forest several miles away, while the information they gathered could be shared instantly with colleagues or commanders.",
      "\u201cI think the biggest advantage is the technology that\u2019s in the drone and its ability to give you data,\u201d Baumert said.",
      "Elsewhere, soldiers tested vehicles that seat more soldiers than traditional Humvees. Smaller and often more agile in steep terrain, they are easier to camouflage and are equipped with hybrid engines, making them quieter and less likely to be spotted by drones with thermal cameras.",
      "Lessons learned during Ukraine\u2019s three-year war with Russia and Israel\u2019s fight with Hamas in Gaza had \u201creally identified that we\u2019ve got to get faster at staying competitive,\u201d Sgt. Maj. of the Army Michael Weimer said in an interview late last month.",
      "Experience garnered during Iran\u2019s missile and drone attacks on Israel, as well as those by its Houthi proxy army in Yemen was also being taken into account, he added.",
      "\u201cThe character of war is changing at a speed we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get faster at staying competitive with the technology that\u2019s changing.\u201d",
      "Information from the battlefield was coming via several avenues in Ukraine, he said.",
      "\u201cTraditionally, we wouldn\u2019t give such new technology to soldiers this early. Traditionally, we would grab a few soldiers, and we would allow them to use the gear, experiment with it, get some feedback from them, then go back, do some more research and development,\u201d added Weimer. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here, because so much of this is commercial off the shelf, is we\u2019re expediting our ability to learn.\u201d",
      "The lessons U.S. and NATO troops are learning from Ukraine and implementing in their training are game changers, according to Ed Arnold, a European security expert at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cUsing drones to spot targets is one of the most important things we have learned from Ukraine. As an example, using artillery strikes. There\u2019s nowhere to hide on the battlefield,\u201d he said in an interview earlier this month.",
      "He added that the maritime capabilities were \u201cprobably more significant than the land capabilities,\u201d because Ukraine\u2019s military had been able to use marine drones to destroy Russian ships and infrastructure. This had allowed Ukraine to keep vital shipping lanes open so it could continue exporting critical products like grain.",
      "The U.S. military had also learned a lot from the way Ukraine has defended parts of the Black Sea, he said.",
      "Back on the training ground in Hohenfels, Col. Josh Glonek, the commander of the 3rd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division, said incorporating the new technology had dramatically reduced the time it took to make a firing decision after spotting an enemy.",
      "This had gone from double digits to under two minutes, said the 43-year-old from Gordon, Wisconsin.",
      "\u201cThe lessons that are coming out of Ukraine are ones that we are very rapidly adapting to and incorporating into our own training,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s provided, I would say, a sense of urgency, not only for us, but for our NATO allies as well, to very rapidly modernize.\u201d",

But he was resolved on one thing \u2014 that his farm should stay a farm. So in 2016, he secured what\u2019s known as a conservation easement, a type of legal agreement that required his property, some of which floods or lacks irrigation, to remain a farm forever.",

      "With homes vandalized, synagogues on fire and residents on edge, Australia is grappling with a surge in antisemitic attacks that has prompted dozens of arrests across the country in what its leaders say is a \u201cnational crisis.\u201d",
      "Australian lawmakers and experts say there has been a rise in both antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Between the start of the war and September 2024, there were more than 2,000 antisemitic incidents in Australia, three times the figure for the same period a year earlier, according to a report in December by the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the Australian affiliate of the World Jewish Congress.",
      "Over the past 16 months, Jewish Australians have faced \u201can unprecedented rise in antisemitism across the country,\u201d according to a parliamentary inquiry report tabled Wednesday.",
      "Homes, cars and schools have been set on fire or spray-painted with anti-Israel messages, and there have been arson attacks against a synagogue in Melbourne and a child care center in Sydney. Last month, police said they had disrupted a potential antisemitic attack after they discovered a caravan containing explosives in a Sydney suburb.",
      "This week, two nurses in a Sydney hospital were suspended for saying they would kill Jewish patients or refuse to treat them in a video chat with a TikTok user who told them he was from Israel.",
      "The Australian government\u2019s response to the antisemitic incidents has been criticized by Jewish groups as well as Israel.",
      "\u201cThe epidemic of antisemitism is spreading in Australia almost unchecked,\u201d Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa\u2019ar said on the social media platform X last month. \u201cWe expect the Australian government to do more to stop this disease!\u201d",
      "Last week, Australian lawmakers almost unanimously passed tough hate crime laws that include mandatory jail time for giving a Nazi salute in public.",
      "\u201cWe want people who are engaged in antisemitic activities to be caught, to be charged and to be put in the clink,\u201d Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters.",
      "Opposition leader Peter Dutton agreed. \u201cThis is a time of national crisis,\u201d he said.",
      "The laws have been welcomed by Jewish communities.",
      "\u201cPrison sentences and fines are called for if there is to be any hope of stamping out this hateful behavior,\u201d the Executive Council of Australian Jewry said in a statement last week. A home formerly owned by the group\u2019s co-chief executive was among those targeted.",
      "The attacks have been concentrated in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia\u2019s most populous cities and home to 85% of the country\u2019s Jewish population.",
      "Most of them have been \u201csmall-scale, low-technology attacks,\u201d said Julian Droogan, head of the Department of Security Studies at Macquarie University in Sydney.",
      "An exception was the trailer laden with explosives, which Droogan said \u201cwas quite remarkable and almost without precedent in recent years.\u201d",
      "While police have arrested dozens of Australians in connection with the arson, they have also said they are investigating whether the attacks could be part of a large-scale concerted effort by foreign actors paying criminals for hire.",
      "\u201cSo part of our inquiries include: Who is paying those criminals, where those people are, whether they are in Australia or offshore, and what their motivation is,\u201d Australia Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw said last month.",
      "Local police are enhancing their efforts as well. This month, police in New South Wales, the Australian state that includes Sydney, said they had doubled to 40 the number of investigators on a task force formed to investigate antisemitic crimes and patrol schools and places of worship.",
      "\u201cChildren shouldn\u2019t feel scared to go to school, people shouldn\u2019t feel afraid to go to prayer or practice their religion,\u201d Commissioner Karen Webb said in a statement.",
      "The Israel-Hamas war and protests around it have been a sensitive issue in Australia, where some rallies have devolved into clashes between protesters and police officers.",
      "In October, police in New South Wales cited security risks and policing costs in trying to ban a pro-Palestinian rally marking the one-year anniversary of the start of the war, which has killed about 1,200 people in Israel and more than 46,000 people in the Gaza Strip.",
      "\u201cWe often look at Australia as geographically detached, and it is. But we forget to mention that the rest of the world is represented within Australia in microcosm,\u201d Droogan said. \u201cSo conflicts and disputes in the world regularly manifest in the Australian community.\u201d",
      "The tensions have extended to Australian schools, with multiple universities urging pro-Palestinian protesters to shut down encampments similar to those set up on campuses in the United States.",
      "There have been increased reports at universities of antisemitic graffiti, protests and chants, according to the parliamentary inquiry report, which urged universities to adjust their definition of antisemitism to more closely align with one that Palestinians and some civil rights groups say mutes criticism of Israel.",
      "Some Jewish groups say that in an attempt to address growing antisemitism, lawmakers and university campuses have instead politicized the issue and worsened prejudice against Palestinians and other groups.",
      "\u201cTo address antisemitism on campus, we must also address the racism faced by other racialized groups, including First Nations, Palestinian, Muslim, Arab, and Asian staff and students,\u201d Sarah Schwartz, executive officer of the Jewish Council of Australia, said in a statement Friday."

      "When Jason Egle plugged the device in and fell asleep at his parents\u2019 New Orleans-area home in the predawn hours of Oct. 16, 2021, it was dead. He hadn\u2019t realized it was someone else\u2019s.",
      "But once he awoke, Egle recalled in an interview, he panicked and quickly came to believe his phone had been intentionally swapped the night before, when he said he may have been drugged and conned by a woman who claimed to be his Uber driver.",
      "As Egle frantically tried to gain access to his accounts, he said, $15,000 vanished from his cryptocurrency account.",
      "Egle, 50, now believes that driver was Danette Colbert, 48, the woman charged with fraud and other crimes this month after a Telemundo reporter covering the Super Bowl was found dead in his hotel in Kenner, west of New Orleans.",
      "Colbert was previously charged in at least five other cases in two states involving allegations similar to Egle\u2019s, and in the week since authorities announced Colbert\u2019s arrest, police in Kenner say they have fielded a dozen complaints from people who believe they or a loved one may have been a victim of Colbert\u2019s.",
      "One of those possible victims, John Jenkins, 55, was found unresponsive in a New Orleans hotel in December. While Colbert hadn\u2019t previously been identified as a suspect, Kenner Deputy Police Chief Mark McCormick told NBC News that authorities now suspect she had a part in Jenkins\u2019 death.",
      "Egle was another possible victim who reached out to the Kenner department after Colbert\u2019s arrest to inform them that he believes she robbed and drugged him. He initially reported his claims to the New Orleans Police Department in 2021, shortly after he was allegedly robbed, according to a copy of a police report shared with NBC News, but he said nothing appears to have been done with the case.",
      "A second man, Eric Maul, told NBC News he also believes he was targeted by Colbert while she allegedly posed as an Uber driver in the French Quarter. He did not know who was responsible when he filed a report with New Orleans police one day after his phone was taken in 2021 and thousands of dollars were stolen from accounts linked to the device, he said in an interview, but didn\u2019t hear anything more from police.",
      "The lack of response, Maul said, made him believe \u201cthey didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d",
      "In an email, a New Orleans police spokesperson said the agency investigates each and every case filed with it. Investigators are examining \u201cany and all\u201d cases that may be connected to Colbert, including some in which she\u2019s already been ruled out as a possible suspect, said the spokesperson, Karen Boudrie.",
      "Boudrie said no suspects have been identified in connection with Maul\u2019s allegations and an investigation is ongoing. Boudrie did not respond to a request for comment about the investigation in Egle\u2019s case.",
      "An Uber spokesperson said it did not appear that Colbert was a driver for the platform.",
      "Current and former lawyers for Colbert either declined to comment or have not responded to requests for comment.",
      "A trail of allegations and charges",
      "Authorities have said that a cause of death for Adan Manzano, 27, the Telemundo reporter, has not yet been determined and that they are awaiting toxicology reports. Hotel security video showed Colbert entering a hotel room with Manzano at 4:35 a.m. on Feb. 5, Kenner Police Chief Keith Conley said earlier this month. The video showed her leaving, then returning, then leaving again at around 6 a.m., he said.",
      "Manzano\u2019s body was found that afternoon, the chief said. Colbert is alleged to have used the reporter\u2019s credit card at a store in the New Orleans area, and a search of Colbert\u2019s home in Slidell recovered what authorities believe is Manzano\u2019s cellphone.",
      "Colbert was arrested Feb. 7 and remains jailed without bond.",
      "Her arrest in the Manzano case comes after allegations of similar crimes in Louisiana and Nevada stretching back years.",
      "Earlier this winter, after Jenkins was found unresponsive on Dec. 15, the coroner\u2019s office attributed his cause of death to combined cocaine and ethanol toxicity and ruled it accidental. McCormick did not provide details about what role police believe Colbert may have played in his death.",
      "The deputy chief said Jenkins was missing property when he was found. \u00a0The\u00a0Louisiana State Police\u00a0and New Orleans police, which\u00a0are\u00a0assisting in the investigation, said\u00a0they were\u00a0not able to discuss any of the details involved in the investigation.",
      "In 2022, prosecutors in Clark County, Nevada, accused Colbert of grand larceny and administering a drug to aid in the commission of a felony in two separate cases. According to Daniel Lippmann, the attorney who represented her, the charges were dismissed after the victims said they did not want to testify in court, The Associated Press reported.",
      "In some cases, Colbert was convicted or pleaded guilty to similar charges.",
      "In New Orleans in 2021, David Butler accused Colbert of drugging him, stealing his phone and emptying his cryptocurrency account of his life savings \u2014 roughly $80,000, he said. Colbert denied the allegations. After a trial last year, she was convicted of computer fraud, theft and illegal transmission of monetary funds and sentenced to five years\u2019 probation, court records show.",
      "In a 2016 case in nearby Jefferson Parish, a man said his Rolex, cellphone and two credit cards disappeared after he got drunk with two women in the French Quarter, according to a probable cause affidavit. Colbert pleaded guilty to fraud and illegal possession of stolen items in connection with the crimes, court records show, and was sentenced to three years in prison.",
      "She was released on good time parole supervision in November 2017, a department of corrections spokesperson said, and charged with fraud again the following year after authorities in Jefferson Parish accused her of unlawfully accessing a man\u2019s phone and stealing money, court records show. She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years\u2019 probation.",
      "The victims in those cases could not be reached for comment, and it isn\u2019t clear if the men accused her of drugging them.",
      "Driver demands to see phone",
      "In October 2021, Egle, a traveling nurse who was raised in New Orleans, was visiting home and had taken his nephew for a night out on Bourbon Street when he said he encountered Colbert.",
      "They were at a bar when Egle suddenly felt so disoriented he was having trouble seeing straight and walking, he wrote in an email to his brother 10 days later that detailed the ordeal. Egle shared the note with NBC News.",
      "It was shortly after midnight when they requested a car. A black Mustang pulled up with a passenger in the back and a driver who said she was from Uber, Egle wrote. They began driving, he told his brother in the email, but there was a discrepancy with their destination and the driver asked to see the app on his phone.",
      "Egle said he handed her the device \u2014 a black iPhone 12 with a clear case \u2014 but the screen closed and locked, so she gave it back to him.",
      "\u201cThis happened a couple of times before she\u2019s like, \u2018Just give me the code,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cSo I gave her the code.\u201d",
      "Shortly after, Egle wrote, the driver told them they\u2019d gotten in the wrong Uber. She returned the phone and told him it was out of power, he wrote.",
      "\u201cSure enough it was dead,\u201d he said in the email. \u201cIt appeared in every way to be my phone, same model, color, and was even in my case.\u201d",
      "When the driver dropped off Egle and his nephew, CJ Egle, they weren\u2019t sure what to make of the brief, strange encounter.",
      "\u201cWe thought they tried to rob us and failed,\u201d the nephew said in an interview this week. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realize we were wrong until the next morning.\u201d",
      "Watching $15,000 vanish",
      "After Egle realized the phone wasn\u2019t his, he got on a laptop and began trying to access his accounts. He had a password vault on his phone and it appeared whoever had his device had gotten into it, he wrote in his email to his brother, because all his passwords had been changed.",
      "\u201cI go into damage control mode immediately, and she\u2019s locked me out of everything,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s already got a credit card in my name, she\u2019s already got a loan in my name. And the worst part is she got in my cryptocurrency account, and I\u2019m watching in real time as I\u2019m getting emails as she\u2019s emptying out my crypto account.\u201d",
      "Egle was able to mark the loan and credit card as fraudulent, he said, but $15,000 vanished from his Coinbase account.",
      "Roughly two hours after Egle woke up, he got a call on the phone that wasn\u2019t his.",
      "\u201cThe guy\u2019s like, \u2018Dude, you got my phone,\u2019\u201d Egle recalls the man saying.",
      "The man on the other end of the line was Eric Maul, who said he was also targeted in an alleged Uber scam. Maul recalled Egle telling him that he\u2019d woken up with Maul\u2019s phone in his own clear case.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018Did you get into an Uber that wasn\u2019t an Uber?\u2019\u201d Maul said Egle asked. \u201cI said, \u2018How did you know that?\u2019\u201d",
      "Maul, who\u2019d been visiting New Orleans from Los Angeles, said that two nights before Egle\u2019s encounter, he\u2019d gotten into a car with a woman who claimed to be an Uber driver. She\u2019d done the same thing with him as she\u2019d done with Egle; when she told him the app was glitching out, Maul recalled, he handed her his unlocked phone.",
      "When the driver tried to give him back a phone that wasn\u2019t his, an argument followed, he said.",
      "\u201cShe pulled several phones from her cleavage and said, \u2018I don\u2019t know which one is yours,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this point, I\u2019m like, this is bad. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s prone to violence. So at the next stoplight, I get out and book it.\u201d",
      "Maul said he soon discovered that someone had drained thousands of dollars from his Robin Hood account, opened a line of credit in his name and downloaded his W2 from last tax season.",
      "He\u2019d also been pickpocketed. Maul said he wasn\u2019t sure when this happened \u2014 perhaps at the bar he\u2019d gone to before he got in the Uber \u2014 but when he looked in his wallet, it was empty.",
      "\u201cI had my physical wallet, but they took everything in it,\u201d he said. \u201cThen they put it back.\u201d",
      "A startling message",
      "A week after Egle\u2019s phone was stolen, another person reached out via Facebook with a startling message: Their phone had been stolen in New Orleans, and now, images of Egle\u2019s financial documents were appearing on the cloud service the man used. Included in the message were images of Egle\u2019s tax returns and a request to confirm a residential address for a bank account, according to screenshots Egle shared with NBC News.",
      "\u201cThey stole $16K from me yours get stolen too?\u201d the man said in another message.",
      "Egle said that man told him he had blacked out after hanging out with two women at the bar where Egle had been with his nephew. When he awoke in a hotel room, Egle recalled the man saying, his phone was gone and thousands of dollars had been transferred out of his Coinbase account. (The man did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.)",
      "Egle said the man told him that he had been drugged and that he and Egle may have been similarly targeted. Egle drinks regularly, he said, but never to intoxication \u2014 and he\u2019d suddenly become \u201cextremely intoxicated\u201d that night.",
      "In the email to his brother, Egle wondered if that might explain why he\u2019d done something as unwise as sharing the passcode for his phone with the driver.",
      "\u201cNever in a million years would I do such a thing and the whole event is hazy,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u2018No one would help\u2019",
      "The three men remained in touch, Egle said. He and Maul filed reports with the New Orleans Police Department, Egle said, and he tried to get security camera video from the bars where they believed they may have been drugged.",
      "But those efforts went nowhere, Egle said. And despite repeatedly contacting the police department, Egle said he never heard back. The same was true for Maul.",
      "\u201cNo one would help,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the darkest it got for me.\u201d",
      "In 2022, months after his Uber ride, Egle said he got in touch with David Butler, whose encounter with Colbert came weeks after Egle\u2019s and Maul\u2019s. Butler had reached out after one of the men described being drugged and robbed on Reddit.",
      "Butler provided them with Colbert\u2019s name and a link to her social media. He asked if she looked familiar, Egle recalled.",
      "\u201cImmediately, we were like, that\u2019s absolutely her,\u201d he said. \u201cNo doubt.\u201d",
      "\u201c100%,\u201d added Maul. \u201cI recognized her.\u201d"

      "Five people have been arrested and charged in New York in connection with the disappearance and death of a 24-year-old Minnesota transgender man who was reported missing earlier this week, officials said.",
      "New York State Police reported that it launched a missing persons investigation for Sam Nordquist, 24, on Sunday after receiving a welfare check request from his family.",
      "On Thursday, investigators discovered human remains, believed to be those of Nordquist, in a field in Yates County, New York. Yates County is about 50 miles south of Rochester.",
      "The case is being investigated as a homicide, Lynnea Crane, spokesperson for the New York State Police, said at a Friday news conference. She added that evidence points to the fact that Nordquist was the \"victim of a criminal act.\"",
      "Capt. Kelly Swift with the New York State Police said at the news conference that they have not ruled out the possibility of this case being a hate crime.",
      "\"Our investigation has revealed a deeply disturbing pattern of abuse that ultimately resulted in Sam's tragic death,\" Swift said, noting Nordquist faced both \"prolonged physical and psychological abuse at the hands of multiple individuals.\"",
      "She called it \"one of the most horrific crimes I have ever investigated\" in her 20-year law enforcement career.",
      "Police could not share details about the specific abuse Nordquist faced, citing the ongoing investigation.",
      "Officials said they discovered that Nordquist had been staying at Patty's Lodge in Hopewell, New York, with one of the five suspects. Evidence uncovered during the investigation suggests that Nordquist \"was subjected to ongoing physical abuse\" between December 2024 and February 2025, police said.",
      "Police identified the five suspects \u2014\u00a0all from New York \u2014\u00a0as Precious Arzuaga, 38; Jennifer A. Quijano, 30; Kyle Sage, 33; Patrick A. Goodwin, 30; and Emily Motyka, 19. All were charged with second degree murder with depraved indifference, according to the state police release.",
      "All five suspects were arraigned and remanded to the Ontario County Jail on Friday.",
      "James Ritts, District Attorney for Ontario County, said at the Friday news conference that the suspects are being held without bail. He noted that a date for a preliminary hearing has been set and that he expects \"grand jury action very quickly.\"",
      "It was not immediately clear if any of the suspects had legal representation. Crane, the spokesperson with the New York State Police, told NBC News she was unaware of the suspects' legal representatives. The Ontario County District Attorney's office did not immediately answer a request for that information on Saturday evening.",
      "Police said they are still investigating the relationship between Nordquist and the suspects.",
      "\"Sam was subjected to repeated acts of violence and torture in a manner that ultimately led to his death,\" Swift said at the news conference. \"His body was then transported in an attempt to conceal the crime.\"",
      "According to the release from state police, Nordquist's body was \"transported to Yates County, where the remains were disposed of.\"",
      "The Monroe County Medical Examiner's Office will conduct an autopsy to determine cause and manner of death, police said.",
      "According to the missing persons report, Nordquist had last been in touch with family at the end of January, and had traveled to New York from Minnesota in September of 2024.",
      "Nordquist was last seen in early February. Investigators executed multiple search warrants at Patty's Lodge, according to police.",
      "The investigation is active and ongoing, police said.",
      "\"The facts and the circumstances of this crime are beyond depraved. This is by far the worst homicide investigation that our office has ever been a part of,\" Ritts said Friday. \"No human being should have to endure what Sam endured.\"",
      "A number of Rochester city council members expressed their support and condolences for Nordquist's family in a news release shared to social media.",
      "\"Our Trans and LGBTQIA+ residents are, and have always been, integral to the fabric of our communities,\" council members Mary Lupien, Stanley Martin and Kim Smith said. \"We reaffirm our commitment to protecting Trans rights, ensuring safety for all and wish to make clear that you belong\u2014fully, openly, and without fear.\""

      "Rwanda-backed rebels reached the center of east Congo\u2019s second largest city, Bukavu, on Sunday morning and took control of the South Kivu province administrative office after\u00a0little resistance from government forces, many of whom fled the rebels\u2019 advance.",
      "Associated Press journalists witnessed scores of residents cheering on the M23 rebels in central Bukavu on Sunday morning as they walked and drove around the city center after a dayslong march from the region\u2019s major city of Goma 63 miles away, which they captured late last month. Several parts of the city, however, remained deserted with residents indoors.",
      "The M23 rebels are the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of Congo\u2019s mineral-rich east, and are supported by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to the U.N.",
      "It was not clear if the rebels had taken decisive control of the city of about 1.3 million people. Their presence in central Bukavu is an unprecedented expansion of the rebels\u2019 reach in\u00a0their yearslong fighting with Congolese forces. Unlike in 2012 when they only seized Goma in the fighting connected to ethnic tension, analysts have said the rebels this time are eyeing political power.",
      "Many Congolese soldiers were seen on Saturday fleeing the rebels\u2019 advance into Bukavu alongside thousands of civilians amid widespread looting and panic.",
      "Congo\u2019s President Felix Tshisekedi held a security meeting in the faraway capital of Kinshasa, where officials noted that Bukavu was \u201cbriefly\u201d invaded by M23 but remains under the control of the Congolese army and allies from local militia, the presidency said on X. There were no signs of fighting or of Congolese forces in most parts of Bukavu on Sunday.",
      "Tshisekedi has warned of the risk of a regional expansion of the conflict. Congo\u2019s forces are being supported in Bukavu by troops from Burundi and in Goma by troops from South Africa.",
      "Burundi\u2019s president, Evariste Ndayishimiye, appeared to suggest his country will not retaliate in the fighting. In a post on X he said that \u201cthose people who were ready to get profit of the armed attack of Rwanda to Burundi will not see this.\u201d",
      "The Congo River Alliance, a coalition of rebel groups that includes M23, said it was committed to \u201cdefending the people of Bukavu\u201d in a Saturday statement that did not acknowledge their presence in the city. \u201cWe call on the population to remain in control of their city and not give in to panic,\u201d Lawrence Kanyuka, the alliance\u2019s spokesperson, said in a statement.",
      "The fighting in Congo\u00a0has connections with a decadeslong ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda militia group. Rwanda says the group is \u201cfully integrated\u201d into the Congolese military, which denies the charges."

    "summary": "A competition to name twin panda cubs launched Saturday following a ceremony at the Hong Kong theme park that houses the twins and their parents.",
    "story": [
      "Panda craze has once again gripped Hong Kong as residents compete to name the territory\u2019s\u00a0first locally-born giant panda cubs\u00a0who just turned six months old.",
      "The competition to name the twin cubs, born Aug. 15, launched Saturday following a celebratory ceremony attended by Hong Kong leader John Lee and other officials at Ocean Park, the theme park that houses the twins, their parents and two other\u00a0giant pandas that arrived from mainland China\u00a0last year. Residents can submit their suggestions via the park\u2019s website.",
      "Lee said the southern Chinese city now has the largest number of pandas in captivity outside of mainland China, and the cubs\u2019 names would be announced in the first half of this year.",
      "The pair, currently identified as the \u201cElder Sister\u201d and the \u201cLittle Brother,\u201d will make their public debut on Sunday and meet visitors for five hours daily. Those who want to enjoy time with the cubs outside regular visiting hours, before the park opens, can pay 1,500 Hong Kong dollars (about $190).",
      "During a media preview session on Saturday, the male cub laid on a swing playing with a tree stick before a carer placed him on a slide. The female cub explored the enclosure before climbing onto a tree.",
      "The panda carers said the female cub seemed more active than her male twin. She loves climbing the tree inside the enclosure and resting there while her brother likes to wander around and play with the plants. The male cub has been marked with two purple food-coloring spots on its back to distinguish it from his sister.",
      "The birth of the baby pandas last year made their mother Ying Ying the world\u2019s oldest first-time panda mom.",
      "Their popularity on social media also raised hopes for the city\u2019s tourism boost. Officials have encouraged businesses to capitalize on the panda craze to seize opportunities in what some lawmakers have\u00a0dubbed the \u201cpanda economy.\u201d",
      "Ocean Park\u2019s chairman Paulo Pong told reporters on Saturday that the park already saw income increases over the Christmas period and Lunar New Year holiday, alongside an uptake in overseas tourists, after the newly arrived pandas from mainland China\u00a0started to greet the public.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re turning the page and we believe the pandas are definitely helping the income of the park,\u201d he said.",
      "But\u00a0caring for pandas in captivity is expensive. Ocean Park recorded a deficit of 71.6 million Hong Kong dollars ($9.2 million) last financial year, and in 2020 required a government relief fund to stay afloat. Observers are watching if taking care of six pandas will add to its burden or give it a chance to revive its business.",
      "Pong said raising pandas was about animal conservation and education, instead of \u201cjust a money exercise.\u201d",
      "Pandas are considered China\u2019s unofficial national mascot. The country\u2019s giant panda loan program with overseas zoos has long been seen as a tool of Beijing\u2019s soft-power diplomacy."

    "story": [
      "With homes vandalized, synagogues on fire and residents on edge, Australia is grappling with a surge in antisemitic attacks that has prompted dozens of arrests across the country in what its leaders say is a \u201cnational crisis.\u201d",
      "Australian lawmakers and experts say there has been a rise in both antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Between the start of the war and September 2024, there were more than 2,000 antisemitic incidents in Australia, three times the figure for the same period a year earlier, according to a report in December by the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the Australian affiliate of the World Jewish Congress.",
      "Over the past 16 months, Jewish Australians have faced \u201can unprecedented rise in antisemitism across the country,\u201d according to a parliamentary inquiry report tabled Wednesday.",
      "Homes, cars and schools have been set on fire or spray-painted with anti-Israel messages, and there have been arson attacks against a synagogue in Melbourne and a child care center in Sydney. Last month, police said they had disrupted a potential antisemitic attack after they discovered a caravan containing explosives in a Sydney suburb.",
      "This week, two nurses in a Sydney hospital were suspended for saying they would kill Jewish patients or refuse to treat them in a video chat with a TikTok user who told them he was from Israel.",
      "The Australian government\u2019s response to the antisemitic incidents has been criticized by Jewish groups as well as Israel.",
      "\u201cThe epidemic of antisemitism is spreading in Australia almost unchecked,\u201d Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa\u2019ar said on the social media platform X last month. \u201cWe expect the Australian government to do more to stop this disease!\u201d",
      "Last week, Australian lawmakers almost unanimously passed tough hate crime laws that include mandatory jail time for giving a Nazi salute in public.",
      "\u201cWe want people who are engaged in antisemitic activities to be caught, to be charged and to be put in the clink,\u201d Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters.",
      "Opposition leader Peter Dutton agreed. \u201cThis is a time of national crisis,\u201d he said.",
      "The laws have been welcomed by Jewish communities.",
      "\u201cPrison sentences and fines are called for if there is to be any hope of stamping out this hateful behavior,\u201d the Executive Council of Australian Jewry said in a statement last week. A home formerly owned by the group\u2019s co-chief executive was among those targeted.",
      "The attacks have been concentrated in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia\u2019s most populous cities and home to 85% of the country\u2019s Jewish population.",
      "Most of them have been \u201csmall-scale, low-technology attacks,\u201d said Julian Droogan, head of the Department of Security Studies at Macquarie University in Sydney.",
      "An exception was the trailer laden with explosives, which Droogan said \u201cwas quite remarkable and almost without precedent in recent years.\u201d",
      "While police have arrested dozens of Australians in connection with the arson, they have also said they are investigating whether the attacks could be part of a large-scale concerted effort by foreign actors paying criminals for hire.",
      "\u201cSo part of our inquiries include: Who is paying those criminals, where those people are, whether they are in Australia or offshore, and what their motivation is,\u201d Australia Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw said last month.",
      "Local police are enhancing their efforts as well. This month, police in New South Wales, the Australian state that includes Sydney, said they had doubled to 40 the number of investigators on a task force formed to investigate antisemitic crimes and patrol schools and places of worship.",
      "\u201cChildren shouldn\u2019t feel scared to go to school, people shouldn\u2019t feel afraid to go to prayer or practice their religion,\u201d Commissioner Karen Webb said in a statement.",
      "The Israel-Hamas war and protests around it have been a sensitive issue in Australia, where some rallies have devolved into clashes between protesters and police officers.",
      "In October, police in New South Wales cited security risks and policing costs in trying to ban a pro-Palestinian rally marking the one-year anniversary of the start of the war, which has killed about 1,200 people in Israel and more than 46,000 people in the Gaza Strip.",
      "\u201cWe often look at Australia as geographically detached, and it is. But we forget to mention that the rest of the world is represented within Australia in microcosm,\u201d Droogan said. \u201cSo conflicts and disputes in the world regularly manifest in the Australian community.\u201d",
      "The tensions have extended to Australian schools, with multiple universities urging pro-Palestinian protesters to shut down encampments similar to those set up on campuses in the United States.",
      "There have been increased reports at universities of antisemitic graffiti, protests and chants, according to the parliamentary inquiry report, which urged universities to adjust their definition of antisemitism to more closely align with one that Palestinians and some civil rights groups say mutes criticism of Israel.",
      "Some Jewish groups say that in an attempt to address growing antisemitism, lawmakers and university campuses have instead politicized the issue and worsened prejudice against Palestinians and other groups.",
      "\u201cTo address antisemitism on campus, we must also address the racism faced by other racialized groups, including First Nations, Palestinian, Muslim, Arab, and Asian staff and students,\u201d Sarah Schwartz, executive officer of the Jewish Council of Australia, said in a statement Friday."

    "story": [
      "Shortly before \"NBC's Saturday Night\" lit up American TV sets on Oct. 11, 1975, producer Lorne Michaels and seven unknown actors and comedians appeared on \"The Tomorrow Show,\" a late-night talk show with Tom Snyder, to promote their new 90-minute variety series.",
      "\"We've got eight and we're hoping for two for it to really work,\" Michaels deadpanned to Snyder about his new cast. \"So, not all of these people will become stars.\"",
      "Sitting next to him? Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, Jane Curtin, Garrett Morris, Gilda Radner, John Belushi and Laraine Newman. Despite Michaels' tongue-in-cheek prediction, they would, in fact, go on to become not only stars, but legends as the original Not Ready For Prime Time Players on the soon-to-be renamed \"Saturday Night Live.\"",
      "Now, 50 years later, the sketch comedy show has gone on to become the most Emmy-decorated television show in history, receiving countless nominations, awards and accolades. And in 2017, those original cast members were inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame.",
      "Defined by its satirical and often censor-defying comedy, along with performances by cutting-edge musicians and artists, \"SNL\" has been a touchstone of American pop culture for five decades. In that time, more than 160 cast members have come and gone, many of them going on to become legends in their own right.",
      "In honor of \"SNL's\" golden anniversary, TODAY.com sat down with past and present cast members to learn what really goes on behind the scenes of the late night show \u2014\u00a0from the anxiety to the exhilaration \u2014 what viewers at home might be surprised to find out, along with their take on the best character breaks and sketches that didn't go quite as planned.",
      "Here's what they revealed.",
      "Answers have been edited for length and clarity.",
      "Laraine Newman (1975 to 1980)",
      "You can only be aware of the audience that's in the studio. There's no sense, at least from my experience, that there's millions of people watching.",
      "It's like everything I was trained to do at The Groundlings where we did sketches and were in place, in costume, doing the sketch, lights out, run off, change, get back down to your spot, lights up and do the next sketch. That's exactly what \"SNL\" is.",
      "What's heroic is that the set designers, they have four days to build sets for sketches that might not even make it to air. The craft of the look of the show, the work that goes into that, the thought that goes into it. The fact that the writers get to collaborate with every aspect \u2014 wardrobe, makeup, everything \u2014 to really optimize their material. I don't think there's any show like that.",
      "Lorne (Michaels) did not want us to laugh, and I never got close to laughing, except when Rodney Dangerfield hosted. We were doing a takeoff on the Woody Allen movie \"Manhattan\" called \"Manhasset.\" (Dangerfield) is saying, \"Tracy, don't go to Manhasset. I tell ya, it's rough. I got a waterbed and there was a guy at the bottom of it.\"",
      "Now, I'd heard that joke in read-through and the rehearsal and it still got me. If you watch it, you can't tell. But I am dying. It is everything I could do not to laugh.",
      "Nora Dunn (1985 to 1990)",
      "There's something about the camera coming on \u2014 you come to life. Because right before that, you're not. It's like your dead, and you're revived and it's a \"do-or-die\" situation. And you go, \"Well, I got here.\" I always tell myself, \"You got here. There's a reason that you are here.\"",
      "I don't think you do it. I think the other side does it. The lights do it. They go, \"5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ... boom!\" It just happens. You can't plan it.",
      "When you're watching a sketch, right behind that wall, someone's taking their clothes off and putting on a costume and having a wig grabbed off their head and put something else on it. You have to make those quick changes.",
      "You might be on with a guest star, the host, and you're like, \"Gotta get my clothes off!\" You're not naked, but next to naked. Every time there's a sketch on \"Saturday Night Live,\" there's all kinds of stuff going on in the background.",
      "We were not supposed to use cue cards, but we all did. But Lorne was like (imitating Michaels), \"They're there if you need them. That's why they're not there, because you don't know your lines.\"",
      "So, Jon (Lovitz) and I had to do a sketch with Charlton Heston. He needed glasses, but he said he didn't. He didn't wear glasses, so they had to make his cue cards huge. So, we had huge stacks of cue cards and we were doing an Egyptian scene. We're dressed up as a couple that's having pyramids built, and the cue card guy lost control of the cards. They spread all over the floor. Lorne was standing 15 feet away and he was furious. We just beelined away from Lorne because he was going to say (imitating Michaels), \"Well, someone didn't learn their lines.\" He was not happy with us.",
      "Kevin Nealon (1986 to 1995)",
      "It's unlike anything I've ever experienced before. It's like sitting in a rollercoaster car, right at the beginning, just anticipating and waiting for it all to happen. And it was a rollercoaster, there were ups and downs, it was crazy.",
      "I remember before I did my first sketch, it was \"Mr. Subliminal,\" and right before, Lorne Michaels comes up to me, puts his hand on my shoulder, and he said, \"Are you sure this is what you want?\" It was funny and it relaxed me a little bit.",
      "But I remember the excitement of the first show. I think The Pretenders were on, and I remember finishing a sketch, then running back to get made up and I'm hearing the band playing and I'm thinking, \"Oh my God,\" and I got filled with such energy and excitement that, \"This is it, man, this is live, this is 'Saturday Night Live.'\"",
      "I think the audience doesn't realize how small the studio is when they get there. And I don't think they realize that we're scrambling to figure out what sketches to cut from rehearsal, how to improve a sketch and what didn't work and what you're surprised that did work.",
      "But, also, I think a lot of times they don't realize how frightened we are about going out there.",
      "(Breaking character) was very rare for me and for a lot of people on our cast because, at the time, Lorne thought of that as being very \"hacky.\" Also, it was a disservice to the writer. If you put all this labor into writing a sketch and then people are breaking on it, it's like, \"Well, there goes that sketch.\"",
      "I did break with Chevy Chase on \"Weekend Update\" once, but that was one of the only times I ever broke in nine years.",
      "Molly Shannon (1995 to 2001)",
      "It's exhilaration. When I hosted, for example, right before you go on, you're in the back and you're with a stage manager and they're like, \"OK ... 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 ...\" So, you're like, \"Ugh (clutches her stomach).\"",
      "I got advice when I hosted. Steve Higgins, a wonderful producer on the show was like, \"Take your time. You don't have to run out there. It's OK.\" So, I thought that was good advice. Set yourself on stage, take a deep breath. But, definitely, there's nerves. I would say, an excited, kind of nervous feeling.",
      "I remember years ago, when I did the show, we would all have dinner after the rehearsals, before the live show. And I remember, because we had the whole week of writing comedy sketches, rehearsing them at dinner, I felt like, \"Ugh, this is time to just relax before the big comedy show live at 11:30 p.m.\"",
      "But people would still be doing comedy bits at dinner, and I remember thinking I just wanted to talk seriously and not have anybody joke around, like, have a quiet dinner before we have to go do a show. I was like, \"No comedy bits at dinner, like, please, let's just eat.\"",
      "Will Ferrell and I were characters who had recently lost 100 pounds, and we were very excited about it. We did it center stage and Will Ferrell and I always had a deal that, if you bombed, if you were tanking, and people weren't laughing, you would still have to commit as an actor, pour your heart into it even more.",
      "While we're performing it, there were crickets, no laughter at all. I remember during the scene, looking at Will, we were like (grimace), but we just kept performing it like the greatest dramatic actors, and we thought it was so funny. So, it entertained us that you had to bomb with grace and dignity, to just jump into bombing and be OK with it. Scoring and bombing were on equal planes \u2014 you had to respect both.",
      "Cheri Oteri (1995 to 2000)",
      "I would always be in the bathroom. That's how fearful I was. I was always very nervous. It's sheer fear and excitement. But because you only get a chance to do it once, it's more fear for me. But I've always been like that, even when I did theater. I was always in the bathroom until it was like, \"10, 9, 8 ...\"",
      "We have a two-hour draft show at 8 o'clock, then a half hour is cut out of that and you're just ... nothing's ever settled until 11:30 p.m. You're working to get your sketches in during the week and you don't know if they're going to get in. And if they do get in, they could always be cut between dress and air.",
      "Nothing is guaranteed. So that's kind of hard. I always say it's a show that you audition for every week, that you already got.",
      "There was one time I broke and it was doing \"Morning Latte.\" It was with Jerry Seinfeld. In this sketch, Will (Ferrell) goes like this (makes hitting motion) with a book and it hits me in the head. That book hit me so hard in the head \u2014 but it didn't hurt. It just clocked. And because of the book being a hardcover, the sound just reverberated and the audience went, \"Ooohhh.\"",
      "I went back and I saw stars. I started laughing and I couldn't stop. Will had to say my lines. Tears are coming down, I'm laughing so much. I've never not been able to recover from something. But because I saw stars, I couldn't stop laughing.",
      "But it was dress, so on air, I knew it was coming. But that was the one and only time I broke.",
      "Ana Gasteyer (1996 to 2002)",
      "Those last 15 seconds right before you go live, I think it's largely fear. It's not fear, necessarily, about failing or anything like that, but it's all so last-minute that it's just your brain synthesizing what has inevitably changed in your sketch moments before you've started and the breakneck pace of it because it really is live.",
      "What people don't understand \u2014\u00a0it's live, and it's written that week, that minute, that day. We may have written a sketch on Tuesday night, but it got rewritten on Thursday. It got rewritten again on Friday and then rewritten before your dress.",
      "You may have just come off another experience, may have had a failed quick change or stressed moment because commercial breaks are only two minutes. They might feel long when you're at home, but two minutes is really, really, really fast to have to change an entire outfit and wig. So, what's happening in those 15 seconds is kind of rooting yourself in the space of what you're going to do.",
      "You know, when you're coming back from a commercial and you're at home and you're like, \"Gosh, why is this taking so long? Why am I looking at this picture of Ariana Grande for so incredibly long?\"",
      "That's because, wildly, some set has not been assembled. That's what those bumper (photo) cards are for, to buy a little bit of time on the edges of your returns.",
      "There was a sketch we did, a Sally Jessy Raphael with Christina Ricci. She had never done live television before, so she was really spooked and kind of addled, and maybe had a little champagne. There was a bad teen sketch and I was Sally Jessy, there was a fist fight.",
      "It looked bad at dress. Lorne, in the notes, between dress and air, was like, \u201cLet\u2019s work on that punch.\u201d We didn\u2019t have a fight coordinator, it was very unrehearsed and the depth perception was off. We got to air and (Christina) was so focused, and that fist hit my nose in such a dramatic, hilarious, painful ... I mean, in the moment I remember my Sally Jessy red signature frames went flying up off my face and landed in, like, slow motion. It was insane. It was like a full-face TKO. I remember just being like, \u201cI\u2019ve got to maintain the impression,\u201d because I was so nervous about my Sally Jessy impression the whole time.",
      "Rachel Dratch (1999 to 2006)",
      "It's kind of a mix. Definite excitement, nerves ... fear is a factor. Doing theater before \"SNL,\" the fear is kind of what drives you. So, the fear is good actually. But, overall, excitement.",
      "This is kind of common sense, but you don't think of it when you're watching at home: That in between when you're watching a commercial, all the madness is happening because it's live. Someone's changing costume, hair, someone can go from being a baby to an old man in that commercial. There's a team of people working \u2014\u00a0every person has their own hair, makeup and wardrobe person. So, there's this huge transformation taking place or the sets are being moved.",
      "A sketch that went wrong in the best way possible was the \"Debbie Downer at Disney World,\" where we started laughing. That's the one everyone seems to remember so well. People tell me they watch when they're sad to cheer them up and that makes me so happy.",
      "But, yes, of course, we try not to laugh on the show. But that one, knowing the camera was coming in every time after I was saying this total bummer fact, and trying to keep it together, it just shows that this show is live. If there's any doubt, things can go wrong. And sometimes it's very funny when they do.",
      "Amy Poehler (2001 to 2008)",
      "Performing on \"SNL\" feels like working in a comedy emergency room. So you are rushing around sometimes, sometimes things are slow. You are around trained professionals, you have high stakes and it feels often very life or death.",
      "There's so many surprising things about \"SNL\" that people wouldn't realize. It's such a unique unicorn of a show and the way it's put together. I think a lot of people don't realize how tired everyone is all the time, especially during read through, because people have stayed up all night and then go in and have to perform.",
      "I think people also don't realize how most of your time at \"SNL\" is wondering when your food is going to get there. That's about 75% of your brain space, \"When is my food going to come?\" So, I think a lot of people are thinking that when (viewers) are thinking that they're thinking about sketches.",
      "My first year on \"SNL,\" the great John Goodman hosted and was so nice to me, even though I was a lone freshman. I remember I did a sketch with Chris Kattan and I got flipped into a dumpster \u2014 on purpose. I think I kind of passed out for a second and then woke up and I remember thinking, \"I wonder if anyone's ever passed out on 'SNL'?'\" Then I thought, \"How long have I been in this dumpster?\" So, that was fun. That was a good entry into what was a wild ride.",
      "Mikey Day (2013 to Present)",
      "It's so week-to-week. That's how the show works. You could have a week when you're in everything, you could have a week where you have three lines and one thing. It all depends. So, I feel like the emotions vary depending on that week.",
      "However, one constant is that after, \"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night,\" and the band starts playing \u2014 that's when the adrenaline (starts) and I'm always reminded, \"Oh wow, it's 'SNL,'\" and I always get kind of a little high off that.",
      "There's so many heroes on that show. The crew, itself, is, like, Tetris because Studio 8H isn't that big. So, they're constantly moving and all the equipment feels like it's from the '70s. This stuff has that old-school feel in terms of its size and bulk, and moving it to and fro on Saturday is pretty crazy. But they make it work somehow.",
      "Also, the filmed pieces, they build those sets in a day \u2014 a literal day \u2014 and sometimes there's three films being shot in one week, which is wild.",
      "Most recently, it was \"Beavis and Butt-Head\" with Ryan Gosling. It was a lot of fun. Heidi (Gardner) broke, Ryan and I were laughing, giggling like two schoolboys.",
      "But I remember the first time I laughed and it was in an unpredictable sketch called \"Dog Head Man.\" It's like geneticists who have created Dog Head Man. It was so dumb. At dress they were feeding the dog some treat or something and the dog didn't really like it. We're like, \"Can we just give it bread?\" And then it just went to town on this bread and I started laughing because Sam Rockwell and I were talking about such heavy stuff, and you just see the dog is so happy, going to town on human food.",
      "Dog Head Man stands out as one that I remember as the first time I kind of lost it. It wasn't too bad, but when you start to go, you're like, \"Oh no, I haven't done this before, am I going to get in trouble?\"",
      "Heidi Gardner (2017 to present)",
      "It's all of those things, actually. But I always just remind myself to have fun, take a few deep breaths. I'm going to do my job, the words are going to come out. That's always the biggest fear: Am I just going to stop knowing how to read cue cards? But it happens.",
      "I had never seen the show as a fan \u2014 I was a fan, but I had never gone to it. I really didn't understand that it was all in the same studio. I thought \"Weekend Update\" was in a separate room, that you walked down the hall to \"Weekend Update,\" then you walk to a sketch, but it's all in the studio. So, those two-minute commercial breaks really are like just complete chaos. The most organized chaos in the world. And it's really its own art form to watch the crew navigate that.",
      "Well, obviously, \"Beavis and Butt-Head,\" but there was one last season I did with Kristen Wiig, where we were \"Mad Men\" type secretaries, and she was supposed to fall through a desk, like sit on a desk and it breaks away. And I was supposed to fall through a wall and both of us just didn't quite have the strength to break either one.",
      "So, she sat on the desk and it didn't break and then she had to hop down. I went into the wall and it didn't break. So it was very funny to try and navigate that live.",
      "Chloe Fineman (2019 to Present)",
      "Performing on \"SNL\" is truly a fever dream. After so many shows, I'm like, \"Wait, what? I was with who? And I kissed so and so?\" Or, \"I was on stage with Ariana Grande?\" It really runs the gamut. It's very surreal, I'd say.",
      "I think viewers at home would be surprised to learn about the machine that happens during the live show. Anytime I've had friends and family come, it's amazing to watch. The sets are running over here and we're running here and there's heels and this thing's getting taken apart and put together. It happens like clockwork and, really, so much can go wrong. For some reason, it doesn't and it's magic. To me, that's almost as entertaining as the show.",
      "We did a \"Cast Away\" sketch with Jason Momoa, and he was supposed to lift me up and we were supposed to pretend to, like, have our bodies move, but he's so much bigger than me and I'm so short and little, that I really was like, \"Woo!\" He really thrusted me in a way that took my breath away. Honestly, that's a favorite."

      "Stark arrived in the Bay Area for the game Feb. 13, just a few hours before his team was set to practice for the first time. His appearance in the game comes amid filming for the back half of Season 8 of \"9-1-1,\" which returns with new episodes March 6.",
      "\"To be quite honest with you, I finished filming about 4 a.m. last night, outside in the rain, so to then wake up and get on an 8 a.m. flight was a little challenging,\" he says. \"But '9-1-1' were actually super accommodating in making sure I was free to do this, but they did send me on my way with a night shoot.\"",
      "One of Stark's character's most memorable recent episodes, titled \"Buck, Bothered and Bewildered,\" fittingly centered on a basketball game.",
      "Season 7, Episode 4, which aired April 4, 2024, saw Buck deal with a newfound jealousy over his best friend Eddie's (Ryan Guzman) new friendship with Tommy (Louis Ferrigno Jr.) Later in the episode, Buck learns via Eddie's wall calendar that he and Tommy have plans to play pick-up basketball, which he decides to crash.",

      "\"Is it circled with a heart around it?\" she teases.",
      "Buck attends the game, and tensions boil over as Buck witnesses Eddie and Tommy's camaraderie on the court. After Eddie steals the ball, Buck chases him down before shoving him, fracturing Eddie's ankle. In the end, Tommy apologizes for excluding Buck, while Buck cops to feeling jealous and admitting he had been trying to get Tommy's attention.",

(\"It was on 'Jeopardy!'?\" he says when asked about it.)",
      "Stark says he's \"cautiously optimistic\" going into the game.",
      "\"I think I'm trying to focus on, 'I'm just here to have fun,' but I do know that my competitive side will probably take over,\" he says. \"But listen, I might spend the whole game on the bench.\"",

      "This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "So listen, it's been a little while since I've played basketball competitively. I played a lot in high school, but that was some years ago. So as soon as I got the email about this, to be quite honest with you, I said, 'Yes.' I put my phone down. I went to the park, and I've pretty much been there ever since playing day in and day out, just to kind of get it back in my body a little bit.",
      "(Laughs) Well, I'll tell you, one of the things that I miscalculated was, you know, I'm 6' 2\", and so I thought that maybe, you know, for the kind of game that it is, that I might be on the taller side. But I'm actually one of the shorter players. So I'm going to put that as a weakness. And I'm going to put, and I say this tentatively, but sports IQ in my in my strengths column, and hope that works in my favor.",
      "Most of their reactions were to do with my somewhat injured knee that I've been struggling with for the past year. And basically everyone said, \"Is your knee going to be able to handle that?\" To which I said, \"I don't know. I guess we'll find out.\"",
      "But over the weeks of prepping for it, I feel good about it and having told that to them, they're all really excited. And they've all said to make sure I let them know exactly what network it's on, what time, and they're going to be cheering me on from back down in Los Angeles.",
      "\"9-1-1\" returns March 6 with Season 8, Episode 9, titled, \"Sob Stories.\" The midseason finale of the show left Buck reeling when Eddie told him he plans to move to El Paso to be closer to his son, Christopher. Buck has also been mourning the end of his relationship with Tommy, who broke up with Buck in Episode 6. Meanwhile, a trailer for the Season 8 return hints that Buck's sister, Maddie, is about to be kidnapped by a serial killer.",
      "Yeah, there's a ton of different stuff going on. There's a lot of tension  in the upcoming episodes between characters that we don't often see tension between. I think the stories across these (episodes), it's going to be quite a fraught and intense atmosphere for a good healthy portion of it. And that's not something that '9-1-1' tends to do, right? In general, our main cast, our main characters, are a pretty tight knit group, whereas we're going to be looking at what happens when you kind of start to tug at a thread, and you know, it keeps on pulling and pulling, and you kind of watch a lot of things unravel as that goes.",
      "Definitely, and I think they're going to be kind of explored and looked at in a way that is more obvious than kind of has ever been done before on the show. To an extent where I was actually surprised by the extent to which it's going to be explored. So, yeah, no, absolutely, that is to come very soon.",
      "Not that specifically. But just kind of an exploration of what the feelings are.",
      "Yeah... I'll say no more on that."

    "summary": "Netflix star Brittany Dodson dishes on meeting Devin Buckley in the \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d Season 8 dating pods in Minneapolis.",
    "story": [
      "From the moment Brittany Dodson met Devin Buckley in the \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d dating pods, the two shared an instant connection.",
      "The Season 8 participants quickly bonded over their shared love of basketball and their father\u2019s identical first names (Willy, not William), then seamlessly shifted to deeper conversations.",
      "Dodson, a 35-year-old partnership executive, lent an empathetic ear to Buckley, a 29-year-old youth director/coach, when he opened up about a difficult time in his life. But she was disappointed that he wasn\u2019t as understanding when she revealed that she had dated both women and men in the past.",
      "Ultimately, Dodson walked away from the relationship before it progressed any further, leaving Buckley to pursue his connection with Virginia Miller, a 34-year-old health care recruiter who later became his fianc\u00e9e.",
      "With Season 8 of \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d officially out on Netflix, Dodson is ready to reflect on the conversation that made her realize Buckley wasn't the match for her. Read on for TODAY.com's exclusive interview with Dodson and a recap of her journey in the pods.",
      "Why did Brittany and Devin break up?",
      "In Season 8 Episode 4, Buckley recalled a challenging time in his life during his senior year of high school where he felt extreme pain in his legs and back. Eventually, Buckley had physical therapy and surgery to address the pain and began to feel much better. Still, he admitted that he still feels \u201cashamed\u201d of abusing pain medication during that time. After listening intently, Dodson instantly reassured him that it was \u201cno reason for you to be ashamed.\u201d",
      "\"I appreciate you. I knew that if I told you, I wouldn't get any judgment,\" he replied.",
      "Dodson felt empowered to open up about her own story at this point and told Buckley about a time in her life after college where she \u201crealized things about my sexuality.\u201d",
      "Dodson said she's dated women in the past but has always seen herself marrying a man. When Buckley asked if she's still interested in women, Dodson offered the following response: \u201cI think that people are beautiful all together.\u201d",
      "Dodson then reassured him that she's always been in a monogamous relationship and is loyal to whoever she's dating \u2014 whether that's a male or a female.",
      "\u201cI feel like it's a lot for me to process just because I've never been with someone that has been with the same sex, but it doesn't change how I feel for you as a person,\u201d Dodson said.",
      "\u201cIt would've been very comforting to hear on your side, \u2018Oh, that don't matter. Oh, I don't care\u2019 but at the same time I have to understand and respect your perspective,\u201d she replied.",
      "On their next date, Dodson called things off and said, \u201cJust knowing that you may be a little more rigid than I would like in a partner, I just kind of feel like I don't think this is going to be good for me. We're not each other's person.\u201d",
      "Brittany Dodson reflects on her 'Love Is Blind' journey",
      "I\u2019ll be away, but I definitely plan to tune in.\u00a0I just have to be prepared for what other people will see.",
      "(Devin) was one of the main connections for sure.\u00a0Adam was definitely another connection, and there were a few more as well. I had a ton of fun with all the guys connecting and just chatting with them.",
      "His response didn\u2019t make me feel great in that moment, especially since I\u2019ve never thought about (my experiences with women) as a really huge deal. Then after saying it and hearing his response, I realized that it could be a bigger deal to others, including my family. So I was like, \u201cOk, here we go. Let's strap in for this ride.\u201d",
      "It definitely didn\u2019t make me feel the best, but hearing his response,  I wanted more from him, more support.\u00a0I wish that he could have had a little more confidence in himself to say, \"That doesn\u2019t matter.\u00a0We\u2019re here now. Where are we going?\"",
      "In that moment I thought, \u201cLet me give him his time.\u201d But then I had time to go home and think about it and just reflect on how I responded to his situation. And in that moment, I wanted to be extremely open and understanding.",
      "I kind of made up my mind by the time I went home and came back and got a restful night. I understand, yes, you can give people time to do things, but it sounded like he already had some very clear instilled views about things.",
      "So, I thought, \u201cI can\u2019t change your mind and I don\u2019t want to be the person to change your mind.\u201d",
      "I think I never had really said it out loud. I was just like, \u201cOk,\u00a0is that kind of silly? Is it the social construct or what society has told me to do and be?\u201d Of course I am open (to being with a woman), but I do like to be in my feminine energy and I do like a big, strong, loving man to take care of me.",
      "I\u2019ve had these experiences, and I think love in general is so beautiful, so I\u2019m very open to it.",
      "I think people come into pretty much any situation with their own expectations of what the person they want to be with is going to be like. When you impose some of those views on people, you kind of mess yourself up a little bit. And again, (there are) societal norms, of course, but I think also we as people tend to just have this fairytale built up in our heads.",
      "The next cast members should be open and understand that it's 2025.\u00a0Anything is possible. Don\u2019t have this mindset that just because someone loves someone else or a different gender or anything else that it will affect how they love you.",
      "We actually didn\u2019t have any conversations about how we wanted to handle anything. Virginia was a little more closed off and kind of kept her cards close to her chest throughout filming.\u00a0She did know after I had broken up with Devin why I\u2019d broken up with him.",
      "There wasn't any room for any drama. I think we\u2019re both very classy women and we are very confident in our own right and know and understand that there's room for everybody to find love and whatever happens, happens.\u00a0We\u2019re very emotionally intelligent people too. We don\u2019t have to claw and scratch at each other for any of this.",
      "I want someone a little more seasoned \u2014\u00a0someone that can teach me something. I'm definitely not interested in holding someone\u2019s hand.",
      "Now, if I fall madly in love with and we\u2019re learning and growing together, that is such a beautiful thing. But I\u2019m not 22 years old anymore. I certainly don\u2019t want to carry the weight of a relationship.",
      "I\u2019m interested in someone that\u2019s well established, ready to be married and receive some beautiful love from me."

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 11:00:42 GMT",
    "summary": "Anthony Mackie and Mark Waid, the comic book writer who introduced the idea of the first Black Captain America, discuss the controversy surround the superhero.",
    "story": [
      "Anthony Mackie taking on the role of Captain America, a fictional comic book character initially portrayed as a white man with blond hair and blue eyes, isn\u2019t groundbreaking to comic books fans.",
      "The idea of a Black man as the patriotic superhero was introduced in 1998 by writer Mark Waid in the comic book \u201cCaptain America: Sentinel of Liberty,\u201d where, according to Waid, Sam Wilson first \u201cpicked up the costume and took on the identity of Captain America.\u201d",
      "Over two decades after Sam Wilson became Cap in the comics, a Black Captain America in the movie adaptations has turned into a contentious topic.",
      "The issue of a Black Captain America in the Marvel Cinematic Universe first arose after Chris Evans, who portrayed Cap on-screen for eight years, passed the mantle on to Mackie\u2019s Falcon in 2019\u2019s \u201cAvengers: Endgame.\u201d Fans were upset with Evans\u2019 departure and some felt Mackie wasn\u2019t capable of taking on the superpowered role.",
      "Though some eventually warmed up to the idea after seeing him in the 2021 critically acclaimed Disney+ series, \u201cFalcon and the Winter Soldier,\u201d where Mackie\u2019s Falcon grapples with the complicated notion of what it means for a Black man to be Captain America, the vitriol against actor ramped back up during his press run for \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World.\u201d",
      "During a Q&A in January, fans threatened to boycott the film and Mackie because of his comments on what he thinks Captain America represents that some deemed unpatriotic.",
      "\u201cCaptain America represents a lot of different things, and I don\u2019t think the term \u2018America\u2019 should be one of those representations. It\u2019s about a man who keeps his word and who has honor, dignity, and integrity. Someone who is trustworthy and dependable. This is like an aspect of a dream coming true,\u201d the actor said at the time.",
      "Following the backlash, Mackie has since clarified his comments online and in interviews, saying he\u2019s a \u201cproud American,\u201d and that Captain America is \u201cimportant for kids of all races\u201d so they can have someone to look up to regardless of their race.",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com about some fans\u2019 mixed reaction following the first teaser of him as Cap, Mackie, 46, says he wasn\u2019t \u201caware\u201d that a Black Captain America had become so controversial.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s funny, because we all call ourselves comic book fans, right? We all call ourselves comic book nerds, right? So if the comic book says, Sam Wilson becomes Captain America, then Sam Wilson becomes Captain America,\u201d Mackie says pragmatically.",
      "Though Mackie says he \u201cdidn\u2019t have any hesitations\u201d taking on the role in the MCU, Waid \u2014 who introduced the idea of Falcon becoming the first Black Captain America in the comics \u2014 admits there was \u201ca little bit of resistance\u201d from Marvel when he pitched it in the '90s.",
      "\u201cNot because anybody disbelieved the message,\u201d Waid, 62, tells TODAY.com. \u201cNot because anybody at Marvel was on the wrong side of history here, but just because when you\u2019re dealing with a corporate character like that it\u2019s going to go through many creators hands over his 80 years of existence.\u201d",
      "We all call ourselves comic book fans, right? We all call ourselves comic book nerds, right? So if the comic book says, Sam Wilson becomes Captain America, then Sam Wilson becomes Captain America.\u201d",
      "Anthony mackie",
      "Captain America was first created in 1941 during World War II. Since then, an array of people have held the role in the comics, including women and people of color, like Sam Wilson.",
      "Waid explains that Marvel wanted him to be careful and not\u00a0\u201ctoo extreme\u201d since that could potentially \u201calienate\u201d a huge part of their audience. \u201cBecause that\u2019s where the money comes from,\u201d he explains.",
      "But Waid\u2019s goal wasn\u2019t just to make sure the comic\u2019s core readers were satisfied, it was also to authentically portray the Black experience. To do this, the comic book writer says he spoke to his real-life Black friends who made him see a different perspective of America, which included sentiments of \u201cracial hatred\u201d and \u201cbigotry.\u201d",
      "\u201c\u2018There is more of this going on than you realize \u2026 so just be mindful of that as you go into the story,\u2019\u201d he recalls them saying.",
      "Within Marvel, Waid says his story of Falcon taking on the mantle of Captain America \u201cwas very well received.\u201d But externally, he says there was \u201ca little bit of pushback\u201d from fandom and readers, with some saying, \u2018\u2018Well, this is not Captain America. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re trying to say.\u201d",
      "Looking back, Waid says the pushback by fans wasn\u2019t so severe that he recalls \u201creceiving any hate mail\u201d about it. But he suspects that if he had done this story today, \u201cpeople would be screaming DEI at us at the top of their lungs without knowing what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d",
      "Waid notes that over the last 10 to 15 years, \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot more trolling, a lot more blow back. A lot of organized fandom full of angry white guys who are not happy that they are being quote, unquote, eclipsed by people of color, which is bulls--t.\u201d",
      "If we had done this story today, people would be screaming DEI at us at the top of their lungs without knowing what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d",
      "Mark Waid, writer of \u00a0\u201cCaptain America: Sentinel of Liberty\u201d",
      "The tenured comic book writer says it comes as no surprise that some fans are upset and even threatening to boycott Marvel\u2019s TV shows and the movies, because \u201cthese are the same people who were up in arms about the comics.\u201d",
      "\u201cLuckily, they have been a small enough part of the audience where we didn\u2019t have to take them into account,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we lost tons of sales because these trolls were out there being actively, performatively angry about the replacement of Captain America by a Black man in a comic book. They weren\u2019t buying the comics anyway. They were just looking for something to be mad about.\u201d",
      "Waid\u2019s introduction of Sam Wilson (Falcon) as Captain America in the comic \u201cCaptain America: Sentinel of Liberty #9\u201d unfolds in a time of \u201cgreat racial divide\u201d in America.",
      "Steve Rogers (Captain America) is trying to disassociate himself from white supremacists (Sons of Serpents) who are co-opting his name and image because they believe that Cap represents their cause, Waid explains.",
      "\u201c\u2018He\u2019s a blonde white guy with a strong jaw. He\u2019s showing you that this is what America should be,\u2019\u201d he says of their sentiments toward Rogers \u2014 who, during his fight to stop them, appears to get killed. It\u2019s at this juncture that \u201cSam Wilson realizes that someone has to pick up the mantle, someone has to pick up the shield, and someone has to fight to clear the name of Captain America.\u201d",
      "While the film is not exactly like the comics, there are similarities. The film follows Falcon\u2019s fight to uncover a villainous plot against President Thaddeus Ross (Harrison Ford) while also helping to exonerate Isaiah Bradley (Carl Lumbly) \u2014 a war vet who is turned into a Super Soldier after undergoing human testings by the government \u2014 who was accused of being involved. Some fans have argued that Bradley is the first Black Captain America since he took the Super Solider serum like Cap. Mackie says Sam's sense of integrity and dedication to justice is what he leans into and tries to embody with his titular role.",
      "\u201cOne thing that I\u2019ve always wanted to portray with Sam, and make the focal point of that conversation, is the fact that he\u2019s the best part of all of us,\u201d Mackie tells TODAY.com. \u201cSam didn\u2019t take the (Super Soldier) serum. Sam isn\u2019t a Super Soldier. He\u2019s just a good human being, and I think that\u2019s why we all kind of are endeared to him and kind of appreciate him, because we can see the best of us in him.\u201d",
      "One thing that I\u2019ve always wanted to portray with Sam, and make the focal point of that conversation, is the fact that he\u2019s the best part of all of us.\"",
      "Anthony Mackie",
      "Since its first publication in March 1941, Waid says Captain America has had a simple, altruistic purpose: he represented the American dream and showed that it was attainable. But he says Cap\u2019s mission has \u201cchanged\u201d over the years.",
      "\u201cAmerica was the land of opportunity,\u201d Waid tells TODAY.com. \u201cAnd clearly it has not always been that way for some people \u2026 And I think that Captain America today stands for equality. He stands for making sure that anyone in this country has an opportunity at bettering themselves and has an opportunity to have the best life possible \u2014 if they\u2019re willing to put the work into it.\u201d",
      "And Anthony Mackie has put that work in with his over two decades in Hollywood and 10 years playing Sam Wilson. Still, even with his tenure, there will still be those who take issue with there being a Black Captain America.",
      "Mackie even gave a nod to the pressure of taking on Cap\u2019s mantle in the film. In an exchange with President Ross following the attack on his life, Mackie\u2019s Sam tells the president that he overwhelmingly understands what he\u2019s going through.",
      "\u201cI know what it\u2019s like to feel you have something to prove,\u201d he says.",
      "Later in the film, Mackie is seen grappling with his past decision to reject the Super Soldier serum and also the pressure that he\u2019s under if he fails his mission.",
      "\u201cIf I\u2019m not on point, I let everyone who wants a seat at that table down,\u201d he says to his First Lieutenant Joaquin Torres (Danny Ramirez), who takes on Sam's former mantle of Falcon. \u201cThat\u2019s pressure. It makes you feel that you\u2019re not enough.\u201d",
      "The \"Captain America\" comic book writer says there\u2019s always been room\u00a0for the character to change, evolve and represent something more inclusive.",
      "\u201cCaptain America can be an Asian man. Captain America can be a woman. Captain America could be anyone who stands for the ideals that Captain America stands for,\u201d Waid explains, noting that he hopes Cap\u2019s fight eventually \u201cgets easier.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs long as they\u2019re an American at heart and fight for the American way \u2026 the way we wish truly was the dream as opposed to what racism and bigotry has sort of poisoned that well.\u201d",
      "Mackie agrees, noting that his Captain America leads with two important things: \u201cCompassion and empathy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like today, we could all use a little compassion and empathy,\u201d he adds."

      "Before actor Monica Barbaro had the chance to meet Joan Baez \u2014 the iconic folk singer she portrayed in \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d \u2014 she received a special message from her.",
      "Barbaro, who was nominated for an Academy Award for her role as Baez in the film, tells TODAY.com that while she had texted with the singer before the release of the film, it was a voicemail from Baez, 84, that ended up making her emotional.",
      "\u201cWhen she saw it, she left me the most wonderful voicemail that I got on Golden Globes weekend, and fully just brought me to tears,\u201d Barbaro says. \u201cLike always, to hear her voice \u2014 had that effect on me. And then, and she said wonderful things about my performance, and about Timmy, and about Ed and the movie, and that was wonderful.\u201d",
      "Directed by James (Jim) Mangold, Barbaro stars alongside Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as Bob Dylan, Edward Norton as Pete Seeger and Elle Fanning as Sylvie Russo, in the critically-acclaimed biopic that centers on Dylan\u2019s early beginnings as an artist.",
      "\u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d scooped up eight Academy Award nominations, including best picture, since its release on Dec. 25. Barbaro says prior to Baez seeing the movie, she sent her a text that not only helped her prepare for the \u201ceventuality\u201d of the film\u2019s success, but also her first real encounter with the singer.",
      "\u201cShe was just really cool about it, like I could tell she wasn\u2019t going to tell me that she liked it, just to be nice or anything, you know \u2014she\u2019s not that kind of person,\u201d Barbaro says of their correspondence.",
      "On Feb. 8 \u2014 over a month after the film premiered in theaters \u2014 the pair got to meet in person for the first time at Baez\u2019s performance at a benefit concert in San Francisco.",
      "\u201cIt was just great to hug her and see her. I thought it would be overwhelming, but it felt kind of, familial, like it was really nice,\u201d Barbaro says. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ll see her again.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe was really present and lovely with me, and was like, \u2018When are you landing? What are you (doing) when is all of this over?\u2019\u201d Barbaro continues. \u201cI think she understands probably better than anyone, how much of a whirlwind moments like this can be.\u201d",
      "The 34-year-old actor adds it was \u201camazing\u201d to get to see Baez perform live, after learning how to play guitar and sing the performer\u2019s songs in the film.",
      "\u201cI obviously am very well acquainted with how talented she is, but I just didn\u2019t expect for her voice to be still, so smooth and powerful as it is in her 80s,\u201d Barbaro says. \u201cIt\u2019s like, absolutely incredible. And her stage presence \u2014 she\u2019s so funny, and she just made the crowd, I think, feel really seen.\u201d",
      "What Baez has said about Barbaro\u2019s performance in \u2018A Complete Unknown\u2019",
      "Baez first spoke publicly about \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d in an interview published in the Marin Independent Journal in Jan.",
      "\u201cI loved what she did in the film,\u201d Baez told the Journal about Barbaro\u2019s performance. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t think she was good at it, I probably wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed it in general. But she looked enough like me and she had my gestures down. You could tell who it was. She worked so hard. Kudos to her for taking the role on.\u201d",
      "Barbaro tells TODAY.com she appreciated Baez publicly speaking out about her performance, because she hasn\u2019t wanted to share what the singer has told her privately.",
      "\u201cI feel very protective of the things she says to me in private, and so it was just really generous of her to then have opened up to the press and said that because nobody has to do that,\u201d Barbaro says.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ve seen a lot of biopics and a lot of characters portrayed, and a lot of responses that are not so positive, or even with a good performance, sometimes people can feel really attached to how a story maybe got something wrong, and she just had a really wonderful way of giving this film over to us.\u201d",
      "In Baez\u2019s interview with the Journal, she also praised Chalamet\u2019s performance as Dylan in the movie (though she did say she remembered the real-life Dylan as a lot scruffier than Chalamet).",
      "\u201cI have to come back to that\u2019s how it was,\u201d Baez said. \u201cWhen he walked into the room, he took up all the oxygen. And so my part was always diminished in his presence. And in that sense the film is accurate.\u201d",
      "Those seemingly authentic moments between Barbaro\u2019s Baez and Chalamet\u2019s Dylan in the film came somewhat naturally to the actors.

      "\u201cI think we just deeply understood these people as best as we could, and then we therefore came up with something authentic,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd the way Jim chose to film it and edit it, I think was indicative of his understanding of their overall dynamic.\u201d",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Feb 2025 14:51:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Alex Brown talks about his breakup with Madison Errichiello on Season 8 of Love Is Blind, what happened with Mason and why they split.",
    "story": [
      "Alex Brown is planning to tune in to Season 8 of \u201cLove Is Blind,\u201d but he\u2019s admittedly nervous to watch the action unfold on the small screen after living it firsthand last year.",
      "\u201cI might be in bed just crying alone when I watch it. I don\u2019t know yet,\u201d the commercial real estate broker said while speaking to TODAY.com ahead of the premiere.",
      "It\u2019s understandable why the 29-year-old is cautiously awaiting his TV debut. After all, it\u2019s not every day that you watch yourself navigate a love triangle. But that\u2019s exactly what Brown encountered when he entered the \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d dating pods.",
      "Madison Errichiello, one of 32 Minneapolis singles on the latest season of \u201cLove Is Blind, was torn between Brown and another contestant, Mason Horacek.",
      "While drawn to Errichiello, Brown was also wary of an engagement given their experiences with conflict. Errichiello admitted that she had an avoidant attachment style and often \u201cdissociates\u201d when faced with a challenge. Brown, who said he was more anxiously attached, acknowledged Errichiello\u2019s approach was a \u201ctrigger\u201d for him since it reminded him of past relationships and \u201ccould lead to some issues.\u201d",
      "The two finally split up over Errichiello\u2019s reaction to what happened between her and Horacek. After first committing to her, he decided to pursue a connection with another woman, Meg Fink (who turned him down). Despite wanting to be with Brown, Errichiello was offended that Horacek was so quick to backtrack from his initial sentiment. Then, when she told Brown how she was feeling, he said he understood \u201cboth perspectives,\u201d which seemed to escalate Errichiello\u2019s annoyance.",
      "After she seemed to retreat emotionally, the topic of avoidance came up again and Brown expressed his concern that they had two very different communication styles. Ultimately, he decided to walk away from the relationship.",
      "Thanks to love triangles like Brown\u2019s, this season spent a particularly long time in the pod stage \u2014 six full episodes. At this point in the season, five couples are together. Two, like Brown and Errichiello, split in the pods.",
      "Below, Brown analyzes his drawn-out breakup with Errichiello, their love triangle and more.",
      "I went into that final date truly 50/50, not knowing if I was going to propose or end things. It was a really big moment when all that went down. At that point, I still had hope that I was going to propose in the next couple hours. It really shook both of us, I think, when we had that disagreement. It was definitely a tough moment for me.",
      "I think (Madison) and I were clearly on different pages in a couple different ways. I haven\u2019t seen the episodes yet, but what had been discussed several times is attachment styles.",
      "I think her and I are different attachment styles. I think it just is very apparent as the show goes on and as we progressed in the dates.",
      "I think she has different ways of dealing with conflict than I do, and again, that\u2019s totally fine. There\u2019s nothing right or wrong with either way, but I think we just realized that we are both on very different pages and that communication wasn\u2019t going to be easy.",
      "There just wasn\u2019t enough time at that point to figure out if that communication gap was going to be an issue or if we could overcome it or not. And I think it was just too much in the moment for us to move forward.",
      "I guess I try to stay along the same principles of finding someone that matches my attachment style or is as secure as possible. I\u2019ve worked so hard in so many years to build myself up to a point where I feel like I\u2019m in a secure attachment style. I know the effort that that took and I want to find someone that has also put in the effort.",
      "I think I just look for those signs that they\u2019re not gonna fight me or run away or all the things that I used to do and that people that I\u2019ve been with have done in the past. I just want to be in a healthy relationship as much as possible.",
      "I was confident in the decision. If we could go back and do things again, I think it would have unfolded the same way. I\u2019m glad that we got all of the issues out on the table the way we did so we could make that decision early on instead of moving forward and proposing and then going on the trip and then living together. I think it would have been a lot messier if that were to happen.",
      "I\u2019m always going to have empathy for others no matter what the situation is, so I\u2019m definitely glad that I stuck to my guns and had empathy. Maybe that wasn\u2019t the right move in the situation. Maybe it was. But I think from my perspective, it was the right move.",
      "I just honestly, sincerely felt bad for Mason because I saw him 10 minutes before that crying into my arms. Basically, he\u2019s sitting there heartbroken. And then it\u2019s hard to walk into the date (with Madison) and have someone just really talk negatively about him.",
      "So that it was hard for me and I just wanted to give him some of the benefit of the doubt while also trying to understand her perspective as well. Maybe I didn\u2019t do a good job. Maybe I did. I haven\u2019t seen the show yet, so I don\u2019t really remember. It\u2019s been a year now.",
      "I think my ideal partner would be someone who is very open-minded, someone who is adventurous, someone who\u2019s very kind and will stay by my side and be kind and be there for me and have some fun adventures together.",
      "I feel like I really understand how to get deeper with someone and to kind of forget about the appearances and the more surface level things. It allows me to get deeper with people and not really focus on those things anymore. So that\u2019s been a really big impact on my life. From friends to family, I\u2019ve been able to get a lot closer to people and feel more vulnerable."

      "As a California native and Los Angeles resident, \u201cThe Californians\u201d\u00a0sketches\u00a0are spot-on and hilarious. The way that the characters describe having to navigate the freeways, streets and traffic is something every person living in LA understands. Also, it\u2019s even funnier when Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig break character and laugh.",
      "\u2014 Liz Calvario",

The skits perfectly utilized Tracy Morgan's comedic skills of being able to be na\u00efve and sassy at the same time. I love how Brian Fellow always has beef with the animals because \u201cthat\u2019s crazy!\u201d",
      "\u2014 L.C.",
      "I love this sketch of exuberant interruptions. Kenan Thompson\u2019s energy is always turned up to 11 as Diondre Cole, the host of a BET talk show that always devolves into song. In this version, Robert De Niro gets hilariously annoyed at the \"rude\" interruptions; Robin Williams hardly says a word but says so much. Equally fun is the recurring cast, like Jason Sudeikis in a track suit. Watch out for that snare drum!",

Plus, it was a clear precursor to The Lonely Island\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m on a Boat\u201d with T-Pain, and what else can really be said about that song\u2019s impact on America at the time?",

It was 2015, and I came home from a night of babysitting to my parents absolutely losing it, for an at first undecipherable reason. My dad picks up the remote and rewinds the TV (again), and my mom explains that they\u2019re going to watch an \u201cSNL\u201d sketch for the\u00a0third\u00a0time in a row, just for me to see it, too. By the time Kate McKinnon said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I was dealing with the top brass,\u201d we had to pause to TV to make sure we didn\u2019t miss a line through all the cackling. And as Gosling was laughing out loud behind his hand \u2014\u00a0almost\u00a0missing his queue before getting an assist from Cecily Strong\u2014 tears were streaming down my face.

      "I've loved so many \"SNL\" sketches that choosing just one is like picking between my children. But it's my children that actually inspire my pick. Like sullen \"teens\" David Spade and Christina Applegate, my kids can relate to getting a total dress down on the couch and I can only wish that I'd had Chris Farley, aka motivational speaker, Matt Foley, to fill them with fear over eating a \"steady diet of government cheese\" and living in a van down by the river. Written by Bob Odenkirk, this genius sketch that singularly sums up \"SNL's\" comedy magic to a tee. An unhinged Farley, spitting, spouting, re-adjusting his too-tight belt and ad libbing his lines, Spade breaking character and hiding his laughter beneath his hand, all topped off by a completely unscripted set failure when Farley falls and breaks the coffee table \u2014 yet manages to finish the sketch without missing a beat. Whoops-a-daisy! If there's ever been a reason to steer clear of \"rollin' doobies,\" Matt Foley, is it. Thank you, \"SNL,\" thank you.",

It became a recurring sketch that hilariously tackled the headlines of the day, but this first appearance of Carvey\u2019s condescending Church Lady in particular signaled the dawn of a new era for \u201cSNL,\u201d with her famous lines \u201cSatan!\u201d and \u201cWell, isn\u2019t that special!\u201d entering the pop culture lexicon. Nearly four decades later, Carvey still plays the character when he stops by the show.",

      "You can choose many Phil Hartman sketches, but this one from Season 17 in 1991 is so ridiculous it merits citing. He plays a caveman who fell in ice, only to be thawed out centuries later and become a lawyer, simultaneously overwhelmed and taken in by the conveniences of the modern world. It\u2019s the type of ludicrousness that makes \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d what it is. \u201cYour world frightens and confuses me\u201d became one of the many lines that the late Hartman, who also aced impressions of Ed McMahon, Phil Donahue and Bill Clinton during his \u201cSNL\u201d tenure, perfectly delivered and highlights just how versatile and brilliant a performer he was.",
      "\u2014 D.W.",
      "\u201cSNL\u201d turned comedy into a kind of rock and roll, so it was only fitting that lovable, burned out rock fans Wayne and Garth welcomed Aerosmith to their little cable access show in what may be the quintessential \u201cWayne\u2019s World\u201d sketch, from Season 15 in 1990. \u201cWayne\u2019s World\u201d was a smash sketch that later became a hit movie. Getting Aerosmith to play along here (the bit where the band debates the future of communism is fantastic) made sense in much the same way it made people laugh. This sketch also gets bonus points for frequent host Tom Hanks playing a dedicated roadie.",
      "\u2014 D.W.",
      "This piece from Season 16 in 1990 was an instant classic. Patrick Swayze parlayed the moves he showed off a few years earlier in \u201cDirty Dancing\u201d by going toe-to-toe with Chris Farley as two men competing for one spot to be a Chippendales dancer. Swayze has the seductive moves and Farley is a slovenly mess, but we\u2019re to believe it\u2019s a dead heat as they perform. Swayze was the sex symbol, but it\u2019s Farley we can\u2019t stop watching. The sketch takes itself very seriously, which is what makes it even funnier \u2014 that and the fact that it\u2019s Farley at his physically comedic best.",

      "The \"Christimas Party\u201d skit featuring her character Sue was a running joke among my group of friends growing up, especially when it comes to the cheese ball!

      "In my opinion, the best \"Celebrity Jeopardy\" sketch of all time. This is Macdonald at his all-time wackiest, changing his name to \u201cTurd Fergeson\u201d and making Will Ferrell as Trebek call him the name for the entire episode, which catches on for future sketches. Hammond as Connery is also a staple of the series and a perfectly appropriate over-the-top impression of the actor. He insults Trebek the entire episode, writing, \u201cSuck it, Trebek!\u201d for his final Jeopardy answer. Ferrell\u2019s reactions and demeanor as Trebek when talking to the clueless celebrities are perfect.",

      "The late Chadwick Boseman\u2019s \u201cBlack Jeopardy!\u201d sketch will forever live on as one my favorite \"SNL\" moments. In the sketch, Boseman reprises his \"Black Panther\" role of King T\u2019Challa and, like the other contestants, responds to statements as it relates to their Black culture. One of the now viral clues in the \u201cBlack Jeopardy!\u201d category of \u201cWhite People,\u201d centered around a \u201cKaren\u201d bringing her potato salad to a Black person\u2019s cookout. Bosemen\u2019s humorous and culturally relatable response as T\u2019Challa immediately became a meme.

He agreed and continued to pursue Virginia, who had been reserved and skeptical during many of their conversations.",
      "In Episode 6, Devin wrote a sweet letter to Virginia expressing his feelings. \u201cVirginia, you are the most kind, loving and genuine person I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d he praised. \u201cI know that in your past relationships, they made you feel insecure and undervalued. But I promise to always make you feel valued, loved, and to make you feel like the queen that you are.\u201d",
      "At the end of his letter, he told Virginia he loved her and asked her to marry him. \u201cYes, I will,\u201d she softly replied. She later told the cameras through tears, \u201cI haven\u2019t felt like this ever. I just feel amazing. Today\u2019s a good day.\u201d",
      "Daniel and Taylor",
      "Daniel Hastings and Taylor Haag matched each other\u2019s energy from their first conversation. He joked about proposing a few minutes into their chat and she playfully went along. When she returned to gush with the girls, Taylor, a 32-year-old colonoscopy nurse, said she appreciated that Daniel, a 30-year-old sales account executive, repeatedly spoke about searching for the mother of his kids.",

      "David \u201cDave\u201d Bettenburg and Lauren O\u2019Brien were one of many Season 8 contestants who were involved in a love triangle. Dave, a 33-year-old medical device salesman, couldn\u2019t determine if he had stronger feelings for Lauren or Molly Mulaney. When Lauren, a 31-year-old education saleswoman, realized Dave was undecided, she revealed to him that she didn\u2019t have any other connections.",
      "Meanwhile, Molly anxiously waited for Dave to call it quits with Lauren and solely pursue her. But in Episode 5, Dave cried as he told Molly that he wanted to \u201csee things through\u201d with Lauren instead. Molly was hurt but said she knew if he didn\u2019t want her then it wasn\u2019t meant to be.",

He explained his beliefs before she revealed that she wasn\u2019t religious.",
      "\u201cThe main thing for me that\u2019s really tough about religion is my sister, Lisa. She\u2019s my best friend. She\u2019s gay,\u201d she explained. She asked if Ben would be comfortable around her sister and would go to Pride activities with them.",
      "\u201cYeah, no discomfort around that community at all,\u201d he replied. She felt confident in their connection, but when they met again in Episode 4, she had some more concerns. She mentioned Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency and the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of ignorant towards that stuff. Like, I didn\u2019t vote in the last election. As long as I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s not going to do much, so\u2026\u201d Ben said.

      "Sara replied, \u201cI think it\u2019s very valuable and important to think about those things.\u201d\u00a0 She later said she didn\u2019t like his responses to her questions. \u201cBasic human rights, equality, I need someone to be on the same page with me about that,\u201d she said.",
      "Ben assured her in Episode 5 that their values aligned. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to have any burden or any weight on your shoulder thinking that you have to teach me because I do have that motivation to grow into that and that internal feeling that we do have the same beliefs in these things,\u201d he said before proposing.",
      "\u201cI feel so at peace and accepted by you,\u201d she said after accepting his proposal. \u201cI honestly can\u2019t imagine being with anyone else.\u201d",

      "(Warning: Spoilers from Season 2, Episode 12 of \u201cFound.\u201d)",
      "In the latest episode of \u201cFound,\u201d fans finally receive an answer to one of the biggest questions that has stumped them since the show premiered: How did Gabi and Sir\u2019s twisted partnership begin?",
      "Season 2, Episode 12, out Feb. 13, flashes back to the moment Gabi, played by Shanola Hampton, and Sir, portrayed by Mark-Paul Gosselaar, came face to face about 20 years after he kidnapped her. Viewers see Gabi intend to kill Sir, hoping to end her years of suffering and fear, before he changes her mind. He pitches that the two collaborate on her M&A cases, allowing their toxic, unbreakable bond to continue.",
      "A majority of the episode, titled \"Missing While Misidentified,\" is set in the past while in the present, both Gabi and Sir are arrested and questioned separately by the police.",
      "\u201cThis is my favorite episode that I\u2019ve ever shot on the show,\u201d Hampton tells TODAY.com in an interview.",
      "She adds, \u201cTo see that rage and that passion of why she did what she did, it was just so fun to do and I was so excited to play it.\u201d",
      "Gosselaar says the episode also digs deeper into the psychology behind Sir\u2019s attachment to Gabi.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a question that people have asked about the first season. Like, \u2018Was he able to escape? How did he escape? Did he want to escape?\u2019 So I think we get a glimpse of that in Episode 212,\u201d he shares.",
      "Below, the two stars unpack all the secrets that were revealed in Season 2, Episode 12 in a joint interview with TODAY.com \u2014 and why Sir and Gabi's relationship is a dynamic \"we have not seen play out on television before.\"",
      "Gosselaar: It\u2019s been lovely. This has been just a great season. The fact that I don\u2019t have to be in the same room as you for so many hours.",
      "Hampton: That\u2019s what I was going to say, too. You know how you go on \"Love Is Blind\" and you want to switch your answer to \"no\" after they say \"No\" (at the altar)?",
      "Gosselaar: Honestly, I do enjoy the scenes that Sir has with Gabrielle in Episode 212 \u2014 we go back to the origin. It\u2019s fun to watch the dynamic between the two characters. And there\u2019s just so much going on, right? So it\u2019s fun to shoot and it\u2019s fun to watch.",
      "Hampton: I make no secret that I get to work with wonderful actors on this show. But my scenes with Mark-Paul, they lift me. And when he\u2019s there and he\u2019s present, on a personal level, it lifts me. So, not having as much interaction this season was really a bit of a shock to my system, because I got so used to it Season 1. I relied on those days as an escape day for me, and so not having that was quite an adjustment. Truthfully, that\u2019s how I feel about it. And hopefully in Season 3 we will be back on the screen together a lot!",
      "Gosselaar: How did it happen? I think that\u2019s a big question of the first season. How did she abduct Sir? Why is he in her basement? Somebody had to help. Who helped her? All those questions get answered. And for us, as fans of our show, that was fun to read and fun to do. We always end on a cliffhanger. That\u2019s by design. The next script for us, we just can\u2019t wait to get into it. So we\u2019re sort of mirroring what the audience is going through, just in a different way.",
      "Hampton: This is my favorite episode that I\u2019ve ever shot on the show. To be able to answer some of the questions from Season 1 in this episode, to see the mindset, to play the dynamics and the nuances of dealing with Margaret (Kelli Williams) while making this choice, and to see Dhan\u2019s (Karan Oberoi) part in it. All of these things where it just was so juicy to me. To see that rage and that passion of why she did what she did, it was just so fun to do and I was so excited to play it. I like seeing Gabi here, because I think the audience gets to really go on the ride that she went through in a real way.",
      "Hampton: I think it\u2019s telling to the psychological damage that one does to the victim and how hard it is to break the cycle. Our central theme is not to judge people\u2019s healing process. People are so quick to say, \"Just block them, girl! Don\u2019t talk to him anymore!\" Everybody has advice until they\u2019re there. Now, she can search why and really heal so that when she does press block, if that time ever comes, it\u2019s out of a place of healing. That was really a telling moment, I think, for Gabi, for me as the actor playing Gabi, and for the audience to see, \"Oh, this goes way deeper than we even think.\"",
      "Gosselaar: I just think it reinforced that a lot of the time that Sir is there by choice. That\u2019s a question that people have asked about the first season. Like, \"Was he able to escape? How did he escape? Did he want to escape?\" So I think we get a glimpse of that in Episode 212.",
      "Hampton: Sick. It\u2019s an obsession of sorts. There\u2019s no real definition. We\u2019ve not really seen this dynamic play out on television before. So to have it not be a sexual chemistry or him wanting to marry her, wifey her up \u2014 you just see him wanting a life with her. So it\u2019s weird.",
      "Gosselaar: There\u2019s so many things. We don\u2019t choose family, so I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s why he uses that word. That even years can go by and because you have the bond of family, it\u2019s an unbreakable bond. So I think he\u2019s very particular in the words that he chooses. But \"family\" is deep and it\u2019s really dark. I guess that\u2019s what people come to our show for.",
      "Hampton: Well, it shows that it\u2019s going to be a disconnect. This means a lot less time of them being in the same room. Gabi (is) putting a line in the sand, saying, \"I\u2019m not giving into his manipulation.\" It sets up the next several episodes of what the dynamic is going to be with Sir and Gabi.",
      "Gosselaar: We\u2019re just going to see moments where the lack of control is going to eat at him. You\u2019re just going to see him do everything in his power to connect.",
      "Gosselaar: We have a great group of actors, very talented. There\u2019s a few stinkers. Actually, just one. But I won\u2019t name names, because that wouldn\u2019t be fair to the other actors. We are a very ambitious show. We\u2019ve said this before: we have 44 minutes to tell a story, and this story is just packed with plot and characters. It was very difficult to get this all on screen. We did, and we have just an unbelievable crew that works their butt off every single day of our show for the nine months that we\u2019re filming. So my hat goes off to them. We have great writers and everyone working behind us and all the actors. It is truly a collaboration that couldn\u2019t be done with one of the parts missing. Thankfully we don\u2019t have any parts missing, and it just makes for a great show. I hope we can continue with Season 3. Maybe I\u2019ll just have to have a conversation with that actor that was slowing things down.",
      "Hampton: That actor says that she has in her contract not to speak to her or look her in the eyes, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. (laughs)",
      "Hampton: It\u2019s awful. So what people don\u2019t understand is that Mark-Paul is the lead on this show, but he doesn\u2019t work. So it\u2019s one day a week, which means I only have to stomach him one day. When he\u2019s directing, he\u2019s gotta prep. His presence is there. He has to direct all eight days. You know what eight days is like being with Mark-Paul? No, it was amazing.",
      "Gosselaar: Actually, I was there for a lot longer. We went through a hurricane together. I was there for three weekends. I was like, \"What is going on here? I\u2019ve never worked so hard in my life!\"",
      "Hampton: What I\u2019ll say about Mark-Paul as a director, and this is for future projects as well, what you\u2019re going to get is someone who is intellectually prepared, technically prepared, but also able to be really chill when things need to change. He has so much experience on set. He is a leader of not only the cast but the crew. He commands trust on day one, and he\u2019s a joy. I mean, he is a stick in the mud. And yes, you would think he\u2019s boring and a jerk. But he\u2019s actually super funny, and people enjoy being around him. I\u2019m not one of those people. He is one of the five directors that I would work with for the rest of my career and be happy.",
      "Hampton: I think it\u2019s that they thought they were just going to get another procedural, and then there was a man in the basement. You start the ride and you cannot get off, because you have to see what\u2019s going to happen with these two characters while serving the communities who are underserved. So I think that\u2019s where the connection has happened.",
      "Gosselaar: I agree. I like how you started that off. Because it\u2019s like the audience thought they were just going to get Shanola, and then they got Mark-Paul Gosselaar.",
      "Hampton: (laughs) Not what I said, Sir!",
      "Gosselaar: Pretty much. You said the procedural and then you were, like, \"Then the guy in the basement.\" I totally agree with that.",
      "Hampton: I mean, how many Critics Choice nominations did you get before working with me? You\u2019re welcome.",
      "Gosselaar: Same as you. (laughs)",

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday that it would be \u201cvery, very, very difficult\u201d for Ukraine to survive without U.S. military support, both now as it tries to repel Russia's invasion and in the future after the war ends.",
      "\"Probably it will be very, very, very difficult. And of course, in all the difficult situations, you have a chance,\" Zelenskyy told NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. \"But we will have low chance, low chance, to survive without support of the United States. I think it\u2019s very important, critical.\"",
      "\"I don\u2019t want to think about\" fighting against Russia without American support, Zelenskyy told \"Meet the Press\" moderator Kristen Welker.",
      "\"I don\u2019t want to think that we will not be strategic partners,\" he added.",
      "The Ukrainian president also spoke about his concern that Ukraine would be vulnerable to another major attack by Russia in the future if the U.S. does not continue providing military support.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to come to the negotiating table not to end the war but to get a ceasefire deal that would lift certain international sanctions on Russia and would allow its military to regroup.",
      "\"This is really what he wants. He wants pause, prepare, train, take off some sanctions, because of ceasefire and et cetera,\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "Zelenskyy's comments came during a fractious summit in Germany, where Vice President JD Vance\u00a0criticized European leaders on a host of issues unrelated to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, including failing to stand up for \u201cvalues shared with the United States of America.\u201d",
      "German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier presented his own unvarnished view in response, saying that the Trump administration had \u201cno regard for established rules, partnership and grown trust.\u201d",
      "The widening gulf between Europe and the United States comes at an especially delicate time for Zelenskyy and an exhausted and depleted Ukraine. While the war appears to have descended into a quagmire, Russian forces have been making slow if painful progress. Russia controls some 20% of the country, which is in dire need of weapons and soldiers.",
      "Ukraine and its supporters always knew that the incoming White House would take a vastly different tack from former President Joe Biden, who backed Ukrainian victory while sometimes not giving Kyiv all the weapons it wanted in its fight against Russia.",
      "But the words and actions of Trump and his surrogates this week have stunned and even appalled many in Europe, where it\u2019s widely held that it is not in the West's interest to not hand Russia a win in Ukraine.",
      "Vance's speech felt like he was trying \"to pick a fight with us, and we don\u2019t want to a pick a fight with our friends,\" E.U. foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said at the Munich summit.",
      "But officials and experts fear Trump risks doing just that, with the president this week appearing to prioritize Putin over Zelenskyy or European allies in any potential peace talks. Trump's administration also floated major concessions to Putin \u2014 including giveaways on Ukrainian territory and dismissing any hope that it may join NATO.",
      "Zelenskyy has kept a brave face, but has little choice to do otherwise, some observers say. He recently told The Economist that he did not believe the U.S. had a \"ready plan\" for peace, while remaining adamant he would reject any agreement negotiated between Washington and Moscow without his involvement.",
      "Trump \"is a strong man,\" the Ukrainian leader said Friday during a panel discussion at the conference with U.S. senators. \"And if he will choose our side, and if he will not be in the middle, I think he will pressure and he will push Putin to stop the war. He can do it.\"",
      "Though Trump signaled little for Ukraine in return, Vance offered some succor to Kyiv and its European neighbors, suggesting in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that Moscow could face sanctions and other penalties.",
      "\u201cThere are economic tools of leverage, there are of course military tools of leverage,\u201d Vance told the newspaper. \u201cThere are any number of formulations, of configurations, but we do care about Ukraine having sovereign independence.\u201d",
      "Europe is not just worried about Ukraine but fears what Putin might do next if he\u2019s seen to be rewarded after his invasion there. European intelligence agencies say Russia could attack a NATO ally in the next five years if it believes the alliance has been weakened \u2014 as Trump is often accused of doing.",
      "Russia\u2019s three-year-old invasion is the bloodiest European conflict since World War II, reviving scenes of trench warfare and tank battles that some scholars believed were consigned to history. As many as 1 million people have died, according to NATO estimates, including hundreds of thousands of both Ukrainian and Russian soldiers.",
      "The alliance believes an average of 10,000 people have been killed or injured every week in the frigid, cratered fields of eastern Ukraine."

      "With homes vandalized, synagogues on fire and residents on edge, Australia is grappling with a surge in antisemitic attacks that has prompted dozens of arrests across the country in what its leaders say is a \u201cnational crisis.\u201d",
      "Australian lawmakers and experts say there has been a rise in both antisemitic and Islamophobic incidents since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Between the start of the war and September 2024, there were more than 2,000 antisemitic incidents in Australia, three times the figure for the same period a year earlier, according to a report in December by the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the Australian affiliate of the World Jewish Congress.",
      "Over the past 16 months, Jewish Australians have faced \u201can unprecedented rise in antisemitism across the country,\u201d according to a parliamentary inquiry report tabled Wednesday.",
      "Homes, cars and schools have been set on fire or spray-painted with anti-Israel messages, and there have been arson attacks against a synagogue in Melbourne and a child care center in Sydney. Last month, police said they had disrupted a potential antisemitic attack after they discovered a caravan containing explosives in a Sydney suburb.",
      "This week, two nurses in a Sydney hospital were suspended for saying they would kill Jewish patients or refuse to treat them in a video chat with a TikTok user who told them he was from Israel.",
      "The Australian government\u2019s response to the antisemitic incidents has been criticized by Jewish groups as well as Israel.",
      "\u201cThe epidemic of antisemitism is spreading in Australia almost unchecked,\u201d Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa\u2019ar said on the social media platform X last month. \u201cWe expect the Australian government to do more to stop this disease!\u201d",
      "Last week, Australian lawmakers almost unanimously passed tough hate crime laws that include mandatory jail time for giving a Nazi salute in public.",
      "\u201cWe want people who are engaged in antisemitic activities to be caught, to be charged and to be put in the clink,\u201d Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters.",
      "Opposition leader Peter Dutton agreed. \u201cThis is a time of national crisis,\u201d he said.",
      "The laws have been welcomed by Jewish communities.",
      "\u201cPrison sentences and fines are called for if there is to be any hope of stamping out this hateful behavior,\u201d the Executive Council of Australian Jewry said in a statement last week. A home formerly owned by the group\u2019s co-chief executive was among those targeted.",
      "The attacks have been concentrated in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia\u2019s most populous cities and home to 85% of the country\u2019s Jewish population.",
      "Most of them have been \u201csmall-scale, low-technology attacks,\u201d said Julian Droogan, head of the Department of Security Studies at Macquarie University in Sydney.",
      "An exception was the trailer laden with explosives, which Droogan said \u201cwas quite remarkable and almost without precedent in recent years.\u201d",
      "While police have arrested dozens of Australians in connection with the arson, they have also said they are investigating whether the attacks could be part of a large-scale concerted effort by foreign actors paying criminals for hire.",
      "\u201cSo part of our inquiries include: Who is paying those criminals, where those people are, whether they are in Australia or offshore, and what their motivation is,\u201d Australia Federal Police Commissioner Reece Kershaw said last month.",
      "Local police are enhancing their efforts as well. This month, police in New South Wales, the Australian state that includes Sydney, said they had doubled to 40 the number of investigators on a task force formed to investigate antisemitic crimes and patrol schools and places of worship.",
      "\u201cChildren shouldn\u2019t feel scared to go to school, people shouldn\u2019t feel afraid to go to prayer or practice their religion,\u201d Commissioner Karen Webb said in a statement.",
      "The Israel-Hamas war and protests around it have been a sensitive issue in Australia, where some rallies have devolved into clashes between protesters and police officers.",
      "In October, police in New South Wales cited security risks and policing costs in trying to ban a pro-Palestinian rally marking the one-year anniversary of the start of the war, which has killed about 1,200 people in Israel and more than 46,000 people in the Gaza Strip.",
      "\u201cWe often look at Australia as geographically detached, and it is. But we forget to mention that the rest of the world is represented within Australia in microcosm,\u201d Droogan said. \u201cSo conflicts and disputes in the world regularly manifest in the Australian community.\u201d",
      "The tensions have extended to Australian schools, with multiple universities urging pro-Palestinian protesters to shut down encampments similar to those set up on campuses in the United States.",
      "There have been increased reports at universities of antisemitic graffiti, protests and chants, according to the parliamentary inquiry report, which urged universities to adjust their definition of antisemitism to more closely align with one that Palestinians and some civil rights groups say mutes criticism of Israel.",
      "Some Jewish groups say that in an attempt to address growing antisemitism, lawmakers and university campuses have instead politicized the issue and worsened prejudice against Palestinians and other groups.",
      "\u201cTo address antisemitism on campus, we must also address the racism faced by other racialized groups, including First Nations, Palestinian, Muslim, Arab, and Asian staff and students,\u201d Sarah Schwartz, executive officer of the Jewish Council of Australia, said in a statement Friday."

    "story": [
      "HASAKAH, Syria \u2014 In a network of prisons and detention camps across northeastern Syria, the Islamic State militant group has an army in waiting, and fanatical support for its brutal regime lives on.",
      "For now the prisons and camps are guarded by the American-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led fighting force that battled alongside the U.S. military to destroy ISIS\u2019 so-called caliphate.",
      "The Islamist group\u2019s radical ideology was never fully defeated, and after the ouster of longtime Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad late last year, as well as the arrival of a new administration in Washington, some are fearful that ISIS could be unleashed on the world once again.",
      "'Army in detention'",
      "In northern Syria, around 10,000 alleged ISIS fighters are locked away in 28 jails, the largest of which is Al Sina Prison on the edge of the small city of Hasakah.",
      "Crowded in the drab, concrete prison are thousands of men, many of them captured on the battlefield during ISIS\u2019 last stand in 2019, who sit or lie around in tattered brown jailhouse uniforms, dozens in each cell.",
      "Among them is Ibrahim, a Moroccan national who admitted in an interview with NBC News late last month that he was an ISIS fighter but insisted that he was no longer a threat.",
      "\u201cIf I were dangerous, I would not have surrendered myself,\u201d said Ibrahim, who declined to give his last name. \u201cI just want to go back to my county.\u201d",
      "Imprisoned for six years, he is one of the many foreign detainees whose home countries have failed to repatriate them.",
      "For the SDF commander, Gen. Mazloum Abdi, these prisoners are among the most dangerous. \u201cThey are hard-liners,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have massive numbers in our prisons, and this constitutes an ongoing threat.\u201d",
      "That threat was brought sharply into focus just over three years ago when ISIS launched a large attack on Al Sina Prison, killing dozens of guards and freeing hundreds of prisoners. Battles raged around the prison for over a week until they were eventually quelled with the help of the U.S. military.",
      "\u201cWe have intelligence that ISIS is planning to attack the prisons again, because the prisoners are considered to be a primary force for them,\u201d Abdi said. \u201cIf they find a way out, ISIS will be able to reorganize and reconstitute.\u201d",
      "Those concerns were repeatedly echoed by the U.S. military, which said in a statement last month that the prison population was \u201ca literal and figurative \u2018ISIS Army\u2019 in detention.\u201d",
      "'One of the most dangerous camps in the world'",
      "On a barren stretch of desert roadway, just 26 miles east of Hasakah, is the sprawling Al Hol Camp \u2014 home to around 40,000 people, 93% of whom are women and children, according to the most recent figures from the United Nations, published last February.",
      "Many of them are the families of ISIS fighters and SDF officials said the camp was considered a breeding ground for the next generation of militants.",
      "\u201cA mindset of radicalism is instilled in the residents,\u201d said Jihan Hanan, Al Hol\u2019s director. \u201cThey are only becoming more extreme.\u201d",
      "With limited resources, she said staff could guard only the perimeter, meaning violence was rife inside what she called \u201cone of the most dangerous camps in the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere have been murders inside, and some are armed with weapons,\u201d she said, adding that there were regular escape attempts.",
      "Inside the camp, in a section dubbed The Annex, the wives of foreign ISIS fighters and their children are held, around 6,000 people from 51 countries. Many of their governments have shown little or no interest in repatriating them in the six or so years they have languished in the camp.",
      "Considered by the SDF to hold the most extreme residents in the whole camp, The Annex is fenced off from the rest of the facility, with guard posts standing at the exit.",
      "Inside, wild dogs pick through piles of garbage, near trash-strewn muddy pathways and open sewers.",
      "Women gather together, all fully covered in the Islamic niqab, as hundreds of young children from strikingly diverse ethnic backgrounds wander through the squalor. There is little electricity or running water, and their patchwork plastic tents offer meager protection against Syria\u2019s winter chill.",
      "In another part of The Annex kids chant \u201cAllahu Akbar,\u201d Arabic for \u201cGod is great,\u201d while raising a single finger in the air, a trademark of ISIS. After hurling vulgar insults and threatening violence, they start to throw stones."

    "summary": "President Donald Trump\u2019s 90-day freeze on all foreign aid could not have come at a worse time for Sudan, which is facing famine amid it's 2-year civil war.",
    "story": [
      "For a country ravaged by two years of brutal civil war and with over 30 million people \u2014 or more than half of the population \u2014 in need of humanitarian assistance, President Donald Trump\u2019s 90-day freeze on all foreign aid could not have come at a worse time for Sudan.",
      "As battles rage in the North African country, a network of communal kitchens has had to immediately stop most of its operations due to a lack of funding, about 75% of which came from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), according to their organizers.",
      "Part of Sudan\u2019s Emergency Response Rooms (ERRs) \u2014\u00a0a civilian-led, grassroots effort to provide humanitarian support \u2014 the kitchens have been able to provide food, medicine and other basic supplies to people in parts of the country unreachable by aid agencies.",
      "Without the American funding \u201ca lot of people will die because of hunger,\u201d Abuzar Osman Suliman, the coordinator of the ERRs in Sudan\u2019s western Darfur region, told NBC News on Friday.",
      "Suliman, who said it cost $10,000 for a single kitchen in Darfur to feed 250 families for two weeks, gave a 10 to 20 day window for people to start dying.",
      "Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 freezing foreign assistance, forcing American-funded aid and development programs worldwide to shut down and lay off staff.\u00a0Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he had sought to mitigate the damage by issuing a waiver to exempt emergency food aid and \u201clife-saving\u201d programs, but USAID officials and aid groups say neither funding nor staffing have been reinstated in order to allow even the most essential programs to start working again.",
      "In Sudan, Suliman said all 40 of ERRs\u2019 community kitchens had to close in Darfur\u2019s Zamzam camp, where more than 1 million displaced people have sought refuge from the conflict between the country\u2019s two main warring powers \u2014 the Sudanese Armed Forces controlled by the country\u2019s top commander and de facto ruler, Gen. Abdel Fattah Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia, led by his former deputy, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo.",
      "Once allies, both men were part of the military establishment that seized power following the collapse of the Western-backed government of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok in 2021. But although they agreed to rule together, their alliance spectacularly broke down over how to manage the transition to a civilian government. With neither willing to cede power, war broke out in April 2023.",
      "Because of intense fighting and an ongoing RSF siege in the surrounding area, U.N. agencies have been unable to get substantial amounts of food relief to the Zamzam camp and a famine was declared in the camps in August, according to an analysis by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), an international system that sets a scale used by the United Nations and governments.\u00a0So people are now facing the choice between staying in the camp to die from hunger, or risk their lives by moving through Darfur areas besieged by the RSF, Suliman said.",
      "Famine has since spread to four other areas of Sudan, according to the IPC, and is expected to deepen and spread in coming months due to the war and impeded access to humanitarian assistance.",
      "In Sudan\u2019s capital, Khartoum, intense block-by-block fighting has made aid delivery almost impossible.\u00a0The World Food Program said it was only able to deliver its first shipment in December, 20 months after the conflict erupted, and even then, it said it had to rely on the ERRs for distribution.",
      "Across Khartoum, the ERRs were operating 742 kitchens and serving around 816,000 people before Trump's executive order, but now 80% of those kitchens have closed, according to Hajooj Kuka, an external communications officer for the Emergency Response Rooms.",
      "In a country riven by ethnic and political divisions, the ERRs have espoused neutrality and solidarity, allowing them to operate in areas controlled by SAF as well as the RSF, leveraging local know-how to navigate hostile terrain.",
      "The kitchens are organized locally and entirely volunteer-led, Kuka said, adding the whole ERR system was run by housewives, doctors, engineers, electricians \u2014 \u201cjust everybody.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis minute, I\u2019m trying to save the lives of the people in the district and the volunteers,\u201d he said in an interview Friday. \u201cI\u2019m just, like, going crazy trying to get any money.\u201d",
      "Without immediate funding, famine could take hold in the city, he added.",
      "Because USAID was often distributing money through other nongovernmental organizations working in Sudan, Kuka said the ERR organizers weren\u2019t always aware of how crucial USAID was to their funding, until the money was taken away.",
      "On Friday, Kuka said he found out that a $50,000 grant he expected from the Baltimore-based Catholic Relief Services (CRS) had been suddenly canceled because of the U.S. freeze.",
      "The humanitarian agency told NBC News they could not comment on the grant cancellation.",
      "CRS, which has about 5,000 employees, told staffers last week to expect layoffs because of the administration\u2019s cuts to their foreign aid grants, according to Reuters. The organization has a $1.5 billion budget, about half of it funded by USAID.",
      "Across Sudan, the cost of operating the kitchens was around $20 million a year, the ERR communications officer said. But the localized ad-hoc nature of the work is also what made them so vulnerable to U.S. funding cuts, Kuka added.",
      "While U.N. agencies may have several months of supplies in the pipeline, the ERRs often relied on purchasing goods directly from local markets. So when the cash flow was cut off, the kitchens could no longer buy and cook food.Andrea Tracy, a former USAID official and country representative in Sudan, said the exemption issued by Rubio was \u201cvery complicated, nobody really knows how it works.\u201d",
      "Tracy, who is currently vice president of Proximity 2 Humanity, a nonprofit working to shore up funding for Sudan\u2019s ERRs, added that some agencies might be big enough to continue operations, relying on a future reimbursement if an exemption is granted, but a lot of smaller organizations can\u2019t do that.",
      "On Friday, a federal judge paused an order putting USAID staff on administrative leave, but Tracy said it is still not clear to what capacity the agency will be able to operate.",
      "\u201cIn theory they have a week where they\u2019re able to work again \u2014access to emails, etc. \u2014 but what they could do before this was heavily curtailed, so unclear as to how much they can do, like make payments.\u201d",
      "Kuka said he is also appealing to any other institutional donors to fill in the funding gaps, using what little they have left to support emergency assistance programs.",
      "\u201cAfter a month, it will be completely done,\u201d he said."

      "Associated Press journalists witnessed scores of residents cheering on the M23 rebels in central Bukavu on Sunday morning as they walked and drove around the city center after a dayslong march from the region\u2019s major city of Goma 63 miles away, which they captured late last month. Several parts of the city, however, remained deserted with residents indoors.",
      "The M23 rebels are the most prominent of more than 100 armed groups vying for control of Congo\u2019s mineral-rich east, and are supported by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to the U.N.",
      "It was not clear if the rebels had taken decisive control of the city of about 1.3 million people. Their presence in central Bukavu is an unprecedented expansion of the rebels\u2019 reach in\u00a0their yearslong fighting with Congolese forces. Unlike in 2012 when they only seized Goma in the fighting connected to ethnic tension, analysts have said the rebels this time are eyeing political power.",
      "Many Congolese soldiers were seen on Saturday fleeing the rebels\u2019 advance into Bukavu alongside thousands of civilians amid widespread looting and panic.",
      "Congo\u2019s President Felix Tshisekedi held a security meeting in the faraway capital of Kinshasa, where officials noted that Bukavu was \u201cbriefly\u201d invaded by M23 but remains under the control of the Congolese army and allies from local militia, the presidency said on X. There were no signs of fighting or of Congolese forces in most parts of Bukavu on Sunday.",
      "Tshisekedi has warned of the risk of a regional expansion of the conflict. Congo\u2019s forces are being supported in Bukavu by troops from Burundi and in Goma by troops from South Africa.",
      "Burundi\u2019s president, Evariste Ndayishimiye, appeared to suggest his country will not retaliate in the fighting. In a post on X he said that \u201cthose people who were ready to get profit of the armed attack of Rwanda to Burundi will not see this.\u201d",
      "The Congo River Alliance, a coalition of rebel groups that includes M23, said it was committed to \u201cdefending the people of Bukavu\u201d in a Saturday statement that did not acknowledge their presence in the city. \u201cWe call on the population to remain in control of their city and not give in to panic,\u201d Lawrence Kanyuka, the alliance\u2019s spokesperson, said in a statement.",
      "The fighting in Congo\u00a0has connections with a decadeslong ethnic conflict. M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled to Congo after the genocide and founded the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda militia group. Rwanda says the group is \u201cfully integrated\u201d into the Congolese military, which denies the charges."

      "Panda craze has once again gripped Hong Kong as residents compete to name the territory\u2019s\u00a0first locally-born giant panda cubs\u00a0who just turned six months old.",
      "The competition to name the twin cubs, born Aug. 15, launched Saturday following a celebratory ceremony attended by Hong Kong leader John Lee and other officials at Ocean Park, the theme park that houses the twins, their parents and two other\u00a0giant pandas that arrived from mainland China\u00a0last year. Residents can submit their suggestions via the park\u2019s website.",
      "Lee said the southern Chinese city now has the largest number of pandas in captivity outside of mainland China, and the cubs\u2019 names would be announced in the first half of this year.",
      "The pair, currently identified as the \u201cElder Sister\u201d and the \u201cLittle Brother,\u201d will make their public debut on Sunday and meet visitors for five hours daily. Those who want to enjoy time with the cubs outside regular visiting hours, before the park opens, can pay 1,500 Hong Kong dollars (about $190).",
      "During a media preview session on Saturday, the male cub laid on a swing playing with a tree stick before a carer placed him on a slide. The female cub explored the enclosure before climbing onto a tree.",
      "The panda carers said the female cub seemed more active than her male twin. She loves climbing the tree inside the enclosure and resting there while her brother likes to wander around and play with the plants. The male cub has been marked with two purple food-coloring spots on its back to distinguish it from his sister.",
      "The birth of the baby pandas last year made their mother Ying Ying the world\u2019s oldest first-time panda mom.",
      "Their popularity on social media also raised hopes for the city\u2019s tourism boost. Officials have encouraged businesses to capitalize on the panda craze to seize opportunities in what some lawmakers have\u00a0dubbed the \u201cpanda economy.\u201d",
      "Ocean Park\u2019s chairman Paulo Pong told reporters on Saturday that the park already saw income increases over the Christmas period and Lunar New Year holiday, alongside an uptake in overseas tourists, after the newly arrived pandas from mainland China\u00a0started to greet the public.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re turning the page and we believe the pandas are definitely helping the income of the park,\u201d he said.",
      "But\u00a0caring for pandas in captivity is expensive. Ocean Park recorded a deficit of 71.6 million Hong Kong dollars ($9.2 million) last financial year, and in 2020 required a government relief fund to stay afloat. Observers are watching if taking care of six pandas will add to its burden or give it a chance to revive its business.",
      "Pong said raising pandas was about animal conservation and education, instead of \u201cjust a money exercise.\u201d",
      "Pandas are considered China\u2019s unofficial national mascot. The country\u2019s giant panda loan program with overseas zoos has long been seen as a tool of Beijing\u2019s soft-power diplomacy."

      "Aerial bombs and cluster munitions make up a large portion of the unexploded ordnance in both countries. During the Vietnam War, the U.S. is estimated to have dropped 500,000 tons of bombs on Cambodia and more than 2 million tons on Laos.",
      "Since the end of the war in 1975, Vietnam has recorded more than 100,00 casualties from unexploded remnants, including nearly 40,000 people killed. In Laos, there have been an estimated 22,000 victims of unexploded bombs, almost half of whom died.",
      "In Cambodia, landmines and unexploded ordnance killed nearly 20,000 people and injured more than 45,000 others from 1979 to 2024. Last month, two deminers with the government-run Cambodian Mine Action Centre\u00a0 were killed by an anti-tank mine near the Thai-Cambodia border.",
      "American aid for mine action in Cambodia has mostly come through the State Department\u2019s Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement, which declined to comment about the funding freeze. The U.S. embassies in Cambodia and Laos referred requests for comment to the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Global Public Affairs.",
      "\u201cWe are reviewing all foreign assistance funds to ensure they are aligned with American interests. National security is and will remain a top priority,\u201d said a State Department spokesperson, who added that the 90-day review period was \u201cput in place for us to align our ongoing work\u201d with the Trump administration\u2019s America First agenda.",
      "There was \u201ctotal shock\u201d in Cambodia when the U.S. announced the funding freeze and the\u00a0 administration moved to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, said Nhean Phoung Maly, the founder and director of the women\u2019s empowerment group Rachna Satrei.",
      "In Siem Reap alone, the hobbling of USAID has affected nearly a dozen nongovernmental organizations that provide HIV treatment, tuberculosis screening and early education, said Nhean, who coordinates a network of more than 300 organizations in the province.",
      "Many officials in Cambodia are reluctant to criticize the U.S. aid freeze for fear that it will be the nail in the coffin for future aid. Nhean is not one of them.",
      "\u201cKilling funding,\u201d she said, is like \u201ckilling people indirectly.\u201d",
      "An unfinished job",
      "The American aid vacuum can\u2019t be filled by any one nation, said Yoshinara Asada, an adviser with the Japan International Cooperation Agency who works within the Cambodian Mine Action Center.",
      "\u201cWe need a joint effort to tackle this issue,\u201d said Asada, who added that \u201csudden 180-degree policy changes can bring considerable confusion and damage reputations.\u201d",
      "The aid suspension could create an opening for rival governments in the region to step into America\u2019s soft power shoes.",
      "\u201cWhen we start making foreign aid a political cudgel, we end up pushing people, who could be on our side, or at least be sympathetic to our aims, into the arms of our adversaries,\u201d Ray said. \u201cIt is a no-win situation for us when we start playing games with aid to people.\u201d",
      "In early February, less than two weeks after the U.S. aid suspension went into effect, China pledged $4.4 million to humanitarian demining in Cambodia.",
      "\u201cThe job is not yet finished. That\u2019s why the contributions from friendly countries, like the United States, is crucial,\u201d Ly Thuch, a senior government minister and vice president of the Cambodian Mine Action and Victim Assistance Authority, said in an interview in Phnom Penh, the capital.",
      "He added, \u201cCambodia is blessed in having a number of friendly countries supporting us.\u201d",
      "On Friday, government demining teams scoured farmland around Wat village in Siem Reap, where an anti-personnel mine and an unexploded mortar round had been detected.",
      "A pair of K-9 units worked in unison to patrol the known edges of the landmine field, once a battleground between the Khmer Rouge and the Cambodian government, sniffing for explosives.",
      "\u201cWe have only worked on this landmine field for three days, and look at how many dangers we have found already,\u201d Oum Socheath, a demining unit manager with the mine action center, said as he motioned to the dogs.",
      "If his group and others are unable to continue their work, local residents \u201cwill have to play a lucky draw on minefields,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cNow that the war in Cambodia has finished, people need to make a living,\u201d Oum said. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t clear out the mines, there will always be a risk.\u201d",
      "While slowed by the aid freeze, demining continues in Cambodia. The same can\u2019t be said in Laos, where the U.S. provided almost 90% of international funding for unexploded ordnance clearance in 2022, according to the Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor.",
      "The freeze in funding is pushing Laos into \u201cuncharted territory,\u201d said Danae Hendrickson, chief of mission advancement and communications at Legacies of War, a U.S.-based advocacy group for mine action in the region.",
      "\u201cI fear this pause in funding will undo decades of progress, not only in mine action, but also in U.S.-Laos relations, which have been difficult in the past few decades,\u201d Hendrickson said.",
      "Since aid was frozen in late January, four unexploded ordnance accidents have been reported in Laos \u2014 leading to two deaths and five injuries across three provinces, according to local authorities. NBC News was unable to independently confirm that figure.",
      "\u201cI refuse to live in a world where we don\u2019t continually strive to help our neighbors, especially when we have been part of the problem,\u201d Hendrickson said. \u201cThis is our shared history. The U.S. has dropped these bombs and it is our duty, our moral obligation, to clean that up.\u201d"

      "Vice President JD Vance publicly berated European leaders on a host of issues from free speech to security and mass migration, as simmering tensions between the United States and its close allies boiled over at an international conference in Munich on Friday.",
      "The vice president used the podium at the high-level security gathering that had been focusing on the invasion of Ukraine and the threat Russia poses to Europe and the rest of the world to raise social issues animating many on the American right.",
      "\"The threat that I worry the most about vis-\u00e0-vis Europe is not Russia. It's not China. It's not any external actor,\" he said at the Munich Security Conference. \"What I worry about is the threat from within \u2014 the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.\"",
      "He added: \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about what you need to defend yourselves from and of course, that\u2019s important. But what has seemed a little bit less clear to me ... is what exactly you\u2019re defending yourselves for?\u201d",
      "The vice president's comments were met with an icy reception and only scattered applause \u2014 and groans when he joked about how if American democracy could \"survive 10 years of Greta Thunberg scolding, you guys can survive a few months of Elon Musk.\u201d",
      "German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius denounced Vance's remarks during a session at the conference later in the day, saying in German that it was \"not acceptable\" that the U.S. vice president compared \"the condition of Europe with the condition that prevails in some auto-authoritarian regimes.\"",
      "\"This is not acceptable,\" Pistorius said. \"This is not the Europe, not the democracy where I live and where I conduct my election campaign right now. And this is not the democracy that I witness every day in our parliament. In our democracy, every opinion has a voice.\"",
      "\"I was in the room in Munich for VP Vance\u2019s speech,\" Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., wrote in a post on X. \"No talk about Russia, Ukraine, China. Just criticisms of our allies and focus on \u201cthe threat from within.\u201d His speech is going to embolden our adversaries who will see this as a green light to act while America is distracted/divided.\"",
      "Meeting with Zelenskyy",
      "A rift between the U.S. and Europe had been growing after President Donald Trump was accused of excluding Kyiv and the continent from peace talks to end the nearly three-year war in Ukraine.",
      "Later in the day, Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Gen. Keith Kellogg, the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, were part of the U.S. delegation that met directly with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials for a bilateral meeting at the conference.",
      "\u201cThe goal is, as President Trump outlined it, we want the war to come to a close,\" Vance told reporters who were briefly brought into the room after the meeting started. \"We want the killing to stop, but we want to achieve a durable, lasting peace, not the kind of peace that\u2019s going to have Eastern Europe in conflict just a couple years down the road.\"",
      "Zelenskyy thanked the U.S. and Trump for supporting Ukraine and said they will work toward a plan that addresses \u201chow to stop Putin and finish the war.\u201d",
      "Before becoming vice president, Vance had conveyed in recent years that he wasn't a fan of providing U.S. assistance to Ukraine. After Russia invaded the country in February 2022, Vance said on a podcast, \u201cI don\u2019t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.\u201d In the Senate, he voiced opposition to the Ukraine aid packages provided by Congress and under Biden.",
      "Throughout the event in Munich, European leaders appeared to ramp up their criticism of the Trump administration's handling of peace efforts.",
      "\"The new American administration has a very different world view to ours, one that has no regard for established rules, partnership and grown trust,\u201d German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said at the conference Friday, prior to Vance's comments.",
      "\"We have to accept that and we can deal with it. But I am convinced that it is not in the interests of the international community for this worldview to become the dominant paradigm,\u201d said Steinmeier, whose post is largely ceremonial, according to Reuters.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen\u00a0said the world had reached a \"moment in history\" where \"great challenges loom,\" as she called on the international community to hold Russian President Vladimir Putin accountable for proving \"he has given up\" a bid to \"destroy Ukraine.\"",
      "There is growing alarm across Europe after what Trump described as a \u201clengthy and highly productive\u201d conversation with Putin about ending the war in Ukraine.",
      "Trump was accused of shutting Kyiv and Europe out of peace talks, while comments he made about the future of Ukraine prompted fear and anger in that country and across Europe.",
      "Speaking at the security conference Friday, Zelenskyy said he had spoken with Trump and warned the American president not to believe Putin when he said he wanted to be part of a peace process.",
      "\u201cI said to him that he is a liar,\u201d Zelenskyy said he told Trump about Putin, adding that he urged the U.S. president to increase pressure on Putin because, he said, \"I don\u2019t trust him.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said it\u2019s important that no decisions about Ukraine are made without Ukraine. He also said that in his first phone call with Joe Biden, the then-president told him Ukraine could not join NATO. The United States \u201cnever saw us in NATO,\u201d Zelenskyy told attendees. \u201cThey just spoke about it, but they really didn\u2019t want us in NATO.\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s security conference comes amid growing concerns over what actions Moscow might take if it is handed a win in Ukraine, particularly amid Trump\u2019s suggestions that the U.S. would not defend NATO allies if they are attacked.",
      "Last year, NATO members\u00a0had indicated that Ukraine was on an \u201cirreversible path\u201d to eventual membership in the alliance. But both Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have indicated that NATO membership and Ukraine regaining lost territory are effectively off the table.",
      "Asked Friday about Sen. Roger Wicker's comments that Hegseth \"made a rookie mistake\" by saying that a return to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders was \"unrealistic,\" Trump said he was \"generally aware\" of what Hegseth would say.",
      "Trump was asked whether he blamed Ukraine or Russia for the war.",
      "\"I think that there were a lot \u2014 a lot of people to blame. All I can say is, very simply, if I were president, that war would never have happened,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday. \"You wouldn't have Russia and Ukraine fighting.\"",
      "Earlier, Vance may have offered European allies some reassurance in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, warning that Russia could face more sanctions and even military action if it refuses to agree to a deal ensuring Ukraine\u2018s\u00a0long-term independence.",
      "\u201cThere are economic tools of leverage, there are of course military tools of leverage,\u201d Vance told the newspaper, describing the possible pressures the U.S. could apply. \u201cThere are any number of formulations, of configurations, but we do care about Ukraine having sovereign independence.\u201d",
      "Vance did not expand on those comments during his address to the security conference on Friday. Later, in posts on X, he said the news outlet \"twisted\" his words and that Trump \"is the ultimate deal maker and will bring peace to the region by ending the war in Ukraine.\"",
      "\"As we\u2019ve always said, American troops should never be put into harm\u2019s way where it doesn\u2019t advance American interests and security,\" he wrote. \"This war is between Russia and Ukraine.\"",
      "\"The fact that the WSJ twisted my words in the way they did for this story is absurd, but not surprising considering they have spent years pushing for more American sons and daughters in uniform to be unnecessarily deployed overseas,\" he said in another post.",
      "German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Friday condemned any plan for peace talks that does not involve Ukrainians and Europeans.",
      "\u201cA sham peace \u2014 over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans \u2014 would gain nothing,\u201d Baerbock said in a statement as the security conference got underway. \u201cA sham peace would not bring lasting security, neither for the people in Ukraine nor for us in Europe or the United States,\u201d she said, according to Reuters.",
      "Baerbock called for talks between U.S. and international partners to be held at the Munich conference, an annual gathering of political and military leaders, as well as diplomats."

      "LONDON \u2014 Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes the accumulation of long-term injuries experienced by some clubs is an \u201caccident waiting to happen\u201d because of the increased demands on players in a congested soccer calendar.",
      "Arteta said he felt a \u201cbig pain in the tummy\u201d after seeing Kai Havertz pick up a serious hamstring injury at the end of a light training session in Dubai that will rule the Germany forward out for the rest of the season.",
      "It further stretches Arsenal\u2019s resources up front, with Gabriel Jesus having ruptured his ACL, winger Bukayo Saka having not played since December because of a hamstring issue and another wide player, Gabriel Martinelli, set to miss the next month also with a hamstring injury.",

Some players have openly complained that it is detrimental to their performance and health and the busy match schedule is facing legal challenges and the possibility of strike action.",
      "For Arteta, it\u2019s no surprise to see injury rates soar at Arsenal because of the extra load on players and what he perceives to be an increased intensity in modern-day soccer.",
      "\u201cYou cannot prove it and the evidence we can provide is very limited in many aspects and every case is very different but already some of them (injuries) we know are based on load and minutes. It\u2019s inevitable,\u201d Arteta said Friday. \u201cWe have players who have been injured who have played 130 games over the last two seasons. In the end, it\u2019s an accident waiting to happen if you continue to load and load and load.",
      "\u201cIs this season an accumulation of that? Is it the stress of that? Is it luck? Is it preparation? Is it methodology? There are a lot of factors. It\u2019s very difficult to point at something but the schedule that\u2019s planned is super-demanding and for certain players, especially explosive players, it\u2019s a real issue.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhen you have to load that muscle for two or three or six or eight weeks that you haven\u2019t in training, the risk of injury is much bigger \u2014 one, because the tendon is not recovered, and then it\u2019s not prepared to absorb the load and stress you are going to put it under every three days.\u201d"
