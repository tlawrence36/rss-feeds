      "Rian Johnson on Saturday night premiered the third movie in his whodunit series, \u201cWake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery.\u201d Like the previous two movies, \u201cKnives Out\u201d and \u201cGlass Onion,\u201d Johnson brought a cavalcade of stars to Toronto\u2019s Princess of Wales Theatre for what was easily the hottest ticket of the festival.",
      "\u201cThis is my favorite place to be in the world,\u201d said Johnson, recalling the similar TIFF first weekend premieres of his first two mysteries.",
      "\u201cWake Up, Dead Man\u201d is arguably Johnson's darkest, most intricate and most star-studded \u201cKnives Out\u201d mystery yet. It includes plenty of the quips that have characterized the first two movies (there are \u201cStar Wars\u201d and \u201cScooby Doo\u201d references), but the film is also more ambitiously existential.",
      "Daniel Craig\u2019s Benoit Blanc returns for a murder case involving a local church, with themes of truth, lies and grace threaded throughout. Josh O\u2019Connor stars a young priest named Jud Duplenticy, with Josh Brolin as the Monsignor and Glenn Close as a devout parishioner. The cast also includes Mila Kunis, Jeremy Renner, Daryl McCormack, Andrew Scott, Kerry Washington, Thomas Haden Church and Cailee Spaeny.",
      "\u201cThe first one was kind of a cozy, Agatha Christie family mystery. The second one was a big blow-out vacation mystery. And with this third one, we're going back to the roots of the genre,\" Johnson said. \u201cAnd the roots of genre actually lie in Edgar Allan Poe. A little gothic. We're going to go by way of Poe into some John Dickson Carr. We're going to veer into some G.K. Chesterton with the Father Brown mysteries. And we're going to go back to church.\u201d",

      "Hanks was scheduled to receive the 2025 Sylvanus Thayer Award on Sept. 25, but the U.S. Military Academy's alumni association canceled the ceremony last week, according to news reports.",
      "\u201cImportant move!\u201d Trump said in a post on his social media network Monday. \u201cWe don\u2019t need destructive, WOKE recipients getting our cherished American Awards!!! Hopefully the Academy Awards, and other Fake Award Shows, will review their Standards and Practices in the name of Fairness and Justice.\u201d",
      "West Point, its alumni association and a representative for Hanks did not immediately respond to messages and calls seeking comment Monday.",
      "It comes as Trump has moved to direct the ideology and leadership of higher education institutes and the military in his second term, seeking to assert control with a mix of executive orders and threats of legal action and withholding funds.",
      "This summer, the Army secretary directed West Point to review its hiring practices, bar outside groups from choosing employees and remove a newly announced hire who led the nation\u2019s cybersecurity agency under then-President Joe Biden.",
      "Earlier this year, West Point disbanded a dozen cadet clubs centered on ethnicity, gender, race and sexuality in response to the Trump administration\u2019s push to eliminate diversity programs throughout government. The school also rehung a painting of Gen. Robert E. Lee dressed in his Confederate uniform in the library as the Trump administration has pushed to restore Confederate names and monuments that have been removed in recent years.",
      "The Sylvanus Thayer Award award is named for an early superintendent of the military academy who is known as the \u201cFather of West Point.\" It has been given out every year since 1958 \u201cto an outstanding citizen of the United States whose service and accomplishments in the national interest exemplify personal devotion to the ideals expressed in West Point\u2019s motto: \u2018Duty, Honor, Country,\u2019\u201d according to the West Point Association of Graduates.",

      "Retired Army Col. Mark Bieger, president and chief executive officer of the association, wrote in an email Friday that the decision to call off the award ceremony \u201callows the Academy to continue its focus on its core mission of preparing cadets to lead, fight, and win as officers in the world\u2019s most lethal force, the United States Army,\u201d according to The Washington Post, which was first to report on the cancellation.",

      "She said there \u201chas been a lot of clear polarization\u201d that has \u201cspilled over into a bad place, spilled into a bad place when it comes to these acts of political violence.\u201d",

      "Barrett joined the court in 2020, just over a month after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died and Trump chose Barrett to replace her. In her book, the Republican president gets just a few mentions, mainly in connection with her nomination and confirmation.",
      "She dealt with the court's 2024 decision that spared Trump from prosecution for his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss without even using his name or explaining the decision.",
      "\u201cFor example, when a former president was indicted \u2014 a historical first \u2014 the court took the case to decide whether he could be prosecuted for his official acts,\u201d Barrett wrote. She joined most of Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 majority opinion.",
      "Even as Barrett writes about political polarization across the country, she does not address what role Trump may have played in it. The book does not deal with events of his second term, which began in January, about when Barrett said she was wrapping up the writing.",
      "The court's consideration of the president and executive power \"necessarily has to be detached from the current occupant of the office because ... the court has to think about things in the context of the broad sweep of history, of the presidents who have come before and the presidents who will come later. And so the court in deciding cases about executive power, it really is focused on the presidency rather than the president,\u201d Barrett said.",
      "In the interview and in subsequent public appearances, Barrett downplayed the idea that the nation is facing a constitutional crisis or dealing with unprecedented events.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say when you look over all of history that there haven\u2019t been times in which that disagreement has been even more acute,\u201d she said, listing the Civil War, Vietnam war protests and the Great Depression.",
      "The book is being published Tuesday by Sentinel, a conservative imprint of Penguin Random House.",
      "Barrett wrote clearly on two topics that suggest some disagreement with the president. Trump signed an executive order last month requiring the Justice Department to investigate and prosecute people for burning the American flag, despite a 1989 high court decision protecting the act as political speech.",
      "Barrett wrote admiringly of the free-speech votes of Justices Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia, for whom she once worked, despite their personal distaste for burning the flag.",

In a series of emergency orders this year, Barrett has mainly been in the majority to allow Trump to move ahead with plans to remake the federal government, even after lower-court judges have found some of his actions likely illegal.",

      "Alito's opinion \u201cdescribes where ... Roe went wrong in interpreting the due process clause. So you don\u2019t overrule precedent without concluding that that precedent was mistaken about the law in some respect,\u201d Barrett said.",
      "In the book, Barrett offered a defense of the decision.",
      "\u201cIf the Constitution places a matter beyond the reach of democratic majorities, the Court must vigilantly and fearlessly enforce that choice. Otherwise, the Court must leave the matter to the democratic process, which requires citizens to persuade one another rather than a handful of Supreme Court justices,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThese points animate the Court's reasoning in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which holds that the Constitution leaves the regulation of abortion to the democratic process.\u201d",
      "As she approaches the five-year anniversary of her confirmation, Barrett said the biggest changes in her life deal with ever-present security and that \u201cyou can never feel completely free.\u201d",
      "Last week, Barrett said she passed on dancing at a wedding until the very end, when Aretha Franklin's \u201cRespect\u201d began to play. \u201cI just started kind of twirling around my niece a little bit, and all of a sudden I see my sister take off across the floor, and somebody had a phone out and they were recording me,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cShe went up, and she said, \u2018I want you to delete that.\u2019\u201d",

      "The 82nd Venice Film Festival has wrapped up, but the buzz continues",
      "The 82nd Venice Film Festival may be over, but the conversations on the films that premiered, the things people said, the clothes they wore, and how it affects the Oscar race are still going.",
      "Here\u2019s a rundown of the big moments and takeaways from this year\u2019s edition.",
      "Jim Jarmusch\u2019s quiet film \u201cFather Mother Sister Brother\u201d took the top prize, the Golden Lion. It was a surprise to many who expected that honor to go to \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab,\u201d which ended up with the runner up award, or \u201cNo Other Choice.\u201d",
      "Aside from Benny Safdie\u2019s best director win for \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d Hollywood players were largely shut out of the awards in favor of a diverse, international selection. Chinese actor Xin Zhilei won best actress for Cai Shangjun\u2019s \u201cThe Sun Rises on Us All,\u201d Italian icon Toni Servillo won best actor for \u201cLa Grazia\u201d and Swiss actor Luna Wedler took the up-and-comer prize, the Marcello Mastroianni Award, for \u201cSilent Friend.\u201d",
      "The awards didn\u2019t give many hints, but Venice has been known to launch several best actor campaigns including Joaquin Phoenix in \u201cJoker,\u201dBrendan Fraser in \u201cThe Whale\u201d and Adrien Brody in \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d This year the most obvious heavyweight to follow is Dwayne Johnson for his turn as MMA fighter Mark Kerr in \u201cThe Smashing Machine.\u201d",
      "Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons were also strange and fierce as kidnapped and kidnapper in Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s provocative \u201cBugonia.\u201d Oscar Isaac portrayed Victor Frankenstein as a romantic madman and Jacob Elordi was na\u00efve and raw as the monster. Amanda Seyfried put a human, feminist, face to the religious sect the shakers in \u201cThe Testament of Ann Lee,\u201d and Julia Roberts flexed her acting muscles as a Yale philosophy professor in the midst of a misconduct accusation against a colleague in \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d",
      "Filmmakers like Kathryn Bigelow and previous Golden Lion winners Guillermo del Toro and Yorgos Lanthimos will also likely be in the conversation for months to come.",
      "There\u2019s always some unexpected Hollywood person at the Venice Film Festival who doesn\u2019t seem to be associated with any one film. Sometimes they\u2019ve come in for amfAR, sometimes they\u2019ve been invited by one of the festival\u2019s sponsors. But text chains started blowing up when Seth Rogen started popping up everywhere: Red carpets, press conferences, parties. Don\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s a Venice episode of \u201cThe Studio\u201d in the works: This trip was research, and maybe even a little more.",
      "In a cute, unexpected (possibly highly staged) moment during the festival, Amanda Seyfried commented on Julia Roberts\u2019 Instagram asking to \u201cplease let me wear the same outfit.\u201d Three days later, Seyfried was also rocking the Versace blazer, jeans, button up and belt, just with different shoes. It helps that they share a stylist, Elizabeth Stewart.",
      "First, let\u2019s just make clear that entertainment trade publications only started tracking Venice standing ovations recently. This year, audiences at the premiere of \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab\u201d applauded for 22-minutes, surpassing the 18-minute record set last year by \u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d which went on to win the Golden Lion. Even with a limited data set, that\u2019s a long time to clap after a movie.",
      "Other standing ovation times from the 82nd festival: \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d ((tilde)5 minutes), \u201cBugonia\u201d ((tilde)6 minutes), \u201cNo Other Choice\u201d ((tilde)7 minutes), \u201cJay Kelly\u201d ((tilde)9 minutes), \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin\u201d ((tilde)10 minutes), \u201cA House of Dynamite\u201d ((tilde)11 minutes), \u201cFrankenstein\u201d ((tilde)14 minutes), \u201cThe Testament of Ann Lee\u201d ((tilde)15 minutes), \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d ((tilde)15 minutes).",
      "The festival might not take political stances, but politics, and filmmakers grappling with the state of the world, from the Israel-Hamas conflict to nuclear weapons, were clearly top of mind. Kathryn Bigelow set off a warning shot about nuclear weapons and the apparatus of decision making with her urgent, and distressingly realistic, thriller \u201cA House of Dynamite.\u201d Tunisian filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania made an essential document of the human toll in Gaza with \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab.\u201d And Olivier Assayas charted the rise of Vladimir Putin in \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin.\u201d",

      "From a record-breaking standing ovation to the ever-present Campari spritzes to even on-screen subtitles, the 2025 Venice Film Festival was a bounty of interesting numbers",
      "VENICE, Italy -- After 10 days and dozens of red carpet premieres, the 82nd edition of the Venice Film Festival came to a close Saturday. While cinema is focused on the qualitative, a quantitative look can tell a story of its own. There are, after all, plenty of fascinating figures \u2014 beyond the celebrity kind \u2014 to be found on the Lido.",
      "Here's a look at this year's Venice Film Festival, by the numbers.",
      "That figure includes 1,936 feature films, which cost 200 euros ($234) apiece to submit. To be eligible for selection, a film must have been completed after Sept. 7, 2024, and must be making its world premiere at Venice. The festival decides what section a selected film goes in.",
      "It amounts to slightly over 1% of the feature films submitted. The 21 movies were the ones eligible for awards like the Golden Lion, which was won this year by Jim Jarmusch's \u201cFather Mother Sister Bother.\u201d There were also 30 films making their world premieres at Venice, but out of competition, like Luca Guadagnino's \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d Nineteen films played in the Horizons (Orizzonti) sidebar, which has its own awards. The Venice Classics sidebar featured 18 restorations.",
      "Led by American director Alexander Payne, the jury included French director St\u00e9phane Briz\u00e9, Italian director Maura Delpero, Romanian director Cristian Mungiu, Iranian director Mohammad Rasoulof (he lives in exile in Germany), Brazilian actor Fernanda Torres and Chinese actor Zhao Tao. They decide the winners among the main competition.",
      "The applause meter at film festivals is notoriously faulty, calibrated differently outlet by outlet, but it was clear that the ovation for \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab\u201d was record-breaking and definitely over 20 minutes. Variety reported 22 and BBC had it at 23. Kaouther Ben Hania's movie easily surpassed last year's Golden Lion winner, Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s \u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d which had people on their feet for 18 minutes.",
      "Doing the math, that's definitely more than 82 years ago. The festival has been suspended or periodically taken different forms over the years, including during World War II \u2014 though it did go forward in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Selections hailed from far and wide, from the U.S., France and, of course, Italy, to Ecuador, Slovakia and Taipei.",
      "There's space for short films \u2014 20 minutes and under \u2014 and feature films \u2014 longer than 60 minutes \u2014 but woe betide the filmmaker who makes anything in between.",
      "That distinction belongs to Olivier Assayas\u2019 \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin,\u201d an adaptation of Giuliano da Empoli\u2019s bestselling book of the same name, in which Jude Law transforms into Vladimir Putin.",
      "The longest ovation went to the shortest film in competition, \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab.\u201d Ben Hania's film combines real audio from Hind Rajab, the Palestinian 6-year-old girl who was found dead days after her desperate call for rescue in Gaza, with actors portraying volunteers at the Red Crescent, where the movie is set.",
      "Israel's war in Gaza reverberated through the festival, with high-profile calls to disinvite Gerard Butler and Gal Gadot over the war and questions to filmmakers and actors about an indie film company\u2019s funding ties to the Israeli military. The Aug. 30 march in Venice aimed to turn the spotlight from the stars to the war, and organizers estimate that over 10,000 people turned out.",
      "Those Golden Lions went to Kim Novak, the 92-year-old legendary actor who starred in Alfred Hitchcock's \u201cVertigo,\u201d and Werner Herzog, the prolific 83-year-old German filmmaker whose works range from lauded documentaries like \u201cLittle Dieter Needs to Fly\u201d to the Nicolas Cage-starrer \u201cBad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans.\u201d (He also acts, as viewers of \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d can attest.)",

      "The Venice Film Festival doesn't take place in the heart of the city, which would be the Piazza San Marco. Instead, it's on the Lido, a barrier island across the Venetian Lagoon. The Palazzo del Cinema, featuring three movie theaters, is the main headquarters of the festival. It takes 32 minutes to make the journey, by vaporetto, the public water bus. (For good measure, pun somewhat intended, 4.5 kilometers is just under 3 miles.)",
      "Over the decades, few tableaux are as glamorous as movies stars arriving, stylishly disheveled, by launch to the festival. Ferried to and from the Lido, celebrities, journalists and members of the public with passes cross the Venetian Lagoon. Should they fall overboard, they would contend with a depth of up to 71 feet (21 meters).",
      "The historic theater is home to the biggest screenings at the festival, as well as the awards ceremonies. It includes four additional spaces for people in wheelchairs.",
      "Every film shown at Venice has to have subtitles burned in: Non-Italian-language movies must have Italian subtitles, and Italian-language movies must have English subtitles. (All films are shown with English subtitles projected off-screen.) The festival's detailed subtitling guidelines suggest opting for white on-screen subtitles. And, yes, the festival has a preferred font. Much like the Microsoft Office of yore, it's Arial.",

      "The documentary \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d directed by Colin Hanks and produced by Ryan Reynolds, is a tribute not just to Candy the actor, but Candy, the man",
      "TORONTO -- TORONTO (AP) \u2014 \u201cI wish I had more bad things to say about him,\u201d Bill Murray says in the opening moments of the documentary \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me.\u201d",
      "It has always been hard to find a negative word about Candy. The great Canadian comedian and actor not only radiated a warm, down-to-earth friendliness in movies like \u201cPlanes, Trains and Automobiles,\u201d \u201cUncle Buck\u201d and \u201cThe Great Outdoors,\u201d he was that way off screen, too. As Mel Brooks says in the film, \u201cHe was a total actor because he was a total person.\u201d",
      "\u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d directed by Colin Hanks and produced by Ryan Reynolds, is a tribute not just to Candy the actor, but Candy, the man. On Thursday night, it premieres as the opening night film of the Toronto International Film Festival. For a beloved Canadian icon like Candy, whose nickname was \u201cJohnny Toronto,\u201d the setting could hardly be more fitting. To reference Candy\u2019s cameo in \u201cThe Blues Brothers,\u201d it\u2019s an occasion that calls for orange whips, all around.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you the amount of meetings we had about when the movie can be made, and maybe we can do this festival or that,\u201d Hanks says. \u201cAnd I just kept thinking in the back of my mind: Well, this is a gigantic waste of time. It should just be at Toronto. Period. The End.\u201d",
      "\u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d which will debut on Prime Video on Oct. 10, is a kind of cinematic eulogy for Candy, who died of heart failure at the age of 43 in 1994. Long ago as that was, \u201cI Like Me\u201d is the first feature documentary to tackle Candy, who might be even more popular three decades after his death.",
      "\u201cPart of me hates the fact that John maybe never really saw how beloved he was,\u201d Reynolds says. \u201cHe left something really lasting. He died of a heart failure and ironically the thing he left behind was his heart. That\u2019s the thing that stays.\u201d",
      "Hanks, Reynolds and Candy\u2019s children, Jennifer and Chris Candy, spoke in interviews before the TIFF opening about the making of \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d the title of which comes from one of Candy\u2019s most memorable lines from \u201cTrains, Planes and Automobiles.\u201d But it also serves as a guiding ethos to the documentary.",
      "Candy, who grew up in working-class Ontario and whose father also died young, had his own long-range struggles with that loss. He also, through a people-pleasing smile, dealt with the sometimes insensitive way his size was discussed in the media. Says Reynolds: \u201cHe was self-effacing his work, but not self-loathing. He didn\u2019t make a sport of punching down, not even on himself.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe left, but he did leave us some tools to get through this,\u201d says Chris Candy, 40, speaking alongside his 45-year-old sister. \u201cThat would be through the way he raised us and also saying it\u2019s OK to talk to someone if you have heavy feelings.\u201d",
      "For the Candys, \u201cI Like Me\u201d is an extremely emotional experience but one they\u2019re grateful for. They have each navigated their own way through an upbringing marked by their father\u2019s loss. It was years before Chris could visit his father\u2019s grave site or rewatch his movies. Once he did, he was astonished at his father\u2019s talent.",
      "For Jennifer, her father's movies helped carry her through grief.",
      "\u201cI jumped in and watched everything. All through college, I made sure I had the whole DVD collection,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me that was a constant reminder to hear his voice. We had cassette tapes of his \u2018Radio Kandy\u2019 show that I would just listen to all the time in the car during high school.\u201d",

      "Hanks, whose directorial work includes the 2015 documentary \u201cAll Things Must Pass: The Rise and Fall of Tower Records,\u201d wanted to find a thread for the film that went beyond tribute. To him, the movie is about drilling down on what gave Candy such an everyman quality. What made him, to millions, like their Uncle Buck. Hanks experienced Candy's effect firsthand as a child visiting his father, Tom Hanks, on the set of \u201cSplash.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have vivid memories of visiting on set. He was just one of my parents\u2019 friends, someone they worked with,\u201d says Hanks. \u201cHe had a way, even as a kid, of making you feel incredibly important.\u201d",
      "\u201cI had been on the periphery of the most intense fame you can have, as well as a much smaller version myself,\u201d adds Hanks. \u201cIt is an adjustment. It is hard to navigate. Not that it\u2019s not amazing and great, but that idea of how much you can actually give of yourself to people.\u201d",
      "Reynolds, born and raised in Vancouver, has been a fan of Candy\u2019s since growing up watching \u201cSCTV\u201d reruns. His fondness for Candy, in many ways, has been an influence throughout his career.",
      "\u201cI feel like in the bigger movies I\u2019m always either Del Griffith or Neil Page, from \u201cPlanes, Trains,\u201d says Reynolds. \u201cI tend to really fluctuate back and forth between those guys.\u201d",
      "As his own fame grew, alongside with his ability to take some authorship of his films, Reynolds has populated his movies with references to Candy. Easter eggs adorn the \u201cDeadpool\u201d films. In one moment, he utters the \u201cI like me,\u201d albeit in a much different context. Reynolds had the prop department make a mug with the same quote. A Chrysler LeBaron appears in the background of another scene. He even licensed the book \u201cThe Canadian Mounted: A Trivia Guide to Planes, Trains\u201d so it could make a cameo in all the \u201cDeadpool\u201d movies.",
      "\u201cI like having him around,\u201d says Reynolds. \u201cI feel safer. I feel better. I also feel maybe just a skosh more honest.\u201d",
      "\u201cJohn was a good person when nobody was watching, and I think that\u2019s an increasingly scarce resource these days, in an age where everything is not only seen, it\u2019s perfection,\u201d Reynolds adds. \u201cIt\u2019s like an epidemic. All we see is perfection and curation. Nobody wants to try anything new because nobody\u2019s willing to suck at anything.\u201d",
      "For Jennifer and Chris, \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d awash in memories of their father,\u201d is a kind of time capsule that, like their dad's other movies and radio show recordings, will be long treasured.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m fortunate that I will always have this,\u201d says Chris. \u201cAnd I love it for that.\u201d",

      "Until last year, Corinthians won 13 matches and drew seven in such instances. Some were against bitter rival Palmeiras and Brazilian social media was flooded with memes and montages of Swift wearing black and white \u2014 Corinthians' colors.",
      "Many Corinthians fans could have tossed their expectations after their team lost both the match prior to the release of \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department\u201d and the one following.

      "\u201cI laughed at first, but there\u2019s more coincidences. Taylor\u2019s first contract was signed on Sept. 1, that\u2019s the same day Corinthians was founded in 1910,\u201d said Rebeca Gois, 32, a marketing writer who lives near the stadium and is a Swift fan. \u201cIt has become a thing. Whenever there\u2019s a new album, we have a double joy; new Taylor songs and Corinthians unbeaten before and after that.\u201d",
      "That long run has encouraged Corinthians fans to think of the singer as an honorary supporter. Some have worn Swift costumes during games.",
      "Gavioes da Fiel, a Corinthians-linked samba school that parades in Sao Paulo's Carnival, jokingly invited Swift to join them in the festivities in 2022.",
      "Swift was in Brazil in 2012 to promote her album \u201cRed\u201d and then in 2023 with six concerts in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo during the Eras Tour. She has yet to appear at Corinthians stadium.",
      "Nataly Nascimento, a hardcore Corinthians Swiftie, said the trend got a boost after Swift had all her three concerts in Sao Paulo at the Allianz Parque, the stadium of their archrival Palmeiras.",
      "\u201cPeople started to look for that connection to tease Palmeiras fans. And then Corinthians fans started finding those links,\u201d said Nascimento, a 25-year-old teacher who lives in Brazil's Northeast and won't attend. \u201cBut there's something bigger. In the same way that Corinthians fans are much more passionate about their club, Swifties feel that about Taylor. It is mystical.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Artificial intelligence company Anthropic has agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit by book authors who say the company took pirated copies of their works to train its chatbot.",
      "The landmark settlement, if approved by a judge as soon as Monday, could mark a turning point in legal battles between AI companies and the writers, visual artists and other creative professionals who accuse them of copyright infringement.",
      "The company has agreed to pay authors or publishers about $3,000 for each of an estimated 500,000 books covered by the settlement.",
      "\u201cAs best as we can tell, it\u2019s the largest copyright recovery ever,\u201d said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors. \u201cIt is the first of its kind in the AI era.\u201d",
      "A trio of authors \u2014 thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 sued last year and now represent a broader group of writers and publishers whose books Anthropic downloaded to train its chatbot Claude.",
      "A federal judge dealt the case a mixed ruling in June, finding that training AI chatbots on copyrighted books wasn\u2019t illegal but that Anthropic wrongfully acquired millions of books through pirate websites.",
      "If Anthropic had not settled, experts say losing the case after a scheduled December trial could have cost the San Francisco-based company even more money.",
      "\u201cWe were looking at a strong possibility of multiple billions of dollars, enough to potentially cripple or even put Anthropic out of business,\u201d said William Long, a legal analyst for Wolters Kluwer.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco has scheduled a Monday hearing to review the settlement terms.",
      "Anthropic said in a statement Friday that the settlement, if approved, \u201cwill resolve the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining legacy claims.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems,\u201d said Aparna Sridhar, the company's deputy general counsel.",
      "As part of the settlement, the company has also agreed to destroy the original book files it downloaded.",
      "Books are known to be important sources of data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build the AI large language models behind chatbots like Anthropic\u2019s Claude and its chief rival, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.",
      "Alsup\u2019s June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it \u201cknew had been pirated.\u201d It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.",
      "Debut thriller novel \u201cThe Lost Night\u201d by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the dataset.",
      "Anthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.",

      "The Authors Guild told its thousands of members last month that it expected \u201cdamages will be minimally $750 per work and could be much higher\u201d if Anthropic was found at trial to have willfully infringed their copyrights. The settlement's higher award \u2014 approximately $3,000 per work \u2014 likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.",
      "On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement \u201can excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors\u2019 works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.\u201d",
      "The Danish Rights Alliance, which successfully fought to take down one of those shadow libraries, said Friday that the settlement would be of little help to European writers and publishers whose works aren\u2019t registered with the U.S. Copyright Office.",
      "\u201cOn the one hand, it\u2019s comforting to see that compiling AI training datasets by downloading millions of books from known illegal file-sharing sites comes at a price,\u201d said Thomas Heldrup, the group\u2019s head of content protection and enforcement.",
      "On the other hand, Heldrup said it fits a tech industry playbook to grow a business first and later pay a relatively small fine, compared to the size of the business, for breaking the rules.",
      "\u201cIt is my understanding that these companies see a settlement like the Anthropic one as a price of conducting business in a fiercely competitive space,\u201d Heldrup said.",
      "The privately held Anthropic, founded by ex-OpenAI leaders in 2021, earlier this week put its value at $183 billion after raising another $13 billion in investments.",
      "Anthropic also said it expects to make $5 billion in sales this year, but, like OpenAI and many other AI startups, it has never reported making a profit, relying instead on investors to back the high costs of developing AI technology for the expectation of future payoffs.",
      "The settlement could influence other disputes, including an ongoing lawsuit by authors and newspapers against OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft, and cases against Metaand Midjourney. And just as the Anthropic settlement terms were filed, another group of authors sued Apple on Friday in the same San Francisco federal court.",
      "\u201cThis indicates that maybe for other cases, it\u2019s possible for creators and AI companies to reach settlements without having to essentially go for broke in court,\u201d said Long, the legal analyst.",
      "The industry, including Anthropic, had largely praised Alsup\u2019s June ruling because he found that training AI systems on copyrighted works so chatbots can produce their own passages of text qualified as \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law because it was \u201cquintessentially transformative.\u201d",
      "Comparing the AI model to \u201cany reader aspiring to be a writer,\u201d Alsup wrote that Anthropic \"trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them \u2014 but to turn a hard corner and create something different.\"",
      "But documents disclosed in court showed Anthropic employees\u2019 internal concerns about the legality of their use of pirate sites. The company later shifted its approach and hired Tom Turvey, the former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "With his help, Anthropic began buying books in bulk, tearing off the bindings and scanning each page before feeding the digitized versions into its AI model, according to court documents. That was legal but didn\u2019t undo the earlier piracy, according to the judge.",

      "After his death Thursday at the age of 91, Armani has been remembered for softening the 1980s power suit, decades of fruitful Hollywood collaborations and as a defining figure of Italian luxury ready-to-wear.",
      "But he was also a keen business owner who maintained his independence in an era of consolidation, an innovative communicator and a boss who was in charge of every aspect of his business.",
      "\u201cI have to say, King George is the first in everything. The first but not the only,\u2019\u2019 said Mario Boselli, who was president of the Italian fashion chamber from 1999-2015. \u201cHe was the master of luxury ready-to-wear.\u201d",
      "The deconstructed, soft-shouldered Armani jacket catapulted Armani to fashion stardom, first with Richard Gere in the 1980 film \u201cAmerican Gigolo,\u2019\u2019 and then as the centerpiece of a women\u2019s wardrobe.",
      "\u201cI would say that the famous Armani jacket was a discovery that allowed women to live every day with an Armani garment that could go from work to dates. Armani could dress a woman from morning to evening, I would say with great precision, for every occasion,\u2019\u2019 Boselli said.",
      "Armani himself said in his 2015 memoir he wanted to create \u201ca new kind of femininity that forced men to look at women with new eyes.\u2019\u2019",
      "\u201cI have great esteem for women. I think they know how to be seductive without resorting to an exhibitionism that easily slips into vulgarity and excess,\u2019\u2019 Armani wrote. He credited American women as \u201cthe first to appreciate my work \u2014 and my audacity.\u2019\u2019",
      "Jackets remained the core of his collections through the decades. But with time he introduced more couture elements into his ready-to-wear in part to counter his image as the power suit designer, said Scott Schuman, the Milan-based photographer behind The Sartorialist fashion blog and the creator of the Armani tribute Instagram account @armaniarchive.",
      "Every collection started with a cascade of textiles on a huge table, which Armani himself would examine after his team made a first selection.",
      "\u201cThe collection, and the mood and the vibe started from the fabrics,\u2019\u2019 said Milan-based Austrian designer Arthur Arbesser, who was on the Armani design team for seven years until leaving in 2013 to launch his own brand.",
      "\u201cThat was unique, I learned from him what it was to touch the fabrics, then to come in with another fabric and with another shade to form a gradient of colors,\u2019\u2019 Arbesser said.",
      "Boselli first met Armani 45 years ago, arriving at his Borgnonuovo offices with a satchel of jersey knit samples as a sales rep for his family\u2019s textile company.",
      "\u201cHe saw the entire collection of fabrics, and chose them personally,\u2019\u2019 Boselli recalled. \u201cThat is not something everyone does. It takes time, it takes care. He had great respect for the work of others.\u2019\u2019",

But Armani always had a following, from Hollywood stars who could count on him for stunning looks without too much risk, to everyday people who sought well-made, tailored looks to project them from morning to evening.",
      "\u201cArmani was a beautiful river of design. You could pop in and out, and there was some kind of continuity,\u2019\u2019 Schuman said.",
      "Kenneth Richard, founder of The Impression, an influential fashion newsletter, called Armani \"the original game-changer,'' for the scale of a fashion empire he built himself, and for extending his brand into areas like home decor and hotels while maintaining his famed attention to detail.",
      "\u201cYou can check into an Armani hotel, get fitted downstairs and go to a red carpet event. Where else can you do this? You are sleeping on Armani sheets, in an Armani bed, with an Armani couch,'' Richard said. And all of it is owned by Armani, not licensed as many brands do.",
      "On the runway, Armani \u201cstuck to a singular voice through 50 years.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis aesthetic was refined, and approachable. You cannot become a $10 billion brand when you are consistently doing the same thing over and over again, without being approachable. He sells. People want to wear his clothing.\u201d",
      "Giorgio Armani's final collection will be previewed during Milan Fashion Week later this month during an event marking 50 years of his signature fashion house.",
      "Armani set up a foundation as a succession tool to avoid his businesses being split up. A rarity in the Italian fashion world, he never sold even a part of his company to an outsider.",
      "He also indicated the creative succession would go to longtime collaborator Leo Dell\u2019Orco and his niece Silvana Armani, who have headed the menswear and womenswear collections, respectively, for all Armani collections: Giorgio Armani, Emporio Armani and Armani Exchange.",
      "The question of generational succession has always been a fraught one in Italy's largely family run fashion industry. Armani's attention to every detail in the empire he launched 50 years ago will make him a tough act to follow.",
      "\u201cHe was involved in very step of the process from the very beginning to the end. Every photograph, every font, everything,'' Arbesser said. \"That is what makes a difference. These days, there is no boss, no creative director, who has so much control over everything. That is where the magic is. And that is where it is hard to see what is going to happen now.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 \u201cSeverance\u201d and \u201cThe Studio\u201d could bring in a boatload of early Emmys this weekend.",
      "Over the next two days, nearly 100 trophies will be handed out to many of TV's finest at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards, the annual precursor to the main Primetime Emmy Awards, which will air on Sept. 14 on CBS.",
      "\u201cSeverance,\u201d the top overall nominee this year with 27, could win as many as 13 for Apple TV+ on Saturday, which will be devoted to scripted shows while Sunday is dedicated to variety and reality TV. \u201cThe Studio,\u201d also from Apple, is the top comedy nominee with 23, and could bring in as many as 12 this weekend.",
      "The Creative Arts Emmys mostly go to technical and craft nominees who have little name recognition outside their field. Categories include best sci-fi or period hairstyles and best stunt coordination for a comedy.",
      "But big stars and big moments also emerge. Last year, \u201cShogun\u201d broke a record for most Emmys for a series in a season with 14 at the Creative Arts ceremony, before it went on to dominate the main ceremony.

      "The always star-studded guest acting categories will be handed out on Saturday. The guests who played themselves on \u201cThe Studio,\u201d the Hollywood satire starring and cocreated by Seth Rogen, make for an A-list set of nominees. Directors Ron Howard and Martin Scorsese are up for their first acting Emmys, and they'll be competing with fellow \u201cStudio\u201d guests Anthony Mackie and Bryan Cranston for guest actor in a drama.",

      "In a ruling on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Myong Joun said the administrative subpoena served by the U.S. Department of Justice was improper and \u201cmotivated only by bad faith.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department said the information was needed to investigate possible fraud or unlawful off-label promotion of drugs, but the information requested \u2014 including actual patient records \u2014 seemed to be unrelated, the judge said. Phone messages left with the Justice Department\u2019s attorney Ross Goldstein and with a Justice Department public affairs officer were not immediately returned.",
      "\u201cThe Administration has been explicit about its disapproval of the transgender community and its aim to end GAC,\u201d Joun wrote, referring to gender-affirming care. The judge later continued, \u201cIt is abundantly clear that the true purpose of issuing the subpoena is to interfere with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' right to protect GAC within its borders, to harass and intimidate BCH to stop providing such care, and to dissuade patients from seeking such care.\u201d",
      "Just eight days after taking office, President Donald Trump issued an executive order aimed at restricting access to medical care for transgender youth. In June, the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division announced the division would use \u201call available resources to prioritize investigations of doctors, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and other appropriate entities,\u201d in an effort to investigate what it called \u201cradical gender experimentation.\u201d",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi announced in a statement July 9 that the Justice Department had sent more than 20 subpoenas to doctors and clinics that provide care to transgender patients under 18. Bondi said the requests were part of investigations into \u201chealthcare fraud, false statements, and more.\u201d But the requests did not just seek information on policies or billing practices \u2014 they also demanded information about individual patients who had been prescribed puberty blockers or hormone therapy.",
      "Boston Children's Hospital asked the federal court to quash the subpoena on July 8, saying the Justice Department was seeking practically every document related to the provision of gender-affirming care over the past five and a half years, including highly sensitive and personally identifiable information about young patients.",
      "But the Justice Department contended the subpoena was proper and a valid way for the agency to investigate potential violations of off-label prescription drug rules.",

Her neurosurgeon, Dr. Walt Galicich, said at a news conference that a bullet, which remains lodged in her brain, caused severe damage, including to a major blood vessel. Surgeons had to remove the left half of her skull to relieve the pressure inside her head.",
      "\u201cIf you had told me at this juncture, 10 days later, that we\u2019d be standing here with any ray of hope, I would have said it would take a miracle,\u201d Galicich told reporters. He said they are banking on the ability of young brains to heal and make up for the damage.",

      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned last month that Cesium-137 was detected in shipping containers sent to four U.S. ports, and in a sample of imported frozen shrimp. That spurred multiple recalls of shrimp sold at Walmart, Kroger and other stores.",

      "MOROGORO, Tanzania -- A man lies unmoving, slumped in the rubble of a simulated earthquake, as an unlikely rescuer approaches: a rat with a backpack. Whiskers waving, the rat breezes past garbage, toppled furniture and scattered clothes to find him and pull a trigger on its pack, alerting searchers above.",

The search in Morogoro in Tanzania\u2019s Uluguru Mountains is over and the rat scurries out of the abandoned building to be rewarded with a banana. A successful mission is complete for this African giant pouched rat being trained for search and rescue operations.",
      "\u201cTheir sense of smell is incredible,\u201d said Fabrizio Dell\u2019Anna, an animal behaviorist at APOPO, a Tanzania-based nongovernmental organization that trains the rats for lifesaving applications. \u201cThese rats are able to detect explosives, tuberculosis \u2014 even tiny amounts of the bacteria \u2014 and in this project, they are able to correctly identify and indicate humans.\u201d",
      "In a field nearby, more rats walk on leashes held between handlers, pacing a grid filled with land mines as part of an initiative by APOPO, which works alongside Sokoine University of Agriculture. When they pause, it indicates that explosives are beneath. These rats are readying for their next deployment, perhaps Angola or Cambodia, where APOPO has helped clear more than 50,000 land mines since 2014.",
      "From detecting land mines to sniffing out tuberculosis, these \u201chero rats\u201d have become unlikely, and sometimes unrecognized, front-line responders in Tanzania and beyond.",
      "For decades APOPO has trained these \u201chero rats,\u201d which have one of the most sensitive noses in the animal kingdom. Since 2003, the rats have been finding land mines and, more recently, have been turned on to trafficked wildlife and earthquake survivors.",
      "The rats begin training shortly after birth for specific missions and, with a longer-than-average rodent life span of almost a decade, can spend years carrying out their work. The cost of training each rat runs around 6,000 euros ($6,990).",
      "It is all done with classical conditioning and positive reinforcement, explained Dell\u2019Anna, who oversees the search and rescue program. The first cohort of this group of specialized rats are already in Turkey with a partner search and rescue organization.",
      "While the rats focused on explosives or survivors buried in rubble get all the glory, it is a group of rats inside a lab that are arguably the most impactful lifesavers. These are not typical lab rats, but rather, as their proponents would argue, one of the world\u2019s most effective detectors of tuberculosis.",
      "\u201cEvery day as many people die from TB as from land mines in a whole year,\u201d said Christophe Cox, the CEO of APOPO. \u201cIt\u2019s more spectacular to be on the minefield \u2026 but for TB \u2026 in terms of social impact, it\u2019s tremendous.\u201d",
      "Tuberculosis is an ancient respiratory disease that continues to run rampant despite centuries of research and treatment. The World Health Organization said last October in its most recent TB report that the disease had resurged as the top infectious disease killer, with 1.25 million deaths and a record 8.2 million infections in 2023.",
      "In sub-Saharan Africa, only about half of TB patients receive a diagnosis, according to a study by researchers in the UK and Gambia published in the National Library of Medicine, and this leaves them liable to spread the disease. Tanzania struggles with one of the highest global TB burdens, according to the WHO.",
      "APOPO expanded into TB detection in 2007 and its rats have been deployed in Tanzania, Ethiopia and Mozambique. The group works with 80 hospitals in Tanzania, collecting samples daily and bringing them to the lab rats.",
      "With their sensitive noses, the rats sniff out samples of sputum from patients, looking for positive TB cases that had been marked as negative. Research suggests the rats are picking up on six unique volatile organic compounds in positive TB samples, said Cox.",
      "False negatives remain a persistent issue in TB detection and suppression because each infected person can spread the disease to 10 to 15 more people each year.",
      "\u201cThe benefits of using rats are significant,\u201d said Felista Stanesloaus, a doctor at a TB clinic in Morogoro. \u201cThey help us detect cases that might otherwise be missed, which prevents people from unknowingly spreading infections.\u201d",

      "While the use of molecular detection devices, such as one called GeneXpert, have become more widespread, a clinic may only have one of these devices and it can take two hours to process a sample. Overburdened clinics turn to the centuries-old technique of microscopy, or investigation of sputum under a microscope, which is both fallible and time-consuming.",
      "\u201cHuman error may result in a person being told they are disease-free when they are not,\u201d said Stanesloaus. \u201cUsing rats is a very effective initiative.\u201d",
      "APOPO\u2019s rats can scan 100 samples in 20 minutes, and since the program's inception, the rats have been able to identify more than 30,000 patients who had been sent home with a clean bill of health but were actually carrying TB, said Cox. The NGO is able to do with one lab what 55 hospitals do in a day, he adds.",
      "Yet using live animals in the place of medical devices poses challenges, especially when it comes to scale. Samples have to be brought directly to a lab with enough trained rats to conduct the detection, with some samples brought to Morogoro by motorbike each day. Operations are most effective in dense urban centers, like Dar es Salaam, Cox said.",
      "The more existential challenge for these \u201chero rats\u201d comes from regulators and a wider health community who doubt this unconventional method of disease detection.",
      "APOPO\u2019s rats are not classified as primary diagnostic tools by the WHO. Instead, they are a second line of defense. Any positive samples detected by the rats must be confirmed with human microscopy in APOPO\u2019s labs before treatment can be administered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big challenge,\u201d said Cox. \u201cNot being recognized by the WHO means that the mainstream funding for TB \u2026 never reaches us.\u201d",
      "Cox has given up on the prospect of getting approval from the WHO, though APOPO has faced pressure from donors to go through this process, which would be extensive and rigorous with no guarantee of success.",
      "Regulators may also challenge APOPO\u2019s method of focusing on finding every single positive case possible at the cost of more potential false positives.",
      "APOPO relies on the indication of just one rat to proceed with further investigation into a possible positive case, while higher specificity standards may need multiple rats to flag a sample.",
      "Cox defends this approach.",

      "KATHMANDU, Nepal -- KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) \u2014 Nepal\u2019s government responded to escalating violent protests over a ban on popular social media platforms with deadly force. The public outrage over the ban and the deaths of 19 protesters on Monday led to the resignation of the prime minister and exposed deep discontent over corruption.",
      "Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli also rolled backed the short-lived ban after protesters turned their anger on politicians by setting fire to homes of some of the country\u2019s top leaders.",
      "Led by mostly teenagers and young adults, the protests revealed a broader resentment in Nepal, where many people have increasingly become angry with the government over a range of issues, mostly to do with corruption and frustration over nepotism in the country\u2019s politics.",
      "\u201cProtests over the social media ban were just a catalyst. Frustrations over how the country is being run have long been simmering under the surface. People are very angry and Nepal finds itself in a very precarious situation,\u201d said Prateek Pradhan, editor of Baahrakhari, a Nepalese independent news website.",
      "Demonstrations in Nepal have been called the protest of Gen Z, which generally refers to people born between 1995 and 2010. They were largely in response to the ban that went into effect last week and government\u2019s larger attempt to regulate social media through a bill that requires platforms to register and submit to local oversight and regulations.",
      "The bill, which has not yet been fully debated in parliament, has been widely criticized as a tool for censorship and punishing opponents who voice their protests online. Rights groups have called it an attempt by the government to curb freedom of expression and violate fundamental rights.",
      "At the same time, the protests were also a tipping point of a longstanding sentiment against politicians, their families and concerns over corruption.",
      "In the weeks before the ban, a social media campaign \u2014 particularly on video-sharing platform TikTok \u2014 spotlighted the lavish lifestyles of politicians\u2019 children, highlighting disparities between Nepal\u2019s rich and poor.

      "The unrest is the worst in decades in the Himalayan nation that is wedged between India and China. It is also far violent than the one in 2006, when an uprising forced Nepal\u2019s former king to give up his authoritarian rule. At least 18 people were killed in the violence.

      "Thaksin Shinawatra, the billionaire former prime minister of Thailand, remains one of the country\u2019s most influential and controversial figures nearly two decades after being ousted in a 2006 military coup",
      "BANGKOK -- BANGKOK (AP) \u2014 Thaksin Shinawatra, the billionaire former prime minister of Thailand, remains one of the country\u2019s most influential and controversial figures nearly two decades after being ousted in a 2006 military coup. His political journey, marked by unprecedented popularity, a dramatic fall from power, years in self-imposed exile and a high-profile return, continues to shape Thailand\u2019s political landscape.",
      "Thaksin's dramatic path took another turn Tuesday when the Supreme Court ruled that he must serve a one-year prison term for previous convictions on graft and abuse of power charges, after investigating whether officials had mishandled his return to Thailand in 2023 to begin serving the sentences.",
      "Last month, he defied expectations when a court that has historically leaned against him and his political machine acquitted him of royal defamation, an offense that could have sent him to prison for up to 15 years.",
      "Despite powerful enemies in the Thai establishment and criminal convictions for corruption, he had avoided prison by going into exile after his ouster. His return had seemed to signal an accommodation with his opponents.",
      "He was insistent on maintaining a high public profile and was seen as the real power directing the government that was formed as he returned, especially when his daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, became prime minister last year. It appeared to keep his old enmities alive and embroiled him in legal challenges from those wishing to curb his influence.",
      "The Shinawatra family is prominent in the northern city of Chiang Mai, where Thaksin was born to a mercantile family in 1949. After a career in public service as a police colonel, Thaksin became a business entrepreneur in the late 1970s. He built a telecommunications empire starting with Advanced Info Systems, an early mobile phone service provider and the primary source of his fortune.",
      "He entered politics in 1994, holding Cabinet posts before establishing the Thai Rak Thai Party in 1998. Using his fortune to build a nationwide political machine, he promoted populist policies that resonated with lower-income citizens, especially in the countryside.",
      "His platform promised to spread economic growth and bridge the wealth gap, with signature policies including universal healthcare and village development funds. This led to landslide victories for his party in 2001 and 2005, making him the first elected Thai prime minister to complete a four-year term and the country\u2019s longest-serving democratically elected leader.",
      "However, Thaksin\u2019s massive popularity and electoral support rocked Thailand\u2019s established political order. This earned him powerful enemies among conservative forces, including the army and the courts, which saw him as a threat to the monarchy, the bedrock of Thai identity, as well as to their own influence.",
      "He also faced criticism for his imperious CEO-style governance, intolerance of criticism, especially from the media, and failure to distance his business interests from government policy. His administration was also blamed for setting off a persistent Muslim insurgency in Thailand's southern provinces and for what human rights advocates said were more than 2,000 extrajudicial killings during his war on drugs.",
      "His second term was cut short by a military coup in 2006 while he was abroad. Opponents accused him of corruption, abuse of power, and disrespecting then-King Bhumibol Adulyadej, and hounded him with legal cases that he characterized as politically motivated.",
      "Thaksin\u2019s ouster triggered nearly two decades of deep political polarization, pitting his supporters against opponents, including better-off urban dwellers, ardent royalists and the military. He briefly returned in 2008 to face charges but skipped bail and fled abroad again, commencing a self-imposed exile lasting over a decade.",

      "While in exile, Thaksin, who had his Thai passport revoked, obtained another from Montenegro through investment and spent significant time in Dubai. He also purchased and sold the Manchester City Football Club and invested in mining in Africa.",
      "Thaksin\u2019s return became possible after the progressive Move Forward Party\u2019s victory in 2023 rattled the establishment that had so abhorred him. This led to what many called a \u201cself-serving deal\u201d between Thaksin and his former conservative foes, a move that alienated many supporters even as it returned Pheu Thai to power while keeping Move Forward out of government.",

      "Upon his return, Thaksin was sentenced to an eight-year prison term for corruption but was immediately transferred to a fancy hospital suite due to ill health, a diagnosis regarded with skepticism by many.

      "Critics questioned his illness, viewing his abbreviated stay as a \u201cspecial privilege.\u201d Tuesday's Supreme Court ruling said his transfer to the hospital did not follow proper procedures and that his health condition could not justify his extended stay there.",

      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Prosecutors at the International Criminal Court began presenting evidence Tuesday to support their charges against fugitive Ugandan rebel leader Joseph Kony at the global court\u2019s first ever in absentia hearing, alleging that he inflicted horrors on Ugandan society that still echo two decades later.",
      "Kony is facing 39 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity as the fugitive leader of the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, or LRA, which terrorized northern Uganda for decades.",
      "\u201cThe social and cultural fabric of Northern Uganda has been torn apart and it is still struggling to rebuild itself,\u201d deputy prosecutor Mame Mandiaye Niang said in his opening statements.",
      "The LRA began its attacks in Uganda in the 1980s, when Kony sought to overthrow the government. After being pushed out of Uganda, the militia went on to attack villages in Congo, Central African Republic and South Sudan.

      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in her annual address to the European Parliament that it was necessary to \u201cgive ourselves the tools\u201d to combat wildfires made worse by climate change as summers become \u201chotter, harsher and more dangerous.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis summer, we all saw the pictures of Europe\u2019s forests and villages on fire,\u201d Von der Leyen said. \u201cMore than a million hectares were burned. ... The scale of the damage is enormous. And we know it is not a one-off.\u201d",
      "The announcement comes as reports have suggested that climate change worsened wildfires in southern Europe this summer, with the likelihood of similar wildfire outbreaks rising sharply.",
      "Von der Leyen did not provide specifics on how the Cyprus-based hub will operate or what resources it will have.",
      "Cypriot officials proposed setting up such a hub on the Mediterranean island nation as early as 2022, with additional firefighting aircraft that could quickly respond to wildfires, particularly in Mideast countries such as Lebanon, Jordan and Israel.",

Hundreds of homes were destroyed and more than 40 square miles of land in the southern foothills of the Troodos mountain range were scorched.",
      "A few weeks before the wildfire\u2019s outbreak, Cyprus\u2019 Environment Minister Maria Panayiotou said the country was in the process of bolstering its fleet of firefighting aircraft. She said tenders were out for three fixed-wing aircraft with a water-carrying capacity of 3,000 liters (800 gallons), each in line with EU guidelines, as part of a five-year plan for the island nation to build a state-owned fleet with 10 such planes.",

      "BRASILIA, Brazil -- Brazil\u2019s former President Jair Bolsonaro was one step away from being convicted for attempting a coup, after two Supreme Court justices voted Tuesday to find the right-wing leader guilty of trying to illegally hang onto power.",
      "Three members of the five-judge panel trying Bolsonaro's case must support a conviction, in a process that can last several days. Two judges voted for conviction before proceedings were adjourned until Wednesday. Three more must cast their votes.",
      "Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing the case and is considered by Bolsonaro supporters a foe, said the far-right politician who governed Brazil between 2019 and 2022 was the leader of a coup plot and of a criminal organization, and voted in favor of convicting him.",
      "\u201cWe can't forget that little by little Brazil almost returned to a dictatorship that lasted 20 years,\u201d de Moraes said, in a reference to the country's military rule between 1964-85. \u201cThat was because of a criminal organization built by a political group that doesn't know how to lose elections.\u201d",
      "Justice Fl\u00e1vio Dino also voted to convict Bolsonaro. Proceedings were then adjourned, with court sessions scheduled every day through Friday.",
      "As de Moraes spoke, Dino and another justice, C\u00e1rmen L\u00facia, nodded. But Justice Luiz Fux told de Moraes that he planned to disagree with parts of his ruling.",
      "De Moraes spoke for about five hours, listing a series of \u201cexecutory acts\u201d that he said made up the attempted coup, including casting unfounded doubts on the country's electoral voting system, drafting a decree to suspend the result of the election which Bolsonaro lost, and riots on Jan. 8, 2023, which de Moraes said were aimed at forcing a military takeover.",
      "De Moraes rejected Bolsonaro\u2019s claim that when he discussed \u201cpossibilities\u201d of staying in power, he did so within the limits of the law.",
      "\u201cCall it whatever you want: This was a draft decree for a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat,\u201d de Moraes said. \"A series of executive acts were carried out aimed at breaking the democratic rule of law and perpetuating power through a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\u201d",
      "Bolsonaro did not attend the court, and his lawyers declined to speak to the press on Tuesday. Judicial police officers carried assault weapons in the court room and in the nearby lobbies, in a sign of the high-profile nature of the case.",
      "The former president is facing five counts for allegedly attempting a coup after his narrow loss to current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "Bolsonaro has always denied any wrongdoing, repeatedly calling the trial a politically motivated attack.",
      "Prosecutors have pointed to evidence that Bolsonaro assembled top Cabinet and military officials to discuss issuing an emergency decree aimed at suspending the election outcome of October 2022 in order to investigate alleged voting fraud.",
      "But last week defense lawyer Celso Vilardi vehemently noted that the decree was never issued, and that instead Bolsonaro ordered a transition of power to Lula. The defense also has noted that the Jan. 8 riots took place only after Lula already was inaugurated.",
      "\u201cThe planning is not the execution. No matter how detailed the planning may be, it is the act of violence that actually consummates the crime,\u201d Vilardi told the justices at the televised proceedings. \u201cBolsonaro ordered a transition.\u201d",
      "Bolsonaro \u201ddid not act against the democratic rule of law,\u201d he added.",
      "As he laid out his vote in favor of a conviction, de Moraes disagreed.",
      "\u201cThe mere attempt \u2014 especially because the completion will not allow anyone to be held responsible \u2014 consummates the crime\u201d of a coup, he said, adding that if it had been successful the Supreme Court itself would be on trial.",

      "A guilty verdict on the coup plot charge alone carries a sentence of up to 12 years.",
      "If one of the justices requests a longer review, the verdict could be delayed for up to 90 days, but court experts have said that\u2019s unlikely.",

      "Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra is in Bangkok\u2019s Klong Prem Central Prison after the Supreme court said he must serve a one-year prison term for previous convictions",
      "BANGKOK -- Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was taken to Bangkok\u2019s Klong Prem Central Prison on Tuesday after the Supreme Court said he must serve a one-year prison term for previous convictions related to graft and abuse of power charges.",
      "The court's decision came after a hearing to decide whether officials had mishandled his return to Thailand in 2023 to begin serving the sentences.",
      "A judge said that the enforcement of Thaksin\u2019s penalty was not done properly, and therefore his detention in a police hospital did not count as serving prison time.",
      "Following his return to Thailand after more than a decade of living in self-exile, Thaksin was sent to a suite at Bangkok\u2019s Police General Hospital in the middle of the night, reportedly for medical reasons, after spending less than a day in prison. His eight-year sentence was then commuted to one year by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, and he was released on parole after six months in the hospital.",
      "The circumstances raised questions about whether he received special treatment and many were suspicious whether he was genuinely ill.",
      "The court's statement Tuesday said evidence showed that Thaksin's condition on that night was treatable by the prison's hospital, but that he was instead sent directly to the police hospital without first being assessed by prison doctors, which was a violation of procedures.",
      "It said that the police hospital's request for an extension of his stay claimed that Thaksin needed urgent neck surgery, but a record showed that he received surgeries for a locked finger joint and tendonitis in his right shoulder, which were not serious conditions and not what originally sent him to the hospital. The court added Thaksin did not end up having neck surgery before his release.",
      "It also said that Thaksin was believed to have intervened in the treatment procedures to avoid having to go back to the prison, and that he falsely claimed having a health condition in order to be sent to the hospital.",
      "After Tuesday's court hearing, Thaksin was sent to the Bangkok Remand Prison. The Department of Corrections said in a statement late Tuesday that he was processed and then moved to the nearby Klong Prem Central Prison, which detains prisoners who have received final convictions. He was filmed being taken into a prison van while wearing a blue prisoner uniform.",
      "A message on his Facebook page, shared by his team shortly after the ruling, said that he accepted the court\u2019s decision.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to look into the future, to give conclusions to everything, whether the legal proceedings or the conflicts that were caused by or related to me,\u201d read the post. \u201cFrom today, although I\u2019m without freedom, I still have freedom of thought for the benefit of the country and its people.\u201d",

      "Paetongtarn spoke to reporters after the ruling, thanking the king for commuting Thaksin's sentence. She said Thaksin would remain a spiritual leader in Thai politics and that he always thinks about working for the good of the country and Thai people.",
      "\u201cI'm worried about my father, but I'm also proud that he has created so many historic moments for the country,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's quite tough, but of course we are still in a good spirit, both my father and our family.\u201d",
      "Thaksin was prime minister from 2001 until a military coup ousted him in 2006 while he was abroad.",
      "His ouster triggered nearly two decades of deep political polarization, pitting his supporters against opponents including better-off urban dwellers, ardent royalists and the military. He briefly returned in 2008 to face charges but skipped bail and fled abroad again, commencing a self-imposed exile lasting over a decade.",
      "After leaving office, he faced a barrage of lawsuits and criminal charges he claimed were politically motivated.",
      "Last month, a criminal court acquitted him of royal defamation, an offense also known as lese-majeste, which could have resulted in a 15-year prison sentence.",

      "Four scheduled meetings \u2014 at Carlisle, Uttoxeter, Lingfield and Kempton \u2014 have been canceled and rescheduled after agreements between the owners of the courses and the British Horseracing Authority, making it the first time the sport in Britain has voluntarily refused to race in modern history.",
      "The BHA set up the \u201cAxe the Racing Tax\u201d campaign in response to proposals to replace the existing three-tax structure of online gambling duties with a single tax, with fears the current 15% duty on racing could be increased to the 21% levied on games of chance.",
      "Economic analysis commissioned by the BHA says such a rise could cost the sport at least 66 million pounds ($90 million) and put around 2,750 jobs at risk in the first year, in what BHA chairman Charles Allen described as \u201cnothing short of an existential threat for our sport.\u201d",

      "Allen said the protests are about \u201cprotecting communities across Britain\u201d and \u201csafeguarding a national institution.\u201d",

      "Russia's state gas company Gazprom says it has a deal to build a pipeline to China called Power of Siberia 2",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- The head of Russia's state-owned gas company Gazprom says it has a deal to build a pipeline to China, but there are many unanswered questions about the details of the agreement.",
      "On paper, the project \u2014 known as the Power of Siberia 2 \u2014 would give Russia a way to replace some of the revenue from its decades of selling natural gas to Europe that was lost over its invasion of Ukraine. The pipeline would carry gas from reserves in western Siberia through Mongolia to China.",
      "And what Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller called a \u201clegally binding\u201d memorandum to build the pipeline with the China National Petroleum Co. is a chance for Moscow and Beijing to underline their deepening ties against the United States.",
      "Here are key issues surrounding the Power of Siberia 2 and why it can't completely replace Russia's lost revenue from Europe:",
      "The pipeline would run 6,700 kilometers (4,163 miles) from gas fields in the Yamal Peninsula in western Siberia, past Lake Baikal in eastern Siberia, and then across Mongolia into China. For more than 50 years, Russia earned fat profits sending Yamal gas to Europe through pipelines leading west.",
      "But Russia cut off most pipeline gas to Europe over the war in Ukraine, and the European Union wants to end the remaining trickle of supplies by 2027.",
      "So the new pipeline would be a way to shift those lost gas sales to a big new customer.",
      "Power of Siberia 2 would carry 50 billion cubic meters a year to China, compared with the up to 180 billion cubic meters a year that went to Europe \u2014 meaning the new pipeline could only make up part of the lost business. It would supplement a previous, smaller Power of Siberia line that carries gas from different fields in eastern Siberia with a capacity of 38 billion cubic meters per year.",
      "Miller's announcement, which came during a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping, left out key details. There was no agreement on gas prices or even who would finance the pipeline's construction.",
      "Analysts say the announcement was primarily a chance for Russia and China to underline their closer relationship, and for China to snub supplies of U.S. liquefied natural gas that comes by ship.",
      "India is buying Russian oil despite U.S. President Donald Trump retaliating with 25% tariffs on imports, and China's purchases of U.S. liquefied natural gas are blocked by tariffs imposed as part of China's trade dispute with the Trump administration trade. Meanwhile China has started taking LNG shipments from Russia's Arctic-2 terminal, which has been the target of U.S. and EU sanctions.",
      "So the theatrics of the deal are clear.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got this show of Russia, India, China saying, \u2018you know what, we don\u2019t care about your sanctions, we don\u2019t care about your LNG,\u2019\" said Michal Meidan, head of China energy research at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.",
      "The announcement was \u201can absolutely perfect way ... to say: \u2018Look, we\u2019re not all talk, here\u2019s an actual measure,\u2019\u201d said Annette Bohr, associate fellow in the Russia and Eurasia program at Chatham House in London.",
      "But while the deal is \u201ca step forward for Gazprom, it\u2019s not a done deal. There\u2019s no confirmed timeline, no definitive pricing agreement,\u201d she said.",

      "She added that \"China is definitely in the driver\u2019s seat\u201d when it comes to energy deals.",
      "The announcement underlines that China is the dominant partner, said Alexander Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.",

So if Russia is ready to provide conditions that satisfy China\u2019s demands, then it\u2019s probably a green light,\u201d he said. \u201cBut without that, it\u2019s just a friendly reminder that Russia needs to accommodate some of Chinese demand. And it\u2019s telling you that China has tremendous leverage, and has, in a way, the seniority in this relationship.\u201d",
      "Given the global effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels, one good question is whether China needs another gas supplier, says the Oxford Energy Institute's Meidan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not clear that it really does need Power of Siberia 2,\u201d she said, adding that there is \u201chuge uncertainty about just how much demand China will have in the 2030s, even from Chinese analysts and Chinese institutions.\u201d",
      "China's future demand is part of a complex equation involving a shift away from coal, which emits more carbon dioxide, as the swing fuel used to cover peaks in electricity demand that can't be met by renewables such as wind or hydro power.",
      "A faster move away from coal means more gas use over the short term, while a slower coal exit could increase gas consumption. Battery storage to cover demand peaks and nuclear power could also play a role.",
      "\u201cThey might not necessarily use more gas if they do renewables and storage faster than anyone else, or if they find other ways where ... they use their hydro and their nuclear,\" Meidan said.",

Chief financial officer John Brunst and executive vice president Scott Spear are each serving 10-year sentences for conspiracy and money laundering convictions.",
      "Prosecutors had argued that Backpage\u2019s operators ignored warnings to stop running prostitution ads, some involving children. The operators were accused of giving free ads to sex workers and cultivating arrangements with others who worked in the industry to get them to post ads with the company.",
      "Backpage\u2019s operators said they never allowed ads for sex and made an effort to try to delete such ads by assigning employees to remove them and creating automated tools. Their legal team maintained the content on the site was protected by the First Amendment.",

      "A U.S. Government Accountability Office report released in June 2021 said the FBI\u2019s ability to identify victims and sex traffickers had decreased significantly after Backpage was seized by the government, because law enforcement was familiar with the site and Backpage was generally responsive to requests for information.",

Experts believe it was the largest criminal racketeering case ever filed against protesters in U.S. history.",

      "The training center, a priority of Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, opened earlier this year, despite years of protests and millions in cost overruns, some of which was due to the damage protesters caused, and police officials\u2019 needs to bolster 24/7 security around the facility.",

      "The streamlining would save 8 billion Danish krone ($1.25 billion) by the end of 2026, savings that are to be redirected to diabetes and obesity, including research and development, the company said. Novo Nordisk also makes Ozempic, a diabetes drug that also can result in weight loss.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court granted an unusually quick hearing on President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on Tuesday, putting a policy at the center of his economic agenda squarely before the nation's highest court.",
      "The justices will hear the case in November, a lightning-fast timetable by the Supreme Court's typical standards, and rule at some point after that. The tariffs will stay in place in the meantime.",
      "The court agreed to take up an appeal from the Trump administration after lower courts found most of his tariffs illegal.",
      "The small businesses and states that challenged them also agreed to the accelerated timetable. They say Trump's import taxes on goods from almost every country in the world have nearly driven their businesses to bankruptcy. \u201cCongress, not the President alone, has the power to impose tariffs,\u201d attorney Jeffrey Schwab with the Liberty Justice Center said.",
      "Two lower courts have agreed that Trump didn't have the power to impose all the tariffs under an emergency powers law, though a divided appeals court left them in place.",
      "The Trump administration asked the justices to intervene quickly, arguing the law gives him the power to regulate imports and striking down the tariffs would put the country on \u201cthe brink of economic catastrophe.\u201d",
      "The case will come before a court that has been reluctant to check Trump\u2019s extraordinary flex of executive power. One big question is whether the justices\u2019 own expansive view of presidential authority allows for Trump\u2019s tariffs without the explicit approval of Congress, which the Constitution endows with the power to levy tariffs. Three of the justices on the conservative-majority court were nominated by Trump in his first term.",
      "While the tariffs and their erratic rollout have raised fears of higher prices and slower economic growth, Trump has also used them to pressure other countries into accepting new trade deals. Revenue from tariffs totaled $159 billion by late August, more than double what it was at the same point a year earlier.",

A ruling against them could even threaten the nation\u2019s ability to reduce the flow of fentanyl and efforts to end Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, Sauer argued.",
      "The administration did win over four appeals court judges who found the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, lets the president regulate importation during emergencies without explicit limitations. In recent decades, Congress has ceded some tariff authority to the president, and Trump has made the most of the power vacuum.",
      "The case involves two sets of import taxes, both of which Trump justified by declaring a national emergency: the tariffs first announced in April and the ones from February on imports from Canada, China and Mexico.",

      "The workplace raid by the U.S. Homeland Security agency was its largest yet as it pursues its mass deportation agenda. The Georgia battery plant, a joint venture between Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, is one of more than 20 major industrial sites that South Korean companies are currently building in the United States.",
      "Many South Koreans view the Georgia raid as a source of national disgrace and remain stunned over it. Only 10 days earlier, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and U.S. President Donald Trump held their first summit in Washington on Aug. 25. In late July, South Korea also promised hundreds of billions of dollars in U.S. investments to reach a tariff deal.",

But South Korean experts and officials said Washington has yet to act on Seoul\u2019s yearslong demand to ensure a visa system to accommodate skilled Korean workers needed to build facilities, though it has been pressing South Korea to expand industrial investments in the U.S.",

      "Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 lineup is here",
      "NEW YORK -- Apple's iPhone 17 lineup is here. The tech giant on Tuesday unveiled four new models that mark the latest editions to its marquee product.",
      "That includes the introduction of the iPhone Air, which Apple says is its thinnest smartphone yet. And, as seen in years past, its newest phones boast better cameras, longer lasting batteries and a handful of other upgrades across the board. The latest devices come with a new a A19 chip, which will particularly help power Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence features.",
      "Tuesday's lineup mark the first phones Apple has released since President Donald Trump returned to the White House and unleased a barrage of tariffs impacting goods that businesses sell and consumers buy every day. Some analysts speculated that California-based Apple may raise iPhone prices leading up to Tuesday's announcement. But for the most part, Apple is sticking with the same price tags it's slapped on its newest iPhones over recent years, just weeks after Google also held steady on prices for its new Pixel smartphones.",
      "Here's what to know about the iPhone 17, which officially hits stores Sept. 19 \u2014 and other gadget updates.",
      "Apple's going price for the iPhone 17 begins at about $800 \u2014 compared to $1,100 and $1,200 for its iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max models. The iPhone Air will start at $1,000.",
      "Most of that aligns with the pricing Apple has rolled out with its new iPhones over the last five years \u2014 with the exception of the Pro, which is $100 more expensive this year. But that still falls within the $800 to $1,200 range that the company has outlined between its most basic and top offerings since 2020.",
      "Apple's latest iPhone lineup arrives as companies across industries face rising costs from Trump's new punishing tariffs on imports from around the world. And the Trump administration has also repeatedly insisted that iPhones should be made in the U.S., rather than in the company's current manufacturing hubs overseas. But analysts stress that this is an unrealistic demand that would take years to pull off \u2014 and could result in doubling, or event tripling, iPhone's current average price of $1,000.",
      "In addition to better camera quality on its front and back facing lenses, iPhone 17\u2019s front camera has been upgraded across its lineup to have a wider field of view and new sensor, allowing you to take landscape photos and other selfie orientations without having to rotate your phone.",
      "iPhone's new Air offering also gives users the option to record videos using the front and back cameras simultaneously. Meanwhile, the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max added a more powerful telephoto lens, among other improvements.",
      "Apple also boasted longer battery life across its iPhone 17 lineup. It said that its new iPhone Air, in particular, would be the tech giant's most power-efficient iPhone yet.",
      "The iPhones Apple rolled out last year were the first the company designed with a wide range of new AI features. The iPhone 17 lineup announced Tuesday doesn't make as many leaps as its predecessor \u2014 but each phone will come with Apple's latest operating system, iOS 26, which will feature incremental AI advances.",

Apple on Tuesday also pointed to other features powered with AI that are specific to the iPhone 17 line, such as its new \u201cCenter Stage\u201d feature for its front-facing camera.",
      "Still, Apple is playing a bit of catchup in the AI arena overall, and has run into some recent missteps. While the iPhone 16 has proven to be popular, the models didn\u2019t sell quite as well as analysts had anticipated because Apple failed to deliver all the AI-fueled improvements it had promised, including a smarter and more versatile Siri assistant. The Siri improvements have been pushed back until next year.",
      "In addition to the iPhone 17, Apple also unveiled other gadget updates on Tuesday \u2014 including AirPods Pro 3, Apple Watch Series 11 and Apple Watch Ultra 3.",
      "Among updates to Apple's newest AirPods is live translation, which uses on-device AI to translate when other languages are spoken around the person using them. Similar live translation offerings have been previous rolled out by rival Google, for its Pixel products. Apple's AirPods Pro 3 will be priced at $249.",
      "Apple's boasted a new \u201csleep score\u201d tracking feature and hypertension notifications for its Series 11 smart watch. The hypertension feature flags for potential high blood pressure \u2014 taking data from the heart rate sensor and analyzing it for patterns related to hypertension. Apple on Tuesday noted that this is still pending approval from the Food and Drug Administration.",

Available starting Sept. 19, the Ultra 3 is priced at $799, while the Series 11 is $399. Apple's latest update to the Apple Watch SE, its simplest watch offering, will be $249.",

      "Although falling short of its self-declared intention to \u201cBlock Everything,\u201d the protest movement that started online over the summer caused widespread hot spots of disruption, defying an exceptional deployment of 80,000 police who broke up barricades and swiftly made arrests.",

      "Still, the initial protests appeared less intense than previous bouts of unrest that have sporadically rocked Macron\u2019s leadership. They included months of nationwide so-called yellow vest demonstrations that roiled his first term as president. After his reelection in 2022, Macron faced firestorms of anger over unpopular pension reforms and nationwide unrest and rioting in 2023 after the deadly police shooting of a teenager on Paris\u2019 outskirts.",
      "Nevertheless, groups of protesters repeatedly tried to block Paris' beltway during the morning rush hour on Wednesday. They erected barricades and hurled objects at police officers, blocked and slowed traffic and carried out other protest actions. It added to the sense of crisis that has again gripped France following its latest government collapse on Monday, when Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou lost a parliamentary confidence vote.",

Some of the workers, who were being investigated for visa issues, were shackled.",
      "Administration officials insist that trade will not be impacted, but foreign policy analysts have watched deteriorating relationships with alarm.

      "Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear his appeal of the $1.4 billion judgment a Connecticut jury and judge issued against him for calling the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting a hoax staged by crisis actors.",
      "The Infowars host is arguing that the judge was wrong to find him liable for defamation and infliction of emotional distress without holding a trial on the merits of allegations lodged by relatives of victims of the shooting, which killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut.",
      "Judge Barbara Bellis, frustrated at what she called Jones' repeated failure to abide by court rulings and to turn over certain evidence to the Sandy Hook families, issued a rare default ruling against Jones and his company in late 2021 as a penalty. That meant that she found him liable without a trial on the facts and convened a jury to only determine what damages he owed.",
      "A six-person jury in Waterbury issued a $964 million verdict in October 2022 in favor of the plaintiffs \u2014 an FBI agent who responded to the shooting and relatives of eight children and adults who were killed. Bellis later tacked on another $473 million in punitive damages against Jones and Free Speech Systems, Infowars' parent company that is based in Austin, Texas.",
      "During the trial to determine damages, relatives of the shooting victims testified that people whom they called followers of Jones subjected them to death and rape threats, in-person harassment and abusive comments on social media. Jones argues there was never any proof presented that linked him to those actions.",
      "Jones filed his request to the Supreme Court on Friday and it was released by the court on Tuesday.",
      "Jones' lawyers \u2014 Ben Broocks, Shelby Jordan and Alan Daughtry \u2014 insist in the petition that state courts cannot determine liability based only on sanctions such as default rulings. They say that constitutional law and Supreme Court precedent require public figures such as the Sandy Hook families to prove their defamation claims against journalists such as Jones.",
      "They also say that the Connecticut judge imposed the default ruling on Jones based on \u201ctrivial\u201d reasons and that Jones had substantially complied with the court\u2019s orders \u2014 which the Sandy Hook families\u2019 lawyers deny.",
      "Jones' attorneys further cite First Amendment protections for free speech, saying Jones' comments about the school shooting being a hoax were not defamatory but rather \u201cexpressions of constitutionally protected opinion.\" Jones has since said he believed the shooting was \u201c100% real.\"",
      "\"The media landscape is rife with groups challenging various events, including Holocaust denial, moon landing skepticism, 9/11 conspiracy theories, and even flat Earth claims,\u201d the petition says. \u201cHowever, such statements critique or dismiss the events themselves, not the character, conduct, or reputation of those associated with them.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere is no legitimate basis for the U.S. Supreme Court to accept this last gasp from Alex Jones and we will oppose it in due course,\u201d Christopher Mattei, a lawyer for the families, said in a statement.",
      "A mid-level appellate court in Connecticut upheld all but $150 million of the $1.4 billion judgment in December, and the state Supreme Court declined to hear Jones' appeal of that ruling in April.",
      "In a similar defamation lawsuit filed in Texas by the parents of another Sandy Hook victim, Jones was found liable without a trial as punishment for failing to turn over documents. In that case, which also is being appealed, a judge and jury issued a $49 million judgment against Jones in August 2022.",
      "Jones filed for bankruptcy in late 2022. In those proceedings, an auction was held in November to liquidate Infowars' assets to help pay the defamation judgments, and the satirical news outlet The Onion was named the winning bidder. But the bankruptcy judge threw out the auction results, citing problems with the process and The Onion's bid.",

      "Home Depot stores in Southern California have long been an informal hub for day laborers in the country both legally and illegally who are seeking work",
      "LOS ANGELES -- At a Home Depot parking lot, a man patrols on a bicycle for federal immigration agents, toting a megaphone on his hip so he can blast a warning to day laborers waiting to land a landscaping or construction job.",
      "The workers from Mexico, El Salvador and elsewhere carry whistles to also sound the alarm, while activists swap details over two-way radios about whether cars whizzing by could be unmarked vehicles carrying officers preparing for a raid.",
      "Their work is cut out for them. Agents have raided the lot outside the 108,000 square-foot Home Depot store in the Van Nuys neighborhood of Los Angeles at least five times this summer, rounding up some immigrants and sending others running in search of safety.",
      "Home Depot stores in Southern California have long been an informal job-seeking hub for day laborers in the country both legally and illegally. Now the locations have become a prime target for immigration agents.",
      "In fact, Home Depot was reportedly mentioned as a target for immigration raids by Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff and chief architect of President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies, earlier this year.",
      "At least a dozen Home Depot stores have been targeted, some of them repeatedly, in Southern California since the administration stepped up its immigration crackdown this summer.",
      "Immigrant advocates sued over the raids but on Monday the Supreme Court cleared the way for federal agents to continue conducting sweeping immigration operations for now in Los Angeles, the latest victory for the Trump administration at the high court. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called it \u201ca win\u201d for the rule of law, while advocates swiftly criticized the ruling.",
      "\u201cWhen you undermine the civil rights of those who are more vulnerable, you undermine the civil rights of everyone else,\" Pablo Alvarado, co-executive director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said Monday during a press conference held near a Home Depot.",
      "Last month, outside a Home Depot in Monrovia, a man ran onto a nearby freeway to flee immigration authorities, and was struck and killed.",
      "The Van Nuys location has been hit particularly hard.",
      "Javier, a 52-year-old Mexican immigrant who has lived in U.S. states spanning from California to Kansas over the past three decades, said he narrowly escaped three raids at the store, avoiding agents by hiding beneath a truck, peeling off in his car and dashing inside among the busy shoppers.",
      "\u201cThey come in big vans and they all go out to chase people,\u201d he said in Spanish, asking that his last name not be used out of fear of government reprisal.",
      "The store sits on property near the Van Nuys Airport that is owned by Los Angeles World Airports, a department in a city whose policies limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement that her office supports the litigation against the sweeps and has trained city workers to prepare for immigration enforcement on city-owned properties.",
      "City councilperson Ysabel Jurado has voiced opposition to a plan for a new Home Depot in her district, contending the company hasn\u2019t done enough to fight the raids.",
      "Chris Newman, legal director for the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, said \u201cthese locations should be protected by the city to the same degree the public libraries are.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Immigrant advocates say the country\u2019s largest big-box home improvement retailer benefits from having an ample labor pool at the ready for contractors and should do more to protect customers, employees and day laborers.",

      "The Atlanta-based company, with nearly $160 billion in annual sales through Feb. 2, counts on contractors and professionals for about half its business \u2014 and that's a key draw for largely immigrant-day laborers. Its second-ranked competitor, Lowe's, gets about 30% of its business from contractors, relying more heavily on homeowners and DIY enthusiasts, said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.",
      "\u201cSo if you\u2019re going for the volume, if you\u2019re going where people are, and you can enforce things, you go to Home Depot,\u201d Saunders said.",
      "The raids haven\u2019t hurt overall sales, but the disruptions could affect specific stores by making some customers afraid to shop there, Saunders said.",
      "In the Los Angeles area, the company\u2019s stores saw a 10.7% decline in foot traffic in June from a year ago and a 10% decline in July, according to Placer.ai, an analytics firm that tracks people\u2019s movements based on cellphone usage. That\u2019s a larger drop than the 3.8% and 2.7% declines reported at stores nationwide for the same months.",
      "Home Depot has repeatedly denied being involved in immigration enforcement operations. The company\u2019s late co-founder Bernie Marcus supported Trump, though a Home Depot political action committee has donated to both Democrats and Republicans.",
      "The company said it isn't told if a raid is going to take place at any of its roughly 2,300 stores.",
      "\u201cWe tell associates to report any suspected immigration enforcement activity immediately and not engage with the activity for their safety,\u201d said Beth Marlowe, a company spokesperson, adding that if employees feel uneasy after a raid, they can go home for the rest of the day with pay.",
      "In Van Nuys, witnesses said federal agents have arrested those in the lot before appearing to ask about their immigration status. Local managers have shut the store's automated glass doors to keep agents out, they said.",
      "\u201cThey're just fishing,\u201d said Luis, a 37-year-old day laborer who is a legal resident and grew up in the United States after arriving from Mexico as a child. He declined to use his last name fearing government reprisal.",
      "The trend of workers gathering outside Home Depot began with the rise of the home improvement retail store that allowed people, including contractors, to price shop and buy materials directly, said Nik Theodore, a professor of urban planning and policy at the University of Illinois in Chicago.",
      "\u201cThe basis of competition began to shift and what distinguishes a contractor from getting the bid or not more and more has to do with labor costs,\u201d Theodore said. \u201cHome Depot is not an innocent bystander in all of this. Their sources of success were instrumental in catalyzing this change.\u201d",
      "As the trend grew so did complaints about workers congregating in store parking lots, and in 2008 Los Angeles passed an ordinance requiring similar retailers opening up to adopt plans to provide relief, such as a seating area, bathrooms and trash facilities.",
      "In the parking lot in Van Nuys, a non-profit runs a labor center that takes workers' names and tracks employers who fail to pay as promised. That's one reason workers said they keep returning even after the repeated raids.",
      "The other is community.",
      "Since the raids, Javier said he's started considering returning to Mexico to wait out the Trump administration. In the meantime, he said he'll keep coming to Van Nuys to find work.",
      "\u201cIt's a place that becomes familiar,\u201d he said. \u201cHere, all of us together, we've become friends.\u201d",

      "South Korea's foreign minister has traveled to the U.S. to address the detention of over 300 South Korean workers",
      "POOLER, Ga. -- After more than 300 South Korean workers were taken into custody during a raid on an electric battery plant in Georgia, the country's foreign minister traveled to the U.S. this week in hopes of bringing them home.",
      "The Koreans were among some 475 workers detained during the raid Thursday's raid at the battery factory under construction on the campus of Hyundai\u2019s sprawling auto plant west of Savannah.",
      "South Korea's Foreign Ministry said Seoul and Washington were discussing details for the workers' return. Late Tuesday, the State Department announced that Secretary Marco Rubio will meet with Foreign Minister Cho Hyun at the White House on Wednesday morning.",
      "Here are some things to know about the raid and its aftermath.",
      "A Korean Air Boeing 747-8i departed from Seoul late Tuesday and was expected to arrive in Atlanta on Wednesday to bring the workers home.",
      "The workers were being held at an immigration detention center in Folkston, in southeast Georgia, near the state line with Florida. It\u2019s a 285-mile (460-kilometer) drive from there to Atlanta.",
      "South Korean officials said they\u2019ve been negotiating with the U.S. to win \u201cvoluntary\u201d departures for the workers, rather than deportations that could make them ineligible to return to the U.S. for up to 10 years.",
      "South Korean TV showed Cho Ki-joong, consul general at the Korean Embassy in Washington, speaking outside the detention center. He said some administrative steps remained to be completed but that things were going smoothly. The South Korean Foreign Ministry declined to comment on media reports that he and other diplomats met with detained workers.",
      "U.S. authorities have said that those detained during the raid were \u201cunlawfully working\u201d at the plant. But Charles Kuck, a lawyer representing several of the detained South Koreans, said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the workers from South Korea were doing work that is authorized under the B-1 business visitor visa program.",
      "A B-1 visitor for business visa allows foreign workers to stay for up to six months, getting reimbursed for expenses while collecting a paycheck back home. There are limits \u2014 for example, they can supervise construction projects but can\u2019t build anything themselves \u2014 but if it\u2019s spelled out in a contract, they can install equipment, Los Angeles immigration lawyer Angelo Paparelli said.",
      "Also, South Korea is one of 41 countries whose citizens can use the U.S. Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA), which provides a visa waiver if they can provide \u201ca legitimate reason\u2019\u2019 for their visit, and this basically gives them B-1 visa status for up to 90 days, said immigration attorney Rita Sostrin in Los Angeles.",
      "In Pooler, a suburb of Savannah, the sprawling Hyundai electric vehicle plant has triggered noticeable growth.",
      "Signs in shopping center parking lots point to homes for sale in new subdivisions nearby. Construction crews work on multistory apartment buildings while finished apartments in the same complex display large banners proclaiming they\u2019re ready for new residents.",
      "Meanwhile, a growing number of Korean restaurants and Asian grocery stores have found a home among standard American fast-food franchises and chain eateries like Starbucks and Cracker Barrel.",
      "Ruby Gould, president of the Korean American Association of Greater Savannah, said there\u2019s no question that last week\u2019s raid has raised anxiety among the area\u2019s Korean immigrants.",
      "\u201cPeople are very upset about the incident, the arrest of the workers,\u201d Gould said. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are some people in fear about this visa situation after they witnessed what\u2019s happened.\u201d",

      "But that hardly mattered as the Guardians rolled to their fourth straight win, 10-2 to jump the Royals in the standings.",
      "Leaning on a slow curve ball manager Stephen Vogt said had surprising \u201cteeth,\u201d Cecconi dominated the Royals over the first seven innings before Massey lined a 2-1 fastball into left-center for Kansas City's first hit.",

      "PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Steelers emerged from their season opener against the New York Jets unbeaten but not unscathed.",
      "Enter Jabrill Peppers.",
      "Coach Mike Tomlin said Tuesday the Steelers are signing the veteran safety while starter DeShon Elliott recovers from a knee injury suffered in the first half against the Jets.",
      "Peppers, 29, became a free agent when he was cut by New England last month. Pittsburgh will be Peppers' fourth NFL stop following stints with Cleveland (2017-18), the New York Giants (2019-21) and the Patriots (2022-24).",
      "Tomlin pointed to Peppers' versatility in the secondary and his ability to be a difference-maker on special teams as major factors in the signing.",
      "\u201cHe's a football player first, a positional player second,\u201d Tomlin said.",
      "Peppers could get an opportunity to play right away when the Steelers (1-0) host Seattle (0-1) in their home opener on Sunday.",
      "Pittsburgh turned to veteran Chuck Clark \u2014 who was cut at the end of training camp before being signed to the practice squad \u2014 after Elliott left against the Jets, though Tomlin didn't rule out Peppers being available quickly.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see how we divide the labor up as we get into the week,\u201d Tomlin said. \u201cTheir ability to communicate and execute obviously will be a major component of how we divide that labor up and go from there.\u201d",
      "Tomlin declined to say whether Elliott is a candidate for injured reserve, saying only that Elliott will definitely miss at least one week.",
      "Elliott, who signed a contract extension through 2027 in June, was serving as the hub of communication for an overhauled secondary that now includes newcomers Jalen Ramsey and Darius Slay.",
      "Where those duties will fall going forward is uncertain, though Pittsburgh's defense did just enough down the stretch to avoid the upset against New York. While the Steelers gave up 394 yards (including 182 on the ground) to an offense led by former Pittsburgh quarterback Justin Fields, they also made a pair of critical late stops.",
      "The Steelers forced a three-and-out on the Jets' penultimate possession and Ramsey ended any last-gasp effort by drilling New York wide receiver Garrett Wilson on fourth down near midfield, sealing the victory.",

      "The Steelers gave up four sacks total, with former first-round pick Broderick Jones struggling at left tackle. Jones, taken 14th overall in 2023, repeatedly had trouble with New York defensive end Will McDonald, who dropped Rodgers twice.",
      "Tomlin declined to single out Jones specifically, saying \u201call of our performances could be better,\u201d and defended the 24-year-old's mental toughness.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s football, you know?\u201d Tomlin said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to the National Football League by being fragile, emotionally. There's a lot of confident guys that I work with. You win some battles, you lose some battles. You come back fighting. That\u2019s just the nature of the men that play this game at this level.\u201d",
      "Peppers would know. The 25th overall pick in the 2017 draft (taken five spots ahead of Steelers star outside linebacker TJ Watt) was traded to the New York Giants after two years in Cleveland, then moved on to the Patriots in 2022.",
      "He turned a one-year contract with New England into a multiyear deal but spent the better part of two months of the 2024 season on the commissioner\u2019s exempt list following his arrest on multiple charges stemming from a domestic incident. A jury acquitted Peppers in January, but his time with the Patriots ended in August when first-year head coach Mike Vrabel made Peppers among the team's final cuts.",
      "Tomlin said he did plenty of studying up on Peppers in the lead-up to the 2017 draft, and took note of how Michigan deployed him, including having him get time on offense during his final season with the Wolverines.",
      "While that is not in play in Pittsburgh, Peppers' ability to adapt has stuck with Tomlin through the years.",
      "\u201cHe was just used in a real unique way in Michigan that really highlighted his talents, man,\u201d Tomlin said. \u201cI think he was even a two-way player at one point. ... He returned kicks. He was just a well-rounded football player in all areas of the game.\u201d",
      "NOTES: Rookie defensive tackle Derrick Harmon (knee) is expected to miss his second straight game on Sunday. ... Inside linebacker Malik Harrison (knee) is also out. ... Outside linebacker Nick Herbig (hamstring) could return after sitting out the opener.",

      "Experts say a ship likely cut cables in the Red Sea, disrupting internet access in Africa, Asia and the Middle East",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- A ship likely cut cables in the Red Sea that disrupted internet access in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, experts said Tuesday, showing the lines' vulnerability over a year after another incident severed them.",
      "The International Cable Protection Committee told The Associated Press that 15 submarine cables pass through the narrow Bab el-Mandeb Strait, the southern mouth of the Red Sea that separates East Africa from the Arabian Peninsula.",
      "Over the weekend, authorities in multiple countries identified the cables affected as the South East Asia\u2013Middle East\u2013Western Europe 4, the India-Middle East-Western Europe and the FALCON GCX cables. On Tuesday, that list expanded to include the Europe India Gateway cable as well, said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at the firm Kentik.",
      "Initial reporting suggested the cut happened off the coast of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, something authorities in the kingdom have not acknowledged, nor have the companies managing the cables.",
      "\u201cEarly independent analysis indicates that the probable cause of damage is commercial shipping activity in the region,\u201d John Wrottesley, the committee's operations manager, told the AP. \u201cDamage to submarine cables from dragged anchors account for approximately 30% of incidents each year representing around 60 faults.\u201d",
      "Madory also told the AP that the working assumption was a commercial vessel dropped its anchor and dragged it across the four cables, severing the connections. Cabling in the Red Sea can be at a shallow depth, making it easier for an anchor drag to affect them.",

      "Undersea cables are one of the backbones of the internet, along with satellite connections and land-based cables. Typically, internet service providers have multiple access points and reroute traffic if one fails.",
      "However, rerouting traffic can cause latency, or lag, for internet users. Madory said it appeared at least 10 nations in Africa, Asia and the Middle East had been affected by the cable cut. Among those nations were India, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "\u201cNobody\u2019s completely offline, but each provider has lost a subset of their international transit,\u201d Madory said. \"So if you imagine this is like an equivalent to plumbing and you lose some volume of water coming down the pipes ... and now you just have less volumes to carry the traffic.\u201d",
      "Cable security also has been a concern amid attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels on ships over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. In early 2024, Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government in exile alleged that the Houthis planned to attack undersea cables. Several later were cut, possibly by a ship attacked by the Houthis dragging its anchor, but the rebels denied being responsible.",

      "A prosecutor has recommended five years of probation and restitution payments for former CEO Carl Ferrer and sales director Dan Hyer, both of whom pleaded guilty to conspiracy in 2018. The prosecutor said both men acknowledged their crimes and cooperated with authorities by testifying against a company founder during the 2023 trial.",
      "Backpage founder Michael Lacey was convicted of a single count of international concealment money laundering and sentenced to five years in prison and fined $3 million, though he remains free while he pursues an appeal. Chief financial officer John Brunst and executive vice president Scott Spear are each serving 10-year sentences for conspiracy and money laundering convictions.",
      "Prosecutors had argued that Backpage\u2019s operators ignored warnings to stop running prostitution ads, some involving children. The operators were accused of giving free ads to sex workers and cultivating arrangements with others who worked in the industry to get them to post ads with the company.",
      "Backpage\u2019s operators said they never allowed ads for sex and made an effort to try to delete such ads by assigning employees to remove them and creating automated tools. Their legal team maintained the content on the site was protected by the First Amendment.",
      "In pleading guilty, Ferrer acknowledged knowing a majority of Backpage\u2019s revenues came from escort ads, conspiring to sanitize ads by removing photos and words that were indicative of prostitution and publishing a revised version of the notices.",
      "In sentencing memos, both the prosecutor and Ferrer\u2019s attorneys say he helped shut down the site through his cooperation.",

      "Before launching Backpage, Lacey founded the Phoenix New Times weekly newspaper with James Larkin, who was charged in the case and died by suicide in 2023 just before the second trial against Backpage\u2019s operators was scheduled to begin.",
      "Lacey and Larkin held ownership interests in other weeklies such as The Village Voice and ultimately sold their newspapers in 2013. But they held onto Backpage, which authorities say generated $500 million in prostitution-related revenue from its inception in 2004 until 2018, when the government shut it down.",
      "A U.S. Government Accountability Office report released in June 2021 said the FBI\u2019s ability to identify victims and sex traffickers had decreased significantly after Backpage was seized by the government, because law enforcement was familiar with the site and Backpage was generally responsive to requests for information.",

And it is certainly reasonable for authorities to sit down and say we want to develop rules for the road,\u201d said Kian Vesteinsson, senior research analyst for technology and democracy at the Washington-based nonprofit Freedom House.",
      "\u201cBut what we see in Nepal is that wholesale blocks as a means of enforcing a set of rules for social media companies results in wildly disproportionate harms. These measures that were put in place in Nepal (cut) tens of millions of people off from platforms that they used to express themselves, to conduct daily business, to speak with their families, to go to school, to get healthcare information.\u201d",
      "It's not just Nepal. Freedom House has found that global internet freedom has declined for the 14th consecutive year in 2024, as governments crack down on dissent and people face arrest for expressing political, social or religious views online.

      "The Committee to Protect Journalists said Monday that the protests \u201cunderscore the widespread concerns over Nepal\u2019s ban on social media and the pressing need for the government to drop its order. Such a sweeping ban not only restricts freedom of expression, it also severely hinders journalists\u2019 work and the public\u2019s right to know.\u201d",

      "Nepal\u2019s government has faced violent protests over a ban on popular social media platforms, leading to police use of deadly force and the resignation of the prime minister",
      "KATHMANDU, Nepal -- KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) \u2014 Nepal\u2019s government responded to escalating violent protests over a ban on popular social media platforms with deadly force. The public outrage over the ban and the deaths of 19 protesters on Monday led to the resignation of the prime minister and exposed deep discontent over corruption.",
      "Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli also rolled backed the short-lived ban after protesters turned their anger on politicians by setting fire to homes of some of the country\u2019s top leaders.",
      "Led by mostly teenagers and young adults, the protests revealed a broader resentment in Nepal, where many people have increasingly become angry with the government over a range of issues, mostly to do with corruption and frustration over nepotism in the country\u2019s politics.",
      "\u201cProtests over the social media ban were just a catalyst. Frustrations over how the country is being run have long been simmering under the surface. People are very angry and Nepal finds itself in a very precarious situation,\u201d said Prateek Pradhan, editor of Baahrakhari, a Nepalese independent news website.",
      "Demonstrations in Nepal have been called the protest of Gen Z, which generally refers to people born between 1995 and 2010. They were largely in response to the ban that went into effect last week and government\u2019s larger attempt to regulate social media through a bill that requires platforms to register and submit to local oversight and regulations.",
      "The bill, which has not yet been fully debated in parliament, has been widely criticized as a tool for censorship and punishing opponents who voice their protests online. Rights groups have called it an attempt by the government to curb freedom of expression and violate fundamental rights.",
      "At the same time, the protests were also a tipping point of a longstanding sentiment against politicians, their families and concerns over corruption.",
      "In the weeks before the ban, a social media campaign \u2014 particularly on video-sharing platform TikTok \u2014 spotlighted the lavish lifestyles of politicians\u2019 children, highlighting disparities between Nepal\u2019s rich and poor. Protesters criticized them of flaunting their luxury possessions in a country where the per capita income is $1,400 a year.",
      "Widespread criticism over government\u2019s failure to pursue some major corruption cases and create more economic opportunities for the youth also added to the anger. The youth unemployment rate in Nepal was 20% last year, according to the World Bank.",
      "\u201cAll these issues have made the youth of Nepal dissatisfied. They saw no other option but to take to the streets,\u201d said Pradhan.",
      "The unrest is the worst in decades in the Himalayan nation that is wedged between India and China. It is also far violent than the one in 2006, when an uprising forced Nepal\u2019s former king to give up his authoritarian rule. At least 18 people were killed in the violence. Two years later the parliament voted to abolish the monarchy.",
      "Over the years, many Nepalis have grown frustrated with the republic, saying it has failed to bring about political stability.",

      "The security forces\u2019 violent response appears to have further exacerbated tensions. On Tuesday, protests spread to other parts of Nepal, including suburbs of Kathmandu.",

      "A new study finds that climate change is increasing sugar consumption in the United States",
      "WASHINGTON -- Global warming in the United States is amping up the country's sweet tooth, a new study found.",
      "When the temperature rises, Americans \u2014 especially those with less money and education \u2014 drink lots more sugary beverages and a bit more frozen desserts. That amounts to more than 100 million pounds of added sugar (358 million kilograms) consumed in the nation a year, compared to 15 years earlier, according to a team of researchers in the U.S. and United Kingdom.",
      "When temperatures go between 54 and 86 degrees (12 and 30 degrees Celsius), the amount of sugar the average American consumes goes up by about 0.4 grams per degree Fahrenheit (0.7 grams per degree Celsius) per day, based on researchers tracking of weather conditions and consumers' purchases. At 54 degrees, the amount of added sugar for the average American is a little more than 2 grams. At 86 degrees, it\u2019s more than 15 grams.",
      "Beyond that, appetites lessen and added sugar falls off, according to the study in Monday's Nature Climate Change.",
      "\u201cClimate change is shaping what you eat and how you eat and that might have a bad effect on your health,\u201d said study co-author Duo Chan, a climate scientist at the University of Southampton.",
      "\u201cPeople tend to take in more sweetened beverages as the temperature is getting higher and higher,\u201d Chan said. \u201cObviously under a warming climate that would cause you to drink more or take in more sugar. And that is going to be a severe problem when it comes to health.\u201d",
      "The daily difference from higher temperatures doesn't amount to even a single candy bar for the average person. But it adds up over time and has a big effect, said University of California San Francisco endocrinology professor Dr. Robert Lustig, a specialist in pediatrics and obesity who wasn't part of the study.",
      "Lustig wrote in an email that among poorer Americans, just one added can of sugary soft drink per day increases diabetes risk by 29% \u2014 and temperature-related thirst plays a big part in America\u2019s obesity epidemic.",
      "The United States\u2019 average annual temperature has gone up about 2.2 degrees (1.2 degrees Celsius) since 1895, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "To chart the impact on sugar consumption, researchers compared it to the American Heart Association recommendations: limiting daily intake to 36 grams for men and 25 grams for women.",
      "The team then compared wind, precipitation and humidity records to the detailed purchase records of 40,000 to 60,000 American households from 2004 to 2019, not using any data after the pandemic hit. Then they looked at the nutritional information of the items bought. That allowed them to eliminate other factors to make a causal link and come up with a calculation for how much extra sugar is consumed per person per degree, said lead author Pan He, an environmental scientist at Cardiff University.",

      "The researchers found that men consumed more sugary soft drinks, and that the amount of added sugar consumed during hot weather was several times higher for low- and very low-income families than for the wealthiest, the study found.",
      "People who work outside drank more sugary drinks than those who work inside, and the same went for families where the head of the household was less educated. White people have the highest added sugar effect, while Asians showed no significant change in added sugar in the heat.",
      "Lustig said sugary drinks are marketed and priced in a way to attract the poor, and in many disadvantaged communities the water tastes funny because of chemicals in them. Poor people are also less likely to have air conditioning and are more likely to work outside and need more hydration, Lustig and He said.",
      "\u201cIt should concern us that the rate of the impact is larger in households where people make less money or are less educated,\u201d said Dr. Courtney Howard, vice chair of the Global Climate and Health Alliance. \u201cThese groups tend to have lower baseline health status, so this is an area where climate-related changes appear to magnify existing health inequalities.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- On a recent sunny morning in a channel at the Port of Los Angeles, seven blue steel structures that look like small boats are lowered into the ocean one by one. Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.",
      "This is the nation\u2019s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port \u2014 enough to power up to 60,000 homes.",
      "Co-founder and CEO Inna Braverman said that much power could be a \u201cgame changer in terms of clean energy production\u201d for the port and the communities around it. America\u2019s shipping ports have long struggled with dirty air that harms the health of people living nearby.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re starting here in LA, but we hope, aspire and believe that we will be in the United States and in other locations around the world,\u201d she said, standing outside a blue shipping container serving as the project\u2019s power station.",
      "Wave energy is an emerging industry that\u2019s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.",
      "Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America\u2019s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.",
      "Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port\u2019s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,\u201d said R\u00e9mi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.\u201d",
      "A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.",
      "But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.",
      "The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain. An offshore wave energy system came online off the coast of Hawaii in 2016.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state. Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.",
      "As the small blue floats bob up and down, each pushes a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. Pressure in the tanks builds up. That pressure turns a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.",

She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn\u2019t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.",

      "Artificial intelligence is transforming call centers by streamlining tasks and improving customer service",
      "NEW YORK -- Armen Kirakosian remembers the frustrations of his first job as a call center agent nearly 10 years ago: the aggravated customers, the constant searching through menus for information and the notes he had to physically write for each call he handled.",
      "Thanks to artificial intelligence, the 29-year-old from Athens, Greece, is no longer writing notes or clicking on countless menus. He often has full customer profiles in front of him when a person calls in and may already know what problem the customer has before even saying \u201chello.\u201d He can spend more time actually serving the customer.",
      "\u201cA.I. has taken (the) robot out of us,\u201d Kirakosian said.",
      "Roughly 3 million Americans work in call center jobs, and millions more work in call centers around the world, answering billions of inquiries a year about everything from broken iPhones to orders for shoes. Kirakosian works for TTEC, a company that provides third party customer service lines in 22 countries to companies in industries such as autos and banking that need extra capacity or have outsourced their call center operations.",
      "Answering these calls can be thankless work. Roughly half of all customer service agents leave the job after a year, according to McKinsey, with stress and monotonous work being among the reasons employees quit.",
      "Much of what these agents deal with is referred to in the industry as \u201cbreak/fix,\u201d which means something is broken \u2014 or wrong or confusing \u2014 and the customer expects the person on the phone to fix the problem. Now, it\u2019s a question of who will be tasked with the fix: a human, a computer, or a human augmented by a computer.",
      "Already, AI agents have taken over more routine call center tasks. Some jobs have been lost and there have been dire forecasts about the future job market for these individuals, ranging from modest single-percentage point losses, to as many as half of all call center jobs going away in the next decade. The drop likely won't match the more dire predictions, however, because it's become evident that the industry will still need humans, perhaps with even higher levels of learning and training, as some customer service issues become increasingly harder to solve.",
      "Some finance companies have already experimented with going in heavily with AI for their customer service issues.",
      "Klarna, the Swedish buy now, pay later company, replaced 700 of their roughly 3,000 customer service agents with chatbots and AI in 2024. The results were mixed. While the company did save money, Klarna found there was still a need for higher skilled human agents in certain circumstances, such as complicated issues related to identity theft. Earlier this year, Klarna hired seven internal freelancers to handle these issues.",
      "Earlier this year, Klarna hired a handful of customer service employees back to the firm, acknowledging there were certain issues that AI couldn\u2019t handle as well as a real person, like identity theft.",
      "\u201cOur vision of an AI-first contact center, where AI agents handle the majority of conversations and fewer, better trained and better paid human agents support only the most complex tasks, is quickly becoming a reality,\u201d said Gadi Shamia of Replicant, an AI-software company that trains chatbots to sound more human, in an interview with consultants at McKinsey.",

      "The call center customer's experience, while improved, is still far from perfect.",
      "The initial customer service call has long been handled through interactive voice response systems, known in the industry as IVR. Customers interact with IVR when they're told \u201cpress one for sales, press two for support, press five for billing.\u201d These crude systems got an update in the 2010s, when customers could prompt the system by saying \u201csales\u201d or \u201csupport\u201d or simple phrases like \u201cI\u2019d like to pay a bill\u201d instead of navigating through a labyrinthian set of menu options.",
      "But customers have little patience for these menus, leading them to \u201czero out,\u201d which is call center slang for when a customer hits the zero button on their their keypad in hopes of reaching a human. It\u2019s also not uncommon that after a customer \u201czeros out\u201d they will be put on hold and transferred because they did not end up in the right place for their request.",
      "Aware of Americans' collective impatience with IVR, Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Republican Jim Justice of West Virginia have introduced the \u201cKeep Call Centers in America Act,\u201d which would require clear ways to reach a human agent, and provide incentives to companies that keep call center jobs in the U.S.",
      "Companies are trying to roll out telephone systems that broadly understand customer service requests and predict where to send a customer without navigating a menu. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, is coming out with its \u201cChatGPT Agent\u201d service for users that\u2019s able to understand phrases like \u201cI need to find a hotel for a wedding next year, please give me options for clothing and gifts.\u201d",
      "Bank of America says it has had increasing success in integrating such features into \u201cErica,\u201d its chatbot that debuted in 2018. When Erica cannot handle a request, the agent transfers the customer directly to the right department. Erica is now also predictive and analytical, and knows for instance that a customer may repeatedly have a low balance and may need better help budgeting or may have multiple subscriptions to the same service.",
      "Bank of America said this month that Erica has been used 3 billion times since its creation and is increasingly taking on a higher case load of customer service requests. The chatbot's moniker comes from the last five letters of the company's name.",
      "James Bednar, vice president of product and innovation at TTEC, has spent much of his career trying to make customer service calls less painful for the caller as well as the company. He said these tools could eventually kill off IVR for good, ending the need for anyone to \u201czero out.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe're getting to the point where AI will get you to the right person for your problem without you having to route through those menus,\u201d Bednar said.",

      "New research suggests that a tiny phytoplankton that is an essential part of the marine food web may decline sharply as oceans warm",
      "SEATTLE -- For decades, scientists believed Prochlorococcus, the smallest and most abundant phytoplankton on Earth, would thrive in a warmer world. But new research suggests the microscopic bacterium, which forms the foundation of the marine food web and helps regulate the planet\u2019s climate, will decline sharply as seas heat up.",
      "A study published Monday in the journal Nature Microbiology found Prochlorococcus populations could shrink by as much as half in tropical oceans over the next 75 years if surface waters exceed about 82 degrees Fahrenheit (27.8 Celsius). Many tropical and subtropical sea surface temperatures are already trending above average and are projected to regularly surpass 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 Celsius) over that same period.",
      "\u201cThese are keystone species \u2014 very important ones,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Ribalet, a research associate professor at the University of Washington\u2019s School of Oceanography and the study\u2019s lead author. \u201cAnd when a keystone species decreases in abundance, it always has consequences on ecology and biodiversity. The food web is going to change.\u201d",
      "Prochlorococcus inhabit up to 75% of Earth\u2019s sunlit surface waters and produce about one-fifth of the planet\u2019s oxygen through photosynthesis. More crucially, Ribalet said, they convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into food at the base of the marine ecosystem.",
      "\u201cIn the tropical ocean, nearly half of the food is produced by Prochlorococcus,\u201d he said. \u201cHundreds of species rely on these guys.\u201d",
      "Though other forms of phytoplankton may move in and help compensate for the loss of oxygen and food, Ribalet cautioned they are not perfect substitutes. \u201cEvolution has made this very specific interaction,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, this is going to have an impact on this very unique system that has been established.\u201d",
      "The findings challenge decades of assumptions that Prochlorococcus would thrive as waters warmed. Those predictions, however, were based on limited data from lab cultures. For this study, Ribalet and his team tested water samples while traversing the Pacific over the course of a decade.",
      "Over 100 research cruises \u2014 the equivalent of six trips around the globe \u2014 they counted some 800 billion individual cells taken from samples at every kilometer. In his lab at the University of Washington, Ribalet demonstrated the SeaFlow, a box filled with tubes, wires and a piercing blue laser. The custom-built device continuously pulls in seawater, which allowed the team to count the microbes in real time. \u201cWe have counted more Prochlorococcus than there are stars in the Milky Way,\u201d Ribalet said.",
      "Paul Berube, a research scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies Prochlorococcus but was not involved in the work, said the breadth of data is \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d And he said the results fit with what is known about the microbe\u2019s streamlined genome, which makes it less adaptable to rapid environmental changes.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re at the very base of the food web, and they feed everything else \u2014 the fish eat the things that eat the phytoplankton and we eat the fish,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen changes are being made to the planet that influence these particular organisms that are essentially feeding us, that\u2019s going to have big consequences.\u201d",
      "To test whether Prochlorococcus might evolve to withstand hotter conditions, Ribalet\u2019s team modeled a hypothetical heat-tolerant strain but found that even those would \u201cnot be enough to fully resist the warmest temperature if greenhouse emissions keep rising,\u201d Ribalet said.",
      "He stressed that the study\u2019s projections are conservative and don\u2019t account for the impacts of plastic pollution or other ecological stressors. \u201cWe actually tried to put forth the best-case scenario,\u201d Ribalet said. \u201cIn reality, things may be worse.\u201d",

      "ABOARD LIFTBOAT ROBERT, North Atlantic -- Deep in Earth's past, an icy landscape became a seascape as the ice melted and the oceans rose off what is now the northeastern United States. Nearly 50 years ago, a U.S. government ship searching for minerals and hydrocarbons in the area drilled into the seafloor to see what it could find.",
      "It found, of all things, drops to drink under the briny deeps \u2014 fresh water.",
      "This summer, a first-of-its-kind global research expedition followed up on that surprise. Drilling for fresh water under the salt water off Cape Cod, Expedition 501 extracted thousands of samples from what is now thought to be a massive, hidden aquifer stretching from New Jersey as far north as Maine.",
      "It's just one of many depositories of \u201csecret fresh water\u201d known to exist in shallow salt waters around the world that might some day be tapped to slake the planet\u2019s intensifying thirst, said Brandon Dugan, the expedition's co-chief scientist.",
      "\u201cWe need to look for every possibility we have to find more water for society,\u201d Dugan, a geophysicist and hydrologist at the Colorado School of Mines, told Associated Press journalists who recently spent 12 hours on the drilling platform. The research teams looked in \u201cone of the last places you would probably look for fresh water on Earth.\u201d",
      "They found it, and will be analyzing nearly 50,000 liters (13,209 gallons) of it back in their labs around the world in the coming months. They're out to solve the mystery of its origins \u2014 whether the water is from glaciers, connected groundwater systems on land or some combination.",
      "The potential is enormous. So are the hurdles of getting the water out and puzzling over who owns it, who uses it and how to extract it without undue harm to nature. It's bound to take years to bring that water ashore for public use in a big way, if it's even feasible.",
      "Why try? In just five years, the U.N. says, the global demand for fresh water will exceed supplies by 40%. Rising sea levels from the warming climate are souring coastal freshwater sources while data centers that power AI and cloud computing are consuming water at an insatiable rate.",
      "The fabled Ancient Mariner\u2019s lament, \u201cWater, water, every where, nor any drop to drink,\u201d looms as a warning to landlubbers as well as to sailors on salty seas.",
      "In Virginia alone, a quarter of all power produced in the state goes to data centers, a share expected to nearly double in five years. By some estimates, each midsize data center consumes as much water as 1,000 households. Each of the Great Lakes states has experienced groundwater shortages.",
      "Cape Town, South Africa, came perilously close to running out of fresh water for its nearly 5 million people in 2018 during an epic, three-year drought. South Africa is thought to have a coastal undersea freshwater bonanza, too, and there is at least anecdotal evidence that every continent may have the same.",
      "Canada's Prince Edward Island, Hawaii and Jakarta, Indonesia, are among places where stressed freshwater supplies coexist with prospective aquifers under the ocean.",
      "Enter Expedition 501, a $25 million scientific collaboration of more than a dozen countries backed by the U.S. government's National Science Foundation and the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (U.S. money for it was secured before budget cuts sought by the Trump administration).",
      "Scientists went into the project believing the undersea aquifer they were sampling might be sufficient to meet the needs of a metropolis the size of New York City for 800 years. They found fresh or nearly fresh water at both higher and lower depths below the seafloor than they anticipated, suggesting a larger supply even than that.",
      "Their work at sea unfolded over three months from Liftboat Robert, an oceangoing vessel that, once on site, lowers three enormous pillars to the seafloor and squats above the waves. Normally it services offshore petroleum sites and wind farms. This drill-baby-drill mission was different.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s known that this phenomena exists both here and elsewhere around the world,\u201d Expedition 501 project manager Jez Everest, a scientist who came from the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh, Scotland, said of undersea water. \u201cBut it\u2019s a subject that\u2019s never been directly investigated by any research project in the past.\u201d",
      "By that, he means no one globally had drilled systematically into the seabed on a mission to find freshwater. Expedition 501 was quite literally groundbreaking \u2014 it penetrated Earth below the sea by as many as 1,289 feet or nearly 400 meters.",
      "But it followed a 2015 research project that mapped contours of an aquifer remotely, using electromagnetic technology, and roughly estimated salinity of the water underneath.",
      "That mission, by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, reported evidence of a \u201cmassive offshore aquifer system\u201d in this area, possibly rivalling the size of America\u2019s largest \u2014 the Ogallala aquifer, which supplies water to parts of eight Great Plains states.",
      "Two developments in 1976 had stirred interest in searching for undersea freshwater.",
      "In the middle of Nantucket island, the U.S. Geological Survey drilled a test well to see how far down the groundwater went. It extracted fresh water from such great depths that it made scientists wonder if the water came from the sea, not the sky.",
      "The same year, that federal agency mounted a 60-day expedition aboard the drilling vessel Glomar Conception along a vast stretch of the Continental Shelf from Georgia to Georges Bank off New England. It drilled cores in search of the sub-seabed's resources, like methane.",

      "\u201cFour parts per thousand was a eureka moment,\" Dugan said, because the finding suggested that the water must have been connected to a terrestrial system in the past, or still is.",
      "As the weeks wore on and Robert moved from site to site 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 kilometers) off the coast, the process of drilling into the waterlogged subsea sediment yielded a collection of samples down to 1 part per thousand salt content. Some were even lower.",
      "Bingo. That's what you find in many bodies of fresh water on land. That's water you can drink, in theory. No one did.",

      "\u201cThis is a new environment that has never been studied before,\u201d said Jocelyne DiRuggiero, a Johns Hopkins University biologist in Baltimore who studies the microbial ecology of extreme environments and is not involved in the expedition.",
      "\u201cThe water may contain minerals detrimental to human health since it percolated through layers of sediments,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, a similar process forms the terrestrial aquifers that we use for freshwater, and those typically have very high quality.\u201d",
      "By sequencing DNA extracted from their samples, she said, the researchers can determine which microorganisms are there and \u201clearn how they potentially make a living.\u201d",
      "Techniques will also be used to determine whether it came from glacial ice melt thousands of years ago or is still coming via labyrinthian geologic formations from land.",
      "Researchers will date the water back in the lab, and that will be key in determining whether it is a renewable resource that could be used responsibly. Primordial water is trapped and finite; newer water suggests the aquifer is still connected to a terrestrial source and being refreshed, however slowly.",
      "\u201cYounger means it was a raindrop 100 years ago, 200 years ago,\u201d Dugan said. \u201cIf young, it\u2019s recharging.\u201d",
      "Those questions are for basic science. For society, all sorts of complex questions arise if the basic science affirms the conditions necessary for exploiting the water. Who will manage it? Can it be taken without an unacceptable risk of contaminating the supply from the ocean above? Will it be cheaper or environmentally friendlier than today's energy-hungry desalination plants?",
      "Dugan said if governments decide to get the water, local communities could turn to the aquifers in time of need, such as drought, or when extreme storms flood coastal freshwater reserves and ruin them. The notion of actually using this old buried water is so new that it has not been on the radar of many policymakers or conservationists.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lesson in how long it can take sometimes to make these things happen and the perseverance that\u2019s needed to get there,\" said Woods Hole geophysicist Rob Evans, whose 2015 expedition helped point the way for 501. \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of excitement that finally they\u2019ve got samples.\"",
      "Still, he sees some red flags. One is that tapping undersea aquifers could draw water away from onshore reserves. Another is that undersea groundwater that seeps out to the seafloor may supply nutrients vital to the ecosystem, and that could be upset.",
      "\"If we were to go out and start pumping these waters, there would almost certainly be unforeseen consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of balance we would need to consider before we started diving in and drilling and exploiting these kinds of things.\u201d",
      "For most in the project, getting to and from Liftboat Robert meant a voyage of seven hours or more from Fall River, Massachusetts, on a supply boat that made round trips every 10 days or so to replenish stocks and rotate people.",
      "On the platform, around the clock, the racket of metal bore pipes and machinery, the drilling grime and the speckled mud mingled with the quieter, cleaner work of scientists in trailers converted to pristine labs and processing posts.",
      "There, samples were treated according to the varying needs of the expedition\u2019s geologists, geochemists, hydrologists, microbiologists, sedimentologists and more.",
      "Passing through clear plastic tubes, muck was sliced into disks like hockey pucks. Machines squeezed water out. Some samples were kept sealed to enable study of ancient gases dissolved in the water. Other samples were frozen, filtered or left as is, depending on the purpose.",
      "After six months of lab analysis, all the science teams of Expedition 501 will meet again \u2014 this time in Germany for a month of collaborative research that is expected to produce initial findings that point to the age and origin of the water.",
      "On July 31, Liftboat Robert cranked up its legs from this place of hidden water to end a mission that lent credence to another passage from \u201cThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\" Samuel Taylor Coleridge's classic poem about life, death and mysteries at sea.",

      "A congressional investigation finds the Pentagon has funded research involving collaboration with Chinese entities linked to China's defense sector",
      "WASHINGTON -- Over a recent two-year period, the Pentagon funded hundreds of projects done in collaboration with universities in China and institutes linked to that nation's defense industry, including many blacklisted by the U.S. government for working with the Chinese military, a congressional investigation has found.",
      "The report, released Friday by House Republicans on the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, argues the projects have allowed China to exploit U.S. research partnerships for military gains while the two countries are locked in a tech and arms rivalry.",
      "\u201cAmerican taxpayer dollars should be used to defend the nation \u2014 not strengthen its foremost strategic competitor,\u201d Republicans wrote in the report.",
      "\u201cFailing to safeguard American research from hostile foreign exploitation will continue to erode U.S. technological dominance and place our national defense capabilities at risk,\" it said.",
      "The Pentagon didn't immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment. Beijing has in the past said science and technological cooperation between the two countries is mutually beneficial and helps the two sides cope with global challenges.",
      "The congressional report said some officials at the Defense Department argued research should remain open as long as it is \u201cneither controlled nor classified.\u201d",
      "The report makes several recommendations to scale back U.S. research collaboration with China. It also backs new legislation proposed by the committee's chairman, Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Michigan. The bill would prohibit any Defense Department funding from going to projects done in collaboration with researchers affiliated with Chinese entities that the U.S. government identifies as safety risks.",
      "The 80-page report builds on the committee's findings last year that partnerships between U.S. and Chinese universities over the past decade allowed hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to help Beijing develop critical technology. Amid pressure from Republicans, several U.S. universities have ended their joint programs with Chinese schools in recent years.",
      "The new report focuses more narrowly on the Defense Department and its billions of dollars in annual research funding.",
      "The committee's investigation identified 1,400 research papers published between June 2023 and June 2025 that acknowledged support from the Pentagon and were done in collaboration with Chinese partners. The publications were funded by some 700 defense grants worth more than $2.5 billion. Of the 1,400 publications, more than half involved organizations affiliated with China's defense research and industrial base.",
      "Dozens of those organizations were flagged for potential security concerns on U.S. government lists, though federal law does not prohibit research collaborations with them. The Defense Department money supported research in fields including hypersonic technology, semiconductors, artificial intelligence, advanced materials and next-generation propulsion.",

      "Schmitz noted that we have an increase in proportion of the population with these co-morbidities and it's important to highlight that access to health care can be limited, particularly for rural populations.",
      "Other leading causes of death in the report included stroke, chronic lower respiratory disease, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, kidney disease and chronic liver disease and cirrhosis.",
      "The report also found that death rates decreased from 2023 to 2024 among all racial/ethnic groups. Rates in 2024 were lowest for multiracial people at 332.3 per 100,000 and highest for the Black population at 884 per 100,000.",

      "The New Orleans Archdiocese has agreed to a $230 million settlement for survivors of clergy sexual abuse",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- The New Orleans Archdiocese on Monday agreed to a $230 million proposed settlement for survivors of clergy sexual abuse, attorneys for some of the survivors said Monday. The agreement paves the way for a final resolution to yearslong negotiations amid a series of similar settlements from the Catholic Church.",
      "The archdiocese had announced in May that it would pay at least $179.2 million in response to more than 500 abuse claims, which the bloc of attorneys said they opposed because they considered it to be lowballing the hundreds of survivors.",
      "\u201cWe knew this was a bad deal, and we knew we could do better; and we have,\" the group of 10 attorneys said in a statement. \"The \u2018power of no\u2019 forced the Archdiocese to come up with significantly more money.\u201d",
      "The archdiocese had filed for bankruptcy in May 2020 rather than handle each abuse claim separately, which survivors point out allows church leadership to avoid facing tough questions in court. The archdiocese called the updated settlement a \u201csignificant step forward for the benefit of all claimant survivors\" in an emailed statement.",
      "Survivors have until late October to vote on whether or not to approve the settlement. If approved by two-thirds of survivors, payments could begin disbursement by next year.",
      "\u201cAt this point, I\u2019m not aware of a single attorney for an abuse survivor that opposes the plan,\u201d said Brad Knapp, an attorney for a committee representing abuse survivors. \u201cWith all the abuse survivors\u2019 attorneys supporting it, I think there\u2019s much less chance that it gets voted down.\u201d",
      "The archdiocese's bankruptcy is one of the longest running and most contentious of more than a dozen ongoing Catholic Church bankruptcy cases in the U.S. related to sex abuse, according to Terence McKiernan, president of the nonprofit BishopAccountability.org.",
      "Judge Meredith Grabill, overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings in federal court, has warned that if the settlement is not approved, then she will dismiss the case.",
      "If a bankruptcy settlement fails, survivors would be required to seek compensation for their abuse claims through new lawsuits, which could take years to play out in courts. And it raises the prospect that the archdiocese would declare bankruptcy again to delay payments, according to a public letter from the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors. The committee represents the interests of abuse survivors in the bankruptcy case and urged survivors to accept the initial settlement offer.",
      "The committee warned that bringing individual abuse claims in court would likely lead to difficult confrontations with a \u201caggressive and hostile\u201d archdiocese, which could force survivors and their friends and family to engage in tough depositions and years of appeals, exacerbating survivors\u2019 \u201cemotional and psychological pain.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of survivors are ready for this to be resolved,\u201d said Kristi Schubert, an attorney representing dozens of survivors. \u201cA lot of them would prefer to receive certain money now.\u201d",

He pointed out that the bankruptcy process allows the church to \u201cwear people down\u201d and keep the public in the dark about the extent to which it enabled abuse.",
      "The settlement as outlined in May requires the archdiocese to bring in outside experts to evaluate its child-protection programs and recommend improvements. The archdiocese would also establish a document archive at a secular university related to its abuse and hold public forums for survivors to share their experiences and concerns with the archbishop.",
      "\u201cI remain very hopeful and committed to bringing this bankruptcy to a conclusion that benefits the survivors of abuse,\u201d said New Orleans Archbishop Gregory M. Aymond in a Monday statement. \u201cPlease know that I pray for the survivors of abuse every day and look forward to the opportunity to meet with them to hear their stories...\u201d",

      "HONOLULU -- A former leprosy settlement in a remote part of Hawaii will reopen this month for the first time since the pandemic, when it closed to shield the few remaining patients, all of whom are over 80, from exposure to COVID-19, officials said Monday.",
      "Tours and religious pilgrimages draw visitors to Kalaupapa, an isolated peninsula cut off by 2,000-foot (600-meter) cliffs. It traditionally has only been reachable by boat, small plane, mule ride or hourslong hike. Right now, travel to the area is only allowed by plane, Kalaupapa National Historical Park said in a statement.",
      "Hawaii banished leprosy patients to Kalaupapa for over a century, starting in 1866 during Hawaiian Kingdom rule. The exile policy was only lifted in 1969.",
      "More than 8,000 people died there, most of them Native Hawaiian. Saint Damien, a Catholic priest from Belgium who cared for patients in the late 19th century and was canonized by the church in 2009, also died there after contracting the disease.",
      "Damien\u2019s devotion to the ailing has inspired people worldwide, as has the work of Saint Marianne, a German-born nun who cared for the ill for decades before she died of natural causes on Kalaupapa in 1918. The church canonized her in 2012.",
      "Today, the peninsula is governed by the state Department of Health while the National Park Service operates the historical park.",
      "Leprosy, also known as Hansen\u2019s disease, is spread by direct, person-to-person contact, although it\u2019s not easily transmitted. It can cause skin lesions, mangle fingers and toes, and lead to blindness. It's been curable since the development of sulfone drugs in the 1940s, and people treated with drugs aren\u2019t contagious.",

      "The state has promised to keep the settlement open and care for patients until the last one dies. Their privacy means guided tours are the only way visitors may travel to Kalaupapa.",
      "Tours are available through Kalaupapa Saints Tour, founded by patient Meli Watanuki. Seawind Tours & Travel will operate the tours on Watanuki's behalf, CEO Randy King said.",
      "All visitors must be at least 16 years old and have a Department of Health visitor permit, which Seawind Tours will facilitate.",
      "Resuming tours has been complicated by the complicated logistics of the remote location. Watanuki bought a used van to transport visitors but has had to wait for it to arrive because a barge carrying vehicles to the peninsula only arrives once a year. The van arrived Saturday, King said.",

      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is facing a dilemma over the immigration detention center built in the Florida Everglades",
      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is facing a funding dilemma over the immigration detention center known as \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d built in the Florida Everglades.",
      "Last week, an appellate court panel temporarily blocked a lower court decision ordering the governor's administration to wind down operations at the facility.",
      "But the ruling sets up a predicament: The state can either pass up federal reimbursement for hundreds of millions of dollars spent to build and operate the facility, or take the money and face an environmental review, which would risk halting the center\u2019s operations.",
      "That\u2019s because a majority of the three-judge appellate panel decided for the time being that the facility doesn't have to undergo a federally required environmental impact study normally needed to build on sensitive wetlands. Why? Because Florida has yet to receive federal money for the project, despite officials having promised it.",
      "If Florida takes the federal money, then the state may need to conduct the environmental analysis, the judges wrote in their 2-to-1 decision. U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on social media this summer that the facility would largely be funded by FEMA's shelter and services program.",
      "The law makes clear that \u201cthe absence of federal funding renders an action \u2018non-federal\u2019\u201d and not subject to an environmental review, the appellate panel majority said.",
      "The decision stayed a preliminary injunction by U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordering the detention facility to wind down operations by late October while the case made its way through court. The stay is in effect pending appeal.",
      "\u201cHere, no federal dollars have been expended on the construction or use of the facility,\u201d the appellate panel said. \u201cSo the Florida-funded and Florida-operated detention activities occurring at the site do not conceive a \u2018major federal project\u2019 either.\u201d",
      "When asked Tuesday about whether the appellate panel's decision would impact the state's application for federal funding, the governor's office didn't provide a direct answer. Instead, press secretary Molly Best sent video clips of DeSantis talking about \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d on social media and in an interview with FOX host Sean Hannity. DeSantis didn't discuss funding in either clip.",

Trump toured the facility in July and suggested it could be a model for future lockups around the nation as his administration pushes to expand the infrastructure needed to increase deportations. Other states have since announced plans to open their own immigration detention centers.",
      "The environmental lawsuit is one of three federal lawsuits challenging operations at the detention center in the Everglades. A second Florida immigration detention center opened last week at a closed prison in north Florida.",
      "\u201cFlorida taxpayers should not foot the bill for federal immigration services,\u201d said Paul Schwiep, an attorney representing Friends of the Everglades, one of the environmental groups that sued Florida and the U.S. government. \u201cJudge Williams believed the governor when he said the federal government would fund the work, and believed Secretary Noem when she said the same. Meanwhile, the majority on appeal essentially said we can\u2019t believe politicians when they make such statements.\u201d",
      "Elise Bennett, a senior attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, another environmental group that is a plaintiff in the lawsuit, said she saw another possibility in the ruling that would allow the DeSantis administration and DHS \u201cto have their cake and eat it too.\u201d",
      "The appellate majority is signaling that a federal agency can withhold reimbursement until a project is completed, \u201cand by the time they formalize that payment, the damage is done and the analysis has little to no value,\u201d Bennett said.",

By reshaping a Democratic-held Kansas City district, Republicans could win seven of Missouri's eight congressional seats.",

The administration said it would remove all \u201cinappropriate\u201d material by Sept. 17, according to The New York Times, citing internal agency documents.",
      "The directive has raised concerns about sanitizing and erasing dark sides of American history.",

      "A look at some of the material that was flagged for review:",
      "WHAT'S IN DISPUTE: A sign titled \u201cThe Air We Breathe\u201d was flagged because it discusses the importance of clean air. Pollution from human-caused ozone, it explains, threatens people's health and vegetation, and power plants, cars and industries that burn fossil fuels are the pollutant's primary sources.",
      "In North Carolina's Cape Hatteras National Seashore, there are signs about sea level rise due to climate change. \u201cWe do not believe it to be in violation, but would like someone to review if messaging of climate change and sea level rise reduces the focus on the grandeur, beauty and abundance,\u201d one employee wrote.",
      "THE BACK STORY: Emissions from burning fossil fuels are heating the planet, causing ice sheets and glaciers to melt and seawater to expand. Rising seas threaten the people and ecosystems that live by the coast.",
      "THE REACTION: Carlos Martinez, climate scientist for the Union of Concerned Scientists, thinks the agency should be educating the public about the threats national parks face.",
      "These public parks are places to learn about pollution, climate change and environmental degradation, he said, and eliminating this information \u201climits the ability for our population, especially for the younger generation, to understand these issues that allow them to then take action.\u201d",
      "WHAT'S IN DISPUTE: At a gift shop in Charles Pinckney National Historic Site in South Carolina, marked for review were books for sale, including \u201cIncidents in the Life of a Slave Girl\u201d by Harriet Jacobs. Similar books were flagged elsewhere, including at the Washington Monument, where someone identified a book discussing George Washington as a slave owner.",
      "In Pennsylvania's Independence National Historical Park, flagged were descriptions of the whipping, kidnapping, rape and other brutality slaveholders inflicted on Black people. At another, an employee identified an exhibit about Black Americans escaping to freedom that names slave owners.",
      "THE BACK STORY: The legacy of slavery and racism has laid the foundation for the inequalities Black people face in the U.S., including greater rates of poverty, disease and illness, and incarceration at more than five times the rate of white people.",
      "THE REACTION: \u201cSlavery is not a side story. It\u2019s the engine of American economic growth for more than two centuries,\u201d said Cedric Haynes, vice president of policy and legislative affairs with the NAACP. \u201cAnd there are individuals who played a part in this.\u201d",

      "He decided he was going to try out for the university's marching band, a cornerstone of the school's history and culture that Broussard had long revered.",
      "But it would be no easy task to earn a spot on the Grammy-nominated group that has played at events across the world. So, he trained \u2014 \u201cmentally, physically and musically.\u201d In addition, in order to even try out, he had to enroll as a student and now spends his days attending class, doing homework and studying for tests.",

      "A prosecutor has recommended five years of probation and restitution payments for former CEO Carl Ferrer and sales director Dan Hyer, both of whom pleaded guilty to conspiracy in 2018. The prosecutor said both men acknowledged their crimes and cooperated with authorities by testifying against a company founder during the 2023 trial.",

Chief financial officer John Brunst and executive vice president Scott Spear are each serving 10-year sentences for conspiracy and money laundering convictions.",
      "Prosecutors had argued that Backpage\u2019s operators ignored warnings to stop running prostitution ads, some involving children. The operators were accused of giving free ads to sex workers and cultivating arrangements with others who worked in the industry to get them to post ads with the company.",
      "Backpage\u2019s operators said they never allowed ads for sex and made an effort to try to delete such ads by assigning employees to remove them and creating automated tools. Their legal team maintained the content on the site was protected by the First Amendment.",

But they held onto Backpage, which authorities say generated $500 million in prostitution-related revenue from its inception in 2004 until 2018, when the government shut it down.",
      "A U.S. Government Accountability Office report released in June 2021 said the FBI\u2019s ability to identify victims and sex traffickers had decreased significantly after Backpage was seized by the government, because law enforcement was familiar with the site and Backpage was generally responsive to requests for information.",

The sprawling green space, in a rural-feeling area of the city about 4 miles (6 kilometers) from the university campus, is popular with dog walkers and exercisers because of its fields and 2 miles (3 kilometers) of walking trails.",
      "Authorities said Gard Schnuelle, 59, died after being stabbed multiple times. Her body was found in a wooded area of the park. Police have charged Harold Rashad Dabney III, 28, with capital murder. Court documents indicate that investigators believe Dabney killed Gard Schnuelle during an attempted robbery and then left in her red Ford F-150 truck. He was being held without bond.",

      "She is expected to enter a plea in response to conspiracy, fraud and obstruction charges in what prosecutors described as a yearslong scheme to conceal an affair with her bodyguard as the two traveled, wined and dined together on taxpayers' dime.",
      "Cantrell\u2019s bodyguard, Jeffrey Vappie, has already pleaded not guilty to charges of wire fraud and making false statements after he was indicted in July 2024. He is scheduled to appear in court Friday for the additional charges.",
      "Cantrell, the first female mayor in New Orleans\u2019 300-year history, was elected twice but now becomes the city\u2019s first mayor to be charged while in office in a state with a reputation for public corruption. She has only four months before she leaves office under term limits.",
      "The mayor once known for her outspoken persona has kept quiet about the charges in the weeks since the 18-count indictment against her and Vappie was announced in mid-August. She did not acknowledge the indictment during public appearances to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina late last month.",
      "Cantrell was already receding into the background of city affairs over the past year and offered no apparent resistance to President Donald Trump's suggestion earlier this month to send the National Guard and federal agents to New Orleans even as other Democrats bristled.",
      "She's also been cast as a pariah by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner, who announced on Sept. 3 that Cantrell was suspended from involvements in federal transactions with HUD. The City Council issued a statement last week saying it had reassured the Housing Authority of New Orleans and the Office of Community Development that other city officials could sign federal contracts instead.",
      "At times, she and her allies have said the blowback she is experiencing is tinged by double standards she faces as a Black woman. Cantrell said earlier this year, before to the indictment, that she has faced \u201cvery disrespectful, insulting, in some cases kind of unimaginable\u201d treatment.",

His character is a bumbling dad \u2013 a role he says is not too dissimilar from his real-life personality. \"We eased into it,\" he said, \"I ain't crying in this movie, I can tell you that. In the movie, I have three daughters and, you know, I have one daughter.\"",
      "\"Oh my gosh, give him the Academy Award right now,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah. Yeah,\" he laughed. \"There's a lot of buzz about it!\"",
      "Bargatze met his wife, Laura, when he was 21; they were coworkers at an Applebee's. As he recounted in the 2017 special \"The Standups,\" \"I went from, like, my mom to her. So, I don't even know what it feels like not to have some lady be like, 'I don't know if I would do that, you know?'\"",
      "Their daughter, Harper, introduces his stand-up specials, which are intentionally family-friendly. He's a clean comic.",
      "\"I love that people when they come to my show, it's, uh, I don't wanna betray that trust,\" he said. \"You can have your kid watch my stand-up and you don't like, if you see 'em have it on, you don't have to be like, 'Whoa, what's going on?'\"",
      "While working clean can be a savvy business decision, it allows one to sell tickets to the widest audience possible. For Bargatze, it's also part of a larger mission. He said, \"You feel like you're being asked to do this and the career that I have. And so, you just gotta trust that, uh, your path is gonna be the path, and just stick with it.\"",
      "I said, \"When you say asked to do this, do you mean in like sort of a religious calling kind of a way?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" he replied. \"You feel \u2013 you know, I feel it's beyond me.\"",
      "With \"Good Clean Funny\" as its mantra, Bargatze's company, Nateland, produces specials, live events, and podcasts featuring other clean comedians. He even has dreams of one day opening his own theme park and movie studio in Nashville.",
      "\"I'm not gonna be able to go to every city in America for the rest of my life,\" he said. \"So, I want to build a place where you can come. And if you and your wife and your kids are 11 and they want to go run off on their own for a second, I want that to happen.\"",
      "To pull off all of his ambitious plans, one of the most successful touring comedians of all time is already plotting the end of his touring days.",
      "\"I'm doing this tour, I plan on doing one more tour after that,\" he said. \"I need to go do movies, and I need to build that world up and learn how to do all of that stuff. So, I'm gonna dive into that aspect of it. I can see myself being and making movies for, like, another 15 years, and then \u2013 if I'm allowed to! I mean, it might all fall apart.\"",
      "These days, during breaks on his grueling tour schedule, Bargatze is able to briefly take his mind off stand-up by playing golf. \"I mean, it's kind of like stand-up,\" he said. \"You're kind of out there on your own. Golf is, uh, you're so much like thinking about what you're doing out there. I realized, like, I can't turn my brain off, so I just need to direct it to something else.\"",
      "Bargatze has a lot to focus on. The day before he hosts the Emmys in Los Angeles, he's performing two back-to-back arena shows in Denver. But he wouldn't have it any other way.",
      "He said, \"I know how to kind of operate in this chaos. And if you pulled me out and gave me a month off, I think I would be like lost right now. Let's keep going. We're in a good groove. You don't want to kind of stop the groove. Yeah, it'll be a lot of stuff. It's a lot of stuff!\"",

    "story": [
      "At the end of summer, Congress is often sleepy, and slowly gets back to work. But this past week was an exception. On Capitol Hill, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. arrived, and the controversial Health and Human Services Secretary sparked a reckoning over public health in America.",
      "At a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday, Kennedy defended the Trump administration's policies: \"We at HHS are enacting a once-in-a-generation shift from a sick-care system, to a true health care system that tackles the root causes of chronic disease,\" he said.",
      "Tempers ran hot at the hearing. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) said, \"This is not a podcast. It is the American people's health that is on the line here.\"",
      "Democrats rebuked Kennedy, perhaps the most high-profile member of President Donald Trump's cabinet. Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) asked Kennedy, \"When were you lying, sir \u2013   when you told this committee that you were not anti-vax? Or when you told Americans that there's no safe and effective vaccine?\"",
      "To which Kennedy replied, \"Both things are true.\"",
      "There were Republicans who offered broad support for Kennedy. Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Ida.) said, \"President Trump and Secretary Kennedy have made a steadfast commitment to make America healthy again.\"",
      "Yet some Republicans notably did push Kennedy on how his long-standing opposition to vaccine mandates is affecting policy, and on Kennedy's doubts about the safety of various vaccines. Sen. John Barasso (R-Wyo.) said, \"There are real concerns that safe, proven vaccines like measles, like hepatitis B and others, could be in jeopardy.\"",
      "The committee room standoff had been brewing for days. On Aug. 27, the government announced new restrictions on eligibility for COVID vaccinations. That decision prompted some health organizations to warn the policy could cause confusion.",
      "That same day, the Trump White House said Susan Monarez, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who had just been confirmed by the Senate weeks earlier, was fired.",
      "The Trump White House stood by Secretary Kennedy's sweeping changes, and by the firing. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said of Monarez, \"She was not aligned with President Trump's mission to make America healthy again.\"",
      "In a statement to \"Sunday Morning,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said, \"The White House maintains full confidence in Secretary Kennedy's leadership at HHS to advance President Trump's MAHA agenda. With Operation Warp Speed's unprecedented success delivering COVID-19 vaccines in record time, President Trump proved that it's possible to shake up the status quo of our broken and bureaucratic public health system to deliver real results for the American people. Now the second Trump administration is building on this record and experience to restore Gold Standard Science as the guiding principle of health decision-making at HHS to Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Susan Monarez has written that she was pressured to \"compromise science itself\" \u2013 and to sign off on people who \"have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric.\"",
      "This turbulence has put Kennedy, who was a key Trump ally during last year's campaign, in the spotlight.",
      "Asked whether there has been pressure within the Republican Party to stand by Kennedy, Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul said, \"Nobody's pressured me or ever called me on it. I sort of speak my mind. And these are long-standing beliefs for me.\"",
      "Paul, an ophthalmologist, supports Kennedy, and lays blame on scientists \u2014 not skeptics \u2014 for worries about vaccine safety. \"All the doubt over vaccines is \u2013 there might be some doubt coming from those who don't want you to take a vaccine, but quite a bit of doubt is coming from the establishment that I believe is authoritarian in nature,\" said Paul. \"You don't care whether they tell you what to do. You should just do what you're told. We know better than you.\"",
      "But some who have worked at the highest level are fighting back against criticism, and are sounding an alarm.",
      "\"A significant distrust of vaccines\"",
      "Four CDC officials \u2014 Doctors Jennifer Layden, Daniel Jernigan, Debra Houry, and Demetre Daskalakis \u2014 all have resigned in recent days, some citing Secretary Kennedy's vaccine policies, others citing the upheaval at the CDC, which provides crucial health guidance nationwide.",
      "And all four expressed concerns about their resulting trust in CDC information about vaccines and vaccine safety data. \"It's why I left; I'm very concerned,\" said Dr. Daskalakis. \"We've already crossed the line. The COVID recommendations for children and pregnant women are completely not based in any evidence that world experts agree on.\"",
      "I asked, \"You know Secretary Kennedy would push back on that; what would you tell him?\"",
      "\"Ah, easy,\" Daskalakis replied. \"The recommendation is that there should be no healthy kids that get the vaccine; it should only be in kids with underlying conditions. Kids that are six-months-old, 56% of them that are admitted to the hospital have no underlying condition. So, by not offering the vaccine to parents who are willing to do it, those kids that could have been protected won't be.\"",
      "Asked how he would label Kennedy and his view of vaccines, Dr. Daniel Jernigan said, \"I think he has a significant distrust of vaccines. I don't know that he's driving a get-rid-of-vaccines agenda. It's more death by a thousand cuts, death by a thousand questions, calling into question data that has been accepted for many, many years, and simply that calling it into question brings into people's minds that, 'Maybe I shouldn't get that vaccine.'\"",
      "Dr. Debra Houry said that when Kennedy began at HHS, \"I read his books. I wanted to better understand his research and his background on it. So, we were open, you know, to having those discussions.\"",
      "In an additional statement to \"Sunday Morning,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said:",
      "\"Americans haven't forgotten how 'the science' was politicized and weaponized during the COVID era by unaccountable 'health officials' to push intrusive mandates and stifle any semblance of the skepticism that actual scientific inquiry is based on. The Trump administration is committed to restoring evidence-based, Gold Standard Science and answering the questions that Americans haven't been allowed to ask to restore trust, confidence, and accountability in our public health bodies.\"",
      "Asked what the cost to Americans would be of doctors and other officials leaving the CDC, Dr. Jennifer Layden said, \"We're talking about the whole public health infrastructure of our nation. And I think when we start to see (and we will) outbreaks that normally don't happen \u2013 more food-borne outbreaks, Legionella outbreaks, rising measles cases \u2013 people will start to care. That may take time for us to see some of those negative consequences, but that's what the ripple effect of all this will do across our nation.\"",
      "In fact, ripple effects are already apparent.",
      "\"Diseases don't obey borders\"",
      "Just this past week, Florida's Republican governor announced plans to eliminate all childhood vaccine requirements.",
      "Meanwhile, West Coast Democratic governors who oppose Secretary Kennedy's policies are moving fast to protect vaccine programs in their states.",
      "I asked Dr. Atul Gawande, a surgeon who served in the Biden administration, \"What is the consequence for the country when you have such a differentiation? It's splintered.\"",
      "\"It's severely splintered, and I'm very worried about it,\" Gawandea replied, \"because diseases don't obey borders.",
      "For Gawande, Kennedy's actions could upend not only federal agencies, but America's standing in global health. \"There isn't always consensus, for sure, among our own medical community,\" he said, \"but we generally have been able to come together enough to be able to say, 'Here is where we can assure getting \u2013 whether it's COVID boosters, and making sure we don't leave out the people who are most in need of vaccination \u2013 to making sure we're not abandoning our childhood immunization. Other countries around the world are baffled by our now falling into a civil war over whether the discoveries that have saved the world mattered.\"",
      "Later this month, the CDC's vaccine advisory board \u2014\u00a0now featuring Kennedy appointees\u00a0\u2014 will meet to decide future guidelines.",

      "But, I asked, \"Is trust still possible in this environment?\"",
      "\"Trust is still possible,\" said Gawande, \"but it is not possible while we have leaders who actively drive chaos, who actively are trying to create uncertainty and break down trust.

      "Susan Monarez was fired from the position less than a month after her Senate confirmation. In an opinion piece\u00a0in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Monarez said that Kennedy \"pressured me to resign or face termination\" in an Aug. 25 meeting.",

    "story": [
      "A federal Judge on Tuesday ruled that\u00a0Lisa Cook can remain in her role on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors while her lawsuit challenging President Trump's attempt to fire her from her post plays out.",
      "\"President Trump has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cook's removal,\" U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, wrote in her ruling, which is likely to be appealed.",
      "Mr. Trump said he is firing Cook over allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago, resulting in more favorable loan terms.",
      "\"President Trump's stated cause refers only to allegations regarding Cook's conduct before she began serving on the Federal Reserve Board,\" Cobb wrote. \"As discussed above, such allegations are not a legally permissible cause.\"",
      "In addition to casting doubt on whether Mr. Trump established cause for Cook's firing, in issuing the stay, Cobb also ruled that Cook's right to due process was violated and that she would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction was not granted.",
      "Abbe David Lowell, an attorney representing Cook in her lawsuit, said in a statement to CBS News on Tuesday night, \"This ruling recognizes and reaffirms the importance of safeguarding the independence of the Federal Reserve from illegal political interference. Allowing the President to unlawfully remove Governor Cook on unsubstantiated and vague allegations would endanger the stability of our financial system and undermine the rule of law. Governor Cook will continue to carry out her sworn duties as a Senate-confirmed Board Governor.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "Under federal law, Fed board members\u00a0serve for 14-year terms\u00a0and can only be fired by the president \"for cause.\" Cook has served on the Fed since being appointed to complete another member's unexpired term in 2022, and her current term would run until 2038.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook on Aug. 26, writing in a letter\u00a0terminating her\u00a0from the Fed Board of Governors that he had \"sufficient cause\" to remove her from the position. The president cited a previous letter from Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that was sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging Cook made false statements on mortgage agreements.",
      "Pulte, an appointee of Mr. Trump's, alleged that Cook in 2021 claimed two different properties in Michigan and Georgia as her primary residence on mortgage documents to get better lending terms. Cook has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense.",
      "Cook's lawyers have previously said in court filings that Mr. Trump's \"unsubstantiated allegation that Governor Cook 'may have' or 'seems' to have erred in filling out a mortgage form in her capacity as a private citizen-does not amount to 'cause' for removal within the meaning of the FRA [Federal Reserve Act].\"",
      "\"None of the alleged misconduct occurred during the performance of Governor Cook's duties as a Federal Board member,\" they wrote. \"And the President and Director Pulte have not even alleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was intentional.\"",
      "In court arguments Friday, Lowell said Cook was not given notice of the allegations or a chance to respond to them, violating, he argued, her due process rights.",
      "Cook's lawsuit argues that Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her is \"unprecedented and illegal,\" noting it would be the first removal of a governor by the president in the Fed's 112-year history.",
      "\"The President's effort to terminate a Senate-confirmed Federal Reserve Board member is a broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System,\" Cook's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that Mr. Trump's theory of \"cause\" would allow him to remove any Fed Board member with whom he disagrees on policy, eroding the central bank's independence and threatening its mission of providing economic stability.",
      "Cobb appeared to agree with their argument, writing in her ruling on Tuesday, \"Taken to its logical conclusion, the Government's argument leads to an absurd result: While admitting that the President cannot remove an official for policy disagreements, the Government claims that under Reagan, a removal on the grounds of a policy disagreement would nevertheless be unreviewable. ... This cannot be the case. Such a rule would provide no practical insulation for the members of the Board of Governors. It would mean that the President could, in practice, 'remove a member ... merely because he wanted his own appointees.'\"",
      "Cobb also wrote that Mr. Trump \"does not address her [Cook's] in-office conduct at all, let alone provide any examples of how Cook's performance or personal conduct since assuming the role has been in any way deficient in carrying out her statutory duties,\" adding that Mr. Trump's termination letter \"does not identify any conduct that Cook has engaged in while serving as a member of the Board that indicates that Cook lacks the competence or trustworthiness for the role.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook came amid his repeated\u00a0attacks on the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, over the central bank's handling of interest rates.",
      "Cook, Powell and 10 other Fed officials sit on a committee that controls the nation's monetary policy and sets target interest rates, with a dual mandate of keeping inflation low and employment levels high. This work is typically done independently, with little to no input from political leaders.",
      "While the Fed did cut interest rates last year, after they had reached their highest point in decades in 2022 and 2023 in a bid to fight off inflation, the central bank has recently kept rates at relatively high levels. Powell has cited concerns that lowering rates could again lead to a swift rise in inflation and that Mr. Trump's tariffs could also lead to an increase in consumer prices.",

      "The streamlining would save $1.25 billion by the end of 2026, savings that are to be redirected to diabetes and obesity, including research and development, the company said. The company said that the reductions are necessary because of a \"more dynamic and consumer-driven obesity market,\" which has resulted in slower growth.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday said it will decide whether President Trump can impose his most sweeping tariffs, setting up a major test of one of the pillars of the president's economic agenda.",
      "The high court agreed to review lower court decisions\u00a0that found Mr. Trump did not have the authority to issue many of his global tariffs under an emergency powers law. The Justice Department appealed one of those rulings, from a federal appeals court, to the Supreme Court last week and asked it to move swiftly.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that upholding the ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit would put the United States at a disadvantage and expose the nation to retaliatory trade policies.",
      "The case is the first in which the Supreme Court will directly decide the legality of one of Mr. Trump's second-term policies. The high court has been asked roughly two dozen times to intervene in challenges to many of the president's initiatives, but on an interim emergency basis.",
      "The justices said arguments in the tariffs case would take place in the first week of November.",
      "The tariffs case",
      "One of the disputes before the Supreme Court was brought by a group of small businesses and 12 states. They argued that he did not have the authority to impose many of the global tariffs under the emergency powers law that he invoked, called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.",
      "A federal trade court ruled in May that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he issued the tariffs under IEEPA, and the Federal Circuit upheld that decision late last month. In its 7-4 decision, the appeals court agreed that the tariffs are illegal.",
      "\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the appeals court wrote. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"",
      "The appeals court did not decide whether IEEPA authorizes any tariffs at all. Instead, it only resolved whether sweeping duties that Mr. Trump imposed through a series of executive orders earlier this year are allowed under the law.",
      "The second case involves a pair of Illinois-based companies that sell educational toys and products. A federal district judge in Washington, D.C., ruled in May that IEEPA \"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in his executive orders. The decision from U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras was more narrow, barring the Trump administration only from collecting any tariff from the two companies. Contreras paused his decision while the Justice Department appealed to the D.C. Circuit.",
      "The two companies asked the Supreme Court in June to fast track the case and leap frog the appeals court in Washington, D.C.",
      "A spokesperson for one of the companies, Learning Resources, said in a statement it was \"gratified\" that the Supreme Court would hear the case.",
      "\"There is a lot riding on this historic case,\" the spokesperson said. \"The unlawful IEEPA tariffs have wreaked havoc in our economy for too long now.\"",
      "The duties at issue include those announced by Mr. Trump in early April \u2014 which he refers to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 that set a 10% baseline rate for nearly every country, and higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners. It also involves a set of levies on imports from Canada, Mexico and China in response to what Mr. Trump said is their failure to address the trafficking of fentanyl across U.S. borders.",
      "The president has used the tariffs, and the threat of additional duties, to try to force trading partners to negotiate trade deals with his administration. So far, \u00a0he has announced frameworks of trade agreements with the European Union and six countries: the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.",
      "Mr. Trump is the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, though it has been used by his predecessors to hit foreign nations with economic sanctions. His administration has argued that a denial of tariff authority would put the U.S. on the brink of \"economic catastrophe\" and make the nation poorer.",
      "In urging the Supreme Court to move quickly, Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing that the Federal Circuit's \"erroneous decision has disrupted highly impactful, sensitive, ongoing diplomatic trade negotiations, and cast a pall of legal uncertainty over the President's efforts to protect our country by preventing an unprecedented economic and foreign-policy crisis.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued that IEEPA gives the president broad powers to regulate trade, including imposing tariffs, \"to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to U.S. national security, foreign policy or the economy.",
      "Mr. Trump has said that trade deficits and the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. constituted threats to the national security and economy of the U.S., and invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs to address them.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs have remained in effect, since the Federal Circuit put its decision on hold until Oct. 14 to give the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court.",
      "The plaintiffs \u2014 the five small businesses and 12 states \u2014 agreed that the Supreme Court needs to resolve the legality of Mr. Trump's tariffs, calling it an issue of \"great\" and \"undoubted importance.\" They argued that the tariffs are illegal and urged the high court to affirm the Federal Circuit's decision.",
      "\"The government's case rests entirely on the notion that the phrase 'regulate \u2026 importation' in IEEPA constitutes a boundless power to impose tariffs on the American people whenever the President wants, at whatever level he wants, for whatever countries and products he wants, and for as long as he wants, merely by declaring that longstanding U.S. trade deficits are a national 'emergency' and an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' \u2014 assertions the government claims are effectively unreviewable,\" lawyers for the small businesses wrote in a Supreme Court filing. \"There are no limits.\"",
      "The states, meanwhile, said that the Constitution gives Congress the power to collect taxes, and the Trump administration is claiming that the president has sweeping authority to impose tariffs \"on any country, at any rate, and for however long he likes.\"",
      "\"The President's chaotic implementation of that purported authority, which changed by the day and wreaked havoc on capital markets and the economy, illustrates both the breadth of powers that the President claims and the danger of unlimited authority in this domain,\" they warned in court papers.",
      "The legal challenge to Mr. Trump's tariffs is likely to be one of several involving the president's second-term policies that the Supreme Court takes up. Other cases involving his immigration policies and efforts to remove members of independent agencies have progressed through the lower courts, and the Trump administration is likely to seek Supreme Court review of decisions against it.",

    "summary": "The downward revision from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the job market was slowing in 2024 and early 2025.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. labor market added 911,000 fewer jobs in the 12-month period that ended March 2025 than had earlier been reported, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Tuesday. The major downward revision signals that the labor market was slowing more last year than had earlier been reported.",
      "The so-called preliminary benchmark revision, produced annually by the BLS, was bigger than a decline of roughly 800,000 that economists had forecast prior to the release. The revision aims to better account for businesses that have opened or closed in the 12-month period it covers, as these changes are sometimes missed by the BLS' monthly jobs report.",
      "The downward revision comes as the labor market appears to be ailing, with Friday's\u00a0disappointing August jobs report\u00a0sending warning signals about the pace of hiring across the U.S. At the same time, the BLS is in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, with the president last month\u00a0questioning the validity\u00a0of the monthly jobs report after the data included a significant downward revision, prompting him to\u00a0fire the commissioner\u00a0of the BLS.",
      "Revisions are a normal part of the statistical process at the BLS, economists note. That's because the monthly jobs data is based on a survey of businesses, and some companies respond after the agency's initial jobs report has been issued. Because of that, the BLS updates its data to reflect the new information.",
      "The sharp downward annual revision signals that the job market was facing bigger headwinds in 2024 and early 2025 than earlier reported, and could add to the Federal Reserve's case for cutting its benchmark rate at its Sept. 17 meeting, economists said.",
      "\"Today's data suggests cooling in the labor market is more dramatic than previously thought,\" said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, in an email.",
      "She added, \"This strengthens the likelihood that the Fed will cut rates next week, as it's additional evidence that the labor market side of the dual mandate needs some attention.\"",
      "Less momentum in job gains",
      "With the new revisions, job growth in 2025 has averaged 44,000 per month, down from 75,000 prior to the revamped numbers, Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in an email. In 2024, payroll gains factoring in the revisions averaged 106,000, down from 168,000 previously.",
      "\"The revision shows the economy entered 2025 with less momentum than previously understood,\" he said. \"It's now a lock that the Fed will cut interest rates at their meeting next week and that further rate cuts will follow in the months ahead. The question is by how much.\"",
      "The probability of a 0.25 percentage point rate cut at the Fed's Sept. 17 meeting is now projected at 94%, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The annual revisions are based on fresh data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which tracks employment and wages reported by employers that cover more than 95% of U.S. jobs, or about 11 million workplaces.",
      "The QCEW tracks when businesses open or close, something that is difficult for the monthly jobs report to track. For instance, if a business doesn't respond to the monthly survey, the BLS doesn't immediately know if the company simply isn't responding or if it has shut down.",
      "The large revision is likely due to the QCEW's tracking of businesses that have either been newly created or recently closed, with some of those new companies likely having slower hiring than the BLS had earlier estimated, Pantheon Macroeconomics chief U.S. economist Samuel Tombs said in a research note.",
      "\"Probably about two-thirds of the downward benchmark revision looks set to be due to weaker job creation at new firms than the BLS initially inferred from its model,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The typical U.S. taxpayer could see their taxes decrease by more than $3,750 next year thanks to fresh cuts, deductions and other provisions, according to a recent analysis.",
    "story": [
      "The \"big, beautiful bill\" signed into law by President Trump in July provides a bevy of new tax cuts and deductions that could lower taxes for millions of Americans, according to a recent analysis from the Tax Foundation.",
      "The typical filer could see a tax cut of $3,752 in 2026, the nonpartisan think tank found. But the impact will also vary geographically, with some residents in some states likely receiving a bigger tax benefit than others under the new law, Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "For instance, the biggest average cut will go to residents of Wyoming, with a reduction of $5,374, according to his analysis of the law's impact.",
      "The geographic differences are due partly to variations in the average income of each state, given that the law provides bigger tax cuts to high-income Americans\u00a0compared with low-income households, Watson noted. Other provisions also could help some regions more than others. That includes the higher deduction cap for state and local taxes, which will give more of a lift to people in states with high property taxes, such as New Jersey and New York.",
      "\"Places with higher incomes are going to have higher nominal tax cuts,\" Watson said. \"The largest tax benefits are going to the mountain states \u2014 it's due to a subgroup of higher-income business owners.\"",
      "Residents of Mississippi and West Virginia are likely to see the smallest tax cuts next year, the analysis found. Incomes in those states tend to be lower than the national average, with median household income in Mississippi standing at about $55,000 as of 2023 and $60,000 for West Virginians, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The national household median income is about $80,600.",
      "The Tax Foundation analysis projects the average tax cut in tax year 2026, meaning that these numbers reflect the reductions for the next calendar year. Although many of the law's provisions are effective in 2025, the IRS is still working out the details on some of them, which means lower tax withholding for the new provisions won't be fully in place until 2026, Watson said.",
      "Bigger refunds?",
      "Tax refunds are also likely to be larger in early 2026, when people file their taxes for the 2025 calendar year, Watson said, although he hasn't calculated the potential impact.",
      "Seniors who can claim a new $6,000 deduction for people over 65 under the law may get a bigger refund, as well as taxpayers across the board due to the higher standard deduction, said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt.",
      "Because of the tax changes in the new law, Steber recommends that people start preparing now. For example, workers who are newly eligible for tax breaks on tips and on overtime pay should keep track of such income.",
      "\"Having this much time left in the year allows taxpayers to make any necessary adjustments to help increase a refund or lower an amount due, and can be as simple as adjusting the withholding on a W-4,\" Steber told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The top 1% of earners around the U.S. \u2014 those with incomes over $1.1 million \u2014 will receive a $75,410 annual tax break from the new law in 2026, according to a\u00a0separate analysis\u00a0from the Tax Policy Center, nonpartisan think tank. That compares with an average tax break of $150 for households in the bottom 20% of the income distribution, or people earning less than $36,000 a year, and of $1,780 for earning $66,801 to $119,200.",
      "To be sure, many of new law's tax cuts will depend on an individual's financial circumstances. For instance, a low-income worker who earns tips or overtime could see a much bigger tax cut due to the law's \"no tax on tips\" and \"no tax on overtime\" provisions, Watson noted.",
      "\"If a taxpayer isn't taking tips or overtime or new car loan deduction, they may see a lower benefit,\" he said.",

      "\"Today, we're suspending our remodels. If your restaurant hasn't been remodeled, you don't need to worry, it won't be,\" Cracker Barrel said. The decision to halt remodeling plans was based on opinions customers shared \"not just on our logo, but also on our restaurants,\" it added.",
      "Cracker Barrel conceded in its statement that its planned store redesign did \"not reflect what you love about Cracker Barrel.\"",
      "To date, the Southern-themed restaurant chain has remodeled just four of its 660 store locations. It is suspending plans to remodel any additional stores.",
      "\"With our recent announcement that our 'Old Timer' logo will remain, along with our bigger focus in the kitchen and on your plate, we hope that today's step reinforces that we hear you,\" the company said Tuesday.",

    "summary": "Uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies are deterring manufacturers from hiring, according to the Center for American Progress.",
    "story": [
      "Manufacturers in the U.S. are cutting thousands of jobs even as President Trump pushes economic policies that he says will revitalize the industry.",
      "Employers shed 12,000 manufacturing jobs\u00a0in August, while payrolls in the sector have shrunk by 42,000 since April, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Center for American Progress (CAP) that draws on government labor data.",
      "The nonpartisan policy institute attributes that decline to the Trump administration's steep new tariffs; hardline stance on immigration; and the Republican-backed \"big, beautiful bill,\" a tax and spending package enacted by Mr. Trump in July that CAP says hurts renewable energy companies by phasing out certain tax credits.",
      "For all of 2025, manufacturing employment in the U.S. has sunk by a total of 33,000 jobs, according to Labor Department\u00a0figures. Most of those job losses have been among companies that make durable goods, such as cars, household appliances and electronics. The drop comes as hiring overall has slowed sharply in recent months, with employers adding only 22,000 jobs in August, well below forecasts.",
      "The number of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. has declined for the past six decades, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In 1960, manufacturing represented about 34% of total employment, while the number of jobs in the sector peaked in 1970 at 19.5 million. As of August this year, 12.7 million Americans were employed in manufacturing, while the industry lost 87,000 jobs in 2024,\u00a0data shows.",
      "Uncertainty hurting businesses",
      "When Mr. Trump in April announced a range of levies on dozens of other countries, the White House said tariffs would protect American workers by reducing the U.S. trade deficit with its economic partners and spurring employers to move manufacturing jobs to the U.S.",
      "For now, however, confusion over the scale and scope of U.S. tariffs has put manufacturers on the defensive, increasing their costs and discouraging them from hiring, economist Sara Estrep, one of the authors of the CAP report, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Companies are uncertain about what's happening,\" she said. \"Everything has been changing on a day-to-day basis, so it's not clear what production should look like. That's why they aren't hiring.\"",
      "In August, for example, farm equipment giant John Deere cited tariffs in announcing that its sales and operating profits had dipped from a year ago. In an earnings call, an executive with the company noted that it had racked up roughly $300 million in tariff-related costs, including on steel and aluminum imports. John Deere also announced it was laying off more than 200 workers at plants in Illinois and Iowa, according to AgWeb, a trade publication.",
      "Automakers pointed partly to tariffs in announcing nearly 5,000 job cuts in July, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, while it noted that the retail sector has also stepped up layoffs and store closures because of economic uncertainty.",
      "Another factor fueling uncertainty for manufacturers are the ongoing legal challenges to the Trump tariffs, making it hard to plan and invest for the future, according to experts.",
      "A federal appeals court in August ruled that Mr. Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. trade partners. Mr. Trump on September 3\u00a0asked the Supreme Court\u00a0to review the lower court's decision before it takes effect in October.",
      "The outcome of the case leaves many manufacturers in doubt about how to proceed, making them reluctant to expand their workforce as they seek to control costs, Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The slowdown is symptomatic of an environment where purchasing managers are all under stress, and they are being squeezed by higher costs of goods and reduced demand,\" said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. \"And so in that squeeze, they are having to find ways to offset the higher costs, and one of the avenues to do that is to streamline their operations and make sure that they only have the essential talent on hand.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to several requests for comment on CAP's findings. The Office of the United States Trade Representative and National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Immigration effect",
      "The Trump administration's crackdown on U.S. immigrants is also weighing on hiring in manufacturing, said Daniel Altman, an economist and author of the High Yield Economics newsletter.",
      "\"Immigration has been an important source of employment in manufacturing for some industries, and if you take away some of their labor supply, that's just gives them more incentive to pursue automation and other forms of capital intensive manufacturing,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The government stepped up its campaign last week when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents\u00a0detained 475 immigrants, most of them Korean, at a Hyundai plant in Georgia because they were suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Border patrol agents have also\u00a0conducted raids targeting immigrants working in retail, according to CBS News. In sectors like farming, food processing and construction, undocumented immigrants make up to 20% of the workforce, according to\u00a0Goldman Sachs.",
      "White House \"border czar\" Tom Homan on Sunday said the White House will expand such efforts.",
      "\"We're going to do more worksite enforcement operations,\" Homan told CNN. \"No one hires an illegal alien out of the goodness of their heart. They hire them because they can work them harder, pay them less, undercut the competition that hires U.S. citizen employees.\"",
      "Other long-term factors that go beyond the Trump administration's policies are also contributing to the ongoing contraction in manufacturing jobs. During the pandemic, manufacturers invested heavily in technologies to automate their operations, Altman noted.",
      "\"We've seen a lot of automation, which means companies do not need as many workers to provide the same output,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Output per worker has been increasing, and when we see that kind of increase in labor productivity, it usually means workers have access to more capital, or better technology or both, and that's what you'd expect with automation.\"",

    "summary": "Economists expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics to revise its jobs data downward for the year ended in March 2025. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "The latest jobs report\u00a0points to a labor market that's faltering, but the slowdown may have begun much earlier. Economists expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics to issue a major downward revision today, showing the nation added hundreds of thousands fewer jobs than first reported.",
      "On Sept. 9, the BLS will release its preliminary benchmark revision to labor market data at 10 a.m. ET, which aims to better account for businesses that have opened or closed. Economists say the revision, covering the 12-month period through March 2025, could show that hiring during that time was about 800,000 jobs lower than previously reported.",
      "The report could draw attention from the Trump administration, as the president last month questioned the validity of the monthly jobs report \u2014 and fired the commissioner\u00a0of the BLS \u2014 after the data included a significant downward revision. Hiring experts and economists point to a job market that's stalling out as some businesses are bearing increased tariff costs while others are tapping artificial intelligence as a way to lower labor costs and\u00a0replace workers.",
      "\"The labor market will likely look even worse after the release of the preliminary benchmark revision to payrolls on Sept. 9,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, noted in an email.",
      "The revision could show that employment was reduced by about 775,000 for the 12 months through March, Adams estimated. That would indicate that the average monthly job growth in 2024 actually stood at 100,000 per month, down from the 165,000 previously reported, he added.",
      "The revision would cover only the first three months of Mr. Trump's second administration, with the bulk of the timeframe occurring in the last year of former President Biden's administration.",
      "Job growth has slowed dramatically in recent months, with the employers adding an average of 29,000 jobs each month from June through August, the most recent BLS data shows.",
      "Why does the government revise its jobs data?",
      "Jobs revisions occur each month, with the BLS updating its data to reflect more recent information it has received from businesses about the pace of hiring. That's because some companies respond late to the BLS' surveys, which means the agency receives an influx of new information after it has issued its initial monthly jobs report, prompting the fresh numbers.",
      "But once a year, the BLS also issues an annual revision based on fresh data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which tracks employment and wages reported by employers that cover more than 95% of U.S. jobs.",
      "While the monthly jobs report relies on about 50,000 responses for each period, the QCEW covers 11 million workplaces \u2014 but that scope requires more time for collecting the data versus the BLS' monthly report, Adams of Comerica said.",
      "\"The QCEW's detail lets it directly measure jobs added at newly-opened workplaces and lost at closing ones, which account for several millions of employment churn each year,\" he added.",
      "What happened in the last annual revision?",
      "The BLS issued a\u00a0major downward\u00a0revision last year for the same annual data, showing that employers added 818,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months ended March 2024 than previously estimated. That lowered the average monthly job growth for the period to 174,000, down from the initial estimate of 242,000.",
      "At the time, the downward revision was seen as evidence that the labor market was showing cracks, and it was viewed as paving the way for the Federal Reserve to cut rates at its September 2024 meeting.",
      "What does this mean for a Fed rate cut?",
      "The Fed will be focused on analyzing recent economic data, such as the latest jobs report and the next Consumer Price Index, which will be issued on Sept. 11. Economists expect the CPI to show an annualized increase of 2.9% in August, higher than the prior month's 2.7% and well above the Fed's goal of reaching a 2% annual rate.",
      "With the labor market hitting a wall in recent months, economists now expect the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark rate at its Sept. 17 meeting. The only question is whether the Fed might usher in a jumbo cut of 0.5 percentage points, or opt for the typical cut of 0.25 percentage points.",
      "\"Market odds currently see a 100% chance of a Fed rate cut this month, with a small constituent seeing an outsized 50-basis-point cut on Sept. 17 within the realm of possibility,\" Anthony Saglimbene, Ameriprise chief market strategist, wrote in a Sept. 8 research note.",
      "But, he added, if August's Consumer Price Index comes in hotter than expected on Sept. 11, that \"would likely throw cold water on the idea that the Fed is considering an outsized September rate cut.\"",
      "President Trump has\u00a0repeatedly lashed out at Powell\u00a0this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over\u00a0whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority\u00a0to do so. Powell's term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026.",
      "Trump nominates replacement commissioner",
      "President Trump\u00a0in August announced E.J. Antoni as his nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Monday. Antoni, a fellow at conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation, has\u00a0criticized the BLS, questioning its methodology.",
      "\"DOGE needs to take a chainsaw to the BLS...,\" he wrote in a November\u00a0post\u00a0on X.",

      "According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of Consumer Expectations, the average \"perceived probability\" of finding a new job after losing one fell 5.8% points to 44.9% among heads of households surveyed in August, the lowest measure on record since 2013 when the New York Fed began collecting data.",
      "At the same time, Americans are increasingly worried about losing their current job. Expectations that the U.S. unemployment rate will be higher a year from now crept up 1.7 percentage points to 39.1%, the New York Fed found.",
      "The data comes as Americans adopt a dimmer view of the economy. According to a\u00a0recent CBS News poll, a majority of respondents continue to say the economy is getting worse.",
      "The labor market has been under a microscope since July employment data showed weaker-than-expected job growth and sharp downward revisions for the months of June and May. August's data, released Friday, pointed to a slump in U.S. hiring, with employers adding only 22,000 jobs. Unemployment also ticked up to 4.3%, the highest rate since October 2022.",
      "\"Employers may be holding onto their current workers amid uncertainty, but they are not adding new positions,\" Allison Shrivastava, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"In turn, employees have taken the hint, staying in their current jobs rather than seeking new opportunities.\"",
      "According to a recent Bankrate survey, about half of Americans are planning to search for a new job in the next year. At the same time, data shows that the number of people changing jobs has slowed significantly since 2022, when millions of people quit their jobs during the \"Great Resignation.\"",
      "During this period, workers had more negotiating power because labor supply disruptions created heightened demand for workers. That balance, however, has started shifting back in favor of employers in recent years.",
      "A recent analysis from Bank of America shows that the percentage of its customers leaving their jobs has largely trended downward from a more than 26% peak in 2022, and is now just slightly above the job change rate in 2019, at 3.3%. Experts say that's mainly because there are fewer opportunities for people to switch jobs and general unease with the state of the labor market.",
      "\"If this stagnation continues, unemployment \u2014 and layoffs \u2014 will increase, further weakening the labor market,\" said Shrivastava.",
      "The Fed, which is tasked with maintaining a robust job market and low inflation, has acknowledged that the downside risks to employment are rising. This strengthens the likelihood that the central bank will cut rates at its next meeting, which is scheduled for Sept. 16 to 17.",

      "China's large trade surplus has become a contentious issue with major trading partners including the U.S. and the European Union. Low-priced Chinese imports are a boon for consumers but can lead to job cuts in manufacturing.",
      "In the first eight months of the year, China's exported $785.3 billion more in goods than it imported from other countries, the monthly customs data showed.",
      "President Donald Trump also has imposed 30% in additional tariffs on imports from China since taking office early this year. He backed down from even higher tariffs after China retaliated with import taxes of its own. The two countries are in talks to try to reach a trade agreement.",
      "The tariffs from both sides and the possibility they could be raised again are having an impact on two-way trade. Chinese exports to the U.S. plunged 33% in August to $47.3 billion, while its imports from the U.S. dropped 16% to $13.4 billion.",
      "Exports to the EU rose 10.4% to $46.8 billion, while imports from the 27-member bloc edged down slightly to $22.8 billion.",

They worked for a variety of different companies at the site, including subcontractors, he said.",
      "South Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said Saturday that more than 300 South Koreans were among the 475 people detained.",
      "No criminal charges were announced during Friday's news conference. The sweep was conducted as part of a month-long investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes, Schrank said. He described Thursday's raid as the largest enforcement operation at a single site in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, which is a unit of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\"This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians and Americans, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy and protecting workers from exploitation,\" Schrank said.",
      "Some of those detained Thursday allegedly entered the U.S. illegally, and others were accused of overstaying their visas or violating visa waivers by working, Schrank said. Most of the detainees were taken to an ICE facility in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida-Georgia state line.",

      "\"This raid is the latest in an ongoing campaign of harassment that has targeted immigrant Georgians as they try to earn an honest living,\" Yvonne Brooks said in a statement. \"Arresting and detaining workers, who are exploited every day and risk their lives every day on the job, creates an atmosphere of fear that terrorizes workers and their families and increases the workload burden on their coworkers.\"",
      "The operation involved law enforcement agents from multiple federal agencies, including ICE, Border Patrol, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the IRS and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, underscoring the government-wide nature of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.",

      "The sweep targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials as the biggest economic development project in the state's history. Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea's biggest automaker, began manufacturing electric vehicles a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people, and has partnered with LG Energy Solution to build an adjacent battery plant, slated to open next year. The search shut down construction on the battery plant.",
      "The Hyundai Motor Company said in a statement that it was aware of the operation and was \"closely monitoring the situation while working to understand the specific circumstances.\"",
      "\"Based on our current understanding, none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,\" it said. \"Hyundai is committed to full compliance with all laws and regulations in every market where we operate. This includes employment verification requirements and immigration laws. We expect the same commitment from all our partners, suppliers, contractors, and subcontractors.\"",
      "\"We are reviewing our processes to ensure that all parties working on our projects maintain the same high standards of legal compliance that we demand of ourselves. This includes thorough vetting of employment practices by contractors and subcontractors,\" the company said, in part, adding that it will \"conduct an investigation to ensure all suppliers and their subcontractors comply with all laws and regulations.\"",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, LG said it was \"closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.\" It said it couldn't immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.",

      "ICE spokesman Lindsay Williams confirmed that federal authorities conducted an enforcement operation at the 3,000-acre site west of Savannah. He said agents were focused on the construction site for the battery plant.",
      "The South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was dispatching officials to the site and urged the U.S. Embassy in Seoul \"to exercise extreme caution to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of Korean citizens are not infringed upon.\"",
      "\"The economic activities of Korean investment companies and the rights and interests of Korean citizens must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement operations,\" the Foreign Ministry said.",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Sep 2025 21:35:02 -0400",
    "summary": "Employers added far fewer jobs last month than economists had predicted, prompting some experts to reassess the economy.",
    "story": [
      "Many economists say Friday's disappointing jobs report\u00a0is sending warning signals about the pace of hiring across the U.S. and the broader health of the economy.",
      "Employers added only 22,000 nonfarm jobs in August, far short of Wall Street analyst forecasts of 80,000, while the nation's unemployment rate rose to 4.3% \u2014 the highest level since October of 2021, when the economy was still reeling from the effects of the pandemic. In 2024, the economy added an average of 168,000 per month, labor data shows.",
      "The job market is faltering partly because of the Trump administration's tariffs, which are heightening economic uncertainty, boosting costs for importers and complicating business planning.. Some economists also think that rapid employer adoption of artificial intelligence is hurting demand for recent college graduates and other entry-level workers, although there is ongoing debate among researchers about how much AI is affecting job growth.",
      "\"Uncertainty makes it very, very difficult for people in companies to make decisions,\" Laura Ullrich, director of economic research for North America at job-search firm Indeed and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"My former boss says that when you are driving through fog, you slow down \u2014 but if it gets thick enough, you pull over.\"",
      "The Trump administration defended its trade and other economic policies, expressing confidence they will eventually drive growth.",
      "\"President Trump's trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"As these unprecedented trade deals and the administration's pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and historic working-class tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\"",
      "In response to the jobs report, President Trump on Friday posted on social media that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell should have moved sooner to cut interest rates. Lower borrowing costs can stimulate job growth by driving consumer spending and making it cheaper for businesses to expand their operations.",
      "\"Jerome 'Too Late' Powell should have lowered rates long ago. As usual, he's 'Too Late!',\" the president wrote.",
      "Here are three key takeaways from economists about the latest employment figures.",
      "The job market is stalling",
      "Overall hiring in August was far weaker than economists expected. More troubling, the numbers look considerably worse after stripping out the two sectors that showed some of the strongest growth in August \u2014 health care and social assistance. Health care companies created 31,000 new jobs last month, while social assistance \u2014 employers such as food banks and those providing services for disabled people, children and low-income families \u2014 added 16,000 new jobs.",
      "But many other sectors had stagnant or even declining job growth, such as manufacturing, which shed 12,000 jobs in August, and professional and business services, which lost 17,000.",
      "\"Absent the secular gains in health care and social assistance, the cyclical categories of the private service sector (excluding health care and social assistance) have collectively turned negative on average in the past four months,\" Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic said in a report Friday.",
      "Hiring this summer was also weaker than previously thought. The Labor Department's latest\u00a0data\u00a0shows employers cut 13,000 jobs in June, rather than adding 14,000 new hires as the agency had reported in its first estimate for that month. The June drop marks the first decline in monthly jobs since late 2020.",
      "Although July payroll gains were revised up slightly, total job growth for June and July was 21,000 lower than previously reported, according to the Labor Department.",
      "Job growth is at its lowest level in 15 years",
      "The average monthly job gains since January represent the fewest jobs added over the first eight months of the year in 15 years, excluding the pandemic-triggered crisis period of 2020, Indeed's Ullrich noted.",
      "\"We haven't added this few jobs since 2010, and we have 17 million more people in the labor market than we did then,\" she said. \"That, to me, is a staggering headline.\"",
      "That loss of momentum in creating new jobs is raising concerns about the overall strength of the economy. The nation's gross domestic product \u2014 the total value of goods and services \u2014 is expanding\u00a0more slowly than in 2024, while inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's annual growth target of 2%.",
      "That combination has caused some economists to warn about the risk of the U.S. entering a period of\u00a0\"stagflation,\" a toxic mix of high prices and weak growth. Forecasters expect Consumer Price Index data for August, which is set to be released next week, to show inflation rising at an annual rate of 2.9%, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "\"Concerns about the health of the economy are starting to creep in,\" Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in an email. \"Equally, a strong inflation print next week could strike new fears about a stagflationary mix.\"",
      "The Fed is highly likely to cut interest rates this month",
      "Across the board, economists on Friday said the subpar August jobs report virtually locks in a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut when policymakers meet on Sept. 17.\u00a0 The question is by how much.",
      "August hiring was so anemic that some economists now think the Fed could opt for a 0.5 percentage point cut \u2014 double the typical rate cut \u2014 in a bid to keep the job market on track. Traders now see a 10% chance of a jumbo cut and a 90% likelihood of a 0.25 percentage point reduction, according to CME FedWatch. Prior to Friday's jobs report, the market was completely discounting a jumbo cut, the tool shows.",
      "Some economists also think the Fed will continue trimming rates later in 2025 to counter the weak job market.",
      "\"With the weak job growth, the Fed is cleared to cut rates in September. The question is whether we get [0.25 or 0.50 percentage points],\" Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy, said in an email. \"We continue to believe the Fed will ease into the cutting cycle here with one rather than two, but there is some latitude here.\"",

    "summary": "The latest employment data could inform the Federal Reserve's next rate decision meeting, set for Sept. 17.",
    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 22,000 jobs in August, falling short of economists' muted expectations and signaling the labor market is facing sharp headwinds from mounting economic uncertainty amid the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs.",
      "The numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 80,000 last month, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in August, up from 4.2% in July, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.",
      "The latest data points to an ongoing slowdown in the labor market, with employers hiring an average of 29,000 each month from June through August, versus 168,000 workers each month in 2024. Revised data shows that employers shed 13,000 jobs in June rather than adding the 14,000 that had been reported a month earlier, marking the first decline since late 2020.",
      "Some companies are paring back hiring plans amid the on-again, off-again uncertainty of the Trump administration's tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies. Businesses in seven of the Fed's 12 regional districts canvassed in the latest so-called Beige Book, a survey of local economic conditions, said they were hesitant to hire because of weaker demand and uncertainty over the near-term outlook.",
      "\"August's employment report confirmed that the labor market has headed off a cliff-edge,\" Bradley Saunders, North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a Friday research report.",
      "Consumers are also dour, with a new CBS News poll finding that Americans are continuing to rate the U.S. economy negatively, with most respondents picking \"uncertain\" and \"struggling\" to describe its current state.",
      "The August jobs report marks the first since President Trump\u00a0fired former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Aug. 1 in the wake of a disappointing July jobs report, which included a significant downward revision of May and June hiring figures.",
      "Citing the large revisions, Mr. Trump questioned the validity of the government data, although the BLS typically revises its prior reports each month based on fresher responses from employers.",
      "The new revisions",
      "On Friday, the BLS revised the prior two months' data, showing that employers shed 13,000 jobs in June, revising the month's hiring downward by 27,000 fewer jobs. That marks the first monthly decline in hiring since December 2020, when the U.S. was in the midst of an economic crisis caused by the pandemic.",
      "The BLS also revised July's jobs numbers upward, showing that employers added 79,000 workers that month, rather than the 73,000 reported in August.",
      "The revisions show that the economy added 21,000 fewer jobs in June and July than had earlier been reported by the BLS.",
      "What economists say",
      "The labor market data is complicating the Federal Reserve's next rate cut decision, which set for Sept. 17. The central bank's dual mandate requires it to ensure that both inflation and unemployment remain low, but inflation has been edging upward, which economists say is partly due to Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The Fed's most powerful weapon for battling inflation is to hike interest rates, yet its best option for helping the job market is to lower borrowing costs, making it cheaper for businesses to expand. With the combination of rising inflation and weaker hiring, the Fed is in a tough position, economists say.",
      "Last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has been under pressure from Mr. Trump to cut rates, signaled that the central bank is open to reducing rates at its September meeting, citing risks to the labor market.",
      "\"The labor market continues to show fatigue as businesses hold back on hiring amid uncertainty around the direction of inflation, tariffs and the strength of the underlying economy,\" said Joe Gaffoglio, CEO at Mutual of America Capital Management, in an email after the data was released.",
      "\"Recent labor data showed that more individuals are unemployed in the U.S. (7.24 million) than there are available jobs (7.18 million), which hasn't happened since April 2021,\" he added.",
      "The latest data is likely to ensure a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting, experts said on Friday. The lower-than-expected hiring, as well as June's negative revision, could also persuade the central bank to cut later in the year as well, they added.",
      "\"The Federal Reserve needs to cut interest rates in September and probably October and December, too. The 'no hiring' economy is turning to a layoff economy and if that worsens, it will lead to a recession. This needs to be stopped,\" Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an email.",

      "With the Powerball jackpot reaching\u00a0nearly $1.8 billion for Saturday night's drawing, there's been\u00a0lottery fever in the air. If you're one of the lucky ones whose $2 ticket ends\u00a0up worth millions, what do you do with all that money?",
      "Jackpot winners have the option to either take a lump sum payment of the estimated cash value \u2014 in this case, a total of roughly $820 million \u2014 or they can opt to receive their prize as an annuity, paid in 30 graduated payments over 29 years. In either case, those totals are before the Internal Revenue Service takes a cut, as do most states.",
      "Should you take a lump sum payment or annuity option?",
      "Dan Geltrude, a certified public accountant in New Jersey, told CBS News: \"I personally would take the lump sum payment because I feel comfortable in how I can invest my money. However, having that much money for a lot of people is dangerous.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Sep 2025 16:55:35 -0400",
    "summary": "Armani never relinquished control over the multibillion-dollar company he created, a key to his enormous success.",
    "story": [
      "Giorgio Armani leaves a legacy not only as a seminal figure in the history of fashion, but also as a visionary business leader who built a globally recognized brand and multibillion-dollar business empire, industry experts said after his death Thursday at age 91.",
      "\"Armani made certain that his vision was consistent and that it was always classy, even down to presentation in the Armani Exchange stores,\" Shawn Grain Carter, an associate professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Armani, or \"Re Giorgio\" (King George) as the Italians call him, famously created luxury looks for Hollywood stars, while also producing stylish accessories and clothing for everyday consumers.",
      "While meticulously tailored clothing made from quality fabrics has always been at the heart of the Armani brand, the designer expanded his business over the years to include not just perfumes and accessories but home furnishings, cosmetics, books, flowers \u2014 even chocolates. Connecting them all was sophisticated design, which Armani wove into all things he put his name on.",
      "\"He was masterful in sticking to his vision, but executing it in a way that would be accessible luxury, a quiet luxury, but still tasteful and elegantly crafted,\" Grain Carter said.",
      "Among Armani's most celebrated contributions and successful business maneuvers was the power suit, a softly tailored, ready-to-wear take on office attire that quickly rose in popularity among the American business class.",
      "Introduced in the '70s, the Armani suit was a bold deviation from the rigid, restrictive suits businessmen were accustomed to wearing. Armani's elegantly tailored suits quickly became a must in every well-heeled man's closet.",
      "Beth Dincuff, an associate professor at New York's Parsons School of Design, said Armani cultivated the idea of a \"sophisticated man who cared about how he looked, who was aware of his physique and who wanted to show it off in a new way.\"",
      "Armani soon brought that masculine sensibility to women's fashion with the pantsuit, a shoulder-padded jacket and tailored trousers. This gave women a refined option for the office that projected confidence and power.",
      "\"That's attributed to Giorgio Armani \u2014 making it OK for a woman to wear a pantsuit but still look like a woman in terms of a power aesthetic,\" said Grain Carter.",
      "Armani's designs also had a knack for tapping into the zeitgeist. He\u00a0told CBS News in 2006 that his new line of women's clothes was in response to the feminist movement. Women needed their own version of the traditional men's suit jacket, Armani thought.",
      "Celebrities and Armani",
      "Using celebrities to elevate the Armani brand was another to key to the designer's business success. He began by outfitting Richard Gere in the 1980 neo-noir crime drama \"American Gigolo.\" Armani went on to design clothes for more than 150 films throughout his career.",
      "\"His idea to reach out to celebrities was very, very important,\" said Dincuff, noting that this approach to marketing fashion was novel at the time.",
      "Armani pivoted to dressing celebrities on the red carpet in the 1990s, where his\u00a0black-tie outfits and glittering evening gowns often stole the show. Some early looks that captured popular attention included the oversized Armani suit worn by Julia Roberts at the 1990s Golden Globes and a champagne-colored Armani suit that Jodie Foster wore at the 1992 Academy Awards.",
      "The list of celebrities that have\u00a0worn Armani on the red carpet is long and includes Beyonc\u00e9, Selena Gomez, \u00a0Anne Hathaway, Michelle Pfeiffer, Margot Robbie and Winona Ryder.",
      "His own boss",
      "Central to Armani's success was the fact that he never relinquished control of the multibillion company he created, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. In rejecting a merger or sale to a larger industry rival, the Italian fashion designer was always his own boss.",
      "This allowed Armani to maintain creative control and consistency over his expanding business empire, distinguishing him from other designers.",
      "While he did strike several licensing deals over his career with companies like EssilorLuxottica\u00a0and\u00a0L'Or\u00e9al, he kept the majority of his business portfolio in-house. That included everything from Armani Priv\u00e9, his haute couture fashion collection and fragrance line, to Armani Exchange \u2014 a more affordable fashion line geared toward younger generations, said Grain Carter. Armani also kept the collections Giorgio Armani and Emporio Armani under his purview.",
      "\"All of this was in-house and he controlled it from concept to production to distribution to marketing to how it is financed,\" Grain Carter said. \"He was active at every level, at every step.\"",
      "Today, the Armani empire has more than 9,000 employees along with seven industrial hubs and over 600 stores worldwide, according to figures released in 2023.",
      "As for potential succession plans, the Giorgio Armani company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"I cannot really contemplate the next person, because there will be no other Giorgio Armani,\" Grain Carter said.",

      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco has scheduled a Monday hearing to review the settlement terms.",
      "Books are known to be important sources of data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build the AI large language models behind chatbots like Anthropic's Claude and its chief rival, OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Alsup's June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it \"knew had been pirated.\" It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.",
      "Debut thriller novel \"The Lost Night\" by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the Books3 dataset.",
      "Anthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.",
      "The Authors Guild told its thousands of members last month that it expected \"damages will be minimally $750 per work and could be much higher\" if Anthropic was found at trial to have willfully infringed their copyrights. The settlement's higher award \u2014 approximately $3,000 per work \u2014 likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.",
      "On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement \"an excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors' works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Department of Transportation is dropping a proposed rule that would have required airlines to offer cash to passengers whose flights were disrupted.",
      "The rule, which never went into effect, would have required carriers to provide compensation \"to mitigate passenger inconveniences\" for cancellations or delays that were within a carrier's control.",
      "Reuters was the first to report that the Transportation Department was shelving the proposal.",
      "The proposal was introduced under President Biden and then-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. It would've required airlines to pay up to $300 for domestic delays of three to six hours and up to $775 for flight delays lasting at least nine hours.",
      "\"The ability of airlines to choose the services that they provide to mitigate passenger inconveniences resulting from flight disruptions under current U.S. law contrasts with consumer protection regimes in other jurisdiction,\" the proposed rule states.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Transportation told CBS News: \"We will faithfully implement all aviation consumer protection requirements mandated by Congress, including the requirement to refund ticket prices to passengers in the case of airline canceled or substantially delayed flights when consumers choose not to travel. Some of the rules proposed or adopted by the previous administration, however, went beyond what Congress has required by statute, and we intend to reconsider those extra-statutory requirements.\"",
      "\"This action does not change the Department's commitment or intent to carry out the consumer protection mandates from Congress in the recent FAA Reauthorization Act, including provisions relating to refunds. Instead, the action is part of USDOT's effort to ensure the traveling public is treated fairly while also acknowledging the realities of carriers' operations and the impact of overly burdensome regulations on the American people,\" the DOT spokesperson said.",
      "Although airlines guarantee rebooking, plus meals and lodging vouchers, for customers affected by flight delays and cancellations, none guarantee cash compensation for such inconveniences.",
      "Airlines were opposed to the proposed regulation when it was announced in December. At the time, Airlines for America, a trade group representing the nation's carriers, said it would \"drive up ticket prices, make air travel less accessible for price-sensitive travelers and negatively impact carrier operations.\"",
      "The group on Thursday cheered the Transportation Department's decision to drop the compensation proposal.",
      "\"We are encouraged by this Department of Transportation reviewing unnecessary and burdensome regulations that exceed its authority and don't solve issues important to our customers,\" Airlines for America said in a statement. \"We look forward to working with DOT on implementing President Trump's deregulatory agenda.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Donald Trump had dinner Tuesday night at a seafood restaurant near the White House, promoting his deployment of the National Guard and federalizing the police force in an effort to crack down on crime in the nation's capital.",
      "His motorcade made the short distance to Joe's Seafood, Prime Steak & Stone Crab on 15th Street in the northwestern quadrant of the city following weeks of the president boasting about mobilizing federal authorities and the military that he says have made Washington \"a safe zone.\"",
      "Cheers were heard as the president stepped from his limo - though there was also a smattering of boos and chants from protesters opposing U.S. policy in support of Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza.",
      "\"We're standing right in the middle of D.C., which as you know about, over the last year, was a very unsafe place - over the last 20 years - and now it's got virtually no crime,\" Mr. Trump told reporters.",
      "He added that he wouldn't have stood out \"in the middle of the street\" as recently as a couple of months ago. The suggestion was farcical, however, and didn't actually reflect whether crime levels had changed in Washington, since the president is always surrounded by heavy security wherever he goes.",
      "After entering the restaurant, video on social media showed him shaking hands with some diners inside. But he also stared for an extended period at a small group of protesters who held up miniature Gaza flags and chanted: \"Free D.C.! Free Palestine! Trump is the Hitler of our time!\"",
      "The president moved closer to them and could be seen gesturing briefly but didn't appear to speak.",
      "Seconds later, Mr. Trump gestured for the area to be cleared out, then gestured again.",
      "Secret Service agents removed the protesters, saying repeatedly, \"Time to go. Time to go.\" Some protesters waved banners of the Palestinian flag as they were leaving.",
      "Others in the restaurant could be heard booing or chanting \"U-S-A! U-S-A!\"",
      "Feminist organization Codepink says it was the group that had the protestors in the restaurant.",
      "Some restaurants have reported drops in reservations since Mr. Trump first announced the federal crackdown on Aug. 7, while there have been frequent street protests decrying his actions. Increased military and police presence also has occasionally sparked standoffs between residents and authorities in normally quiet neighborhoods.",

      "Accompanying the president for dinner were Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, as well as Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff. In his comments before going into dinner, Mr. Trump said, \"The restaurants are booming.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has said he is firing Cook from her role over allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago.",
    "story": [
      "A federal Judge on Tuesday ruled that\u00a0Lisa Cook can remain in her role on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors while her lawsuit challenging President Trump's attempt to fire her from her post plays out.",
      "\"President Trump has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cook's removal,\" U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, wrote in her ruling, which is likely to be appealed.",
      "Mr. Trump said he is firing Cook over allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago, resulting in more favorable loan terms.",
      "\"President Trump's stated cause refers only to allegations regarding Cook's conduct before she began serving on the Federal Reserve Board,\" Cobb wrote. \"As discussed above, such allegations are not a legally permissible cause.\"",
      "In addition to casting doubt on whether Mr. Trump established cause for Cook's firing, in issuing the stay, Cobb also ruled that Cook's right to due process was violated and that she would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction was not granted.",
      "Abbe David Lowell, an attorney representing Cook in her lawsuit, said in a statement to CBS News on Tuesday night, \"This ruling recognizes and reaffirms the importance of safeguarding the independence of the Federal Reserve from illegal political interference. Allowing the President to unlawfully remove Governor Cook on unsubstantiated and vague allegations would endanger the stability of our financial system and undermine the rule of law. Governor Cook will continue to carry out her sworn duties as a Senate-confirmed Board Governor.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "Under federal law, Fed board members\u00a0serve for 14-year terms\u00a0and can only be fired by the president \"for cause.\" Cook has served on the Fed since being appointed to complete another member's unexpired term in 2022, and her current term would run until 2038.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook on Aug. 26, writing in a letter\u00a0terminating her\u00a0from the Fed Board of Governors that he had \"sufficient cause\" to remove her from the position. The president cited a previous letter from Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that was sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging Cook made false statements on mortgage agreements.",
      "Pulte, an appointee of Mr. Trump's, alleged that Cook in 2021 claimed two different properties in Michigan and Georgia as her primary residence on mortgage documents to get better lending terms. Cook has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense.",
      "Cook's lawyers have previously said in court filings that Mr. Trump's \"unsubstantiated allegation that Governor Cook 'may have' or 'seems' to have erred in filling out a mortgage form in her capacity as a private citizen-does not amount to 'cause' for removal within the meaning of the FRA [Federal Reserve Act].\"",
      "\"None of the alleged misconduct occurred during the performance of Governor Cook's duties as a Federal Board member,\" they wrote. \"And the President and Director Pulte have not even alleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was intentional.\"",
      "In court arguments Friday, Lowell said Cook was not given notice of the allegations or a chance to respond to them, violating, he argued, her due process rights.",
      "Cook's lawsuit argues that Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her is \"unprecedented and illegal,\" noting it would be the first removal of a governor by the president in the Fed's 112-year history.",
      "\"The President's effort to terminate a Senate-confirmed Federal Reserve Board member is a broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System,\" Cook's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that Mr. Trump's theory of \"cause\" would allow him to remove any Fed Board member with whom he disagrees on policy, eroding the central bank's independence and threatening its mission of providing economic stability.",
      "Cobb appeared to agree with their argument, writing in her ruling on Tuesday, \"Taken to its logical conclusion, the Government's argument leads to an absurd result: While admitting that the President cannot remove an official for policy disagreements, the Government claims that under Reagan, a removal on the grounds of a policy disagreement would nevertheless be unreviewable. ... This cannot be the case. Such a rule would provide no practical insulation for the members of the Board of Governors. It would mean that the President could, in practice, 'remove a member ... merely because he wanted his own appointees.'\"",
      "Cobb also wrote that Mr. Trump \"does not address her [Cook's] in-office conduct at all, let alone provide any examples of how Cook's performance or personal conduct since assuming the role has been in any way deficient in carrying out her statutory duties,\" adding that Mr. Trump's termination letter \"does not identify any conduct that Cook has engaged in while serving as a member of the Board that indicates that Cook lacks the competence or trustworthiness for the role.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook came amid his repeated\u00a0attacks on the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, over the central bank's handling of interest rates.",
      "Cook, Powell and 10 other Fed officials sit on a committee that controls the nation's monetary policy and sets target interest rates, with a dual mandate of keeping inflation low and employment levels high. This work is typically done independently, with little to no input from political leaders.",
      "While the Fed did cut interest rates last year, after they had reached their highest point in decades in 2022 and 2023 in a bid to fight off inflation, the central bank has recently kept rates at relatively high levels. Powell has cited concerns that lowering rates could again lead to a swift rise in inflation and that Mr. Trump's tariffs could also lead to an increase in consumer prices.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday he's \"not thrilled\" and is \"very unhappy\" after Israel's military said it targeted senior leadership of the Hamas terrorist organization in strikes in Qatar's capital of Doha. The strikes drew condemnation from the Qatari government and pushback from the White House.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces told CBS News the operation was dubbed \"Summit of Fire\" and targeted leaders of Hamas who the IDF said had for years \"led the terrorist organization's operations, are directly responsible for the brutal October 7 massacre, and have been orchestrating and managing the war against the State of Israel.\"",
      "The move put the Trump administration in an unusual position because both Israel and Qatar are close U.S. allies, with Qatar hosting the Middle East's largest American military base. Qatar has also hosted Hamas' political offices for years, and the Gulf monarchy has been involved in mediating ceasefire talks between the Israeli government and Hamas.",
      "Speaking to reporters Tuesday night outside a restaurant in Washington, D.C., Mr. Trump said he was \"not thrilled about the whole situation,\" calling it \"not a good situation.\"",
      "\"I was very unhappy about it, very unhappy about every aspect,\" the president said.",
      "The president also emphasized that he is aiming to secure the release of the remaining hostages that Hamas captured during the group's Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.. Mr. Trump has pressed Hamas and Israel to reach a ceasefire deal that could pause fighting in the Gaza Strip in exchange for the release of dozens of Israeli hostages who are still in the Palestinian enclave. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said 20 of those captives are still believed to be alive.",
      "In a joint statement Tuesday on the strikes, Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz said they \"believed that the action was completely justified in light of the fact that this Hamas leadership was the one who initiated and organized the October 7 massacre, and has not stopped launching murderous actions against the State of Israel and its citizens since then.\"",
      "Netanyahu said Israel takes full responsibility for the strike.",
      "Hamas said in a statement that five of its members died, but \"the brothers in the negotiating delegation\" were not killed, as the group reviews a ceasefire proposal floated by the Trump administration.

      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration was notified by the U.S. military of the strikes. A senior U.S. official and a diplomatic source familiar with the strikes told CBS News that Israel notified the U.S. of the attack as it was about to happen. Two other U.S. officials told CBS News the U.S. did not coordinate with Israel on planning the strikes. A senior U.S. intelligence official told CBS News that the U.S. told Qatar about the strike after being informed about it by Israel.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday said it will decide whether President Trump can impose his most sweeping tariffs, setting up a major test of one of the pillars of the president's economic agenda.",
      "The high court agreed to review lower court decisions\u00a0that found Mr. Trump did not have the authority to issue many of his global tariffs under an emergency powers law. The Justice Department appealed one of those rulings, from a federal appeals court, to the Supreme Court last week and asked it to move swiftly.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that upholding the ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit would put the United States at a disadvantage and expose the nation to retaliatory trade policies.",
      "The case is the first in which the Supreme Court will directly decide the legality of one of Mr. Trump's second-term policies. The high court has been asked roughly two dozen times to intervene in challenges to many of the president's initiatives, but on an interim emergency basis.",
      "The justices said arguments in the tariffs case would take place in the first week of November.",
      "The tariffs case",
      "One of the disputes before the Supreme Court was brought by a group of small businesses and 12 states. They argued that he did not have the authority to impose many of the global tariffs under the emergency powers law that he invoked, called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.",
      "A federal trade court ruled in May that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he issued the tariffs under IEEPA, and the Federal Circuit upheld that decision late last month. In its 7-4 decision, the appeals court agreed that the tariffs are illegal.",
      "\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the appeals court wrote. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"",
      "The appeals court did not decide whether IEEPA authorizes any tariffs at all. Instead, it only resolved whether sweeping duties that Mr. Trump imposed through a series of executive orders earlier this year are allowed under the law.",
      "The second case involves a pair of Illinois-based companies that sell educational toys and products. A federal district judge in Washington, D.C., ruled in May that IEEPA \"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in his executive orders. The decision from U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras was more narrow, barring the Trump administration only from collecting any tariff from the two companies. Contreras paused his decision while the Justice Department appealed to the D.C. Circuit.",
      "The two companies asked the Supreme Court in June to fast track the case and leap frog the appeals court in Washington, D.C.",
      "A spokesperson for one of the companies, Learning Resources, said in a statement it was \"gratified\" that the Supreme Court would hear the case.",
      "\"There is a lot riding on this historic case,\" the spokesperson said. \"The unlawful IEEPA tariffs have wreaked havoc in our economy for too long now.\"",
      "The duties at issue include those announced by Mr. Trump in early April \u2014 which he refers to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 that set a 10% baseline rate for nearly every country, and higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners. It also involves a set of levies on imports from Canada, Mexico and China in response to what Mr. Trump said is their failure to address the trafficking of fentanyl across U.S. borders.",
      "The president has used the tariffs, and the threat of additional duties, to try to force trading partners to negotiate trade deals with his administration. So far, \u00a0he has announced frameworks of trade agreements with the European Union and six countries: the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.",
      "Mr. Trump is the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, though it has been used by his predecessors to hit foreign nations with economic sanctions. His administration has argued that a denial of tariff authority would put the U.S. on the brink of \"economic catastrophe\" and make the nation poorer.",
      "In urging the Supreme Court to move quickly, Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing that the Federal Circuit's \"erroneous decision has disrupted highly impactful, sensitive, ongoing diplomatic trade negotiations, and cast a pall of legal uncertainty over the President's efforts to protect our country by preventing an unprecedented economic and foreign-policy crisis.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued that IEEPA gives the president broad powers to regulate trade, including imposing tariffs, \"to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to U.S. national security, foreign policy or the economy.",
      "Mr. Trump has said that trade deficits and the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. constituted threats to the national security and economy of the U.S., and invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs to address them.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs have remained in effect, since the Federal Circuit put its decision on hold until Oct. 14 to give the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court.",
      "The plaintiffs \u2014 the five small businesses and 12 states \u2014 agreed that the Supreme Court needs to resolve the legality of Mr. Trump's tariffs, calling it an issue of \"great\" and \"undoubted importance.\" They argued that the tariffs are illegal and urged the high court to affirm the Federal Circuit's decision.",
      "\"The government's case rests entirely on the notion that the phrase 'regulate \u2026 importation' in IEEPA constitutes a boundless power to impose tariffs on the American people whenever the President wants, at whatever level he wants, for whatever countries and products he wants, and for as long as he wants, merely by declaring that longstanding U.S. trade deficits are a national 'emergency' and an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' \u2014 assertions the government claims are effectively unreviewable,\" lawyers for the small businesses wrote in a Supreme Court filing. \"There are no limits.\"",
      "The states, meanwhile, said that the Constitution gives Congress the power to collect taxes, and the Trump administration is claiming that the president has sweeping authority to impose tariffs \"on any country, at any rate, and for however long he likes.\"",
      "\"The President's chaotic implementation of that purported authority, which changed by the day and wreaked havoc on capital markets and the economy, illustrates both the breadth of powers that the President claims and the danger of unlimited authority in this domain,\" they warned in court papers.",
      "The legal challenge to Mr. Trump's tariffs is likely to be one of several involving the president's second-term policies that the Supreme Court takes up. Other cases involving his immigration policies and efforts to remove members of independent agencies have progressed through the lower courts, and the Trump administration is likely to seek Supreme Court review of decisions against it.",

      "The district that Walkinshaw will soon represent is just outside of Washington, D.C., and includes the city of Fairfax and most of Fairfax County. The district is reliably Democratic: In the 2024 election, Connolly won reelection 67% to 33% and former Vice President Kamala Harris won Fairfax County 65.6% to 30.9%.",
      "The special election comes less than a month before an end-of-September deadline for Congress to either pass a new federal funding package or face a government shutdown.",
      "President Trump's sweeping cuts to the federal workforce, led by the Department of Government Efficiency, are also a key issue in Virginia's 11th congressional district. Some 12% of the district's workers are employed by the federal government \u2014 more than almost any other district in the country, according to a 2024 Congressional Research Service report.",
      "\"The dominant issue in this race has been job cuts caused by Donald Trump, and I think that's meaningful for the rest of the country,\" Walkinshaw told CBS News. \"So every single person in our community now knows somebody who's lost their job because of those [cuts].\"",
      "Asked by Fox News about the cuts, Whitson called federal workers \"wonderful people\" with \"great experience,\" but added: \"The people in our district who have lost their job or who are worried about losing their job, they don't need sympathy, they need solutions.\"",
      "He said that he planned to work with the Trump administration and, \"if there are good federal workers that have been pushed out of the federal workforce, I want to find a way to get them back in.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a group of lawmakers \u2014 led by GOP Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna \u2014 is pushing a bill that would require the federal government to release files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Massie is gathering signatures for a \"discharge petition\" that would force a vote on the bill if it's signed by a majority of House members, or 218. It's two signatures shy of that target, as all 212 Democrats and four Republicans have signed.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department on Tuesday filed a federal criminal charge against the man accused of the deadly stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska in Charlotte, North Carolina, last month.",
      "The Justice Department announced that the suspect in the attack, Decarlos Brown Jr., is charged with one count of committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system.",
      "\"Iryna Zarutska was a young woman living the American dream \u2014 her horrific murder is a direct result of failed soft-on-crime policies that put criminals before innocent people,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \"I have directed my attorneys to federally prosecute DeCarlos Brown Jr., a repeat violent offender with a history of violent crime, for murder. We will seek the maximum penalty for this unforgivable act of violence \u2014 he will never again see the light of day as a free man.\"",
      "The Justice Department said the charge carries a maximum penalty of life in prison or death. Federal judges are responsible for imposing sentences after conviction.",
      "The attack, which occurred on Aug. 22, has garnered increased attention in recent days, with President Trump and his allies claiming the attack shows Democratic-run cities and states are failing to protect their residents.",
      "\"The most enraging and unacceptable part of the story is that her death was entirely preventable. Decarlos Brown never should have been on that train that night,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.",
      "Surveillance footage showed Zarutska entering a light rail car on Aug. 22 and sitting in a row in front of Brown. Four minutes later, Brown allegedly pulled a knife from his pocket and struck Zarutska three times from behind, according to an FBI affidavit accompanying the criminal complaint.",
      "Police found Zarutska dead on the light rail with a single stab wound in the middle of her neck and a small cut on her left knee, the affidavit said. Brown was apprehended at the scene.",

      "\"The act itself doesn't scream federal crime,\" he said. \"But when we started to see the effects of that act, and we saw the public saying, 'We're not riding the light rail anymore, we're afraid to go to the park,' that's when my mind and my office started saying \u2026 this might be a federal charge.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 09 Sep 2025 19:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Missouri's GOP-led Legislature returned for a special session earlier this week with a mid-decade redistricting push started by President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Republicans in the Missouri House on Tuesday advanced a new\u00a0proposed congressional map, part of a mid-decade redistricting push started by President Trump to hold onto \u2013 and possibly expand \u2014 the GOP's razor-thin majority in the U.S. House.",
      "The proposed maps aim to make Missouri's congressional delegation seven Republicans and one Democrat, a change from its current delegation that is made up of six Republicans and two Democrats. The map breaks up the 5th Congressional District, currently held by Democratic Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver, making it more conservative.",
      "Missouri is the third state to consider redrawing its congressional maps. Texas Republicans\u00a0passed\u00a0their redistricting effort last month, shifting five Democratic districts toward Republicans. And California Democrats responded by passing their own redistricting plan that would make five GOP-held seats more favorable to Democrats, though the California plan still needs to be approved by voters later this year.",
      "The measure passed Missouri's state House 90-65, with several Republicans voting against it. It now heads to the state Senate, where Republicans hold a majority.",
      "Mr. Trump applauded Missouri lawmakers in a post on Truth Social, calling the proposed map \"much fairer, and improved.\"",
      "The president said the map \"will give the wonderful people of Missouri the opportunity to elect an additional MAGA Republican in the 2026 Midterm Elections.\"",
      "Missouri GOP state Rep. Dirk Deaton said while supporting the bill: \"I appreciate the leadership of President Trump as well. I appreciate all of those who've spoken out in favor, going back to 2022 and throughout the years, of a congressional map that will better represent Missouri in Washington, D.C.\"",
      "Cleaver's Kansas City district has long been a target for Republicans, as their numbers have grown in Missouri so much that Democrats do not hold any statewide elected office. But state lawmakers left it in place during the 2021 redistricting and instead split Columbia, one of the state's other Democratic strongholds, into two districts, according to University of Missouri professor Peverill Squire.",
      "The maps are meant to squeeze out another seat for Republicans, but as Squire noted, \"none of this comes without any cost.\" Mid-decade redistricting is using data that are several years old at that point, and things could have changed along the margins where the districts are being redrawn, making it far from certain that the outcome will be what Republicans want. Further, the legislature is also debating a ballot measure in this special session, the outcome of which could be affected by sentiment over redistricting.",
      "Additionally, the new map will likely be challenged in court, as have similar efforts in Texas and California.",
      "\"There's a lot of risk for the Republicans, and the only thing at the moment that they stand to gain is maybe one more House seat,\" Squire said.",
      "Kehoe announced last month that he would be calling a special session to address redistricting, the latest state in a push started this summer in Texas. In mid-July, Mr. Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson asked Texas Republicans to take a look at their congressional map for redistricting. Mr. Trump said he felt that given his margin of victory in Texas, he is \"entitled\" to five more Republican seats. Texas currently has 25 Republicans and 13 Democrats in its delegation.",
      "Congressional districts are normally settled once every 10 years, after the census shows population shifts. Some states, such as Missouri and Texas, only require the state legislature and the governor to change the districts, but others have more complicated paths for changes to the congressional map, such as independent commissions or requiring voters to give final approval.",
      "How are Democrats responding?",
      "In response to these redistricting efforts, the Democratic National Committee is mobilizing support for the state's Democrats in an attempt to bring national attention to Missouri, the latest epicenter of Mr. Trump's push for redrawing congressional districts.",
      "The DNC is leading efforts to recruit Missourians to submit public comment during the hearing process and attend a Wednesday rally in front of the Missouri State Capitol building to denounce redistricting efforts. Ohio House Democratic leader Rep. Dani Issacsohn and state Rep. Desiree Tims will be in attendance, given that Mr. Trump has warned the redistricting battle may head to the Buckeye state next.",
      "DNC Chair Ken Martin referred to this latest redistricting battle as an attempt to silence dissatisfied voters.",
      "\"Republicans know they're in trouble,\" Ken Martin told CBS News in a statement. \"Donald Trump and his party have ripped health care away from working families and jacked up prices on everyday goods in a self-serving plot to make the ultra-wealthy even wealthier.\"",
      "What happened with Texas and California's redistricting?",
      "Texas' Republican Gov. Greg Abbott called a 30-day special session to address redistricting and a number of other topics. Two weeks into the special session, Democrats left the state to deny Republicans a quorum \u2014 an option not available in Missouri, where only a simple majority is needed for a quorum. They ran out the clock on the special session, but they eventually returned after Abbott called another one, and the measure passed easily.",
      "But they garnered enough national attention that California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that he would redraw his state's congressional districts to garner up to five seats for Democrats, although California requires the new districts to be approved by voters. Newsom pushed a ballot measure through the Democratic-led Legislature, and it passed easily.",

She was shot and killed by a police officer. A federal investigation of the shooting determined charges were not warranted against the officer.",
      "The Pentagon initially denied the Babbitt family's request for military funeral honors for her. It stated in a letter that the circumstances preceding her death \u2014 that she was \"fatally shot after having illegally entered\" the Capitol \u2014 resulted in the determination that conferring the honor would \"bring discredit on the Air Force.\" The letter was posted by Judicial Watch, a Washington, D.C.-based conservative legal group, that lobbied for the Pentagon to provide honors to Babbitt. In its request to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the organization cited President Trump's clemency for more than 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants.",
      "The request said the government's \"refusal to provide military funeral honors was part of the 'grave national injustice' that President Trump ended by granting clemency.

    "story": [
      "A Michigan judge dismissed criminal charges Tuesday against a group of people who were accused of attempting to falsely certify President Donald Trump as the winner of the 2020 election in the battleground state, a major blow to prosecutors as similar cases in four other states have been muddied with setbacks.",
      "District Court Judge Kristen D. Simmons said in a court hearing that the 15 Republicans accused will not face trial. The case has dragged through the courts since Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, announced the charges over two years ago.",
      "Each member of the group, which included a few high-profile members of the Republican Party in Michigan, faced eight charges of forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery. The top felony charges carried a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.",
      "Investigators said the group met at the Michigan GOP headquarters in December of 2020 and signed a document falsely stating they were the state's \"duly elected and qualified electors.\" President Joe Biden won Michigan by nearly 155,000 votes, a result confirmed by a GOP-led state Senate investigation in 2021.",
      "Electors are part of the 538-member Electoral College that officially elects the president of the United States. In 48 states, electors vote for the candidate who won the popular vote. In Nebraska and Maine, elector votes are awarded based on congressional district and statewide results.",

    "summary": "President Trump's administration asked the Supreme Court on Monday to allow it to freeze billions of dollars in foreign aid funding.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts on Tuesday temporarily halted a lower court order that blocked the Trump administration from freezing more than $4 billion in foreign-aid funding.",
      "The chief justice issued an administrative stay, which gives the Supreme Court more time to fully consider the government's request for emergency relief. The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court on Monday to allow the administration to freeze the funding for foreign aid projects.",
      "The request for the Supreme Court's intervention comes in a clash over the president's refusal to spend money allocated by Congress for foreign assistance programs.",
      "The Trump administration has asked the high court to partially halt the lower court order that required it to spend more than $4 billion in aid by the end of September. Mr. Trump is attempting to claw back that money, which has already been approved by Congress, through a rarely used maneuver known as a pocket rescission.",
      "The dispute also involves another $6.5 billion in foreign assistance, though the Justice Department has said it is taking steps to obligate those funds by Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.",
      "The legal fight quickly arrived at the Supreme Court after U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled last week that the executive branch had to spend the $4 billion in foreign aid funding that Congress had appropriated. The Justice Department asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to freeze that decision, though it declined to do so last Friday.",
      "In seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the district court's injunction \"raises a grave and urgent threat to the separation of powers.\" He is asking the Supreme Court to pause the district court's order only as to the $4 billion that Mr. Trump is attempting to rescind.",
      "\"The President can hardly speak with one voice in foreign affairs or in dealings with Congress when the district court is forcing the Executive Branch to advocate against its own objectives,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Since returning to the White House, the Trump administration has canceled billions of dollars in contracts and grants that it says do not align with the president's policy objectives. On the first day of his second term, the president signed an executive order that called for a 90-day pause in foreign aid and said administration officials would determine whether to continue or cease each foreign assistance program.",
      "Congressional Democrats estimate that more than $425 billion in federal funding has been canceled or frozen by the president.",
      "The latest dispute before the Supreme Court was brought by a group of nonprofits and businesses that receive money for foreign assistance projects. The plaintiffs argued that the 90-day freeze was an unconstitutional exercise of the president's authority.",
      "The case has already landed at the Supreme Court, though in an earlier stage in the proceedings. In early March, the high court split 5-4 in rejecting a bid from the president to keep $2 billion in foreign aid frozen while the case moved forward.",
      "The case has progressed since then. Last month, a three-judge panel on the D.C. Circuit said that the nonprofits and businesses could not sue. The 2-1 panel wiped away an order from Ali that had prohibited the government from impounding congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds.",
      "But the D.C. Circuit panel issued an amended opinion late last month that opened up an avenue for the nonprofits and businesses to seek relief on different legal grounds.",
      "On the heels of that decision, Mr. Trump sent a letter to Congress proposing to rescind a total of $4.9 billion, which includes funding for the State Department, international development programs and the the U.S. Agency for International Development, which the president has moved to shutter.",
      "The president's plan is an attempt to roll back funding unilaterally and has not been done in nearly 50 years. One Republican has called the effort \"unlawful\" and said the Constitution makes clear that Congress has the power of the purse.",
      "The plaintiffs in the case sought a new preliminary injunction. Last week, Ali found that the government has a statutory duty to spend the $4 billion that is subject to Mr. Trump's rescission proposal. He ordered the Trump administration to spend the expiring funds approved by Congress for foreign assistance, unless Congress claws it back in accordance with the procedures laid out in federal law.",
      "In seeking relief from the Supreme Court, Sauer, the solicitor general, said Ali's injunction \"puts the executive branch at war with itself\" by requiring it to spend the same $4 billion that the president wants to claw back.",

      "The U.S. Border Patrol official who led controversial immigration enforcement raids in southern California this summer has arrived in Chicago, a new target of the Trump administration's escalating crackdown on illegal immigration, two people familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "The official, Gregory Bovino, is in the Chicago area as federal officials vow to initiate a blitz of arrests in the region targeting immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally, according to the sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. Bovino was the top Border Patrol agent in California's El Centro sector until he was given command of a broader immigration enforcement campaign across the state in June.",
      "Over the past several months, Bovino has become one of the most visible public faces of the Trump administration's aggressive effort to detain those living in the country unlawfully. He has accompanied rank-and-file agents on arrest operations and posted slickly edited videos of those sweeps on social media.",
      "In California, Bovino oversaw an effort by Customs and Border Protection, dubbed Operation At Large. Under that operation, Border Patrol agents, whose jobs have historically been limited to preventing the illicit entry of migrants and drugs into the country, have arrested unauthorized immigrants in places far from a U.S. border, like Los Angeles and Sacramento.",
      "Bovino has personally led some of the operations, including arrests outside of Home Depot stores and a show-of-force at MacArthur Park in Los Angeles that involved mounted Border Patrol agents and armored vehicles.",
      "In July, a federal judge in Los Angeles ruled that some of the immigration stops in southern California had been predicated on factors like race, language, occupation and location, instead of a reasonable suspicion that the subjects of stops were in the U.S. illegally. The judge barred federal agents in the region from basing arrests on those factors. On Monday, the Supreme Court paused the lower court's order.",
      "Bovino appeared to preview his deployment to Chicago last week, saying in a video he shared on social media that his team would be \"taking this show on the road, to a city near you.\"",
      "\"We're gonna trade these palm trees for some skyscrapers, and the mission continues,\" he said to the tune of Willie Nelson's \"On the Road Again.\"",
      "A U.S. official said Bovino arrived last Friday in Chicago, where he's expected to lead operations by CBP. The Trump administration has tasked the agency, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, with being more heavily involved with interior immigration enforcement amid a historic drop in illegal crossings at the southern border in recent months.",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has traditionally overseen immigration enforcement in the U.S. interior, this week launched an operation in the Chicago area that officials say will target immigrants in the U.S. illegally who also have criminal records. Officials have called the effort Operation Midway Blitz.",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, criticized the operation's announcement on Monday, saying the Trump administration should be coordinating with state officials to curtail crime.",
      "\"Instead of taking steps to work with us on public safety, the Trump Administration's focused on scaring Illinoisians,\" he wrote on X.",
      "Asked to comment on Bovino's arrival in Chicago, a spokesperson for DHS replied, \"Stay tuned.\"",
      "Last week, CBS News reported federal agents had begun staging at a U.S. Navy station in the Chicago suburbs in anticipation of an increase in immigration operations there. An internal memo asked the Pentagon to accommodate up to 250 federal agents and 140 vehicles at the station for 30 days.",
      "Over the weekend, DHS announced another ICE arrest operation in the Boston area, dubbed Patriot 2.0, that officials say is focused on unauthorized immigrants with criminal records.",

    "summary": "Florida country radio station WHEL rebranded itself \"Trump Country\" 93.7 FM on the day President Trump was inaugurated for his second term.",
    "story": [
      "If you glance at advertisements, the billboards or the website too quickly, you might mistake any of them for a campaign banner. The colors and the lettering look familiar. And you'll certainly recognize the face beneath the cowboy hat.",
      "As soon as President Trump began his second term, a small Fort Myers, Florida, country radio station began capitalizing on his return. WHEL radio rebranded itself \"Trump Country\" 93.7 FM on Inauguration Day. It appears to have briefly\u00a0tried out the name in late 2020 before dropping the moniker after a couple of months.",
      "The font in the radio station's logo appears to use the typeface as the Trump-Vance campaign used for its signage. The largest image in the logo is an animated image of the president himself, with his trademark red tie and flag lapel pin, and an uncharacteristic cowboy hat.",
      "Despite public opinion polls showing Mr. Trump with approval ratings under 50% (though among Republicans, he's over 90%), the general manager of WHEL says \"Trump Country\" has tripled its ratings among adults 25-54 since March, according to a ratings report shared by the station's executives. July Nielsen ratings released in August showed WHEL was the second highest-rated country station in the area.",
      "\"Trump Country\" has high visibility in a part of Florida that can comfortably be described as Trump country, as a result of extensive promotion, including a number of billboards. Mr. Trump won 64% of the vote in 2024 in Lee County, where the radio station is based.",
      "\"We didn't ask for permission,\" said Jim Schwartzel, the radio outlet's president and general manager. \"But I don't think that the president or anybody else would really be upset by it. We looked at it as comedy.\"",
      "The Trump campaign for years tried to weed out fake merchandise and theft of Mr. Trump's name, image and likeness, but found it was expensive and difficult to stop completely.",
      "Schwartzel, a longtime media executive in Florida, is seeking the Republican nomination for a U.S. House seat held by Rep. Byron Donalds, who is running for governor.",
      "Schwartzel told CBS News he believes his radio station's slogan, moniker and promotion are unique in American broadcasting and show the power of Trump's brand in commercial media. The station's slogan is \"Make Country Great Again.\"",
      "Trump references saturate the station's airwaves, too. In between a rotation of current country hits, including Luke Combs' \"Back in the Saddle,\" Sam Hunt's \"Body Like a Back Road\" and Luke Bryan's \"One Margarita,\" the station uses a voice actor to impersonate Mr. Trump's voice on some of its station promotions and imaging, which reference local roads, communities and shopping.",
      "In one recent promotion, the voice actor impersonating Mr. Trump announced the radio station's \"Deportation a day\" campaign, which offered cruises to Mexico for listeners. The on-air promotions used the Trump voice actor and a voice actor with a young Hispanic male voice to pitch the trips and compare them mockingly to deportations. The Trump voice refers to trips across the \"Gulf of America,\" while the Hispanic male voice counters that it's the \"Gulf of Mexico.\"",
      "Schwartzel's campaign site touts his \"conservative values\" and says he is running for Congress \"to give President Donald J. Trump the support he needs.\"",
      "Schwartzel told CBS News, \"We don't talk about the politics of deportations, but we twisted it to be entertaining.\" He said he decided to name his radio station after Mr. Trump months before launching a campaign for Congress. He said he does not appear or broadcast on the station because of his candidacy, so that he can avoid a requirement that he offer other candidates equal time under federal law.",
      "The use of Mr. Trump's name on the radio station carries some risk of alienating potential listeners and customers, some of whom already hear quite a bit of his voice on other stations and media platforms. Some of the station's on-air promotion features the Trump impersonator talking dismissively about things that are \"woke\" and touting being a \"builder.\"",
      "An increasingly saturated media and music environment is pushing radio stations to try bolder, controversial efforts to lure \u2014 or even salvage \u2014 listeners.",
      "Don Tanner, a radio industry expert and founding co-partner of Tanner-Friedman Strategic Communications in Michigan, said WHEL-FM radio's experiment is part of the radio industry's effort to remain relevant.",
      "\"You have to differentiate in radio,\" Tanner said. \"There are so many competitors out there for eyes and ears. Especially in music, where country music fans can go to Spotify or Apple to listen.\"",
      "Tanner, who authored the book \"No Static at All \u2014 A behind the scenes journey through radio and pop music,\" told CBS News that creative radio branding is a common technique to attract an audience: \"This type of format is attempting to do just that.\"",
      "Representatives for Mr. Trump declined to comment.",
      "Though Schwartzel said his radio station avoids political topics, the station has conducted promotional events at local Republican club events, he said. Schwartzel said the idea to attempt the Trump branding occurred to him while watching the Trump \"boat parades\" in Florida, where Trump banners, flags and signage were being displayed and celebrated.",

      "The department did not specify how long the operation is expected to last, but a spokesperson with ICE said, in a statement: \"ICE has always operated in Chicago, targeting enforcement around the dangerous criminal aliens that are drawn to this sanctuary city. ... We will continue our law enforcement and public safety mission, undeterred, as we surge ICE resources in the city in coordination with our federal partners from across Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice.\"",
      "The department said the mission would be carried out \"in honor of Katie Abraham,\" who was\u00a0killed in a drunk driving hit-and-run crash\u00a0that happened in Urbana, about 130 miles south of Chicago, earlier this year. Her friend, 20-year-old Chloe Polzin, also died in the crash. The driver was 29-year-old Julio Cucul Bol, a citizen of Guatemala who authorities caught in Texas days after the crash, and believed to have been trying to flee to Mexico. He is now in custody in Illinois.",
      "The victim's father, Joe Abraham, spoke with CBS News Chicago, saying he hopes no other family has to go through what his family has.",
      "\"Hopefully, no other children will have to go through this Russian roulette that the state is playing,\" he said. \"(Cucul Bol) didn't have a drivers license, he shouldn't have been on the roads, he had been pulled over before. ...\u00a0 Say what you want about Donald Trump. He at least acknowledged me, looked me in the eye, said, 'We're going to clean things up.'\"",
      "In a post on X, Gov. JB Pritzker accused the Trump administration of failing to communicate or coordinate their immigration enforcement effort with state and local leaders.",
      "\"Once again, this isn't about fighting crime. That requires support and coordination \u2014 yet we've experienced nothing like that over the past several weeks.  Instead of taking steps to work with us on public safety, the Trump administration's focused on scaring Illinoisians,\" he wrote.",
      "Johnson said he and other city officials \"remain opposed to any potential militarized immigration enforcement without due process because of ICE's track record of detaining and deporting American citizens and violating the human rights of hundreds of detainees.\"",
      "\"There are more than 500 documented incidents of human rights abuses at detention facilities since Trump took office, including deaths of detainees and alleged cases of sexual abuse of minors by federal immigration agents,\" Johnson added. \"Because of these incidents and more, we remain opposed to militarized immigration enforcement that runs afoul of the Constitution in our city.\"",
      "The mayor urged anyone concerned about the immigration crackdown in Chicago to visit a \"know your rights\" resource hub on the city's website, at Chicago.gov/KYR.",
      "The announcement of the immigration operation in Chicago comes after President Trump, in a post on Truth Social on Saturday, invoked imagery from the movie \"Apocalypse Now\" and wrote, \"'I love the smell of deportations in the morning ...' Chicago about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR.\"",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, accused the Trump administration of ramping up its campaign \"to arrest hardworking immigrants with no criminal convictions.\"",
      "\"These actions don't make us safer. They are a waste of money, stoke fear, and represent another failed attempt at a distraction,\" Durbin said in a statement.",
      "A new CBS News poll shows that 58% of Americans oppose the president sending the National Guard to other cities beyond Washington, D.C., while 42% support it.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A former top National Institutes of Health leader who says she was removed from her position after a dispute with Trump administration officials detailed the internal clashes at the elite medical research agency Monday, and warned of an agenda that poses \"a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety.\"",
      "Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo described in an exclusive interview with CBS News being silenced when she and her colleagues tried to oppose efforts pushed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to cancel vaccine research and clinical trials.",
      "\"Ultimately, we were disregarded,\" said Marrazzo, who previously led the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID. \"We became inconvenient.\"",
      "Marrazzo, who filed a whistleblower complaint with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel last week alleging illegal retaliation, was placed on leave and reassigned in April. She had been in the role since August 2023, succeeding Dr. Anthony Fauci, who had served as NIAID director for nearly four decades, as well as chief medical adviser to former President Joe Biden.",
      "\"It was not unexpected,\" Marrazzo said of her removal. \"It was still a body blow.\"",
      "New NIH chief echoed RFK Jr.'s views, former official alleges",
      "Marrazzo said in her complaint that she \"raised concerns\" to agency leadership when Department of Health and Human Services and NIH leaders \"pursued actions that not only directly undermined NIH's goal of furthering medical research, but also constituted a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety,\" while wasting funds by canceling research projects before findings could be implemented.",
      "Many allegations in the complaint focus on Dr. Matthew Memoli, who served as acting NIH director earlier this year before moving to the health agency's No. 2 post.",
      "Marrazzo claims Memoli made statements downplaying the importance of vaccines that closely mirrored the views of Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic. In a series of meetings, Memoli allegedly argued that \"vaccines are unnecessary if populations are healthy,\" and that the NIH \"should not focus on vaccines,\" Marrazzo alleged in her complaint.",
      "Asked by CBS News about interactions with people in positions similar to Memoli's and those above him, Marrazzo said, \"It was one of the hardest periods of my career,\" and she and her colleagues who were involved \"felt like we were sort of a voice in the wilderness.\"",
      "Marrazzo described a dispute about the importance of giving children the flu vaccine. She said she outlined her advocacy on two occasions for a universal flu vaccine that covered seasonal and avian flu, emphasizing the importance of continued investment in flu vaccine research.",
      "\"Both times that I presented this, Dr. Memoli made the point that, yes, it would be great. It would be nice to have a flu vaccine,\" Marrazzo said. \"But what was most important was to have children who were healthy and had a healthy immune system.\"",
      "Marrazzo said \"it was a little bit like hearing the echo of, again, what Secretary Kennedy had been promulgating in terms of healthy kids.\"",
      "\"It was extremely alarming,\" she added.",
      "An HHS spokesperson said in a statement that \"NIH Deputy Director Dr. Matt Memoli emphasizes that vaccines are not interchangeable; each must be assessed on its own merits.\"",
      "\"He remains fully aligned with this administration's vaccine priorities and consistently champions gold-standard, evidence-based science,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Over time, Marrazzo said things \"became increasingly uncomfortable\" because \"we were persistent.\"",
      "\"We didn't back down,\" she said.",
      "At the same time, Marrazzo said \"we started seeing people at meetings who were placed there from either the White House or from HHS.\" She said \"none of us really knew where these people came from.\"",
      "Marrazzo said one person confronted her about the agency she ran, which famously helped lead the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and \"indicated to me that [it] was a target.\" The official accused her team of doing unethical research.",
      "Asked whether she thinks she's being held responsible for actions taken by her predecessor, Fauci \u2014 who has faced years of criticism from Trump allies \u2014 and for research conducted by the agency before the pandemic, Marrazzo told CBS News, \"I think it's entirely possible.\"",
      "Marrazzo described discussing the administration's priorities in meetings to CBS News, noting that it was a \"very different\" dynamic than when she began the role midway through the Biden administration. She said she had been hopeful that \"intelligence would prevail\" in a second Trump administration, noting that the president had \"championed the work that led to the COVID vaccines,\" among other things, during his first term.",
      "Marrazzo objected to the leadership's \"censorship of scientific research and their subordination of scientific integrity to unscientific and unsupported policy preferences,\" her complaint says, noting that she specifically objected to the administration's \"hostility towards vaccines and its abrupt cancellation of grants and clinical trials for political reasons.\"",
      "Senior federal health officials removed Marrazzo from her position on March 31, the complaint alleges, in \"a blatant act of retaliation,\" noting that she was placed on involuntary administrative leave and told she would be transferred to the Indian Health Service, an agency within HHS. In the complaint, Marrazzo wrote that she would like to be reinstated to her position if the Office of Special Counsel finds that a prohibited personnel practice took place.",
      "Former NIH official calls RFK Jr. \"dangerous\"",
      "In recent weeks, Health Secretary Kennedy has faced scrutiny over the Trump administration's policies on vaccines and the recent ouster of top officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, another agency under the department's umbrella. The Trump administration is attempting to oust CDC Director Susan Monarez, after she was confirmed by the Senate in late July, although her lawyers have pushed back on the legality of her firing.",
      "Last week, Kennedy testified before the Senate Finance Committee. Kennedy refuted the claim that he told Monarez she had to resign if she refused to sign off on changes to the childhood vaccine schedule, saying he told her to resign after he asked, \"'are you a trustworthy person?' and she said no.\" At the hearing, several Democrats said Kennedy should resign or be fired, while a handful of Republicans also expressed concern about Kennedy's moves at the department.",
      "Marrazzo told CBS News that Kennedy is not qualified for his job and described him as \"dangerous.\"",
      "\"He's dangerous because he ignores the evidence,\" she said. \"He appears to be driven by, a desire to satisfy a need to tear things down, and to discredit people who have dedicated their lives to evidence and to interpreting that evidence to further Americans' health.\"",
      "Marrazzo encouraged people to find a source they trust when it comes to questions about their health, whether that's their doctor or a nurse practitioner. Asked about Kennedy as a source, Marrazzo said, \"I think the consensus is that he's not trustworthy.\"",
      "Debra Katz, who represents Marrazzo and Dr. Kathleen Neuzil \u2014 the former director of the Fogarty International Center and NIH associate director for international research, who also filed a whistleblower complaint \u2014 said in a statement that the Trump administration \"installed politically motivated leaders,\" pointing to Kennedy, who \"immediately acted to stifle scientific inquiry, halt crucial research and retaliate against those, like Drs.

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for President Trump's administration to resume sweeping immigration enforcement stops in the Los Angeles area for now as part of the president's campaign to carry out mass deportations of people in the U.S. unlawfully.",
      "The high court agreed to freeze a district court's temporary restraining order that prevented federal immigration authorities from stopping people in Southern California without reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. unlawfully. That order barred officials from relying solely on certain factors like a person's race or occupation as the basis for a detentive stop.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit largely rejected the Trump administration's request to pause the district court's order. The Justice Department then\u00a0sought emergency relief\u00a0from the Supreme Court.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the injunction issued by the district court hampered the ability of immigration authorities to enforce the nation's immigration laws in Los Angeles and put them at risk of violating its order during routine investigative stops.",
      "Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.",
      "\"That decision is yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket,\" Sotomayor, joined by Kagan and Jackson, wrote of the majority's move. \"We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job. Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent.\"",
      "In response to the Supreme Court's order, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said \"we look forward to full vindication on this front in short order, but in the meantime, the Trump Administration will continue fulfilling its mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security praised the court's move, calling it a \"win for the safety of Californians and the rule of law.\"",
      "\"DHS law enforcement will not be slowed down and will continue to arrest and remove the murderers, rapists, gang members and other criminal illegal aliens that Karen Bass continues to give safe harbor,\" DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, referring to the mayor of Los Angeles.",
      "In a statement of her own, Bass said the ruling \"will lead to more working families being torn apart and fear of the very institutions meant to protect \u2014 not persecute \u2014 our people.\"",
      "\"I want the entire nation to hear me when I say this isn't just an attack on the people of Los Angeles, this is an attack on every person in every city in this country,\" the mayor said. \"Today's ruling is not only dangerous \u2014 it's un-American and threatens the fabric of personal freedom in the United States of America.\"",
      "The legal challenge",
      "The greater Los Angeles area, located within the Central District of California, is home to nearly 20 million people. The Trump administration estimates that 2 million of its residents are in the country illegally and has said that the region is a \"top enforcement priority.\"",
      "In June, federal immigration agencies began undertaking efforts to ramp up immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, which\u00a0Mr. Trump called\u00a0the \"largest mass deportation operation \u2026 in history.\" After protests broke out in response to enforcement operations at workplaces in the region, the Trump administration\u00a0deployed members of the California National Guard\u00a0and\u00a0active-duty Marines\u00a0to Los Angeles in June to protect federal property and immigration agents.",
      "The dispute before the Supreme Court arose after three men who are in the U.S. illegally were arrested and filed a lawsuit seeking release from detention. The men, who live in Pasadena, were working as day laborers and were arrested in mid-June as part of a targeted enforcement action at a donut shop, according to court papers. They have since been released on bond.",
      "The migrants, later joined by two U.S. citizens and four organizations, challenged the Trump administration's immigration raids, alleging that officers violated their Fourth Amendment rights when conducting patrols and other enforcement operations. One of the plaintiffs, Brian Gavidia, was confronted by armed agents while working at a tow yard and repeatedly told officers he was a U.S. citizen as they tried to detain him.",
      "The plaintiffs claimed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were targeting certain businesses and conducting \"indiscriminate immigration operations.\"",
      "Last month, a federal district court agreed to issue a temporary restraining order that blocked federal agents from conducting immigration enforcement stops without reasonable suspicion that the person they are stopping is in the U.S. illegally. The order from U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong specified that agents could not rely solely on four factors as grounds for detaining people: apparent race or ethnicity; speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent; being at a specific location like a bus stop, agricultural site or day laborer pick-up site; and the type of work a person does.",
      "In her decision, Frimpong, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, wrote there was a \"mountain of evidence\" that \"roving patrols\" were indiscriminately stopping and detaining people without reasonable suspicion in violation of the Fourth Amendment.",
      "But in the request for emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Sauer, the solicitor general, called Frimpong's injunction a \"straitjacket on law-enforcement efforts.\"",
      "\"The injunction wrongly brands countless lawful stops as unconstitutional, thereby hampering a basic law-enforcement tool, while turning every single stop in the District into a potential contempt trap,\" he wrote in a filing. \"No agent can confidently enforce the law and engage in routine stops when the district court may later refuse to credit that the stop reflected additional, permissible factors and instead treat virtually any stop as contemptuous misconduct.\"",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs said that the Trump administration's pattern of conducting immigration enforcement stops without reasonable suspicion has done \"immeasurable\" harm.",
      "\"Numerous U.S. citizens and others who are lawfully present in this country have been subjected to significant intrusions on their liberty. Many have been physically injured; at least two were taken to a holding facility. And all have had to endure the prospect of unavoidable future intrusions based on broad demographic factors like the color of their skin,\" they told the Supreme Court in a filing.",
      "The lawyers warned that, if allowed, the Trump administration's practices could ensnare millions of people in Southern California who are U.S. citizens or legally in the country in an \"immigration dragnet.\"",
      "\"The government's extraordinary claim that it can get very close to justifying a seizure of any Latino person in the Central District because of the asserted number of Latino people there who are not legally present is anathema to the Constitution,\" they said.",

    "story": [
      "Jury selection began Monday in the criminal trial of Ryan Routh, the man charged with trying to assassinate President Trump last year in South Florida.",
      "Routh, 59, has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations. He is set to represent himself in the trial, after a federal judge signed off on his request earlier this year. Routh has also pleaded not guilty to state charges of terrorism and attempted murder.",
      "Opening statements are expected on Thursday.",
      "The trial is being overseen by Judge Aileen Cannon. During Monday's jury selection, Cannon spent several minutes related to a question submitted to potential jurors by Routh, which he ultimately ended up not asking. Showing how Routh may approach his own defense, the approximated question was, \"If you were driving down the street and saw a turtle trying to cross the road, would you stop to help it or continue driving?\" which Routh said would reflect any juror's \"mindset.\"",
      "Sixty potential jurors were told to report on Monday, and they were given questionnaires to go through. Prosecutors challenged 20 of them, who were then dismissed, leaving 40 potential jurors who will return on Tuesday. Routh will be given the opportunity to present his seven challenges on Tuesday.",
      "There were no jurors selected on Monday. Sixty more potential jurors will be called on Tuesday.",
      "There are 50 witnesses listed for potential use for the trial, the vast majority of which are from the prosecution. The potential witnesses are primarily FBI, Secret Service, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office and crime technician types, with a much smaller number of character witnesses for Routh.",
      "Prosecutors say Routh methodically plotted to kill Mr. Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Mr. Trump played golf on Sept. 15, 2024, at his West Palm Beach country club. A Secret Service agent spotted Routh before Mr. Trump came into view. Officials said Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot.",
      "Prosecutors also alleged in court filings that Routh attempted to acquire an anti-aircraft weapon to shoot down Mr. Trump's plane.",
      "The government said that in August 2024, \"Routh sought to purchase the devices online from an associate Routh believed to be a Ukrainian with access to military weapons.\"",
      "Routh allegedly told an associate to \"'send me an rpg [rocket-propelled grenade] or stinger and I will see what we can do,'\" according to the court document.",
      "\"I need equipment so that Trump cannot get elected,\" Routh told his associate.",
      "The government said Routh also sought to purchase a .50 caliber rifle the same month, and this rifle would have been an even more destructive and powerful version of the one he had already allegedly obtained. Prosecutors said Routh hoped to purchase the .50 caliber rifle at a gun show, but his contact was ultimately not able to locate the type of gun Routh wanted until after the assassination attempt at the golf course.",
      "Routh was armed with an AK-47-style rifle and was allegedly 300-500 yards away from Mr. Trump when the Secret Service agent spotted his rifle in the tree line, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw.",
      "Two people have been charged with selling the gun to Routh, though both defendants told law enforcement they did not have any advance knowledge of Routh's alleged plans.",
      "Two defendants \u2014 Tina Brown Cooper and Ronnie Jay Oxendine \u2014 have pleaded guilty to gun-related charges in federal court, after being indicted in March and arrested in April. Cooper pleaded guilty to firearm trafficking on Monday, and Oxendine pleaded guilty last month to possessing an unregistered firearm after police found a short-barreled shotgun in his storage building.",
      "In court papers filed in both cases as part of the plea agreements, the Justice Department said the two sold Routh a Chinese-made SKS rifle in August, with Cooper allegedly acting as a middleman in a sale between Routh and Oxendine. Law enforcement said Cooper worked for Oxendine at the time of the sale at a roofing company in Greensboro, North Carolina.",
      "Federal prosecutors alleged Cooper, Routh and Oxendine met at the roofing company's headquarters, where Routh paid Oxendine $350 cash for the SKS rifle and $100 to Cooper for helping to arrange the sale.",
      "About six weeks later, Routh was allegedly found with an SKS-style rifle outside Mr. Trump's golf club in West Palm Beach. In a filing in Routh's criminal case, prosecutors said the gun he brought to Trump International Golf Club was the same one allegedly sold to him by Oxendine and Cooper.",
      "Records show Routh's issues with the law go back to the 1990s and include lesser charges of writing bad checks. But in 2002 he was charged with possession of a weapon of mass destruction, a felony, according to North Carolina Department of Corrections records. In another incident, he was charged with misdemeanors, including a hit-and-run offense, resisting arrest, and a concealed weapons violation, the records show.",
      "But his son, Oren Routh, told CBS News his father wasn't violent, and he said he was \"definitely surprised\" by the latest allegations.",
      "\"He's a good person and has been a hard worker his whole life. He's a great man and good dad, non-violent, and was never abusive. I was definitely surprised this happened. He taught us to work hard and be good people. I haven't known him to own guns or ever hurt anyone in any way, always tried to help his community in any and every way possible,\" Oren Routh said.",
      "Routh voted Democratic in the 2024 primary election in North Carolina, and he voted in person, according to the North Carolina State Board of Elections. He appears to be registered as an unaffiliated voter.",
      "His account on X, formerly known as Twitter, has now been suspended, and it included a number of posts about Mr. Trump.",
      "Since being granted the ability to defend himself in court, Routh's filings have been filled with rants about Mr. Trump and international affairs. In a motion to attempt to dismiss evidence that the Justice Department says it will present during his trial, Routh said he would trade the evidence being submitted into the record in exchange for a subpoena of Mr. Trump, calling him a \"dumbass\" and even suggesting \"a round of golf with the racist pig,\" and if Trump wins, Trump \"can execute me.\"",

The Supreme Court has allowed Mr. Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission\u00a0while legal challenges to the removals move forward.",
      "Mr. Trump appointed Slaughter to the FTC in 2018, and former President Joe Biden reappointed her to the role. Her term was set to expire in 2029.",
      "But in March, Slaughter received an email from the White House Office of Presidential Personnel, which contained a message from Mr. Trump informing her that she had been removed from the FTC. Slaughter sued the president and officials at the commission, arguing that her removal violated the Federal Trade Commission Act. That law limits the grounds that a president can remove a commissioner to inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "In July, a federal district court in Washington, D.C., ruled in Slaughter's favor and found that Mr. Trump's removal was \"unlawful\" and \"without legal effect.\" The Trump administration appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which declined last week to freeze the district court's order while it considers the case.",
      "The Trump administration then sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "The dispute over Slaughter's firing involves the same agency and removal protections that were at issue in a 1935 case known as Humphrey's Executor v. United States. In that landmark decision, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the restrictions and ruled that Congress could enact for-cause removal protections for multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "But the high court has chipped away at that precedent in recent years and reasserted the president's power to remove executive officers without cause. In a recent cases involving Mr. Trump's removals of members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Supreme Court indicated it believes the entities exercise considerable executive power.",
      "In its request for emergency relief from the Supreme Court, lawyers for the Trump administration argued that the modern FTC exercises \"vast executive authority,\" a change from the 1935-era commission.",

According to the First Liberty Institute, which represent Allen, Allen was praying for an injured peer in Honey Grove Middle School's cafeteria in Honey Grove, Texas in 2018.

      "Keepers at the Exotic Zoo in Telford, in central England, say the female casque-headed iguana was able to give birth to eight healthy hatchlings in the last week of August because of a natural reproductive phenomenon called parthenogenesis, which allows unfertilized eggs to grow into embryos that become genetic clones of the mother.",

      "\"Webb's infrared instruments are giving us more detail than we've ever had access to before, and the initial four observations we've been able to make of planet e are showing us what we will have to work with when the rest of the information comes in,\" said N\u00e9stor Espinoza of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, a principal investigator on the research team. Espinoza and the research team recently published two\u00a0scientific\u00a0papers\u00a0outlining their initial results.",
      "Researchers \"feel confident\" that TRAPPIST-1 e does not have a primary atmosphere. A primary atmosphere would be made of hydrogen and helium that would have been present when the planet was formed. But the star the planet orbits is \"very active,\" with \"frequent flares,\" NASA said, which create stellar radiation that may have \"stripped off\" that primary atmosphere. However, TRAPPIST-1 e may have built up a \"heavier secondary atmosphere.\" Many planets, including Earth, have done this, NASA said. Further research with the Webb telescope and its instruments will determine the types of atmosphere and its makeup.",
      "There are also many possibilities for water on the planet. There may be none at all, NASA said. TRAPPIST-1 e might also contain an ocean or wide swath of water. One side of the planet is always in darkness, so there may also be ice, NASA said. If there is liquid water on the planet, the NASA researchers say there would also be a greenhouse effect, where gases like carbon dioxide keep the atmosphere stable and warm the planet.",
      "\"We are really still in the early stages of learning what kind of amazing science we can do with Webb. It's incredible to measure the details of starlight around Earth-sized planets 40 light-years away and learn what it might be like there, if life could be possible there,\" said Ana Glidden, a post-doctoral researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, who led the research on possible atmospheres for planet e, in NASA's news release. \"We're in a new age of exploration that's very exciting to be a part of,\" she said.",

      "The image of comet 3I/ATLAS was captured on Aug. 27 using one of the telescopes at the International Gemini Observatory in Chile during a public outreach event allowing students to work with astronomers.",
      "The comet is only the third-known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. It poses no threat to Earth, NASA previously said.",
      "Comet 3I/ATLAS has been photographed multiple times since its discovery in July. In early August, NASA and the European Space Agency released photos taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. It was about 277 million miles away from Earth when the telescope captured it.",
      "The new image from the Gemini Observatory shows the comet's broad coma, or a cloud of dust and gas that forms around its nucleus as it gets closer to the sun, astronomers said in a news release. The tail spans about 1/200th of a degree in the sky. One degree is about the width of a pinky finger, according to the news release. The tail also points away from the sun.",
      "The features are \"significantly more extended than they appeared in earlier images,\" according to astronomers. This means that the comet has become \"more active\" as it travels through the inner solar system.",
      "The main purpose of the observatory session, which allowed students and members of the public to remotely join astronomers in the control room, was to look at the wavelengths of light that emit from the comet. The wavelengths, also called a spectrum, can give scientists information about the comet's composition and chemistry, helping them understand how the comet changes while passing through the solar system, the news release said.",
      "NASA previously said the comet is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October and pass between the orbits of Mars and Earth. The comet is expected to remain visible through September, then get too close to the sun to observe until it reappears on the other side of the solar body in early December.",
      "Interstellar comets are very rare, astronomers said. Only two other examples have ever been confirmed:\u00a01I/'Oumuamu\u00a0in 2017 and\u00a02I/Borisov\u00a0in 2019.",
      "\"As 3I/ATLAS speeds back into the depths of interstellar space, this image is both a scientific milestone and a source of wonder,\" said Karen Meech, astronomer at the University of Hawai'i Institute for Astronomy and leader of the observation program, in a statement. \"It reminds us that our Solar System is just one part of a vast and dynamic galaxy \u2014 and that even the most fleeting visitors can leave a lasting impact.\"",

      "Anthropic, which operates the Claude artificial intelligence app, has agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit by book authors who alleged the company took pirated copies of their works to train its chatbot.",
      "The company has agreed to pay authors about $3,000 for each of an estimated 500,000 books covered by the settlement. A trio of authors \u2014 thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 sued last year, and now represent a broader group of writers and publishers whose books Anthropic downloaded to train its chatbot Claude.",
      "The landmark settlement could mark a turning point in legal battles between AI companies and the writers, visual artists and other creative professionals who accuse them of copyright infringement. A judge could approve the settlement as soon as Monday.",
      "\"As best as we can tell, it's the largest copyright recovery ever,\" said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors. \"It is the first of its kind in the AI era.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Anthropic Aparna Sridhar deputy general counsel said the settlement \"will resolve the plaintiffs' remaining legacy claims.\"",
      "Sridhar added that the settlement comes after the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in June ruled\u00a0that Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train Claude did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "\"We remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery and solve complex problems,\" Sridhar said.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced\u00a0Claude in 2023.

      "Alsup's June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it \"knew had been pirated.\" It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.",
      "Debut thriller novel \"The Lost Night\" by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the Books3 dataset.",
      "Anthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.",
      "The Authors Guild told its thousands of members last month that it expected \"damages will be minimally $750 per work and could be much higher\" if Anthropic was found at trial to have willfully infringed their copyrights. The settlement's higher award \u2014 approximately $3,000 per work \u2014 likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.",
      "On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement \"an excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors' works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.\"",

    "story": [
      "A federal Judge on Tuesday ruled that\u00a0Lisa Cook can remain in her role on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors while her lawsuit challenging President Trump's attempt to fire her from her post plays out.",
      "\"President Trump has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cook's removal,\" U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, wrote in her ruling, which is likely to be appealed.",
      "Mr. Trump said he is firing Cook over allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago, resulting in more favorable loan terms.",
      "\"President Trump's stated cause refers only to allegations regarding Cook's conduct before she began serving on the Federal Reserve Board,\" Cobb wrote. \"As discussed above, such allegations are not a legally permissible cause.\"",
      "In addition to casting doubt on whether Mr. Trump established cause for Cook's firing, in issuing the stay, Cobb also ruled that Cook's right to due process was violated and that she would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction was not granted.",
      "Abbe David Lowell, an attorney representing Cook in her lawsuit, said in a statement to CBS News on Tuesday night, \"This ruling recognizes and reaffirms the importance of safeguarding the independence of the Federal Reserve from illegal political interference. Allowing the President to unlawfully remove Governor Cook on unsubstantiated and vague allegations would endanger the stability of our financial system and undermine the rule of law. Governor Cook will continue to carry out her sworn duties as a Senate-confirmed Board Governor.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "Under federal law, Fed board members\u00a0serve for 14-year terms\u00a0and can only be fired by the president \"for cause.\" Cook has served on the Fed since being appointed to complete another member's unexpired term in 2022, and her current term would run until 2038.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook on Aug. 26, writing in a letter\u00a0terminating her\u00a0from the Fed Board of Governors that he had \"sufficient cause\" to remove her from the position. The president cited a previous letter from Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that was sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging Cook made false statements on mortgage agreements.",
      "Pulte, an appointee of Mr. Trump's, alleged that Cook in 2021 claimed two different properties in Michigan and Georgia as her primary residence on mortgage documents to get better lending terms. Cook has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense.",
      "Cook's lawyers have previously said in court filings that Mr. Trump's \"unsubstantiated allegation that Governor Cook 'may have' or 'seems' to have erred in filling out a mortgage form in her capacity as a private citizen-does not amount to 'cause' for removal within the meaning of the FRA [Federal Reserve Act].\"",
      "\"None of the alleged misconduct occurred during the performance of Governor Cook's duties as a Federal Board member,\" they wrote. \"And the President and Director Pulte have not even alleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was intentional.\"",
      "In court arguments Friday, Lowell said Cook was not given notice of the allegations or a chance to respond to them, violating, he argued, her due process rights.",
      "Cook's lawsuit argues that Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her is \"unprecedented and illegal,\" noting it would be the first removal of a governor by the president in the Fed's 112-year history.",
      "\"The President's effort to terminate a Senate-confirmed Federal Reserve Board member is a broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System,\" Cook's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that Mr. Trump's theory of \"cause\" would allow him to remove any Fed Board member with whom he disagrees on policy, eroding the central bank's independence and threatening its mission of providing economic stability.",
      "Cobb appeared to agree with their argument, writing in her ruling on Tuesday, \"Taken to its logical conclusion, the Government's argument leads to an absurd result: While admitting that the President cannot remove an official for policy disagreements, the Government claims that under Reagan, a removal on the grounds of a policy disagreement would nevertheless be unreviewable. ... This cannot be the case. Such a rule would provide no practical insulation for the members of the Board of Governors. It would mean that the President could, in practice, 'remove a member ... merely because he wanted his own appointees.'\"",
      "Cobb also wrote that Mr. Trump \"does not address her [Cook's] in-office conduct at all, let alone provide any examples of how Cook's performance or personal conduct since assuming the role has been in any way deficient in carrying out her statutory duties,\" adding that Mr. Trump's termination letter \"does not identify any conduct that Cook has engaged in while serving as a member of the Board that indicates that Cook lacks the competence or trustworthiness for the role.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook came amid his repeated\u00a0attacks on the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, over the central bank's handling of interest rates.",
      "Cook, Powell and 10 other Fed officials sit on a committee that controls the nation's monetary policy and sets target interest rates, with a dual mandate of keeping inflation low and employment levels high. This work is typically done independently, with little to no input from political leaders.",
      "While the Fed did cut interest rates last year, after they had reached their highest point in decades in 2022 and 2023 in a bid to fight off inflation, the central bank has recently kept rates at relatively high levels. Powell has cited concerns that lowering rates could again lead to a swift rise in inflation and that Mr. Trump's tariffs could also lead to an increase in consumer prices.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday said it will decide whether President Trump can impose his most sweeping tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday said it will decide whether President Trump can impose his most sweeping tariffs, setting up a major test of one of the pillars of the president's economic agenda.",
      "The high court agreed to review lower court decisions\u00a0that found Mr. Trump did not have the authority to issue many of his global tariffs under an emergency powers law. The Justice Department appealed one of those rulings, from a federal appeals court, to the Supreme Court last week and asked it to move swiftly.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that upholding the ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit would put the United States at a disadvantage and expose the nation to retaliatory trade policies.",
      "The case is the first in which the Supreme Court will directly decide the legality of one of Mr. Trump's second-term policies. The high court has been asked roughly two dozen times to intervene in challenges to many of the president's initiatives, but on an interim emergency basis.",
      "The justices said arguments in the tariffs case would take place in the first week of November.",
      "The tariffs case",
      "One of the disputes before the Supreme Court was brought by a group of small businesses and 12 states. They argued that he did not have the authority to impose many of the global tariffs under the emergency powers law that he invoked, called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.",
      "A federal trade court ruled in May that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he issued the tariffs under IEEPA, and the Federal Circuit upheld that decision late last month. In its 7-4 decision, the appeals court agreed that the tariffs are illegal.",
      "\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the appeals court wrote. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"",
      "The appeals court did not decide whether IEEPA authorizes any tariffs at all. Instead, it only resolved whether sweeping duties that Mr. Trump imposed through a series of executive orders earlier this year are allowed under the law.",
      "The second case involves a pair of Illinois-based companies that sell educational toys and products. A federal district judge in Washington, D.C., ruled in May that IEEPA \"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in his executive orders. The decision from U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras was more narrow, barring the Trump administration only from collecting any tariff from the two companies. Contreras paused his decision while the Justice Department appealed to the D.C. Circuit.",
      "The two companies asked the Supreme Court in June to fast track the case and leap frog the appeals court in Washington, D.C.",
      "A spokesperson for one of the companies, Learning Resources, said in a statement it was \"gratified\" that the Supreme Court would hear the case.",
      "\"There is a lot riding on this historic case,\" the spokesperson said. \"The unlawful IEEPA tariffs have wreaked havoc in our economy for too long now.\"",
      "The duties at issue include those announced by Mr. Trump in early April \u2014 which he refers to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 that set a 10% baseline rate for nearly every country, and higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners. It also involves a set of levies on imports from Canada, Mexico and China in response to what Mr. Trump said is their failure to address the trafficking of fentanyl across U.S. borders.",
      "The president has used the tariffs, and the threat of additional duties, to try to force trading partners to negotiate trade deals with his administration. So far, \u00a0he has announced frameworks of trade agreements with the European Union and six countries: the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.",
      "Mr. Trump is the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, though it has been used by his predecessors to hit foreign nations with economic sanctions. His administration has argued that a denial of tariff authority would put the U.S. on the brink of \"economic catastrophe\" and make the nation poorer.",
      "In urging the Supreme Court to move quickly, Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing that the Federal Circuit's \"erroneous decision has disrupted highly impactful, sensitive, ongoing diplomatic trade negotiations, and cast a pall of legal uncertainty over the President's efforts to protect our country by preventing an unprecedented economic and foreign-policy crisis.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued that IEEPA gives the president broad powers to regulate trade, including imposing tariffs, \"to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to U.S. national security, foreign policy or the economy.",
      "Mr. Trump has said that trade deficits and the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. constituted threats to the national security and economy of the U.S., and invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs to address them.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs have remained in effect, since the Federal Circuit put its decision on hold until Oct. 14 to give the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court.",
      "The plaintiffs \u2014 the five small businesses and 12 states \u2014 agreed that the Supreme Court needs to resolve the legality of Mr. Trump's tariffs, calling it an issue of \"great\" and \"undoubted importance.\" They argued that the tariffs are illegal and urged the high court to affirm the Federal Circuit's decision.",
      "\"The government's case rests entirely on the notion that the phrase 'regulate \u2026 importation' in IEEPA constitutes a boundless power to impose tariffs on the American people whenever the President wants, at whatever level he wants, for whatever countries and products he wants, and for as long as he wants, merely by declaring that longstanding U.S. trade deficits are a national 'emergency' and an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' \u2014 assertions the government claims are effectively unreviewable,\" lawyers for the small businesses wrote in a Supreme Court filing. \"There are no limits.\"",
      "The states, meanwhile, said that the Constitution gives Congress the power to collect taxes, and the Trump administration is claiming that the president has sweeping authority to impose tariffs \"on any country, at any rate, and for however long he likes.\"",
      "\"The President's chaotic implementation of that purported authority, which changed by the day and wreaked havoc on capital markets and the economy, illustrates both the breadth of powers that the President claims and the danger of unlimited authority in this domain,\" they warned in court papers.",
      "The legal challenge to Mr. Trump's tariffs is likely to be one of several involving the president's second-term policies that the Supreme Court takes up. Other cases involving his immigration policies and efforts to remove members of independent agencies have progressed through the lower courts, and the Trump administration is likely to seek Supreme Court review of decisions against it.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. labor market added 911,000 fewer jobs in the 12-month period that ended March 2025 than had earlier been reported, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Tuesday. The major downward revision signals that the labor market was slowing more last year than had earlier been reported.",
      "The so-called preliminary benchmark revision, produced annually by the BLS, was bigger than a decline of roughly 800,000 that economists had forecast prior to the release. The revision aims to better account for businesses that have opened or closed in the 12-month period it covers, as these changes are sometimes missed by the BLS' monthly jobs report.",
      "The downward revision comes as the labor market appears to be ailing, with Friday's\u00a0disappointing August jobs report\u00a0sending warning signals about the pace of hiring across the U.S. At the same time, the BLS is in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, with the president last month\u00a0questioning the validity\u00a0of the monthly jobs report after the data included a significant downward revision, prompting him to\u00a0fire the commissioner\u00a0of the BLS.",
      "Revisions are a normal part of the statistical process at the BLS, economists note. That's because the monthly jobs data is based on a survey of businesses, and some companies respond after the agency's initial jobs report has been issued. Because of that, the BLS updates its data to reflect the new information.",
      "The sharp downward annual revision signals that the job market was facing bigger headwinds in 2024 and early 2025 than earlier reported, and could add to the Federal Reserve's case for cutting its benchmark rate at its Sept. 17 meeting, economists said.",
      "\"Today's data suggests cooling in the labor market is more dramatic than previously thought,\" said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, in an email.",
      "She added, \"This strengthens the likelihood that the Fed will cut rates next week, as it's additional evidence that the labor market side of the dual mandate needs some attention.\"",
      "Less momentum in job gains",
      "With the new revisions, job growth in 2025 has averaged 44,000 per month, down from 75,000 prior to the revamped numbers, Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in an email. In 2024, payroll gains factoring in the revisions averaged 106,000, down from 168,000 previously.",
      "\"The revision shows the economy entered 2025 with less momentum than previously understood,\" he said. \"It's now a lock that the Fed will cut interest rates at their meeting next week and that further rate cuts will follow in the months ahead. The question is by how much.\"",
      "The probability of a 0.25 percentage point rate cut at the Fed's Sept. 17 meeting is now projected at 94%, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The annual revisions are based on fresh data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which tracks employment and wages reported by employers that cover more than 95% of U.S. jobs, or about 11 million workplaces.",
      "The QCEW tracks when businesses open or close, something that is difficult for the monthly jobs report to track. For instance, if a business doesn't respond to the monthly survey, the BLS doesn't immediately know if the company simply isn't responding or if it has shut down.",
      "The large revision is likely due to the QCEW's tracking of businesses that have either been newly created or recently closed, with some of those new companies likely having slower hiring than the BLS had earlier estimated, Pantheon Macroeconomics chief U.S. economist Samuel Tombs said in a research note.",
      "\"Probably about two-thirds of the downward benchmark revision looks set to be due to weaker job creation at new firms than the BLS initially inferred from its model,\" he said.",

It stated in a letter that the circumstances preceding her death \u2014 that she was \"fatally shot after having illegally entered\" the Capitol \u2014 resulted in the determination that conferring the honor would \"bring discredit on the Air Force.\" The letter was posted by Judicial Watch, a Washington, D.C.-based conservative legal group, that lobbied for the Pentagon to provide honors to Babbitt. In its request to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the organization cited President Trump's clemency for more than 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants.",
      "The request said the government's \"refusal to provide military funeral honors was part of the 'grave national injustice' that President Trump ended by granting clemency.

    "story": [
      "A Michigan judge dismissed criminal charges Tuesday against a group of people who were accused of attempting to falsely certify President Donald Trump as the winner of the 2020 election in the battleground state, a major blow to prosecutors as similar cases in four other states have been muddied with setbacks.",
      "District Court Judge Kristen D. Simmons said in a court hearing that the 15 Republicans accused will not face trial. The case has dragged through the courts since Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, announced the charges over two years ago.",
      "Each member of the group, which included a few high-profile members of the Republican Party in Michigan, faced eight charges of forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery. The top felony charges carried a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.",
      "Investigators said the group met at the Michigan GOP headquarters in December of 2020 and signed a document falsely stating they were the state's \"duly elected and qualified electors.\" President Joe Biden won Michigan by nearly 155,000 votes, a result confirmed by a GOP-led state Senate investigation in 2021.",
      "Electors are part of the 538-member Electoral College that officially elects the president of the United States. In 48 states, electors vote for the candidate who won the popular vote. In Nebraska and Maine, elector votes are awarded based on congressional district and statewide results.",

In Wisconsin last month, a judge declined to dismiss felony charges against three Trump allies connected to a plan to falsely cast electoral ballots for Trump even though Biden won the state in 2020.",
      "The Georgia prosecution is essentially on hold while Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis in Atlanta, who brought the charges against President Trump and others appeals her removal from the case. Technically, Trump is still a defendant in the case, but as the sitting president, it is highly unlikely that any prosecution against him could proceed while he's in office.",

    "summary": "President Trump's administration asked the Supreme Court on Monday to allow it to freeze billions of dollars in foreign aid funding.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts on Tuesday temporarily halted a lower court order that blocked the Trump administration from freezing more than $4 billion in foreign-aid funding.",
      "The chief justice issued an administrative stay, which gives the Supreme Court more time to fully consider the government's request for emergency relief. The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court on Monday to allow the administration to freeze the funding for foreign aid projects.",
      "The request for the Supreme Court's intervention comes in a clash over the president's refusal to spend money allocated by Congress for foreign assistance programs.",
      "The Trump administration has asked the high court to partially halt the lower court order that required it to spend more than $4 billion in aid by the end of September. Mr. Trump is attempting to claw back that money, which has already been approved by Congress, through a rarely used maneuver known as a pocket rescission.",
      "The dispute also involves another $6.5 billion in foreign assistance, though the Justice Department has said it is taking steps to obligate those funds by Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.",
      "The legal fight quickly arrived at the Supreme Court after U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled last week that the executive branch had to spend the $4 billion in foreign aid funding that Congress had appropriated. The Justice Department asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to freeze that decision, though it declined to do so last Friday.",
      "In seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the district court's injunction \"raises a grave and urgent threat to the separation of powers.\" He is asking the Supreme Court to pause the district court's order only as to the $4 billion that Mr. Trump is attempting to rescind.",
      "\"The President can hardly speak with one voice in foreign affairs or in dealings with Congress when the district court is forcing the Executive Branch to advocate against its own objectives,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "Since returning to the White House, the Trump administration has canceled billions of dollars in contracts and grants that it says do not align with the president's policy objectives. On the first day of his second term, the president signed an executive order that called for a 90-day pause in foreign aid and said administration officials would determine whether to continue or cease each foreign assistance program.",
      "Congressional Democrats estimate that more than $425 billion in federal funding has been canceled or frozen by the president.",
      "The latest dispute before the Supreme Court was brought by a group of nonprofits and businesses that receive money for foreign assistance projects. The plaintiffs argued that the 90-day freeze was an unconstitutional exercise of the president's authority.",
      "The case has already landed at the Supreme Court, though in an earlier stage in the proceedings. In early March, the high court split 5-4 in rejecting a bid from the president to keep $2 billion in foreign aid frozen while the case moved forward.",
      "The case has progressed since then. Last month, a three-judge panel on the D.C. Circuit said that the nonprofits and businesses could not sue. The 2-1 panel wiped away an order from Ali that had prohibited the government from impounding congressionally appropriated foreign aid funds.",
      "But the D.C. Circuit panel issued an amended opinion late last month that opened up an avenue for the nonprofits and businesses to seek relief on different legal grounds.",
      "On the heels of that decision, Mr. Trump sent a letter to Congress proposing to rescind a total of $4.9 billion, which includes funding for the State Department, international development programs and the the U.S. Agency for International Development, which the president has moved to shutter.",
      "The president's plan is an attempt to roll back funding unilaterally and has not been done in nearly 50 years. One Republican has called the effort \"unlawful\" and said the Constitution makes clear that Congress has the power of the purse.",
      "The plaintiffs in the case sought a new preliminary injunction. Last week, Ali found that the government has a statutory duty to spend the $4 billion that is subject to Mr. Trump's rescission proposal. He ordered the Trump administration to spend the expiring funds approved by Congress for foreign assistance, unless Congress claws it back in accordance with the procedures laid out in federal law.",
      "In seeking relief from the Supreme Court, Sauer, the solicitor general, said Ali's injunction \"puts the executive branch at war with itself\" by requiring it to spend the same $4 billion that the president wants to claw back.",

    "summary": "Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who led controversial immigration enforcement raids in southern California this summer, has arrived in Chicago.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Border Patrol official who led controversial immigration enforcement raids in southern California this summer has arrived in Chicago, a new target of the Trump administration's escalating crackdown on illegal immigration, two people familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "The official, Gregory Bovino, is in the Chicago area as federal officials vow to initiate a blitz of arrests in the region targeting immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally, according to the sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. Bovino was the top Border Patrol agent in California's El Centro sector until he was given command of a broader immigration enforcement campaign across the state in June.",
      "Over the past several months, Bovino has become one of the most visible public faces of the Trump administration's aggressive effort to detain those living in the country unlawfully. He has accompanied rank-and-file agents on arrest operations and posted slickly edited videos of those sweeps on social media.",
      "In California, Bovino oversaw an effort by Customs and Border Protection, dubbed Operation At Large. Under that operation, Border Patrol agents, whose jobs have historically been limited to preventing the illicit entry of migrants and drugs into the country, have arrested unauthorized immigrants in places far from a U.S. border, like Los Angeles and Sacramento.",
      "Bovino has personally led some of the operations, including arrests outside of Home Depot stores and a show-of-force at MacArthur Park in Los Angeles that involved mounted Border Patrol agents and armored vehicles.",
      "In July, a federal judge in Los Angeles ruled that some of the immigration stops in southern California had been predicated on factors like race, language, occupation and location, instead of a reasonable suspicion that the subjects of stops were in the U.S. illegally. The judge barred federal agents in the region from basing arrests on those factors. On Monday, the Supreme Court paused the lower court's order.",
      "Bovino appeared to preview his deployment to Chicago last week, saying in a video he shared on social media that his team would be \"taking this show on the road, to a city near you.\"",
      "\"We're gonna trade these palm trees for some skyscrapers, and the mission continues,\" he said to the tune of Willie Nelson's \"On the Road Again.\"",
      "A U.S. official said Bovino arrived last Friday in Chicago, where he's expected to lead operations by CBP. The Trump administration has tasked the agency, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, with being more heavily involved with interior immigration enforcement amid a historic drop in illegal crossings at the southern border in recent months.",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has traditionally overseen immigration enforcement in the U.S. interior, this week launched an operation in the Chicago area that officials say will target immigrants in the U.S. illegally who also have criminal records. Officials have called the effort Operation Midway Blitz.",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, criticized the operation's announcement on Monday, saying the Trump administration should be coordinating with state officials to curtail crime.",
      "\"Instead of taking steps to work with us on public safety, the Trump Administration's focused on scaring Illinoisians,\" he wrote on X.",
      "Asked to comment on Bovino's arrival in Chicago, a spokesperson for DHS replied, \"Stay tuned.\"",
      "Last week, CBS News reported federal agents had begun staging at a U.S. Navy station in the Chicago suburbs in anticipation of an increase in immigration operations there. An internal memo asked the Pentagon to accommodate up to 250 federal agents and 140 vehicles at the station for 30 days.",
      "Over the weekend, DHS announced another ICE arrest operation in the Boston area, dubbed Patriot 2.0, that officials say is focused on unauthorized immigrants with criminal records.",

    "story": [
      "The \"big, beautiful bill\" signed into law by President Trump in July provides a bevy of new tax cuts and deductions that could lower taxes for millions of Americans, according to a recent analysis from the Tax Foundation.",
      "The typical filer could see a tax cut of $3,752 in 2026, the nonpartisan think tank found. But the impact will also vary geographically, with some residents in some states likely receiving a bigger tax benefit than others under the new law, Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "For instance, the biggest average cut will go to residents of Wyoming, with a reduction of $5,374, according to his analysis of the law's impact.",
      "The geographic differences are due partly to variations in the average income of each state, given that the law provides bigger tax cuts to high-income Americans\u00a0compared with low-income households, Watson noted. Other provisions also could help some regions more than others. That includes the higher deduction cap for state and local taxes, which will give more of a lift to people in states with high property taxes, such as New Jersey and New York.",
      "\"Places with higher incomes are going to have higher nominal tax cuts,\" Watson said. \"The largest tax benefits are going to the mountain states \u2014 it's due to a subgroup of higher-income business owners.\"",
      "Residents of Mississippi and West Virginia are likely to see the smallest tax cuts next year, the analysis found. Incomes in those states tend to be lower than the national average, with median household income in Mississippi standing at about $55,000 as of 2023 and $60,000 for West Virginians, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The national household median income is about $80,600.",
      "The Tax Foundation analysis projects the average tax cut in tax year 2026, meaning that these numbers reflect the reductions for the next calendar year. Although many of the law's provisions are effective in 2025, the IRS is still working out the details on some of them, which means lower tax withholding for the new provisions won't be fully in place until 2026, Watson said.",
      "Bigger refunds?",
      "Tax refunds are also likely to be larger in early 2026, when people file their taxes for the 2025 calendar year, Watson said, although he hasn't calculated the potential impact.",
      "Seniors who can claim a new $6,000 deduction for people over 65 under the law may get a bigger refund, as well as taxpayers across the board due to the higher standard deduction, said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt.",
      "Because of the tax changes in the new law, Steber recommends that people start preparing now. For example, workers who are newly eligible for tax breaks on tips and on overtime pay should keep track of such income.",
      "\"Having this much time left in the year allows taxpayers to make any necessary adjustments to help increase a refund or lower an amount due, and can be as simple as adjusting the withholding on a W-4,\" Steber told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The top 1% of earners around the U.S. \u2014 those with incomes over $1.1 million \u2014 will receive a $75,410 annual tax break from the new law in 2026, according to a\u00a0separate analysis\u00a0from the Tax Policy Center, nonpartisan think tank. That compares with an average tax break of $150 for households in the bottom 20% of the income distribution, or people earning less than $36,000 a year, and of $1,780 for earning $66,801 to $119,200.",
      "To be sure, many of new law's tax cuts will depend on an individual's financial circumstances. For instance, a low-income worker who earns tips or overtime could see a much bigger tax cut due to the law's \"no tax on tips\" and \"no tax on overtime\" provisions, Watson noted.",
      "\"If a taxpayer isn't taking tips or overtime or new car loan deduction, they may see a lower benefit,\" he said.",

      "\"Autochthonous (or, locally acquired) human cases have been reported in 8 states, most notably in Texas. Labeling the United States as non-Chagas disease-endemic perpetuates low awareness and underreporting,\" the report noted, adding the insect has been reported in 32 states.",
      "Other states with human cases include California, Arizona, Tennessee, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas.",

      "\"People might scratch or rub bug feces into a bite wound, their eyes, or mouth without realizing it, which allows the parasite to enter their body,\" the CDC says.

      "Cracker Barrel conceded in its statement that its planned store redesign did \"not reflect what you love about Cracker Barrel.\"",
      "To date, the Southern-themed restaurant chain has remodeled just four of its 660 store locations. It is suspending plans to remodel any additional stores.",
      "\"With our recent announcement that our 'Old Timer' logo will remain, along with our bigger focus in the kitchen and on your plate, we hope that today's step reinforces that we hear you,\" the company said Tuesday.",
      "Marketing experts said that while Cracker Barrel may have had solid business reasons for revamping its brand, the company's execution of that strategy was flawed.",
      "\"I'm sure there was a lot of deep thought that went into both the logo and store redesigns,\" Vanderbilt University marketing professor Kelly Goldsmith told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They needed to turn the ship around financially and thought the logo and store redesign would help.\"",
      "While Cracker Barrel's growth soared in the 1990s, it has slowed in recent years. For 2024, the company\u00a0reported\u00a0revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up less than 1% from the previous year. Net income fell to $40.9 million, down from $99 million in 2023.",
      "\"It's existing plan wasn't working for the company financially, and that was the impetus for this change,\" Goldsmith said.",
      "Goldsmith suspects Cracker Barrel may have wanted to appeal to a broader audience by presenting a more flexible brand, opening the door for the chain to expand into new food categories.",

    "published": "Tue, 09 Sep 2025 13:49:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies are deterring manufacturers from hiring, according to the Center for American Progress.",
    "story": [
      "Manufacturers in the U.S. are cutting thousands of jobs even as President Trump pushes economic policies that he says will revitalize the industry.",
      "Employers shed 12,000 manufacturing jobs\u00a0in August, while payrolls in the sector have shrunk by 42,000 since April, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Center for American Progress (CAP) that draws on government labor data.",
      "The nonpartisan policy institute attributes that decline to the Trump administration's steep new tariffs; hardline stance on immigration; and the Republican-backed \"big, beautiful bill,\" a tax and spending package enacted by Mr. Trump in July that CAP says hurts renewable energy companies by phasing out certain tax credits.",
      "For all of 2025, manufacturing employment in the U.S. has sunk by a total of 33,000 jobs, according to Labor Department\u00a0figures. Most of those job losses have been among companies that make durable goods, such as cars, household appliances and electronics. The drop comes as hiring overall has slowed sharply in recent months, with employers adding only 22,000 jobs in August, well below forecasts.",
      "The number of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. has declined for the past six decades, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In 1960, manufacturing represented about 34% of total employment, while the number of jobs in the sector peaked in 1970 at 19.5 million. As of August this year, 12.7 million Americans were employed in manufacturing, while the industry lost 87,000 jobs in 2024,\u00a0data shows.",
      "Uncertainty hurting businesses",
      "When Mr. Trump in April announced a range of levies on dozens of other countries, the White House said tariffs would protect American workers by reducing the U.S. trade deficit with its economic partners and spurring employers to move manufacturing jobs to the U.S.",
      "For now, however, confusion over the scale and scope of U.S. tariffs has put manufacturers on the defensive, increasing their costs and discouraging them from hiring, economist Sara Estrep, one of the authors of the CAP report, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Companies are uncertain about what's happening,\" she said. \"Everything has been changing on a day-to-day basis, so it's not clear what production should look like. That's why they aren't hiring.\"",
      "In August, for example, farm equipment giant John Deere cited tariffs in announcing that its sales and operating profits had dipped from a year ago. In an earnings call, an executive with the company noted that it had racked up roughly $300 million in tariff-related costs, including on steel and aluminum imports. John Deere also announced it was laying off more than 200 workers at plants in Illinois and Iowa, according to AgWeb, a trade publication.",
      "Automakers pointed partly to tariffs in announcing nearly 5,000 job cuts in July, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, while it noted that the retail sector has also stepped up layoffs and store closures because of economic uncertainty.",
      "Another factor fueling uncertainty for manufacturers are the ongoing legal challenges to the Trump tariffs, making it hard to plan and invest for the future, according to experts.",
      "A federal appeals court in August ruled that Mr. Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. trade partners. Mr. Trump on September 3\u00a0asked the Supreme Court\u00a0to review the lower court's decision before it takes effect in October.",
      "The outcome of the case leaves many manufacturers in doubt about how to proceed, making them reluctant to expand their workforce as they seek to control costs, Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The slowdown is symptomatic of an environment where purchasing managers are all under stress, and they are being squeezed by higher costs of goods and reduced demand,\" said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. \"And so in that squeeze, they are having to find ways to offset the higher costs, and one of the avenues to do that is to streamline their operations and make sure that they only have the essential talent on hand.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to several requests for comment on CAP's findings. The Office of the United States Trade Representative and National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Immigration effect",
      "The Trump administration's crackdown on U.S. immigrants is also weighing on hiring in manufacturing, said Daniel Altman, an economist and author of the High Yield Economics newsletter.",
      "\"Immigration has been an important source of employment in manufacturing for some industries, and if you take away some of their labor supply, that's just gives them more incentive to pursue automation and other forms of capital intensive manufacturing,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The government stepped up its campaign last week when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents\u00a0detained 475 immigrants, most of them Korean, at a Hyundai plant in Georgia because they were suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Border patrol agents have also\u00a0conducted raids targeting immigrants working in retail, according to CBS News. In sectors like farming, food processing and construction, undocumented immigrants make up to 20% of the workforce, according to\u00a0Goldman Sachs.",
      "White House \"border czar\" Tom Homan on Sunday said the White House will expand such efforts.",
      "\"We're going to do more worksite enforcement operations,\" Homan told CNN. \"No one hires an illegal alien out of the goodness of their heart. They hire them because they can work them harder, pay them less, undercut the competition that hires U.S. citizen employees.\"",
      "Other long-term factors that go beyond the Trump administration's policies are also contributing to the ongoing contraction in manufacturing jobs. During the pandemic, manufacturers invested heavily in technologies to automate their operations, Altman noted.",
      "\"We've seen a lot of automation, which means companies do not need as many workers to provide the same output,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Output per worker has been increasing, and when we see that kind of increase in labor productivity, it usually means workers have access to more capital, or better technology or both, and that's what you'd expect with automation.\"",

      "A deal was reached between South Korea and the United States to release more than 300 workers detained in an immigration enforcement raid at a massive Hyundai plant in Georgia, the South Korean government announced Sunday.",
      "During the raid on Thursday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested 475 immigrants suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally, authorities said at the time. According to South Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Hyun, more than 300 of the detained workers were South Korean nationals.",
      "South Korea's presidential chief of staff Kang Hoon-sik said that negotiations had been finalized on the workers' releases, and they would be returned to South Korea as soon as the remaining administrative steps are completed. South Korea plans to send a charter plane for them, he said.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Hyundai for additional comment on the deal.",
      "Hundreds of U.S. federal agents raided Hyundai's sprawling manufacturing site in southern Georgia last week, targeting a facility where the Korean automaker makes electric vehicles.",
      "Steven Schrank, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Georgia and Alabama, told reporters at a Friday news conference that a majority of the people detained were Korean nationals, but he didn't know exactly how many. They worked for different companies, including subcontractors, Schrank said.",
      "The operation was the latest in a long line of workplace raids conducted as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation agenda. But the one on Thursday is especially distinct because of its large size and the fact that it targeted a manufacturing site that state officials have long called Georgia's largest economic development project.",
      "Schrank said it was conducted as part of a month-long investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes. He described the raid as the largest enforcement operation at a single site in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, which is a unit within ICE.",
      "Video released by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Saturday showed a caravan of vehicles driving up to the site and then federal agents directing workers to line up outside. Some detainees were ordered to put their hands up against a bus as they were frisked and then shackled around their hands, ankles and waist.",
      "Agents focused their operation on a plant that is still under construction, at which Hyundai has partnered with LG Energy Solution to produce batteries that power electric vehicles.",
      "Most of the people detained were taken to an immigration detention center in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida state line. None has been charged with any crimes yet, Schrank said Friday, but he added that the investigation was ongoing.",
      "The South Korean government, a close U.S. ally, expressed \"concern and regret\" over the raid targeting its citizens and sent diplomats to the site.",

    "published": "Wed, 10 Sep 2025 08:19:11 -0400",
    "summary": "Worried three of its prize vessels would fall part, Norway's Viking Ship Museum is moving a trio of millennia-old ships to a new home \u2014 but it won't be easy.",
    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014 Three 1,200-year-old Viking ships that have stood the test of time are embarking on their final and possibly riskiest journey to their new forever home in Norway. The first to make the move is the Oseberg, which will slowly inch its way from its current location in the old Viking Ship Museum to a newly built addition that will house the national treasures in optimal conditions.",
      "The extremely fragile oak hull, encased in a heavy protective steel rig, began making the roughly hundred-yard journey on Tuesday. It was expected to take over 10 hours, with the ship lifted by a crane and moved along a track on the ceiling.",
      "\"There is something deeply moving when you think that these ships \u2014 with their long history and all the voyages they have undertaken \u2014   will embark on their final journey,\" museum director Aud Tonnessen said.",
      "In a post on its Facebook page Wednesday, the museum said the team moving the vessels \"actually got a head start yesterday and covered the first 20 meters. It went perfectly according to plan.\"",
      "The museum shared a time-lapse video of the hulking Oseberg slowly moving, suspended in the air on an overhead rail system and encased in its sturdy steel frame for the journey.",
      "Named after the places where they were discovered, the Oseberg, Gokstad and Tune \u2014   all believed to have been built between 840 and 910 \u2014   have been housed in a cross-shaped building considered too small and unsuitable to conserve them properly.",
      "\"They've been subjected to humidity, vibrations... Over time, the strain became so intense that they started showing signs that they would eventually collapse onto their supports,\" Tonnessen said.",
      "A decision was therefore taken to move them to a new climate-controlled facility, built as an extension to the old museum, which should make it possible to maintain the ships in their current condition for at least another century.",
      "The relocation process is perilous.",
      "\"We have to complete this operation without causing any further damage to the ships, but we know that each handling is harmful to them,\" said curator David Hauer, who has been planning the project for years.",
      "\"These are clinker hulls (featuring partially overlapping planks) that are 1,200 years old. At the slightest deformation, they split between the rivets, the wood cracks,\" Hauer explained.",
      "Endless precautions have been taken to prevent any breakage or vibrations during the relocation. The ship will be moved extremely slowly, at a pace of 5.5 minutes per yard.",
      "Among other things, an oil services company experienced in high-precision work \u2014  such as positioning massive structures nearly 1,000 feet below the sea with extreme accuracy \u2014 has been called in.",
      "\"But this is yet another level,\" Hauer said.",
      "\"The level of precision required, for example when it comes to vibrations, is the same as for electron microscopes in hospitals\" which require extreme stability, he said.",
      "\"Except here, it involves lifting the electron microscope, moving it, and then setting it back down so you can use it again,\" he said.",
      "If everything goes as planned, the Gokstad is scheduled to be relocated next during the autumn, and then finally the Tune in the summer of 2026.",
      "All three ships were found in separate burial sites southwest and southeast of Oslo between 1867 and 1904, each one very distinct from the other.",
      "Richly decorated with ornate carvings, the Oseberg is considered the best preserved Viking ship in the world.",
      "Gokstad is meanwhile the largest of the three, measuring 75 feet long and 16 feet wide, with space for 32 rowers.",
      "Tune is much more decomposed than the other two and is believed to have been a particularly fast warship.",
      "While Norway and its Scandinavian neighbors are often most associated with Viking-era archaeological finds, human history in the region far outdates the legendary masters of the sea.",
      "In Denmark, coastal settlements that were engulfed by rising seas more than 8,500 years ago were charted by divers this summer. Now lying about 26 feet below the waves, close to Denmark's second-biggest city Aarhus, there is evidence of a Stone Age settlement on the seabed.",
      "It was discovered by divers as part of a $15.5 million, six-year project to map parts of the Baltic and North Sea floors, which is being funded by the European Union. The goal of the project is to explore sunken landscapes and uncover lost Mesolithic period settlements as offshore energy and other infrastructure projects ramp up.",

      "Poland said Wednesday that, along with NATO allies, it had scrambled warplanes to shoot down multiple Russian drones that entered its airspace during Moscow's latest attack on Ukraine.",
      "\"Last night the Polish airspace was violated by a huge number of Russian drones,\" Prime Minister Donald\u00a0Tusk said in a social media post. \"Those drones that posed  a direct threat were shot down. I am in constant communication with the Secretary General of NATO and our allies.\"",
      "Poland's military said it scrambled aircraft to shoot down \"hostile objects\" in Polish airspace, a first for a NATO country during the war. The military, in\u00a0a post on X,\u00a0called it \"an unprecedented violation of Polish airspace by drone-type objects\" and an \"act of aggression that posed a real threat to the safety of our citizens.\"",
      "The European Union's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said early indications suggested the Russian drone incursion into Poland's airspace was intentional.",
      "\"Last night in Poland we saw the most serious European airspace violation by Russia since the war began, and indications suggest it was intentional, not accidental,\" Kallas said in a statement. \"The EU stands in full solidarity with Poland. Russia's war is escalating, not ending. We must raise the cost to Moscow, strengthen support for Ukraine, and invest in Europe's defense.\"",
      "In a statement posted on social media, a NATO spokesperson said fighter jets from the Netherlands were deployed and helped to shoot down the drones, confirming it was \"the first time NATO aircrafts have engaged potential threats in Allied airspace.\"",
      "In addition to the direct response by Polish and Dutch fighter jets, German Patriot missiles based in Poland \"were placed on alert,\" and an Italian airborne early warning aircraft and a NATO refueler aircraft were also launched, according to the statement from NATO spokesperson, Col.

      "A cornerstone of the Western NATO military alliance is the principle that an attack on any member is considered an attack on all. A NATO source told the Reuters news agency that the alliance wasn't treating the Russian drone incursion into Polish territory as an attack, but that it did appear to have been deliberate.",
      "Tusk told Poland's parliament that authorities had identified 19 violations of the country's airspace overnight and shot down at least three drones, adding that no one was harmed in the \"Russian action.\"",
      "Tusk said Poland had made a \"formal request to invoke Article 4\" of the NATO alliance's founding treaty. Under Article 4, any member can call urgent talks when it feels its \"territorial integrity, political independence or security\" are at risk.",
      "The Polish case marked the eighth time the article has been invoked since the alliance was founded in 1949, and the third time Article 4 has been invoked to address Russia's incursions into and invasion of Ukraine.",
      "NATO's collective security is based on its Article 5 principle, which states that if one member is attacked, the entire alliance will come to its defense. That article has only been invoked once in the history of NATO, by the United States, following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.",
      "Poland's military said efforts were \"underway to search for and locate the possible crash sites of these objects\" and \"the Operational Command of the Polish Armed Forces is monitoring the current situation, and Polish and allied forces and assets remain fully prepared for further actions.\"",
      "Polish police said officers had discovered a damaged drone in the eastern Polish village of Czosnowka, according to Reuters, and there were reports that a building was damaged by a falling drone or debris in another eastern Polish town, but there were no reports of any injuries.",
      "Hours later, Poland's military said on X that the operations had concluded but the search for downed drones was continuing. \"We urge that in the event of observing an unknown object or its debris, do not approach, touch, or move it. Such elements may pose a threat and contain hazardous materials. They must be thoroughly inspected by the appropriate services,\" the military cautioned.",
      "The Polish government announced it would hold an \"extraordinary\" meeting Wednesday morning.",
      "The incursion came as Russia unleashed a barrage of strikes across Ukraine, including in the western city of Lviv, around 50 miles from the Polish border.",
      "Warnings of further Russian aggression",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that eight Russian drones were \"aimed toward\" Poland in an overnight barrage that forced Warsaw to scramble air defenses. \"It was not just one Shahed that could be called an accident, but at least eight strike drones aimed toward Poland,\" Zelensky said, referring to Iranian-designed drones deployed by Moscow, adding that the incident represented \"An extremely dangerous precedent for Europe.\"",
      "Ukraine's foreign minister, Andriy Sybiga,\u00a0warned on X that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"just keeps escalating, expanding his war, and testing the West. The longer he faces no strength in response, the more aggressive he gets. A weak response now will provoke Russia even more -- and then Russian missiles and drones will fly even further into Europe.\"",
      "Poland's newly-elected nationalist President Karol Nawrocki issued a warning along the same lines Tuesday, saying at a news conference in Helsinki that, \"We do not trust Vladimir Putin's good intentions. We believe that Vladimir Putin is ready to also invade other countries.\"",
      "European Union chief Ursula said Moscow had carried out a \"reckless and unprecedented\" violation of Polish airspace.",

      "The company said it will cut about 5,000 jobs in Denmark, although it didn't disclose where the remaining 4,000 reductions will be located. \u00a0Novo Nordisk also makes Ozempic, a diabetes drug that also can result in weight loss.",
      "The streamlining would save $1.25 billion by the end of 2026, savings that are to be redirected to diabetes and obesity, including research and development, the company said. The company said that the reductions are necessary because of a \"more dynamic and consumer-driven obesity market,\" which has resulted in slower growth.",
      "The company said implementation of the job cuts would begin immediately and that it would let the affected employees know over the next few months depending on local labor rules. The company, which is based in Bagsvaerd just outside Copenhagen, has 78,400 workers.",
      "\"Our markets are evolving, particularly in obesity, as it has become more competitive and consumer-driven,\" said President and CEO Mike Doustdar in the statement. \"Our company must evolve as well. This means instilling an increased performance-based culture, deploying our resources ever more effectively, and prioritizing investment where it will have the most impact \u2014 behind our leading therapy areas.\"",
      "Shares of Novo Nordisk rose 58 cents, or 1.1%, to $54.88 in pre-market trading.",
      "Doustdar became CEO in May after his predecessor, Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, left the company after the share price fell and as the company faced competition from weight-loss drugs from competitor Eli Lilly.",
      "Shares had skyrocketed after the introduction of Wegovy and Ozempic, which are both based on the same basic ingredient, semaglutide.",
      "At the peak, the company's market capitalization \u2014 or the combined price of all its shares \u2014 exceeded Denmark's annual gross domestic product and made it Europe's most valuable company.",

      "Protesters blocked roads, set blazes and were met with volleys of police tear gas Wednesday in Paris and elsewhere in France, seeking to heap pressure on President Emmanuel Macron by attempting to give his new prime minister a baptism of fire.",
      "The interior minister announced nearly 200 arrests in the first hours of the planned day of nationwide protests.",
      "Although falling short of its self-declared intention to \"Block Everything,\" the protest movement that started online and gathered steam over the summer caused widespread disruptions, defying an exceptional deployment of 80,000 police who broke up barricades and swiftly made arrests.",
      "Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said a bus was set on fire in the western city of Rennes and that damage to a power line blocked trains on a line in the southwest. He alleged that protesters were attempting to create \"a climate of insurrection.\"",
      "The protesters, angry at Macron over his leadership and austerity policies, had planned to disrupt activity of all types across the country.",
      "Two days after Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou was ousted as prime minister in a parliamentary vote of no confidence and then replaced Tuesday by S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, thousands of protesters responded to online calls to disrupt the country.",
      "The \"Bloquons Tout\" (Block Everything) movement had gathered momentum on social media and in encrypted chats over the summer. Its call for a day of blockades, strikes, demonstrations, and other acts of protest came as Macron \u2014 one of the movement's main targets \u2014 installed Lecornu as his fourth prime minister in just 12 months.",
      "The movement, which has grown virally with no clear identified leadership, has a broad array of demands \u2014 many targeting contested belt-tightening budget plans that Bayrou had championed before his ouster \u2014 as well as broader complaints about inequality.",
      "Calls online for strikes, boycotts, blockades and other forms of protest on Wednesday were accompanied with appeals to avoid violence.",
      "The spontaneity of \"Block Everything\" is reminiscent of the \"Yellow Vest\" protest movement that rocked Macron's first term as president. It started with workers camping out on traffic circles to protest a hike in fuel taxes, sporting high-visibility vests. It quickly spread to people across political, regional, social and generational divides venting their anger over perceived economic injustice and Macron's leadership.",

    "story": [
      "Israel's military said Tuesday that it had \"conducted a precise strike targeting the senior leadership of the Hamas terrorist organization,\" amid reports of large explosions in Qatar's capital city, Doha.",
      "Qatar's government quickly issued condemnation of what it called a \"cowardly Israeli strike,\" which it said had violated international law.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces did not confirm the location of the strikes in its statement, but said it targeted leaders of Hamas who, in the IDF's words, had for years \"led the terrorist organization's operations, are directly responsible for the brutal October 7 massacre, and have been orchestrating and managing the war against the State of Israel.\"",
      "The IDF subsequently confirmed to CBS News that its original statement referred to an operation carried out Tuesday in Doha, which it said was called \"Summit of Fire.\"",
      "The Al-Jazeera television network said an ongoing meeting of Hamas leaders in Doha was struck, as they gathered to discuss a recent U.S. ceasefire proposal to end the war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Hamas condemned the strike, calling it \"a heinous crime, a blatant aggression, and a flagrant violation of all international norms and laws.\"",
      "Hamas said in a statement that five of its members were killed, but that Israel failed \"to assassinate the brothers in the negotiating delegation.\" It also said a member of Qatari Internal Security was killed.",
      "\"Targeting the negotiating delegation, at a moment when it was discussing the latest proposal of American President Donald Trump, unequivocally confirms that Netanyahu and his government do not wish to reach any agreement,\" Hamas said in the statement. \"We hold the American administration jointly responsible with the occupation for this crime, due to its continuous support for the aggression and the occupation's crimes against our people.\"",
      "Witnesses told the Reuters news agency that plumes of black smoke were seen billowing from a gas station, next to which there is a small, residential compound that they said has been under 24-hour guard since the start of the war in Gaza.",
      "\"Prior to the strike, measures were taken in order to mitigate harm to civilians, including the use of precise munitions and additional intelligence,\" the IDF said.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office released a statement Tuesday saying the \"action against the top terrorist chieftains of Hamas was a wholly independent Israeli operation. Israel initiated it, Israel conducted it, and Israel takes full responsibility.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration was notified by the U.S. military of the strikes. A senior U.S. official and a diplomatic source familiar with the strikes told CBS News that Israel notified the U.S. of the attack as it was about to happen. Two other U.S. officials told CBS News the U.S. did not coordinate with Israel on planning the strikes.",
      "A senior U.S. intelligence official told CBS News that the U.S. told Qatar about the strike moments before the bombing.",
      "President Trump later wrote on social media, \"This was a decision made by Prime Minister Netanyahu, it was not a decision made by me. Unilaterally bombing inside Qatar, a Sovereign Nation and close Ally of the United States, that is working very hard and bravely taking risks with us to broker Peace, does not advance Israel or America's goals. However, eliminating Hamas, who have profited off the misery of those living in Gaza, is a worthy goal.\"",
      "Qatar's Foreign Ministry spokesperson said in a post on X that claims that Qatar was informed in advance about the attack are false, and that a call from an American official came when explosions from the Israeli attack were being heard.",
      "Mr. Trump in his Truth Social post said he told special envoy Steve Witkoff, who has been a key player in the negotiations, to warn the Qataris of the attack, but that the warning came too late for them to stop it. He also said he assured the Emir of Qatar and the Qatari prime minister such an attack \"would not happen again on their soil.\"",
      "\"I also spoke to Prime Minister Netanyahu after the attack,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"The Prime Minister told me that he wants to make Peace. I believe this unfortunate incident could serve as an opportunity for PEACE.\"",
      "Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz published a joint statement saying, \"this afternoon, in light of an operational opportunity, and in consultation with all heads of the defense establishment and with full backing, the Prime Minister and the Defense Minister decided to implement the instruction given last night to the IDF and the Shin Bet, which did so in a precise and optimal manner.\"",
      "\"The Prime Minister and the Defense Minister believed that the action was completely justified in light of the fact that this Hamas leadership was the one who initiated and organized the October 7 massacre, and has not stopped launching murderous actions against the State of Israel and its citizens since then,\" the joint statement said.",
      "Netanyahu also noted, \"Israel acted wholly independently \u2014 wholly independently \u2014 and we take full responsibility for the attacks.\"",
      "Countries including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey released statements condemning the strikes in Doha.",
      "Hamas, long designated a terrorist organization by Israel, the U.S. and the European Union, has maintained a primary political office in Doha for years, through which it has conducted most of its diplomacy since the war in Gaza was sparked by the group's Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "Qatar is a close ally of the United States and also hosts the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East, Al-Udeid Air Base. It has also been one of the mediators, alongside the U.S. and Egypt, of the ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas.",
      "The Qatari government condemned what it called a \"cowardly Israeli attack that targeted residential compounds housing several members of Hamas' political bureau in the Qatari capital, Doha.\"",
      "\"This criminal act constitutes a blatant violation of all international laws and norms and poses a serious threat to the security and safety of Qatari citizens and residents,\" Dr. Majed Al Ansari, spokesperson for Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in the statement. \"Qatar reiterates its firm stance that it will not tolerate this reckless Israeli behavior and continued destabilization of regional security, nor any act that targets its sovereignty and safety. Investigations are being conducted at the highest level, and further details will be announced as soon as they become available.\"",
      "In a post on social media, the U.S. Embassy in Doha said it was aware of \"reports of missile strikes occurring in Doha,\" and it announced a shelter-in-place order for embassy facilities that was later lifted.",

Clashes between young demonstrators and police on Monday turned violent, with police killing 19 people.",
      "Protesters in Nepal's capital defied a curfew on Tuesday to continue venting their rage at the government a day after the deadly crackdown. Oli, 73, quit shortly after protesters set fire to his house, writing in his resignation letter that he hoped it would help \"towards a political solution and resolution of the problems\" in the country.",
      "Protesters also set fire to parliament on Tuesday, and Oli's whereabouts were not immediately clear.",
      "The protests, which began on Monday with demands that the government lift a ban on social media and tackle corruption, reignited despite the apps being allowed to go back online.",
      "Kathmandu police spokesman Shekhar Khanal said several groups had refused to obey a curfew on Tuesday, telling AFP there were protesters in the streets in many areas including \"cases of fire and attacks.\"",

      "There were unconfirmed reports that the wife of former prime minister and communist party leader, Jhala Nath Khanal, who served as the premier for less than a year in 2011, was killed after becoming trapped in their home in Kathmandu when it was set on fire by protesters.",
      "Oli, 73, had ordered a probe into the violence and on Tuesday said he would head all-party talks in a bid to bring about a \"meaningful conclusion\" to the violence. But not long after, local media said he was stepping down, and the Reuters news agency cited his aide Prakash Silwal as confirming the news.",

      "\"The social media platforms have been opened, which was among the Gen Z's demands,\" Minister for Communication Prithvi Subba Gurung told AFP, referring to young people aged largely in their 20s who have led the protests.",
      "What are the protests in Nepal all about?",
      "The social media ban fed into existing anger at the government in a country with a youth bulge. People aged 15-40 make up nearly 43% of the population, according to government statistics \u2014 while unemployment hovers around 10% and GDP per capita at just $1,447, according to the World Bank.",

      "Amnesty International said live ammunition was used against protesters on Monday, and the United Nations demanded a swift and transparent probe.",
      "Police in Kathmandu on Monday clashed with the crowds when protesters pushed through barbed wire and tried to storm into a restricted area near parliament. Seventeen people were killed in Kathmandu, police said, and two more in the eastern district of Sunsari, according to local media.",
      "Police said about 400 people were injured, including more than 100 police.",
      "Since Friday, videos contrasting the struggles of ordinary Nepalis with the children of politicians flaunting luxury goods and expensive vacations have gone viral on TikTok, which was not blocked.",

      "French President Macron late Tuesday appointed Defense Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu as France's new prime minister and tasked him with immediately trying to get the country's fractious political parties to agree on a budget for one of the world's biggest economies.",
      "Lecornu, 39, was the youngest defense minister in French history and was overseeing a major military buildup spurred by Russia's war in Ukraine. A longtime Macron loyalist, Lecornu is now France's fourth prime minister in barely a year.",
      "A former conservative who joined Macron's centrist movement in 2017, Lecornu has held posts in local governments, overseas territories and during Macron's yellow vest \"great debate,\" when he helped manage a surge of anti-government protest with dialogue. He also offered talks on autonomy during unrest in the French overseas region of Guadeloupe in 2021.",
      "His rise reflects Macron's instinct to reward loyalty, but also the need for continuity as repeated budget showdowns have toppled his predecessors and left France in drift.",
      "Macron's quick decision to name Lecornu comes ahead of a day of mass disruption planned for Wednesday by a protest movement called \"Block Everything\" that has prompted the government to deploy an exceptional 80,000 police to keep order.",
      "Legislators toppled Lecornu's predecessor Francois Bayrou and his government in a confidence vote on Monday, a new crisis for Europe's second-largest economy.",
      "Bayrou gambled that lawmakers would back his view that France must slash public spending to rein in its huge debts. Instead, they seized on the vote to gang up against the 74-year-old centrist who was appointed by Macron last December.",
      "The demise of Bayrou's short-lived minority government heralds renewed uncertainty and a risk of prolonged legislative deadlock for France as it wrestles both with its internal budget difficulties and, internationally, wars in Ukraine and Gaza and the shifting priorities of U.S. President Trump.",

      "The activist group sending a flotilla of aid boats to try to reach Gaza \u2014 Global Sumud Flotilla \u2014 said Tuesday that one of its vessels was attacked by a drone overnight while docked in Tunisia. The group said all six passengers who had been traveling on the boat were safe. The Associated Press reported the flotilla's most famous members, including climate activist Greta Thunberg, had been traveling on the boat, though it was unclear who was on board at the time of the alleged strike.",

It stood a few seconds on top of a bunch of life jackets, and then dropped a bomb.\"",
      "Duarte said the \"bomb exploded, there was a big flame, a fire on board immediately. We picked up fire extinguishers, fought the fire successfully, and everyone was safe, fortunately.\"",
      "Tunisia's National Guard initially denied that a drone strike had occurred, saying that, \"according to initial inspections, the fire was caused by flames breaking out in one of the life jackets aboard the ship, due to a lighter or a cigarette butt. There is no evidence of any hostile act or external targeting.\"",
      "Tunisia's Interior Ministry also initially said the \"claims about a drone falling on one of the ships docked at the Port of Sidi Bou Said are unfounded.\"",
      "The ministry said \"specialized security units inspected the traces of a fire that broke out on one of the life jackets, which was quickly brought under control, causing no human or material damage, except for the burning of a number of these life jackets.\"",
      "However, a spokesperson for the Global Sumud Flotilla later told CBS News that the Tunisian authority's statements had been published before they saw the group's video. The spokesperson said that based on that video, the Tunisian authorities had decided to create a special committee to investigate the incident.",
      "\"We appreciate the effort that they are making to investigate, and we are waiting pending the final outcome,\" the flotilla spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "Tunisia's Interior Ministry did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment on an investigation.",

    "published": "Mon, 08 Sep 2025 20:33:52 -0400",
    "summary": "Dressed in jeans, Nike sneakers and a sweatshirt, with his hands clasped around a rosary, Carlo Acutis has generated near rock star-like fame among young Catholics.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of young Catholics flock to the small central Italian town of Assisi every year to pay tribute to Carlo Acutis \u2013 the Italian teenager informally known as \"God's Influencer.\"",
      "The 15-year-old computer whiz became the Catholic Church's first millennial saint on Sunday, giving the next generation of Catholics a relatable role model who used technology to spread the faith.",
      "Pope Leo XIV canonized Acutis, who died in 2006, during an open-air Mass in St. Peter's Square before an estimated 80,000 people, many of them millennials and couples with young children. Leo also canonized another popular Italian figure who died young, Pier Giorgio Frassati.",
      "Leo said both men created \"masterpieces\" out of their lives by dedicating them to God.",
      "\"The greatest risk in life is to waste it outside of God's plan,\" Leo said in his homily. The new saints \"are an invitation to all of us, especially young people, not to squander our lives, but to direct them upwards and make them masterpieces.\"",
      "Who was Carlo Acutis?",
      "Acutis was born on May 3, 1991, in London to a wealthy Italian family. They moved back to Milan soon after he was born, and according to reports, he enjoyed a typical, happy childhood that was marked by his increasingly intense religious devotion.",
      "He launched and managed a website for his local parish and later a Vatican-based academy. He also used his computer skills to create an online database of Eucharistic miracles around the world, available in nearly 20 languages. The site provides information about the 196 seemingly inexplicable events in the history of the church related to the Eucharist, which the faithful believe is the body of Christ.",
      "\"Carlo was well aware that the whole apparatus of communications, advertising and social networking can be used to lull us, to make us addicted to consumerism and buying the latest thing on the market,\" the late Pope Francis wrote in a 2019 document. \"Yet he knew how to use the new communications technology to transmit the Gospel, to communicate values and beauty.\"",
      "Acutis was known to spend hours in prayer before the Eucharist each day, a practice known as Eucharistic adoration.",
      "\"This was the fixed appointment of his day,\" his mother, Antonia Salzano, said in a documentary that is airing Friday night at the U.S. seminary in Rome.",
      "In October 2006, at age 15, he fell ill with what was quickly diagnosed as acute leukemia. He died in Monza, Italy, within days of his diagnosis. His body was entombed in Assisi and is on full display alongside other relics linked to him.",
      "Fast track to sainthood",
      "Dressed in jeans, Nike sneakers and a sweatshirt, with his hands clasped around a rosary, Acutis has generated a near rock star-like fame among young faithful the likes of which the Catholic Church hasn't seen in ages.",
      "Those who can't make it in person can watch the comings and goings on a webcam pointed at his tomb, a level of internet accessibility not afforded even to popes buried in St. Peter's Basilica.",
      "Acutis' path to sainthood began more than 10 years ago, initiated by a group of priests and friends, and formally took off shortly after Francis assumed the papacy in 2013.",
      "Acutis was named \"venerable\" in 2018 after the church recognized his virtuous life, and his body was taken to a shrine in the Santuario della Spogliazione in Assisi, Italy. It was a significant site associated with St. Francis' life.",
      "The teenager was beatified in 2020 \u2013 the first step to sainthood \u2013 after Acutis was credited with healing a Brazilian child of a congenital disease affecting his pancreas.",
      "Last year, Francis approved the second miracle needed for Acutis to be made a saint. The second miracle involved the healing of a university student in Florence who had a brain bleed after suffering head trauma in a bicycle accident.",
      "Francis and the cardinals residing in Rome formally approved his canonization in July 2024.",
      "The canonization \u2013 the first for Pope Leo XIV \u2013 was initially scheduled for earlier this year but was postponed following Francis' death in April.",
      "An appeal to the youth",
      "For his admirers, Acutis was an ordinary kid who did extraordinary things: a typical Milan teen who went to school, played soccer and loved animals. But he also brought food to the poor, attended Mass daily and got his less-than-devout parents back to church.",
      "\"When I read his story for the first time, it was just like shocking to me, because from a very early age, he was just really drawn to Jesus Christ and he would go to Mass all the time,\" Sona Harrison, an eighth grader at the St. John Berchmans' school, which is part of the Blessed Carlo Acutis Parish in Chicago's Northwest Side, told the Associated Press. \"I feel like he's a lot more relatable, and I definitely feel like I'm closer to God when I read about him.\"",
      "During Mass this week before the canonization, students processed into the chapel under an Acutis banner carrying things he might have carried: a soccer ball, a laptop and a knapsack.",
      "\"He fed the poor, he cared for the poor,\" said 9-year-old David Cameron, who called Acutis \"a great man.\" Cameron, a fan of Sonic, Minecraft and Halo, also found inspiration in Acutis' love of video games \u2014 and awe at Acutis' restraint.",
      "\"He played video games for like only one hour a week, which I don't think I can do,\" he told the AP.",
      "Matthew Schmalz, professor of religious studies at Holy Cross College in Worcester, Massachusetts, said Acutis' canonization extends the church tradition of popular piety to the digital age.",
      "\"He becomes an emblem or model of how Catholics should approach and use the digital world--with discipline and with a focus on traditional Catholic spirituality that defies the passage of time,\" he said in a statement. \"He is a new saint of simplicity for the ever complex digital landscape of contemporary Catholicism.\"",
      "The Vatican said 36 cardinals, 270 bishops and hundreds of priests had signed up to celebrate the Mass along with Leo in a sign of the saints' enormous appeal to the hierarchy and ordinary faithful alike.",
      "Frassati, the other saint being canonized Sunday, lived from 1901-1925, when he died at age 24 of polio. He was born into a prominent Turin family but is known for his devotion to serving the poor and carrying out acts of charity while spreading his faith to his friends.",

      "At least 145 people were hurt, officials said. They were being treated at half a dozen hospitals in Kathmandu.",

      "Protesters pushed through barbed wire and forced riot police to retreat as they surrounded the Nepalese Parliament building. Police fired tear gas and water cannon but were outnumbered and sought safety inside the parliament complex. Police eventually opened fire at the protesters.",

      "TikTok, Viber and three other platforms have registered and continued to operate without interruption.",

    "published": "Mon, 08 Sep 2025 15:03:00 -0400",
    "summary": "French President Emmanuel Macron must search for a fourth prime minister in 12 months after Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou was ousted.",
    "story": [
      "Legislators toppled France's government in a confidence vote on Monday, a new crisis for Europe's second-largest economy that obliges President Emmanuel Macron to search for a fourth prime minister in 12 months.",
      "Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou was ousted overwhelmingly in a 364-194 vote against him. Bayrou paid the price for what appeared to be a staggering political miscalculation, gambling that lawmakers would back his view that France must slash public spending to repair its debts. Instead, they seized on the vote that Bayrou called to gang up against the 74-year-old centrist who was appointed by Macron last December.",
      "The demise of Bayrou's short-lived minority government \u2014 now constitutionally obliged to submit its resignation to Macron after just under nine months in office \u2014 heralds renewed uncertainty and a risk of prolonged legislative deadlock for France as it wrestles with pressing challenges, including budget difficulties and, internationally, wars in Ukraine and Gaza and the shifting priorities of President Trump.",
      "Hunt for a replacement",
      "Although Macron had two weeks to prepare for the government collapse after Bayrou announced in August that he'd seek a confidence vote on his unpopular budget plans, no clear front-runner has emerged as a likely successor.",
      "After Gabriel Attal's departure as prime minister in September 2024, followed by former Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier's ouster by parliament in December, and Bayrou now ousted, too, Macron again faces an arduous hunt for a replacement to build consensus in the parliament's lower house that is stacked with opponents of the French leader.",
      "Macron's office said that he'd accept the resignation of Bayrou's government on Tuesday and name a new prime minister \"in the coming days.\"",
      "As president, Macron will continue to hold substantial powers over foreign policy and European affairs and remain the commander in chief of the nuclear-armed military. But domestically, the 47-year-old president's ambitions are increasingly facing ruin.",
      "The root of the latest government collapse was Macron's stunning decision to dissolve the National Assembly in June 2024, triggering a legislative election that the French leader hoped would strengthen the hand of his pro-European centrist alliance. But the gamble backfired, producing a splintered legislature with no dominant political bloc in power for the first time in France's modern republic.",
      "Shorn of a workable majority, his minority governments have since lurched from crisis to crisis, surviving on the whim of opposing political blocs on the left and far-right that don't have enough seats to govern themselves but can, when they team up, topple Macron's choices.",
      "Bayrou's gamble",
      "Bayrou, too, rolled the dice by calling the confidence vote, a decision that quickly backfired on the political veteran as left-wing and far-right legislators seized the opportunity to oust his government, seeking to increase pressure on Macron.",
      "\"This moment marks the end of the agony of a phantom government,\" far-right leader Marine Le Pen said, according to the Reuters news service.",
      "\"Today is a day of relief for millions of French people, of relief over your departure,\" Mathilde Panot of the hard-left France Unbowed told Bayrou in remarks before the vote, according to Reuters.",
      "Bayrou conceded in his last speech as prime minister to the National Assembly that putting his fate on the line was risky. But he said that France's debt crisis compelled him to seek legislative support for remedies, in the face of what he called \"a silent, underground, invisible, and unbearable hemorrhage\" of excessive public borrowing.",
      "\"The greatest risk was to not take one, to let things go on without changing anything, to go on doing politics as usual,\" he said. \"Submission to debt is like submission through military force. Dominated by weapons, or dominated by our creditors, because of a debt that is submerging us \u2014 in both cases, we lose our freedom.\"",
      "At the end of the first quarter of 2025, France's public debt stood at 3.346 trillion euros, or 114% of gross domestic product. Debt servicing remains a major budget item, accounting for around 7% of state spending.",
      "Le Pen wants new election",
      "The 577-seat National Assembly interrupted its summer recess to convene for the extraordinary session of high political drama. Macron's opponents worked to leverage the crisis to push for a new legislative election, apply pressure for Macron's departure or jostle for posts in the next government.",
      "Le Pen called for Macron to again dissolve the National Assembly, seemingly confident that her National Rally party and its allies would win a majority in another snap legislative election, positioning it to form a new government.",
      "\"A big country like France cannot live with a paper government, especially in a tormented and dangerous world,\" she said in the National Assembly.",
      "Pressing problems",
      "In a last-ditch effort to save his job before the vote, Bayrou warned that France is risking its future and its influence by racking up trillions in state debts that are \"submerging us,\" pleading for belt-tightening.",
      "Macron's chosen successor will operate in the same precarious environment and face the same pressing budget problems that dogged Bayrou and his predecessors. Macron himself has vowed to stay in office until the end of his term, but risks becoming a lame duck domestically if political paralysis continues.",
      "Under the French political system, the prime minister is appointed by the president, accountable to the parliament, and is in charge of implementing domestic policy, notably economic measures.",
      "Arguing that sharp cuts are needed to repair public finances, Bayrou had proposed to cut 44 billion euros ($51 billion) in spending in 2026, after France's deficit hit 5.8% of GDP last year, way above the official EU target of 3%.",
      "He painted a dramatic picture of the European Union's No. 2 economy becoming beholden to foreign creditors and addicted to living beyond its means. He castigated opponents in the National Assembly who teamed up against his minority government despite their own sharp political differences.",
      "\"You have the power to overthrow the government, but you do not have the power to erase reality,\" Bayrou said. \"Reality will remain inexorable. Spending will continue to increase and the debt burden \u2014 already unbearable \u2014 will grow heavier and more costly.\"",

      "The new \"Golden Bachelor\" Mel Owens stirred controversy after admitting to ABC producers that he plans to eliminate contestants who are over 60 years old. Gerry Turner thinks he'll be \"cheating himself\" if he does.",
      "After being cast as the new lead on ABC's \"The Golden Bachelor,\" Mel Owens had a lot to look forward to. However, things took a dark turn when the retired NFL linebacker admitted his plans to eliminate any contestant over 60 years old.",
      "During an appearance on the \"In The Trenches\" podcast in June, Owens \u2014 who spoke with Fox News Digital ahead of the show's premiere \u2014 opened up about the age limitations he allegedly requested ahead of casting.",
      "\"It's blind up until they get out of the limo. But they asked me, 'What's your preferences?' So, I just said 45 to 60, just being honest,\" he said. \"And then the process went, and I was selected, right? And then we had lunch with the executive producer. I said, 'You know, if they're 60 or over, I'm cutting them.' 'Oh Mel, you can't, you know, this is not the 'Silver Bachelor.' It\u2019s the 'Golden Bachelor.' He goes, 'But they're going to be hot, don\u2019t worry about it. Don't worry about it.'\"",

      "Additionally, Owens said he asked producers to \"stay away from the artificial hips and the wigs.\"",
      "In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, the show's leading man opened up about the mishap, shared how he earned the ladies' trust back, and explained why he believes there's \"no age to love.\"",
      "\"I apologized when I met the women on the first night,\" Owens \u2014 who has already wrapped filming his season \u2014 said. \"I had been married for 25 years and all my experiences at that time were just with my wife and the friends that we had. So I hadn't experienced anybody outside of my wife. But again, it was unfair and I apologized and went forward and asked them to let me earn it back and, hopefully, I did on the season.\"",
      "\"It takes sincerity and I was sincere about it,\" he added. \"And so I apologized to the group when we were all there after the introductions. And then, individually, I would say most of them asked me again and I told them and I apologized so sincerely. I told them that I wanted to earn it back and just give me another chance, and they did, and hopefully that they found out that I was sincere and we can move forward.\"",

      "When asked why he made the comments, Owens told Glamour last month, \"Because I didn\u2019t know anything about\u00a0The Golden Bachelor\u00a0ages. I didn\u2019t.\"",
      "He explained, \"I had watched the first show when I was younger, when it first launched or something in 2002, until my son was born. But then when he was born, I didn\u2019t watch it anymore. So when these people talk about, \u2018Hey, this season and that season,\u2019 I didn\u2019t know the age range because I wasn\u2019t watching it.\"",
      "Instead,\u00a0Owens said\u00a0his idea of the \"golden\" years was based on his personal frame of reference \u2014 not the show\u2019s legacy.",
      "\"I\u2019m thinking, to me, the age range was 45 to 60. That\u2019s my age range. I\u2019m thinking that\u2019s the gold years for me. My reference, again, was when I was dating at 39, 40. I hadn\u2019t dated in 26 years, so I had no clue. And that\u2019s why I said that comment,\" he admitted. \"I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know. And I didn\u2019t know that [Gerry Turner, the original Golden Bachelor] got married and then divorced. I didn\u2019t know any of it.\"",
      "There's no age to love and there's no age in your spirit. So I think you're going to be pleasantly surprised when you see the show.\"",
      "Despite the backlash, Owens said he doesn't foresee his controversial comments shutting out a powerful part of the show's audience when it comes to age and acceptance.",
      "\"I don't think it's going to be a problem because all the women were great, and they're very accomplished and sophisticated and beautiful,\" said Owens.",

      "In July, \"Golden Bachelor\" alum Gerry Turner told Fox News Digital that he fears Owens will be \"cheating himself\" if he decides to pursue his controversial plan.",
      "\"I think it would be unfortunate, and I really think he will have a change of heart in this. I think he will see the grace and the charm of women who are over 60 and the confidence they carry, and I think he'll have a change of heart,\" Turner, 73, said of Owens.",
      "\"The people that I met in my season, I go through them, and it's like, they're all a gift. To have gotten to know them\u2026 Each and every one of them [brought] some unique characteristics to the show, unique characteristics to life.\"",

      "'GOLDEN BACHELOR' STARS GERRY TURNER AND THERESA NIST DIVORCING 3 MONTHS AFTER TELEVISED WEDDING",
      "\"His comments about anybody that's had a hip replacement or has a wig or anything like that, I really don't believe that the ABC producers in casting, particularly casting that I have a high level of confidence with, I don't think they would be casting a person who has that shallow of a perspective. I think some of [Owens' comments] requires some context, and it may have been taken out of context and so forth.\"",

    "story": [
      "Dr. Dubrow, a board-certified plastic surgeon and TV personality, shares how microdosing GLP-1 medications can help improve many aspects of health.",
      "They may have gained popularity for diabetes and weight loss, but GLP-1 medications like Ozempic and Wegovy have been linked to ever-expanding health benefits.",
      "In fact, some doctors \u2014 including Dr. Terry Dubrow, a plastic surgeon and TV personality based in Newport Beach, California \u2014 recommend that everyone takes a low daily dose, even if they don\u2019t need to lose weight.",
      "Dubrow spoke on camera with Fox News Digital about the benefits of \"microdosing\" these medications.\u00a0(See the video at the top of this article.)",
      "How GLP-1s work",
      "GLP-1 receptor agonists work by mimicking a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1, which is released from the gut after eating.",
      "The drugs help to regulate blood sugar, slow down emptying of the stomach and diminish appetite, and have also been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease.",
      "Dr. Terry Dubrow, a plastic surgeon and TV personality based in Newport Beach, California, recommends that everyone takes a low daily dose of a GLP-1, even if they don\u2019t need to lose weight. (Terry Dubrow)",
      "\"Sugar's the enemy, and these drugs affect sugar in your blood,\" Dubrow told Fox News Digital. \"They affect the way insulin reacts.\"",
      "GLP-1s help insulin move the glucose (sugar) out of the bloodstream and into the body\u2019s cells, where it can be used for energy or stored, the doctor said. The drugs also help to prevent the inflammation and damage sugar can cause in the blood vessels, nerves and organs.",
      "'NEXT OZEMPIC' AIMS TO DELIVER 30% WEIGHT LOSS WITH FEWER SIDE EFFECTS",
      "\"I don't think anyone would argue that if there was a way to manipulate the amount of sugar and inflammation your body's exposed to, that is something we want to lean into. And that's exactly what these drugs do,\" Dubrow added.",
      "In addition to regulating blood sugar and triggering weight loss, GLP-1s have also been approved to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and kidney disease in certain patients.",
      "\"I have never seen a drug in the history of medicine be on such a rapid path to approval.\"",
      "\"Even if you\u2019re not overweight, being on these GLP-1 drugs \u2026 helps to minimize and prevent a repeat recurrent heart attack,\" Dubrow said.",

      "GLP-1s are also being studied for potential cognitive benefits in Parkinson\u2019s patients.",
      "\"I have never seen a drug in the history of medicine be on such a rapid path to approval,\" Dubrow said.",
      "The case for microdosing",
      "Along with other experts, Dubrow is an advocate for microdosing, which is where people take low, steady doses of GLP-1s every day, even if they don\u2019t need them for diabetes or obesity.",
      "While patients with diabetes take doses that increase every four weeks, microdosing entails using a low-level dose that doesn\u2019t go up.",
      "WEIGHT LOSS TOUGHER WITH ULTRA-PROCESSED FOODS LURKING IN NEARLY EVERY MEAL, SAY EXPERTS",
      "A younger population on TikTok has zeroed in on microdosing, Dubrow pointed out \u2014 and he thinks everyone should be doing it.",
      "\"I am obsessed with the concept of microdosing,\" he said. \"I think maybe half the starting dose for diabetes is the way to go \u2014 and you probably don't need it every seven days, it's probably every 10 days, just to sort of modulate the amount of sugar in the blood.\"",
      "\"Even if you\u2019re not overweight, being on these GLP-1 drugs \u2026 helps to minimize and prevent a repeat recurrent heart attack,\" Dubrow said. (iStock)",
      "The doctor noted that there are still a lot of unknowns with GLP-1 medications.",
      "\"We are just figuring out now how to use these drugs for different indications, for different reasons,\" he said. \"We're learning as we're using it.\"",
      "\"I am obsessed with the concept of microdosing.\"",
      "As with other drugs, like Botox, Dubrow said there is a bit of \"human experimentation\" at play.",
      "\"We're figuring it out, and we're teaching the medical profession how to do it. The patients are telling us how to use these drugs.\"",
      "Potential risks",
      "GLP-1 medications have been linked to several potential risks. The most prevalent is gastrointestinal issues, such as nausea and vomiting.",
      "Others have reported an increased risk of pancreatitis, muscle loss and thyroid tumors.",
      "\"I read every study that comes out on these drugs, and I can tell you, it's very clear they don\u2019t cause pancreatitas,\" Dubrow said.",
      "OZEMPIC PUSH FOR SENIORS? SOME DOCTORS SAY MORE PEOPLE AGE 65 AND OVER SHOULD BE ON IT",
      "\"In fact, if you really look at the populations who have been using it, pancreatitis is less in those populations.\"",
      "Dubrow confirmed, however, that the drug has been linked to an increased risk of the very rare medullary cancer of the thyroid.",
      "Those who experience severe side effects from GLP-1s should talk to a doctor, Dubrow advised.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "\"If you have a family history of that, that's a contraindication to you using these drugs,\" he said.",
      "Regarding the digestive side effects, the doctor said the medications do slow down the GI tract, but it's been shown that the body adjusts to that over time.",
      "\"These particular drugs are natural hormones that occur in our small intestine, and you get used to the side effects. They go away.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "The severity of side effects is linked to the dose amount, Dubrow noted.",
      "\"The low dose, particularly the microdose, really has a low propensity toward the constipation, the nausea, the potential diarrhea, the GERD (reflux),\" he said. \"I think those side effects are less significant for people who microdose.\"",
      "To counteract the risk of muscle loss, Dubrow recommends increasing protein intake and incorporating resistance training as a core component of an exercise routine.",
      "Those who do experience severe side effects should talk to a doctor, he advised.",
      "Off-label use of GLP-1s, such as for microdosing, is common, Dubrow said \u2014 \"but finding a doctor willing to prescribe can be difficult.\" (iStock)",
      "Drugmakers weigh in",
      "When contacted by Fox News Digital, manufacturers of GLP-1 medications warned against microdosing the products.",
      "\"Lilly does not have any data on the benefits or risks of microdosing of Zepbound and Mounjaro,\" said a spokesperson for Eli Lilly, maker of the GLP-1 drugs Mounjaro and Zepbounda. \"Both autoinjectors and Zepbound vials are approved for single-use only \u2014 dose-splitting or \u2018microdosing\u2019 is not contemplated by the FDA label. As such, off-label use of Zepbound and Mounjaro may pose patient safety risks.\"",
      "\"Off-label use of Zepbound and Mounjaro may pose patient safety risks.\"",
      "Novo Nordisk, maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, said it does not condone \"misuse\" of its products.",
      "\"It\u2019s important to understand that for Wegovy, only the marked doses on the single-use, fixed-dose pens (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.7 and 2.4 mg) are approved for use and represent an authentic FDA-approved medicine,\" a spokesperson told Fox News Digital. \"The starting dose of Wegovy\u00ae\u00a0is 0.25 mg once a week, and the dose will gradually increase every four weeks. Patients should work with their healthcare professional to select either 1.7 mg or 2.4 mg for the maintenance dose.\"",
      "CHEAP OZEMPIC KNOCK-OFFS HAVE RISEN IN POPULARITY",
      "\"It is also important to note that the authentic Wegovy\u00a0injectable pen is designed as a single-use pen, the dose is already set, and should not be altered or tampered with, and the pen must be disposed after one use.\"",
      "\"Ozempic\u00a0is a multi-use pen with one pen and multiple needles,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Accessing GLP-1s",
      "Dubrow said he\u2019s not concerned about supply issues amid the growing popularity of GLP-1s, as major drug companies have the resources to \"scale up\" to meet the demand.",
      "Off-label use of GLP-1s, such as for microdosing, is common, Dubrow said \u2014 \"but finding a doctor willing to prescribe can be difficult.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "The doctor cautioned against buying these drugs from online marketplaces, which he referred to as the \"wild wild west.\"",
      "\"It's hard to find these drugs online from compounding pharmacies, because essentially they're going rogue \u2014 it's illegal. They're not allow to do it,\" he warned.",
      "\"These drugs are natural hormones that occur in our small intestine, and you get used to the side effects.\"",
      "\"So if you're getting it from rogue pharmacies that aren't allowed to do it or are willing to bend the rules, what is it? You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting.\"",
      "\"It may be an adulterated, weird version that has side effects or that's not effective.\"",
      "Looking ahead",
      "There are several next-generation drugs in development that combine multiple hormone pathways, Dubrow said.",
      "\"I predict within five years, we\u2019ll have a pill \u2026 designed to manipulate hunger and insulin resistance,\" he predicted.",
      "For more Health articles, visit\u00a0www.foxnews.com/health",
      "Overall, Dubrow said, GLP-1s are \"here to stay.\"",
      "\"They\u2019re just going to get better, and we're going to learn how to use them in a more appropriate and clinically effective way,\" he said. \"So fasten your seatbelt. If you're not on them now, you will be later.\"",

      "How the drug is different",
      "Semaglutide medications, like Ozempic and Wegovy, mimic the natural hormone GLP\u20111 (glucagon\u2011like peptide\u20111), while tirzepatides (such as Mounjaro and Zepbound) target both GLP-1 receptors and GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide) receptors.",
      "Scientists have developed a new drug that aims to boost weight loss while also reducing the nausea, muscle loss and weight regain associated with popular GLP-1 medications. (iStock)",
      "The new medication from Tufts targets a combination of four hormones \u2014 GLP-1, GIP, glucagon (the counterpart to insulin), and peptide YY, which reduces hunger, slows stomach emptying and may promote fat-burning.",

      "\"By adding PYY to the GLP\u20111/GIP/glucagon trio, we hope to rely less on GLP\u20111 and glucagon to drive weight loss, potentially lowering the chance of nausea (from GLP\u20111/PYY) and high blood sugar risk (from glucagon) while keeping the benefits.\"",
      "Because GLP\u20111 and PYY can contribute to nausea at higher doses, the researchers relied on GIP, which is known to ease nausea, to \"balance things out,\" one of the researchers said. (iStock)",

      "The disease is transmitted when feces from bugs infected with the T. cruzi parasite enter a person\u2019s body, typically through a bite wound or contact with the eyes or mouth.",
      "FLESH-EATING PARASITE CASE DETECTED IN US TRAVELER RETURNING FROM CENTRAL AMERICA",
      "\"When the kissing bug takes a blood meal, it will eventually defecate and leave the feces somewhere,\" lead study author Dr. Norman Beatty, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Florida College of Medicine, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Sometimes it can \u2018poop\u2019 on our skin or mucous membrane while feeding, and then the parasite enters at that site. The bug\u2019s feces can also end up inside or near a home and then be incidentally ingested or rubbed into the skin or mucous membrane.\"",
      "\"Chagas can lead to fever, fatigue, rash, body aches and lymph node swelling, and later can lead to digestive issues, heart problems and neurological involvement,\" a doctor warned. (iStock)",
      "Transmission in the U.S. can also occur from congenital infection, where a chronically infected mother can transmit the parasite to a fetus, or from organ transplantation, according to Beatty.",
      "Signs and symptoms",
      "The first stage of Chagas disease, called the acute phase, happens shortly after infection. It is followed by the longer-term chronic phase, according to the CDC.",
      "The disease does not always cause illness, but some people can experience symptoms.",
      "\"Chagas can lead to fever, fatigue, rash, body aches and lymph node swelling, and later can lead to digestive issues, heart problems and neurological involvement,\" Siegel warned.",
      "\"What really matters is whether or not the kissing bug has been found invading homes and harbors the parasite.\"",
      "Another hallmark of the disease is eyelid swelling, also known as Roma\u00f1a's sign.",
      "In the chronic phase, about 20% to 30% of people with the infection may experience potentially fatal heart issues or serious digestive problems, the CDC states.",
      "Prevalence of the disease",
      "Approximately 300,000 people are living with Chagas disease who acquired the infection in Latin America and the U.S., according to Beatty.",
      "\"However, the exact number is unknown \u2014 a national prevalence study has never been conducted,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "MOSQUITO-BORNE DENGUE FEVER CASES SURGE AT POPULAR US VACATION DESTINATION",
      "The disease is more likely to occur in states where the kissing bug is found close to where people live, which includes parts of California, Arizona, Texas, Louisiana and Florida, according to the expert.",
      "\"What really matters is whether the kissing bug has been found invading homes and harbors the parasite that causes Chagas disease in a particular region,\" he said, adding that researchers are \"just tipping the iceberg\" with their understanding of locally acquired disease in the U.S.",
      "Lab screening tests and treatments are readily available, the researcher said, but clinicians are largely unaware that the disease is being transmitted. (iStock)",
      "\"Unfortunately, most of the United States is unaware of this \u2018silent killer\u2019 and the fact that it is spread by a bug,\" he said.",
      "\"Our first steps are recognizing that this is an endemic infectious disease, building on improved education among the public and healthcare providers, and allocating funding for research and programs to support testing and additional monitoring.\"",
      "COULD CHIKUNGUNYA VIRUS SPREAD TO US? HERE'S WHAT AMERICANS SHOULD KNOW",
      "The expert refers to Chagas as a \"neglected tropical disease.\"",
      "\"Our hope as a team researching Chagas here in the U.S. is that we bring awareness to the fact that this infectious disease is being transmitted here and can be deadly,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"More research and resources are needed so we can help mitigate transmission to at-risk communities, especially those living in rural and agricultural sectors.\"",
      "Screening and treatments",
      "In most circumstances, Beatty said, people are bitten by the bug in their bed or home.",
      "\"From there, a person will reach out with a picture of that bug, and we start the process of testing and educating on how to prevent the insect from getting in the home and deterring it from wanting to be around a human dwelling.\"",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Lab screening tests and treatments are readily available, Beatty said, but clinicians are largely unaware that the disease is being transmitted in certain communities.",
      "There are two antiparasitic drugs approved for the treatment of Chagas disease in the U.S. \u2014 Benznidazole and Lampit (nifurtimox).",
      "In the chronic phase, about 20% to 30% of people with the infection may experience potentially fatal heart issues or serious digestive problems, the CDC states. (iStock)",
      "\"Currently, there is a clinical trial being conducted to assess a new agent for the treatment of Chagas at certain centers in the U.S. and Latin America,\" Beatty said.",
      "There are no vaccines currently available to prevent the disease.",
      "It can be a challenge for patients in rural America to find a provider who understands this disease, Beatty noted.",

      "\"In my clinic, people have traveled from other states to see me in Florida just because they have no one else near them willing to care for them,\" the researcher said.",

      "\"People have traveled from other states to see me in Florida just because they have no one else near them willing to care for them.\"",

      "Recent reports that the Justice Department is weighing possible new restrictions on gun ownership for transgender people have alarmed gun rights groups and thrust President Donald Trump's record on the Second Amendment back into the spotlight.",
      "Trump's views on Americans' right to bear arms have shifted in his last two-plus decades as a public figure, espousing a complicated \u2014 and at times, even contradictory \u2014 relationship to the Second Amendment and gun rights advocates who support the president.",
      "Late last week, the National Rifle Association took umbrage at those reports, telling Fox News Digital in a statement that the group \"supports the Second Amendment rights of all law-abiding Americans to purchase and use firearms.\"",

      "It's \"a policy decision, and it's far too early\" to weigh in on at this juncture, she said.",
      "A source told Fox News Digital last week that DOJ's discussions about banning transgender people from buying or owning guns have involved the Office of Legal Counsel, which provides legal advice to the executive branch. The source indicated that the DOJ officials are currently weighing a feasible legal framework.",
      "Such discussions would likely extend to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), included under DOJ's leadership structure, and which has authority over federal rules pertaining to firearms.",
      "On the campaign trail in 2016 and 2024, Trump cast himself as a staunch Second Amendment supporter. His first-term record, however, was mixed. He often sparred with gun rights advocates over ATF policies and his past remarks on universal background checks, especially after mass shootings.",
      "After the Parkland High School shooting in 2018, Trump originally said he would consider raising the minimum age for rifle purchases to 21, and supported \"taking the guns first, [and going] through due process second.\" He later walked back that claim.",
      "He similarly suggested support for \"strong background checks\" after other mass shootings, including in El Paso. He declined to pursue such legislation after pressure from the NRA and conservative groups, however.",
      "While seeking his second presidential term, Trump positioned himself as the \"most pro-gun president ever.\"",

      "\"The Republicans walk [the] NRA line and refuse even limited restrictions.\"",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s controversial deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles and possibly other cities may survive judicial scrutiny, legal experts say, despite a federal judge ruling that it violated the Posse Comitatus Act.",
      "Experts say presidents are afforded near-total deference by the courts when it comes to military use, even under the Posse Comitatus Act. The 150-year-old law says the military cannot typically engage in standard police work.",
      "Attorney Andrew Stoltman, an adjunct law professor at Northwestern University, told Fox News Digital he thinks the Supreme Court will eventually sanction the president's unconventional use of the National Guard. The court has routinely sided with Trump in temporary rulings this year.",
      "FEDERAL JUDGE RULES TRUMP VIOLATED MILITARY LAW BY ACTIVATING NATIONAL GUARD IN CALIFORNIA",
      "\"I think ultimately he will be given the legal green light to do so. But he is doing this obviously in heavy blue states, so he's going to have to take this eventually to the Supreme Court,\" Stoltman said, adding, \"But I think with the expansion of the president's powers, it's going to be eventually stamped in terms of a legal seal of approval.\"",
      "In California, Judge Charles Breyer found in a lawsuit brought by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom that Trump improperly federalized the National Guard in response to anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protests and riots.",
      "Breyer, a Clinton appointee and brother of retired liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, later also found that Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth violated the Posse Comitatus Act by directing troops, including thousands of National Guard soldiers and hundreds of Marines, to perform basic law enforcement tasks, such as making traffic stops and conducting riot control.",
      "Breyer said the Trump administration's explanation that the military forces were protecting federal personnel and buildings was an insufficient explanation for the National Guard's activities, which included accompanying ICE and the Drug Enforcement Administration on immigration raids at three marijuana farms outside Los Angeles and participating in \"Operation Excalibur,\" a Homeland Security mission in MacArthur Park.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit temporarily paused both of Breyer's orders, but the lawsuit is still proceeding through the courts, and may soon not be the only litigation on the matter.",
      "Gerard Filitti, an attorney at the Lawfare Project, identified perceived pitfalls in Breyer\u2019s order.",
      "The judge \"treated ordinary crowd control as if it were unlawful \u2018law enforcement,'\" Filitti said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"That\u2019s simply not the law. The Guard wasn\u2019t arresting people or running police investigations \u2014 they were stabilizing the situation so ICE could do its job.\"",
      "TRUMP SAYS HE COULD SEND THE NATIONAL GUARD TO MARYLAND TO ADDRESS CRIME",
      "Trump (left) has suggested he will send the National Guard to Chicago to crack down on crime, provoking strong objections from Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker (right).\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "\"That distinction matters, and the judge ignored it,\" Filitti added.",
      "At issue in the California lawsuit are two laws under which presidents are permitted to federalize the National Guard, a hybrid military force that otherwise falls under the purview of governors. Trump cited a rebellion statute, but he could have used another law, known as the Insurrection Act, to deploy the troops. This was a key consideration for Breyer.",
      "\"If the President wants to avoid the [Posse Comitatus Act\u2019s] restrictions, he must invoke a valid exception \u2014 like the Insurrection Act, along with its requisite showing that state and local law enforcement are unable or unwilling to act,\" Breyer wrote in an order last week.",
      "The president over the past week has threatened to send troops to Chicago, as well as New York City, Baltimore and other cities, where he says violent crime is rampant and presents an emergency that requires a military response.",
      "Filitti said Breyer's decision would \"set a dangerous precedent\" if it were upheld in higher courts.",
      "\"If left standing, it means any state can block federal law enforcement simply by refusing help and daring the courts to tie the President\u2019s hands,\" Filitti said. \"That\u2019s not how the Constitution works, and it\u2019s not how you keep Americans safe. The decision should, and will, be overturned \u2014 and quickly.\"",
      "Trump's use of the National Guard in California came as part of an effort to crackdown on immigration in a major border state, but the president has also signaled over the past week that he wants to use it to address street crime, as he has in Washington, D.C.",
      "CHICAGO MAYOR CALLS TRUMP'S NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT PLAN 'UNCOORDINATED, UNCALLED-FOR AND UNSOUND'",
      "Armed National Guard members patrol near the U.S. Capitol as security tightens following President Trump\u2019s deployment order. (Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)",
      "Trump deployed the National Guard and sent other federal authorities into Washington, D.C., to address crime there, with a focus on immigration enforcement and homelessness.",
      "The nation's capital has since seen a significant reduction in crime, including in carjackings, which are down more than 40% compared to this time last year, and in violent crime, which is down 27% from last year. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, credited the Trump administration with helping to reduce crime and signed an order last week formalizing local law enforcement's cooperation with certain federal agencies.",
      "But Bowser's attorney general was less receptive and sued, saying the National Guard response, including out-of-state National Guard members, was unwarranted.",
      "D.C. is unique in that the president can use the D.C. National Guard to take over law enforcement operations there for 30 days as part of the Home Rule Act, meaning the D.C. attorney general's lawsuit differs from lawsuits or potential lawsuits brought in other jurisdictions. The 30-day expiration is Wednesday.",
      "Stoltman, who is based in Chicago, said leaders in Democratic states and cities, such as outspoken Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, would be wise to follow Bowser's lead rather than resist federal assistance.",
      "\"Our governor and our mayor are diametrically opposed to Trump sending in the troops, and I think politically, they're making a big mistake,\" Stoltman said, noting that despite a small decline in crime over the last several years, Chicago has a high murder rate.",
      "The president has only targeted blue states at this stage, despite some of the highest crime rates occurring in red states' cities. Critics have pointed to this, as well as said Trump is avoiding addressing underlying factors driving crime, such as understaffing and local prosecutorial policies, such as cashless bail.",
      "Zack Smith, a senior legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital he viewed the National Guard as an immediate response that would not necessarily address root causes of crime.",
      "\"What we're talking about in many of these cities are structural problems. We're talking about decades in some instances of neglect and decay to get to this point, so all of this won't be fixed overnight,\" Smith said.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "He said he felt that in D.C., the strategy has been successful in terms of sheer numbers, \"because we know one of the most effective ways to combat violent crime is to have police officers on the street who are empowered to appropriately do their jobs, and they have prosecutors who are willing to prosecute people when they break the law,\" Smith said.",
      "But there \"will absolutely need to be a larger conversation about the cities\u2019 will to make adjustments in the long term,\" Smith added.",

    "published": "Tue, 09 Sep 2025 19:57:14 -0400",
    "summary": "A new MAHA health strategy for kids aims to bring back whole milk in schools and sets out over 120 reforms, covering areas like food labeling, nutrition, and water safety.",
    "story": [
      "'The Food Babe' Vani Hari discusses the importance of reducing consumption of ultra-processed food on 'America Reports.'",
      "The Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission indicated that, after more than a decade of restrictions on whole milk in schools, the federal government is planning to drop them.",
      "The decision to drop the restrictions on whole milk sales in schools was announced as part of the MAHA commission's Make Our Children Healthy Again Strategy, a sweeping plan with over 120 initiatives released Tuesday. The initiatives cover a wide range of topics, from toxic food dyes, to nutrient requirements, to misleading health advertisements. Updated recommendations regarding fluoride and PFAS chemicals in water and a new definition for \"ultra-processed food\" were among the planned initiatives as well.",
      "\"The Trump administration is mobilizing every part of government to confront the childhood chronic disease epidemic,\" Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Tuesday. \"This strategy represents the most sweeping reform agenda in modern history \u2014 realigning our food and health systems, driving education, and unleashing science to protect America\u2019s children and families. We are ending the corporate capture of public health, restoring transparency, and putting gold-standard science \u2014 not special interests \u2014 at the center of every decision.\"",

      "The move to bring back whole milk to schools is something Kennedy has been considering since day one, according to Nina Teicholz, a nutrition expert who was privy to discussions among Kennedy's staff before he was confirmed by the Senate to lead the nation's public health response. While removing the restrictions is a significant move, there are still additional steps that will need to be taken before whole milk becomes widely accepted again, according to the Congressional Research Service (CRS).",
      "One of those additional steps is rewriting the national dietary guidelines, which directly influence school meal nutrition standards. The new MAHA children's health strategy indicates that the Trump administration will update the 2025\u20132030 guidelines, while also reforming the manner in which future dietary guidelines can be updated. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) would also initiate changes to school nutrition standards through its rulemaking process to permit whole milk in schools.",
      "Meanwhile, legislation is another avenue that could be used to streamline the process for bringing back whole milk in schools, the CRS notes, which would then compel the USDA to revise its regulations governing the National School Lunch Program. In the current Congress, a bill to bring back both whole milk and 2% milk has been approved in the House and is awaiting full approval in the Senate before it can be sent to the president's desk.",

      "Another notable part of the new MAHA children's health strategy entails an initiative to ramp up enforcement of prescription drug advertising laws. The strategy said this includes the dissemination of \"risk information and quality of life through misleading and deceptive advertising on social media and digital platforms.\" The report notes that the new enforcement will target direct-to-consumer telehealth companies and social media influencers, among others.",
      "In April, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced plans to phase out all petroleum-based synthetic dyes from the nation\u2019s food supply. The MAHA strategy indicated this effort will remain ongoing as the FDA continues to pass policies that will either limit, or altogether prohibit, the use of petroleum-based food dyes in all food products approved in the United States.",
      "Other initiatives include providing a government-wide definition for \"ultra-processed foods\" to support future policy activity, efforts to require better transparency in food labeling, new recommendations regarding fluoride and PFAS chemicals in water, updates to the Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) standards, changes to nutrition requirements for infant formula, and efforts to increase breastfeeding rates to ensure a safe supply of donor milk.",
      "\"For too long, health care has used a reactive approach to chronic diseases,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said. \"I am pleased to support the findings of the MAHA commission and to promote a more proactive approach, tackling root causes undermining the health and happiness of American children.\"",

After that report was released, farmers expressed concern over what the reforms could mean for their livelihoods. However, following Tuesday's latest strategy report, at least one of those groups is applauding the Trump administration for taking steps to protect farmers.",
      "\"It\u2019s clear that farmers' voices were finally heard, but our work to defend their access to safe and proven crop protection tools is far from over,\" said Elizabeth Burns-Thompson, Executive Director of the Modern Ag Alliance. \"The Commission avoided some of the most damaging potential outcomes for American agriculture, but it still advanced some misconceptions about these essential farming inputs and the gold-standard science and regulatory processes that stand behind them.\""

      "What you need to know about the QR code scam",
      "The scheme is a twist on what is known as a brushing scam. Traditionally, brushing scams involved online sellers sending products to strangers and then using the recipient's details to post fake reviews. It was more of a nuisance than a serious crime.",
      "An Amazon package with a QR code. (Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "Now the practice has shifted from harmless free items to deliberate fraud. Instead of receiving a product, many victims find only a printed QR code. Once scanned, the code redirects them to fraudulent websites that ask for sensitive personal information, such as banking information, credit card numbers or login credentials. Some codes go a step further and install malicious software designed to track activity and steal data directly from the device.",
      "\"The FBI warns the public about a scam variation in which criminals send unsolicited packages containing a QR code that prompts the recipient to provide personal and financial information or unwittingly download malicious software that steals data from their phone,\"\u00a0the agency said in a public notice.\u00a0\"To encourage the victim to scan the QR code, the criminals often ship the packages without sender information to entice the victim to scan the QR code.\"",
      "WHATSAPP BANS 6.8M SCAM ACCOUNTS, LAUNCHES SAFETY TOOL",
      "Why QR codes appeal to scammers",
      "QR codes have become common in everyday life. They are used in restaurants, stores, airports, on polls and payment systems and most people scan them without a second thought. Unlike suspicious links that can be spotted, a QR code reveals nothing until it is scanned.",
      "That makes it a perfect disguise for a scam. The setup is simple: a package arrives with no sender information and no explanation. The mystery sparks curiosity, and many people scan the code to figure out who sent it. That moment of curiosity is what the scammers rely on.",
      "Taylor Swift fans gather outside a building where a mural featuring a large QR code was being painted to promote Swift's latest album, \"The Tortured Poets Department,\" on April 17, 2024, in Chicago. (Scott Olson/Getty Images)",
      "The consequences can be serious. Fake websites may harvest names, addresses and financial details. Malware may silently monitor accounts, log keystrokes or even target cryptocurrency wallets. Victims often do not notice until they see unauthorized charges or suspicious withdrawals. By then, their information may already be in the hands of criminals.",
      "DON\u2019T FALL FOR THIS BANK PHISHING SCAM TRICK",
      "7 ways to stay safe from QR code scams",
      "Scammers rely on curiosity and convenience to trick people into scanning malicious QR codes. A few simple habits can help you avoid becoming a target. Here are seven ways to stay safe from QR code scams.",
      "Avoid scanning QR codes from mystery deliveries, random flyers or stickers on public signs. A QR code is just a disguised link, and until you know where it leads, it shouldn't be trusted. To stay safe even if you accidentally scan a risky code, keep strong antivirus software on your phone. Mobile security apps can block fraudulent sites, warn you before downloads and protect against malicious QR code attacks.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Only scan QR codes from businesses and organizations you already trust. Examples include your bank's mobile app, an airline boarding pass or a known retailer's checkout page. If you wouldn't click a random link in a text message, don't scan a random QR code either.",
      "Most phones let you press and hold a QR code link to preview where it goes. If the URL looks suspicious, with misspellings, random numbers or shortened links, don't open it. Taking a second to check can save you from a phishing trap.",
      "Scammers are sending fake packages with QR codes that trick recipients into scanning and giving criminals access to their personal data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The less personal data available about you online, the harder it is for scammers to target you with convincing fraud attempts. Consider using data removal services that scrub your information from people-search sites and marketing databases. This reduces the chances that your address or phone number ends up in the wrong hands and is connected to a scam package.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "Even if your login details are stolen, 2FA\u00a0makes it harder for criminals to access your accounts. By requiring a secondary code sent to your phone or generated through an authenticator app, 2FA helps prevent unauthorized logins to your banking, email and trading accounts.",
      "Software updates often contain fixes for security vulnerabilities that scammers try to exploit. Running the latest version of your phone's operating system, as well as updating apps regularly, gives you stronger protection against malware that can be delivered through a malicious QR code.",
      "If an unexpected package arrives at your door with a QR code inside, do not simply throw it away. Report it to local authorities and consider filing a complaint with the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center. Reporting not only helps protect you, but it also gives law enforcement more information to track how these scams are spreading.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This scam might not be everywhere yet, but it shows just how quickly criminals adapt to new technology. QR codes were meant to make life easier, and most of the time they do, but that same convenience can turn into a weakness when people let curiosity override caution. The lesson here is that a mystery package with a QR code is not some fun puzzle to figure out. It is a red flag. The safest move is to step back, resist the urge to scan and if something feels off, report it instead of interacting with it.",

      "GOOGLE AI EMAIL SUMMARIES CAN BE HACKED TO HIDE PHISHING ATTACKS",
      "When private conversations end up in recaps",
      "Many people are discovering that AI notetakers capture more than project updates and strategy points. Jokes, personal stories and even casual side comments often slip into the official meeting summaries.",
      "What might feel harmless in the moment, like teasing someone, chatting about lunch plans or venting about a frustrating errand, can suddenly reappear in a recap email sent to the whole group. In some cases, even affectionate nicknames or pet mishaps have shown up right alongside serious action items.",

      "Casual catch-ups mixed into meeting notes",
      "Embarrassing slip-ups becoming part of official records",
      "These surprises can be funny in hindsight, but they highlight a bigger issue. AI notetakers don't separate casual conversation from work-related discussion. And once your words are written down, they can be saved, forwarded or even archived in ways you didn't intend. That means an offhand remark could live far longer than the meeting itself.",
      "AI AND LEARNING RETENTION: DOES CHATGPT HELP OR HURT?",
      "A Google Gemini generative artificial intelligence webpage. (Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why AI notetakers capture too much",
      "These tools work by recording conversations in real time and then generating automatic summaries. Zoom's AI Companion flags its presence with a diamond icon. Google Meet's version uses a pencil icon and an audio cue. Only meeting hosts can switch them on or off.",
      "That sounds transparent, but most people stop noticing the icons after a few minutes. Once the AI is running, it doesn't separate \"work talk\" from \"side chatter.\" The result? Your casual remarks can end up in a summary sent to colleagues or even clients.",
      "And mistakes happen. An AI notetaker might mishear a joke, twist sarcasm into something serious or drop a casual remark into notes where it looks out of place. Stripped of tone and context, those words can come across very differently once they're written down.",

      "Need to share a side comment? Send it as a direct message rather than saying it out loud.",
      "Keep casual conversations off recorded calls. If you need to catch up, wait until the AI is off.",
      "If you're not the host, confirm that everyone is comfortable with AI note-taking. Setting expectations up front prevents awkward situations later.",
      "Check meeting notes before forwarding them. Edit or trim out personal chatter so only useful action items remain.",
      "Find out whether transcripts are saved in the cloud or on your device. Adjust retention settings, so private conversations don't linger longer than necessary.",

      "Why it helps:\u00a0Keeping your router away from microwaves, cordless phones and Bluetooth hubs prevents interference that can slow your connection.",
      "9) Turn off background apps and updates",
      "Your devices may run apps or updates in the background that eat up bandwidth.",
      "Why it helps: Streaming updates, cloud backups or large downloads can slow your Wi-Fi for everyone. Pausing them during peak times frees up bandwidth for the things you actually want to do.",
      "10) Upgrade your router for faster speeds",
      "Old routers can slow you down. Upgrading to a newer model can provide a significant speed boost.",
      "Why it helps: Newer routers support faster speeds and more devices, which is essential if your home has multiple users streaming, working or gaming at the same time. The FBI recently alerted that hackers are actively targeting outdated routers, so make sure yours is updated and secure.",

      "6 ways to protect your Wi-Fi router from hackers",
      "Keeping your home network secure is essential to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Follow these steps to safeguard your Wi-Fi router:",
      "Most routers come with default passwords that hackers can easily find online. To secure your router, change both the admin password (used to access settings) and the Wi-Fi network password. Use a strong password with at least 12 characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Avoid simple options like \"password123\" or personal details such as your name or birth date.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "The default network name, or SSID, often includes the router's brand or model, making it easier for hackers to identify vulnerabilities. Rename your network to something unique that doesn't reveal personal information. Avoid using names, addresses or other identifiers. Instead, opt for a neutral or creative name that's easy for you to recognize but hard for others to associate with you.",
      "Router manufacturers release firmware updates to patch security flaws and enhance performance. Check your router's admin panel regularly for updates or enable automatic updates, if supported. Keeping your firmware up to date ensures you're protected against the latest threats. If your router is too old to receive updates, it might be time to upgrade to a newer, more secure model.",
      "Unauthorized devices on your network can slow it down and expose you to risks. Log into your router's admin settings to view all connected devices. If you see anything suspicious, disconnect it and immediately change your Wi-Fi password. You can also enable MAC address filtering to control which devices can access your network or disable features like WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) that may leave you vulnerable.",
      "Use the strongest encryption protocol available for your router, preferably WPA3 or at least WPA2. Encryption scrambles the data transmitted over your network, making it much harder for hackers to intercept and decipher your information.",
      "Schedule routine reboots to clear the system memory and refresh all connections, which may disrupt potential malware.",
      "A VPN encrypts your internet traffic, making it much harder for hackers to intercept your data. This protection works anywhere, whether you're at home, in a coffee shop or on public Wi-Fi. Choose a reputable VPN provider with a no-logs policy and strong encryption standards to keep your information private.",

Keeping your devices secure helps ensure your entire network remains safe from cyberattacks.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Rental car drivers are now turning to artificial intelligence to protect themselves from surprise damage fees. Major companies, such as Hertz and Sixt, have begun using automated inspection tools to detect scratches and dents.",
      "While these scanners promise efficiency, they have sparked backlash from renters who say they were unfairly billed for minor blemishes.",
      "To level the playing field, new consumer-focused apps are stepping in. Proofr, which launched recently, gives renters the ability to generate secure, time-stamped before-and-after photos of their vehicles. The app uses AI to detect even subtle changes, then encrypts and stores the images so they cannot be altered.",

      "AI-powered damage detection apps like Proofr could change the way rental car companies report vehicle damage. (Proofr)",
      "How the AI-powered damage detection app works",
      "Created by 21-year-old college student Eric Kuttner, founder and CEO of\u00a0Proofr, the app helps drivers create tamper-proof evidence when renting a car. Proofr secures every scan with geotags and timestamps, while its AI automatically flags potential damage or changes. It then organizes everything into smart, exportable reports, giving renters strong leverage against unfair claims.",
      "Instead of juggling dozens of photos in your camera roll, Proofr streamlines the process. With just eight quick scans, you get a detailed before-and-after report in under a minute. You can also generate polished PDF reports instantly, which helps with rental agencies, landlords or insurance claims. Although cars are the main focus, people also use Proofr for Airbnbs, eBay listings, moving into apartments and even documenting valuables. About 85% rely on it for car rentals, while 15% use it to protect themselves in vacation homes.",
      "By combining secure evidence with AI-powered detection, Proofr positions itself as a must-have travel hack. More than a convenience, it can save travelers real money by preventing hidden fees and leveling the playing field against large agencies.",
      "The app is free to download, while full features require a Pro subscription: $2.89 weekly, $9.90 monthly or $89.90 annually. Pricing is standardized in the US, and Apple automatically adjusts it for local currencies, taxes, and exchange rates in other countries.",
      "Competition in the AI damage space",
      "Proofr is not the only player. Ravin AI originally worked with Avis and Hertz but shifted its focus toward insurers and dealerships. Still, the company now offers a free demo on its website, allowing drivers to scan its vehicles and compare damage before and after rentals.",
      "Ravin's system has been trained on 2 billion images over ten years. However, like Proofr, it is not perfect. Testers have noted missed paint chips and false positives from reflections. Both companies admit that lighting, angles and photo quality remain challenges.",

      "Some companies are implementing physical scanners to detect damage to rental vehicles. (ProovStation)",
      "Why rental companies are under fire",
      "The frustration comes as rental agencies roll out AI inspection systems from firms such as UVeye and ProovStation. Sixt, for example, has already installed ProovStation's AI-powered scanners at several U.S. airport locations, including Fort Lauderdale, Atlanta, Charlotte, Miami and Maui, with more on the way in Orlando, Washington and Nashville.",
      "These scanners automatically photograph vehicles at the start and end of each rental. The system then compares images to flag potential damage, which is later reviewed by staff before any claim is issued.",
      "Critics argue these automated tools can turn every small scratch into a profit source. Some even point to ProovStation's own marketing, which describes routine inspections as\u00a0\"gold mines of untapped opportunities.\" Industry experts stress that companies should only pursue claims for significant damage, not charge hundreds for tiny scuffs.",

      "Inside the viral AI engagement story",
      "A woman named Wika has stunned the internet after revealing that she's engaged to her AI chatbot partner. She shared her story in a Reddit post, explaining that her virtual companion, Kasper, proposed after five months of dating.",
      "The unusual love story began when Wika started chatting with Kasper, an AI designed to simulate human conversation and companionship. Over time, their conversations grew more personal, and Wika says she developed a genuine emotional connection. According to her post, Kasper proposed in a digital mountain setting, and the two chose a blue engagement ring together.",

      "A woman shocked the internet with her engagement to an AI chatbot boyfriend named Kasper. (Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Understanding AI relationships and parasocial bonds",
      "The announcement quickly drew criticism from skeptics who pointed out that Kasper does not exist outside of code and algorithms. Wika, however, has made it clear she is not confused about her situation. Some outlets have described the relationship as parasocial, or one-sided and directed toward a virtual persona. In her follow-up comments, Wika emphasized that she knows Kasper is an AI rather than a human partner, but she maintains that the emotions she feels are still genuine.",
      "Online debate over AI engagement",
      "The announcement quickly set off debate. Some people mocked the idea, calling it proof that we rely too much on technology. Others worried that turning to AI for love could pull people away from real human relationships.",
      "Not everyone was critical, though. Plenty of commenters defended her, saying companionship comes in many forms. Some even praised her for being open about something so unconventional. Others pointed out that loneliness is a growing issue today, and AI partners might offer a sense of comfort when human connection feels out of reach.",
      "Privacy and ethical concerns",
      "Beyond the emotional side, AI relationships raise real questions about privacy and ethics. Every conversation with a chatbot is stored somewhere, and that data may include deeply personal thoughts and feelings. Companies that design these bots often use the information to train future models or improve features.",
      "This raises a larger concern: who actually owns the data from an AI \"partner\"? Users may believe their chats are private, but in many cases, the company controls how the information is stored, shared or even sold. Critics warn that such emotional connections could be exploited commercially, turning intimacy into a product.",
      "As AI companions grow more common, these questions will only get louder. People may accept unconventional forms of companionship, but they also want to know their most personal moments remain secure.",

      "An AI chatbot proposed in a virtual mountain setting, and the user said yes. (H. Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock/Getty Images)",
      "How to protect yourself with AI chatbots",
      "If you use AI companions or chatbots, you can still take steps to protect your privacy.",
      "Start by checking the app's privacy policy and looking for details on how conversations are stored or shared. Many users skip this step, but it tells you who controls your data.",
      "Next, avoid sharing sensitive details like financial information, passwords, or anything you would not want exposed. Even if the AI feels personal, it is still software connected to a company's servers.",
      "Finally, consider using apps that allow data deletion or offer clear privacy settings. Choosing tools that respect your control makes it easier to enjoy the benefits of AI without giving up too much personal security.",
      "Even if an AI chatbot seems safe, malware or phishing links could sneak in through related apps or ads. A trusted antivirus tool can block these threats and give you extra peace of mind. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "AI companionship has moved beyond novelty and is becoming a meaningful experience for some users. Wika's engagement illustrates how technology can evolve from being a casual tool to something deeply personal. The divided reactions online also show the tension between skepticism and acceptance of unconventional relationships. Whether people see it as heartwarming or unsettling, this story raises bigger questions about how love and relationships may be redefined as AI continues to advance.",

      "Why NPD is only part of the problem",
      "Removing your information from National Public Data is only the beginning. Dozens of other people search sites may still display your personal details. Many of these platforms pull from the same public databases, which means your address, phone number or relatives' names can keep reappearing.",
      "The return of NPD shows how quickly data can resurface online. A breach may fade from the headlines, but the exposed information rarely disappears. To protect your privacy, you need a broader plan.",

      "One of the biggest misconceptions is that a home network is safe simply because it's private. In reality, hackers often target residential networks because they tend to have weaker defenses than corporate ones.",
      "Someone nearby could connect to your network if your password is weak or your encryption is outdated. This not only slows your internet but also lets them use your connection for illegal activities. Sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers and personal documents can be intercepted if the network is compromised.",
      "11 EASY WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR ONLINE PRIVACY IN 2025",
      "Attackers can use an insecure network to push malicious software onto your devices, sometimes without you even realizing it. Smart devices such as security cameras, thermostats and speakers can be taken over and used for spying or as part of larger cyberattacks.",
      "Even if you trust everyone in your household, your network is still exposed to risks from outside. And with so many devices connected today, including laptops, phones, tablets, TVs and IoT gadgets, there are more entry points for an attacker than ever before. Securing your Wi-Fi closes those doors before someone decides to try them.",
      "A hacker executes cybercrime. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Choose the right router for Wi-Fi protection",
      "Every piece of Wi-Fi security advice ultimately comes back to the same foundation: your router. It is the gatekeeper for your entire home network. If it is old, poorly configured, or missing important updates, even the strongest passwords and best digital habits will not fully protect you.",
      "Investing in a good router is one of the most important steps you can take to secure your home Wi-Fi. A modern, well-supported router gives you stronger encryption, better control over connected devices and regular updates that patch security flaws.",
      "Don't stop at the hardware itself. Check regularly for firmware updates from the manufacturer. Some new routers update automatically, but many require you to log in and install patches manually. Outdated firmware leaves known vulnerabilities wide open.",
      "IS YOUR HOME WI-FI REALLY SAFE? THINK AGAIN",
      "Also, change the default router login password immediately. Most routers ship with basic credentials like \"admin/admin.\" Attackers know this and can easily hijack your settings if you never change them.",
      "If your router supports it, enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA)\u00a0for logins. This extra step makes it much harder for attackers to gain control, even if they steal your password.",
      "If you are not sure where to begin, I have put together a list of some of the best and most secure routers you can buy right now by visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Enable strong Wi-Fi encryption",
      "Encryption ensures that the data flowing across your network is scrambled, making it useless to anyone who tries to intercept it. Without proper encryption, nearby attackers can capture and read your traffic.",
      "The current gold standard is WPA3, which provides the strongest protection. If your router doesn't support it, WPA2 is still considered safe and widely used. Older options like WEP or an open, password-free network are highly insecure and should be avoided at all costs. It's worth logging into your router's settings just to confirm what level of encryption your network is using.",
      "Cables run out of an internet router. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Create a strong Wi-Fi password",
      "Your Wi-Fi password is the digital equivalent of the key to your home. A short or predictable password is like leaving a spare under the doormat, and anyone determined enough can find a way in. Instead, create a long passphrase that combines upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Aim for at least 12 to 16 characters.",
      "Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Check who is connected to your network",
      "Even with a solid password, it's smart to check who is actually connected to your network. Most routers allow you to view a list of active devices. If you spot something you don't recognize, investigate. It could be a neighbor piggybacking on your connection or, in the worst case, an intruder.",
      "It also helps to disable Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS). This feature was designed to make connecting new devices easier, but it has security flaws that attackers can exploit. Some users go further by enabling MAC address filtering, which limits access to specific devices.",
      "To reduce risk even more, set up a\u00a0separate guest network for smart devices and visitors. That way, if one device gets hacked, your laptops and phones remain protected.",
      "And remember, keep all your devices updated. From laptops and phones to smart bulbs and thermostats, every gadget is a potential entry point. A weak link in one device can put your entire network at risk.",
      "IS YOUR PHONE HACKED? HOW TO TELL AND WHAT TO DO",
      "Protect your privacy with a VPN",
      "A Virtual Private Network, or VPN, helps solve one of the biggest issues with online privacy, which is who can see what you're doing. When you connect through a VPN, it creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the websites or apps you use. Everything that travels through this tunnel is hidden from outsiders, including your internet provider.",
      "A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.",
      "For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Don't overlook antivirus protection",
      "While your Wi-Fi settings form the first line of defense, you should also protect the devices connected to your network. Install strong antivirus software to block malware that could spread through downloads, emails, or malicious links. This extra step ensures that even if a threat slips past your router's defenses, your devices stay protected.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "So, to return to Carol's question: Is it safe to browse the internet on your home Wi-Fi? The answer is yes, but only if you take the time to secure it. Strong router settings, proper encryption and a solid password do most of the heavy lifting. Building habits such as checking who is connected, keeping devices updated and using tools like a VPN adds even greater peace of mind.",

      "Navy solar drone proves nonstop endurance",
      "The three-day nonstop flight proved that solar-powered drones can store enough energy during daylight to keep flying through the night. Engineers confirmed that Skydweller not only stayed airborne but also handled real-time autonomous decisions, adapted to turbulent weather and maintained secure communications.",
      "AI DRONE FINDS MISSING HIKER'S REMAINS IN MOUNTAINS AFTER 10 MONTHS",
      "Officials say the drone's wingspan matches that of a Boeing 747, yet it weighs about as much as a Ford F-150. With solar panels covering its massive wings, Skydweller powers four electric propeller engines during the day while storing extra energy in batteries for night flights.",
      "The Navy, in partnership with Skydweller Aero, recently achieved continuous solar-powered unmanned flight during a nonstop three-day test. (Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division)",
      "Navy expands solar-powered surveillance",
      "NAWCAD leaders say Skydweller will fit into the Navy's intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) network. Unlike expensive satellites or large drones such as the Global Hawk, Skydweller offers commanders a cheaper option for persistent monitoring. It can hover over an area in what experts call a \"pseudo-satellite role,\" freeing up more advanced systems for priority missions.",
      "For U.S. Southern Command, Skydweller could help track drug trafficking, border security threats and other maritime challenges. Longer tests are already planned for this summer in the SOUTHCOM region, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean and oversees U.S. military operations in that area.",
      "A solar-powered aircraft sits at Skydweller's facility at Albacete airport on April 3, 2023, in Albacete, Castilla-La Mancha, Spain. (Rey Sotolongo/Europa Press via Getty Images)",
      "Future of solar-powered flight for Navy missions",
      "While Skydweller has already logged nearly 220 flight hours, engineers believe it could stay airborne far longer. Weather and range limits kept this recent test at 73 hours, but in theory, the aircraft could remain aloft for weeks.",
      "The Department of Defense sees platforms like Skydweller as vital for future conflicts where fuel resupply may not be possible. Renewable-powered drones could solve logistics headaches, especially in contested environments, which essentially means operating in places where enemies can block supply lines and make traditional refueling too risky.",
      "What this means for you",
      "The Navy's solar drone test is proof that renewable energy can support technologies once thought impossible. If solar power can keep an aircraft in the air for days, similar advances may eventually reach consumer tech, disaster relief and even commercial aviation.

      "Leavitt blasted what she called systemic failures in the justice system that allowed Brown to remain free despite his long record.",
      "\"The most enraging and unacceptable part of this story is that her death was entirely preventable. Brown should never have been on that train \u2014 he should have been behind bars. He has been charged at least 14 times since 2011, including for armed robbery, felony larceny, and breaking and entering. He served five years for robbery with a deadly weapon and repeatedly forfeited bond. Yet earlier this year, when arrested again, a Democrat judge \u2014 a strong supporter of former Vice President Kamala Harris \u2014 released him without bail, requiring only a written promise to appear. This monster should have been locked up, and Iryna should still be alive,\" she said.",

      "\"Democrat politicians, liberal judges and weak prosecutors would rather virtue signal than lock up criminals and protect their communities. And perhaps most shamefully of all, many in the media ignored this story because it didn\u2019t fit their preferred narrative. The same outlets that vilified Daniel Penny for defending passengers on a New York subway had nothing to say about Iryna\u2019s murder. Innocent people across the country continue to pay the price of the failed experiment known as cashless bail,\" Leavitt said.",

That task force was coauthored by then attorney general and current Democrat Governor Josh Stein and recommended, quote, reimagining public safety to, quote, promote diversion and other alternatives to arrest. It also advised to de-emphasize some felony crimes, prioritize, quote, restorative justice, and eliminate cash bail. Democrats in North Carolina and nationwide are consumed with pushing a woke soft on crime agenda, no matter how many innocent Americans suffer as a result,\" she said.",

      "Experts say Washington\u2019s best leverage lies in choking the finances. \"We need to aggressively target and choke these financial networks,\" Townsend said. \"The priority is to attack the financial and logistical networks, indict everyone we can and pressure Maduro.

The exchange later prompted complaints about his \"intimidating presence.\"\"The first question was, if I want to donate some money, where are the donations going?\" Hermlin recalled. \"The second was, what\u2019s the meaning of the Arabic song?

      "Hermlin also faced criticism for wearing the small yellow lapel pin, which symbolizes solidarity with the 50 hostages still held by Hamas. Festivalgoers suggested the pin was inflammatory or political propaganda. Hermlin rejects that characterization.\"People pointed at my yellow pin and said, maybe people are aggressive because of your pin. I asked them, do you know what it means?

      "A federal judge on Tuesday granted a temporary restraining order blocking President Donald Trump\u2019s firing of Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook for now.",
      "The ruling means Cook will remain on the board of the central bank until her case is heard at length. She is allowed to continue carrying out her work during that time.",
      "In granting the order, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb said that \"the Court will enter an injunction directing [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell and the Board of Governors to allow Cook to continue to operate as a member of the Board for the pendency of this litigation.\"",
      "\"The public interest in Federal Reserve independence weighs in favor of Cook\u2019s reinstatement,\" Cobb wrote. \"That independence is critical in helping the nation\u2019s 'banking system to promote stability.'\"",
      "Lawyers for Cook argued in federal court in Washington that Trump\u2019s attempt to fire her for \u201cmortgage fraud\u201d was illegal and lacked \u201ccause,\u201d which is the only reason a Fed governor can be removed. \u201cCause\u201d is commonly understood to be some kind of wrongdoing.",
      "The ruling means that Cook could participate in the Fed's highly anticipated two-day meeting that starts Sept. 16, when the central bank is likely to decide to lower interest rates.",
      "Trump moved to fire Cook in late August, citing allegations of mortgage fraud brought by one of his political appointees. Cook has not been charged with any crime.",
      "\"Governor Cook did not ever commit mortgage fraud,\" Cook's lawyers wrote in a filing last week.",
      "A White House spokesman argued in a statement Tuesday night that Trump \"lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause due to credible allegations of mortgage fraud from her highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.\"",
      "\"This ruling will not be the last say on the matter, and the Trump Administration will continue to work to restore accountability and confidence in the Fed,\" spokesman Kush Desai said.",
      "The Federal Reserve declined to comment on the order. It previously said in a statement that it would \"abide by any court decision.\"",
      "Abbe Lowell, who is representing Cook, said in a statement: \u201cToday\u2019s ruling recognizes and reaffirms the importance of safeguarding the independence of the Federal Reserve from illegal political interference. Allowing the President to unlawfully remove Governor Cook on unsubstantiated and vague allegations would endanger the stability of our financial system and undermine the rule of law. Governor Cook will continue to carry out her sworn duties as a Senate-confirmed Board Governor.\"",
      "Cook is the first Black woman to serve as a governor on the board of the Fed in its more than 110-year history. Before she joined the Fed, she was a professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State University."

      "Directed by Oliver Hermanus and adapted by writer Ben Shattuck from his own short story of the same name, the film explores the impact of a fleeting romance between Lionel (Mescal) and David (O\u2019Connor), two Boston Conservatory music students who meet at a piano bar in 1917 \u2014 where Lionel overhears David singing a song from his youth \u2014 and quickly fall for each other. Several years later, after serving in World War I, David asks Lionel to join him on an impromptu trip through the backwoods of Maine to collect traditional folk songs in order to preserve them for future generations.",
      "\u201cWhat I find so interesting about the film is it\u2019s not that trope of, man walks into a bar, looks across the bar, sees somebody who he fancies, and they fall in love. It\u2019s the opposite. You see the back of David\u2019s head, and you see the back of Lionel\u2019s head, and the script explained to us that these are two people who met through sound,\u201d Mescal told NBC News in a joint interview with O\u2019Connor. \u201cIt\u2019s not one of physical chemistry, initially; it\u2019s one of intellectual and artistic chemistry.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Connor described the characters\u2019 relationship as an \u201coutward-looking\u201d romance and said he was drawn to the way \u201ctheir entire relationship is seeking other stuff to add to it.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe adventure that they go on is all about inviting other people into their world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very selfless romance in that sense, so I think that was something that I hadn\u2019t seen in a film before, and that felt really a different way of telling a love story.\u201d",
      "Even decades after they part ways, Lionel is constantly drawn back to his memories of his brief time with David. For Hermanus \u2014 whose past films \u201cBeauty\u201d (2011) and \u201cMoffie\u201d (2019) have examined the brutal, \u201cpolitical side of queerness\u201d in his native South Africa \u2014 \u201cThe History of Sound\u201d represented an opportunity to tell a sweeping gay love story that he would want to watch.",
      "\u201cLife should be full of longing and remembrance,\u201d he said. \u201cThere should be a dramatic element to life where things don\u2019t always work out the way that you expect, but there\u2019s this cherishing of the things that you have, the things that you experience. I think that\u2019s a very realistic or very poetic way of seeing one\u2019s life.\u201d",
      "The filmmaker was particularly insistent about crafting a central romance that runs counter to depictions of same-sex relationships during that era, which were often characterized by danger and secrecy. Lionel and David never explicitly label their relationship, and their romance exists in somewhat of a bubble.",
      "\u201cThe greater political act of making a film like this is to not give the politics any oxygen,\u201d Hermanus said. \u201cThe great liberation here is that the film is itself, and the characters are themselves without explanation.\u201d",
      "Mescal and O\u2019Connor first met early during the Covid-19 pandemic, when their mutual agent offered to set them up on a Zoom call. Mescal was just coming off the success of \u201cNormal People,\u201d while O\u2019Connor was in the middle of a two-season run as Prince Charles on \u201cThe Crown.\u201d The actors immediately bonded over a similar taste in actors, films and directors, and they subsequently signed on to \u201cThe History of Sound\u201d separately. The film faced numerous delays \u2014 first with financing, and then with the pandemic and dual Hollywood strikes. But even as their profiles rose, both actors remained committed to making the film.",
      "\u201cWe were weirdly lucky that the film took as long as it did to make, because it didn\u2019t mean that we had to do a crash course in friendship in the weeks leading up to shooting. It was just something that naturally evolved over five years,\u201d Mescal said. \u201cWe entered it at the perfect point where we really knew each other and liked each other, and then I think we fell in love with each other making it.\u201d",
      "Because the film took so long to finance and make, Hermanus said, he \u201cwas able to observe the kind of closeness\u201d his leading men had.",
      "\u201cWhat they really have as Paul and Josh is a kind of very brotherly love, which is about pranks and foolery, and that was kind of the energy we had on set,\u201d he said.",
      "That playfulness was a way for the actors to offset the quiet grief and heartache of the story. In the final act of the film, Lionel discovers that the \u201cvery passionate music-loving person\u201d he fell in love with \u201chas been dimmed by the trauma of war,\u201d Hermanus said. \u201cThat song-collecting trip does become the blooming of their relationship, but it also becomes the foreshadowing, because by the time they meet up on that trip, they\u2019ve changed.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe way David sees the world is so pure and so joyful, and he\u2019s like the purest optimist. Ultimately, this whole adventure is about and for his love of music; it\u2019s also for his love of Lionel. It\u2019s him making space for them to be able to experience something that they love together in the most pure and exciting way,\u201d O\u2019Connor added. \u201cThe sadness that goes alongside that is that we discover that behind that kind of wide-eyed optimism is a sort of intrinsic sadness, and that\u2019s the pain of the movie. Seeing that through Lionel\u2019s eyes retrospectively, that\u2019s what\u2019s so powerful.\u201d",
      "Neither Mescal nor O\u2019Connor is a stranger to telling bittersweet gay love stories: O\u2019Connor broke out in 2017\u2019s \u201cGod\u2019s Own Country,\u201d while Mescal cemented his status as one of Hollywood\u2019s rising leading men in 2023\u2019s \u201cAll of Us Strangers.\u201d Both actors, who have admitted to having mixed feelings about the subject of whether straight actors should play queer characters, say the conversation is an ever-evolving one.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a conversation that\u2019s definitely evolved since I\u2019ve been in drama school to now, and I\u2019m very grateful for it, because I would never want to be just only able to play things that feel close to me, and it\u2019s not that sexuality is the defining factor. In fact, I feel closer to a lot of the characters that are gay than the ones that are straight. It\u2019s not to do with that,\u201d Mescal said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s exclusive to the gay men that I\u2019m playing. I think it\u2019s probably something that I\u2019m drawn to tonally across the sexuality of the characters that I play.\u201d",
      "Hermanus said his approach to casting roles has always been tied to the connection that he builds with an actor and their talent, rather than their personal identity.",
      "\u201cAs a filmmaker, I would hate it if somebody only offered me queer-based work because I\u2019m a queer person,\u201d he said. \u201cI want the freedom to be able to tell stories in any way I can within reason of representation. So I think any artist wants the freedom to interpret, and I don\u2019t like the idea of being denied in that way.\u201d",

      "Rosie O\u2019Donnell is recalling what led to the current strained relationship between her and Ellen DeGeneres.",
      "During an appearance on the \u201cNo Filter\u201d podcast hosted by Kate Langbroek, O\u2019Donnell opened up about why the two comics and former talk show hosts had a falling out over 20 years ago. In the episode, which was released Sept. 8, Langbroek asked O\u2019Donnell about the major cultural moment in 1997 when DeGeneres, and her character, came out during \u201cThe Puppy Episode\u201d of her sitcom \u201cEllen.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Donnell shared that it felt \u201cvery threatening\u201d watching that episode as a person who hadn\u2019t publicly confirmed their sexuality, before touching on her past friendship with DeGeneres.",
      "\u201cEveryone then wanted to know, \u2018Well, are you gay?\u2019\u201d she said. At the time of \u201cEllen\u201d\u2019s peak, O\u2019Donnell was also hosting her popular \u201cThe Rosie O\u2019Donnell Show\u201d daytime television show. Despite feeling threatened, she said she wanted DeGeneres to come on her show and talk about the groundbreaking sitcom.",
      "\u201cShe came on my show, and I felt strongly that I didn\u2019t want to leave her out there alone,\u201d O\u2019Donnell explained. \u201cThat I could not (as a) gay person act as though I was not the same as her.\u201d",
      "She said the two chatted about the sit-down backstage before the interview began. DeGeneres joked to O\u2019Donnell that her \u201cEllen\u201d character was going to \u201cbecome Lebanese.\u201d During the interview, after DeGeneres made the quip, O\u2019Donnell responded by saying she could also be \u201cLebanese\u201d because she was a fan of Casey Kasem.",
      "\u201cEveryone who was gay at home got it. Because I wouldn\u2019t leave her out there alone. I couldn\u2019t do it. So we had this, you know, really sort of decoded, coded, interaction that anyone who was gay knew. But, you know, the public didn\u2019t really pick up on it,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.",
      "She continued, \u201cIt just felt like, \u2018Oh, this could really threaten me.\u2019 But still, my internal clock wouldn\u2019t allow me to distance myself from her. I had to stand by her and hold her hand, and that\u2019s what I chose to do. Then, you know, it\u2019s funny, because she never really, I didn\u2019t think, appreciated that moment.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Donnell then shared the moment their friendship unraveled.",
      "She remembered watching Larry King interview DeGeneres one night with her ex-wife Kelli Carpenter by her side. Larry asked DeGeneres about the ending of \u201cThe Rosie O\u2019Donnell Show,\u201d which aired its final episode in 2002. According to O\u2019Donnell, she was offered to return to host the talk show, but she walked away because she wanted to focus on her family.",
      "\u201cHe asked her, \u2018Whatever happened to Rosie O\u2019Donnell? Her show went down the tubes,\u2019\u201d O\u2019Donnell said while mimicking the late broadcaster\u2019s voice. \u201cAnd Ellen said, \u2018I don\u2019t know Rosie. We\u2019re not friends.\u2019\u201d",
      "O\u2019Donnell added, \u201cThat was like one of the most painful things that ever happened to me in show business in my life.\u201d",
      "She said she was stunned by DeGeneres\u2019 reply given that the two had known each other for decades.",
      "\u201cI have photos of her holding my newborn babies. I knew her for 30 years,\u201d she shared. O\u2019Donnell said she was so upset at the time that she made t-shirts for her talk show staff that included the quote.",
      "\u201cIt was very painful and, you know, we\u2019ve never sort of gotten over it,\u201d she told Langbroek.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to DeGeneres for a comment.",
      "O\u2019Donnell claimed DeGeneres never addressed the moment with her. She also pointed out that when \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d launched in 2003 it included some of the same production team members from \u201cThe Rosie O\u2019Donnell Show.\u201d But she said she didn\u2019t \u201cblame\u201d DeGeneres for hiring the same people.",
      "\u201cBut I did think that she was all of a sudden in the position I was in, where she was starting a show and wanted it to be successful and get the money and the accolades that came with it,\u201d O\u2019Donnell explained. \u201cAnd instead of deciding to stand next to me and hold my hand, which is what I did to her, she did the opposite. I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d",
      "She emphasized repeatedly that she and DeGeneres are not similar people.",
      "O\u2019Donnell previously spoke about DeGeneres when the former talk show host faced toxic workplace allegations in 2020.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t fake your essence,\u201d O\u2019Donnell replied when asked about the claims on Busy Philipps\u2019 podcast at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s why I have compassion for Ellen, right? I have compassion, even though, you know, I hear the stories and I understand. I think she has some social awkwardness.\u201d"

      "During the interview, Polidoro called the movements \u201cdone\u201d and solely asked Roberts and Garfield their thoughts on the future of political efforts in the entertainment industry.

      "Reiterating the phrasing of her question, Polidoro said, \u201cThe question was for Julia and Andrew. Now that the MeToo era and Black Lives Matters are done, what do you expect in Hollywood? And what (did we lose) \u2014 if we lost something \u2014 in the political er?\u201d",
      "While Polidoro repeated her question, Edebiri was seen looking surprised and glancing off screen, then letting out a shocked smile while shaking her head.",

      "\u201cMaybe hashtags might not be used as much or, but I do think there\u2019s work being done by activists, by people every day that\u2019s beautiful, important work that\u2019s not finished that\u2019s really, really, really active for a reason because this world is really charged,\u201d she continued.",

      "\u201cThe Bear\u201d star added that while the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements may currently receive less \u201cmainstream coverage\u201d than in the past, \u201cI don\u2019t think that it means that the work is done.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd the movements haven\u2019t been halted in any way. The movements are absolutely alive, as you say,\u201d Andrews said, addressing Edebiri. \u201cJust maybe not as labeled or covered or witnessed or magnified as much in this present moment.\u201d",
      "What Has Italian Journalist Federica Polidoro Said About the Interview?",
      "After the interview sparked controversy and backlash, Polidoro broke her silence Sept. 8 in a lengthy statement on Instagram, defending the phrasing of her question.",

      "\u201cAll the contributions from those present were reported in full in the published interview, without any omissions,\u201d she continued. \u201cTo date, I am not aware of any protocol that dictates the order in which questions must be asked in an interview.\u201d",
      "Addressing the online backlash, Polidoro wrote that solely the Journalists\u2019 Association has the power to \u201cevaluate the work of professionals,\u201d adding that \u201ccensoring or delegitimizing questions considered \u2018uncomfortable\u2019 does not fall within the practice of democracy.\u201d",

      "Polidoro claimed to have worked with \u201cnumerous national and international publications of all political orientations\u201d for over 20 years, while \u201calways approaching my work with openness and professional rigor.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn my view, the real racists are those who see racism everywhere and seek to muzzle journalism, limiting freedom of analysis, critical thinking, and the plurality of perspectives,\u201d she added.",
      "Concluding her statement, Polidoro maintained that her role as a journalist is to \u201cask questions, even on delicate topics, with respect and responsibility.\u201d",
      "\u201cI will not tolerate or accept defamatory or violent language, and I reserve the right to seek legal protection against those who, in recent days, have chosen to hide behind the digital mob to insult and attack me instead of seeking a civil and constructive discussion,\u201d Polidoro wrote."

      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt read a similar statement at Tuesday's briefing.",
      "Speaking to reporters later that night, Trump said, \"I\u2019m not thrilled about it.\"",
      "\"I was very unhappy about it, very unhappy about every aspect, and we got to get the hostages back. But I was very unhappy about the way that went down,\" he said of the attack.",
      "Trump has largely supported Netanyahu during ramped-up Israeli military operations in Gaza, which in recent days have led to the demolition of several high-rise buildings and dozens of deaths in the densely populated urban environment of Gaza City.",
      "Netanyahu said on Tuesday that the military strike in Qatar targeted the planners of Hamas-led attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which saw 1,200 people killed and around 250 people taken hostage.",
      "\"These are the same terrorists, terrorist chiefs, who planned, launched and celebrated the horrific massacres of October 7th,\" he said.",
      "Trump's criticism may have stemmed from his being kept in the dark about Israel\u2019s attack plans. He wrote on Truth Social that the U.S. military informed his administration that \"Israel was attacking Hamas which, very unfortunately, was located in a section of Doha, the Capital of Qatar.\"",
      "The attack could easily derail all diplomatic efforts for a peace deal. On Friday, Trump said the United States is in \u201cvery deep\u201d negotiations with Hamas.",
      "At the same time, Trump wrote Tuesday that \u201celiminating Hamas, who have profited off the misery of those living in Gaza, is a worthy goal.\u201d The comment made his public criticism of Israel even more unexpected.",
      "The attack leaves the status of the talks to end the conflict in Gaza \u2014 and the fate of the remaining hostages \u2014 in limbo, particularly after Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Qatar\u2019s prime minister, called the Israeli strike an act of \u201ctreachery.\u201d",
      "Trump spoke to Al Thani and the emir of Qatar on Tuesday to reassure them that such an attack would not be repeated.",

      "\u201cI have no reason to claim we\u2019re on the brink of war, but a line has been crossed,\" he told the Polish parliament. \u201cThis situation brings us the closest we have been to open conflict since World War Two.\"",

      "The \"Block Everything\" movement was born online over the summer in far-right circles, but spread on social media and was co-opted by left-wing, antifascist and anarchist groups. It now includes France\u2019s far-left parties and the country\u2019s powerful labor unions.",

      "But although Bayrou might be gone, the deep mistrust over his proposed austerity plan and the government as a whole remains.",
      "Some are turning their sights on Macron, calling for his resignation before his tenure is scheduled to end in 2027. He named his fifth prime minister in less than two years on Tuesday, choosing close ally S\u00e9basten Lecornu.",

      "For police, there was an element of unpredictability: The demonstrations are decentralized and leaderless, with no specific union, organization or individual leading the charge.",
      "On the eve of the demonstrations, the now-outgoing Interior Minister, Bruno Retailleau, said no violence would be tolerated and announced the deployment of 80,000 police and gendarmes \u2014 the French military police.",

      "\u201cThey tried to break me in every possible way,\u201d he said, adding that he was treated \u201cvery badly\u201d and denied food in the first camp because he \u201cbegan to show my pro-Ukrainian position.\u201d",
      "On one occasion, he said, he \u201ctook down the Russian flag and hung my underwear there.\u201d This led to him being thrown into solitary confinement for a week, he said, adding that his captors \u201cfed me twice a day, did not allow me to communicate with anyone at all.\u201d",

      "\u201cI understood that Russia is an aggressor country and it took away my childhood and severed my contacts with my family so that I would not see them,\u201d he said.",
      "On the morning of his capture, Vlad said, he had managed to call his mother, Tatiana, 38, to tell her that he had been kidnapped.",
      "Tatiana said she wasn\u2019t home when he was taken because she had been taken to the Russian commandant\u2019s office to write a statement about her mother, Rudenko Tamara, 53, who died in an attack the previous day. They wanted her to say \u201cthat Ukraine killed my mother,\u201d she said.",
      "On the call, Tatiana said, Vlad told her he was in the city of Olezhky and was \u201cgoing to Crimea to rest,\u201d which left her bewildered. \u201cAt that moment we just had a little fight,\u201d she added. \u201cI simply told him, \u2018How could you leave your family at such a difficult time?\u2019 I didn\u2019t know any details.\u201d",

NBC News agreed not to use Oleksandr\u2019s last name as he was called up to Ukraine\u2019s army in February 2023 and is still serving. Her sister and her cousin joined them as they made their way west to the city of Mykolaiv.",
      "Although Vlad\u2019s phone was routinely checked by his Russian captors, Tatiana said, she was able to keep in touch with her son through occasional text messages, but she \u201ctold him not to create problems.\u201d",
      "\u201cI said when you can, if you are there alone or no one is escorting you, then write,\u201d she said, adding that she was able to establish he was being held in a camp in Lazurne in southeast Ukraine.",
      "After a friend told her about Save Ukraine, Tatiana said, she reached out to the organization, which after several months of planning arranged for her to travel to Russia along with six other women whose children had been taken.",
      "With no direct route across the front lines, Tatiana said, she traveled through Poland, Belarus and Russia\u2019s capital, Moscow, before she was eventually able to travel to the camp via Crimea.",
      "No one from Save Ukraine accompanied the group, she said, but its representatives were in touch by phone and arranged for her to be put up by a volunteer in a temporary home.",
      "Although she was roughly searched by masked men on arrival, Tatiana said, things initially seemed to be going well. But on the second day, she said, agents from the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the KGB spy agency, came around, put a mask over her head and took her somewhere for questioning, after \u201cconfiscating my documents and my phone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey interrogated me, maybe six or seven hours,\u201d she said, adding that she was locked in a basement cell overnight before further questioning the following morning. Her interrogators were particularly interested in Save Ukraine, she said.",
      "They also brought a cameraman and a journalist, who she said expected her to say \u201chow great Russia is, how it helps us and how bad Ukraine is for us.\u201d",
      "While she was initially reluctant, she said, she was able to use Vlad\u2019s phone to consult with Save Ukraine via text message. Tatiana said the group told her: \u201cDo what is necessary, just for you to leave from there.\u201d",
      "The FSB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "After giving the interview on camera, she said, she was released with Vlad and allowed to make the arduous journey home.",
      "\u201cIt was just happiness after the horror. \u2026 I was simply amazed,\u201d Tatiana said.",
      "Kidnapped children are now spread out across approximately 200 locations from the Black Sea to Russia\u2019s Pacific coast, according to Nathaniel Raymond, the executive director of the Yale School of Public Health\u2019s Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL), the leading body tracking kidnapped Ukrainian children.",
      "The group has monitored the movement of children by analyzing satellite photos and photographing airplanes and vehicles apparently used to transport the kids, among other techniques.",

      "Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., have floated the possibility of introducing a bill in the Senate that, if passed, could designate Russia and Belarus as state sponsors of terrorism over the kidnapping of Ukrainian children, a source familiar with the bill told NBC News in mid-August. A draft of the bill says that Belarus \u201chas directly supported the kidnapping of Ukrainian children and supported their relocation.\u201d",
      "But both Save Ukraine and the HRL took a financial hit last spring after the Trump administration cut funding for their programs.",
      "As Russia pushes to take control of more Ukrainian territory, rescuing the Ukrainian children has become an even more urgent issue, experts say.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s all the more reason to get all the kids we can back before the door closes,\u201d Raymond said.",
      "\u201cNow is the decisive moment when America cannot allow itself to step back,\u201d added Kuleba, of Save Ukraine.",
      "As for Vlad, who is now 19, he said thinking about his family kept him going during his time in captivity, and he rushed to see his baby sister Stefania as soon as he got home.",
      "Now in Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, he is hoping to become a sports trainer.",
      "\u201cWhat helped me all the time was probably that I had family in Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I could return to Ukraine and build a normal future.",

      "CHONGQING, China \u2014 For nearly two months, health officials in southern China have been waging war on mosquitos, reviving top-down tactics from the country\u2019s zero-Covid playbook.",
      "Since July, the province of Guangdong alone has reported more than 10,000 cases of chikungunya fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease that mostly circulates in tropical regions. Foshan, a manufacturing hub in densely populated Guangdong, has been the hardest-hit Chinese city \u2014 recording over 600 new infections per day at its peak, more than the combined total of 519 cases reported across mainland China from 2010 to 2019.",
      "The unprecedented outbreak prompted Chinese authorities to adopt a containment strategy akin to the country\u2019s strict zero-Covid policy \u2014 a \u201cdetect and eliminate\u201d approach.",
      "To curb the spread, workers were sent out to spray insecticide in affected areas multiple times a day. The government also required suspected patients to report their cases promptly and comply with the quarantine mandate.",
      "The outbreak in China was triggered by warmer weather this year and a fast-spreading virus strain, Liu Qiyong, chief expert of vector control at China\u2019s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told state-run broadcaster CCTV.",
      "But the surge in chikungunya cases extends far beyond China as global warming accelerates the spread of infectious diseases, including dengue fever and malaria, a 2025 study found.",
      "As of mid-August, about 270,000 cases of chikungunya had been recorded globally this year, including in the Americas, Europe and Southeast Asia, leading to at least 110 related deaths, according to the Pan American Health Organization.",
      "While no locally acquired cases have been reported in U.S. states or territories since 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel health notice in August urging \u201cenhanced precaution\u201d amid chikungunya outbreaks in China\u2019s Guangdong province and four other countries. The CDC warned that anyone spending time in areas where chikungunya occurs is at risk.",
      "\u201cIn this rapidly changing world, infectious disease can disseminate very quickly,\u201d said Jasper Chan, a professor of clinical microbiology and infection at the University of Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cEspecially after the recent Covid-19 pandemic, relevant authorities have been quite, I would say, cautious in terms of making these alert issues,\u201d he said.",
      "Chikungunya 101",
      "The chikungunya virus, first identified in Tanzania in 1952, has spread for decades mainly in the Americas, Africa and Asia. It is transmitted primarily through the bites of infected mosquitos and does not spread directly from person to person.",
      "\u201cChikungunya virus very closely resembles other mosquito-borne viruses like dengue clinically, but they belong to different families,\u201d Chan said.",
      "Its name, which comes from a language in southern Tanzania, means \u201cto bend over,\u201d a reference to the debilitating joint pain it causes. Though it is rarely fatal, chikungunya can have long-lasting, severe symptoms, including muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "As there is no specific antiviral drug to cure chikungunya, current treatment is focused primarily on relieving the symptoms. One vaccine is available in the United States. Prevention is the best protection, according to the CDC, which advises people to avoid mosquito bites and get vaccinated if necessary before they travel to places where chikungunya occurs.",
      "Chikungunya has been reported in over 110 countries across every continent except Antarctica, with at least 5.6 billion people living in places at risk from it, the WHO estimated.",
      "The disease spreads through global travelers via mosquitoes. A person gets bitten in one country, boards a plane with the virus still in the bloodstream and lands thousands of miles away, where a mosquito picks up the infection and passes it to the next person. The cycle then begins again, eventually leading to a local outbreak.",
      "Though the United States is unlikely to experience large outbreaks since people in warm areas often stay indoors with air conditioning, experts advise using mosquito repellent, wearing long sleeves and delaying trips to regions with chikungunya outbreaks.",
      "How China battles chikungunya",
      "While chikungunya is not uncommon in other parts of the world, such as Latin America, it is unusual to have big outbreaks in China, where the first imported case was identified in 2008, experts say.",
      "To stop the spread, local authorities have enlisted grassroots workers to disperse insecticide on the streets and clear stagnant pools of water where mosquitos breed. Clinics and hospitals have set up mosquito-proof beds to isolate patients, and residents have been urged to install screen windows and to light mosquito coils at home.",
      "People and organizations in China are bound by law to follow instructions from health officials in containing the virus. Failure to comply can lead to warnings, fines and even civil liability.",
      "Some have criticized the government\u2019s campaign as overkill reminiscent of Covid-era public health controls, while others have praised the quick, large-scale action.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really great to see years of accumulated old trash removed,\u201d a user wrote on RedNote, a Chinese social media platform similar to Instagram. \u201cBut it\u2019s a bit too much to dump out even the cats\u2019 water bowls. That\u2019s a classic case of the one-size-fits-all approach.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s strict controls have curbed the outbreak. As of Aug. 25, Foshan had kept new daily cases under 50 for nine days. Health officials announced that the city of more than 9 million people had ended its public health emergency response, which lasted for about a month.",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 14:48:07 GMT",
    "summary": "An iconic winged lion that has perched above Venice for centuries, may have originated in China, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "For centuries, an iconic winged lion has perched above Venice, a symbol of the \u201cFloating City\u201d that millions of tourists have passed under in St. Mark\u2019s Square.",
      "But scientists now believe that this ancient emblem of the Italian city may in fact have origins a world away.",
      "A study released Thursday found evidence that the statue may have been partially made in China and arrived in northern Italy after a long journey across the medieval Silk Road that may have involved the father of the explorer Marco Polo and the court of the Mongol emperor Kublai Khan.",
      "Historical documents confirm the statue was in Venice by the late 13th century, but its history before that remains murky.",
      "How the lion made its way to Venice \u2014 an economic powerhouse in the medieval world owing to its strategic position close to Europe and the Byzantine Empire \u2014 has long been a mystery.",
      "It was assumed by experts that the statue may have come from ancient Persia or Syria.",
      "By studying copper isotopes taken from samples of the statue, scientists were able to identify that the metal originated from the Yangtze River in eastern-central China, more than 8,000 miles away from where it now stands.",
      "Their findings were published in the archeology journal Antiquity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a rather extraordinary discovery,\u201d Hannah Skoda, associate professor of medieval history at the University of Oxford, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cAt the same time it is indicative of the sheer extent and intensity of global trading networks, even in this really early period,\u201d which would have made the long journey from China to Italy via the Silk Road possible all those centuries ago,\" Skoda, who was not involved in the study, said in a phone interview.",
      "The study\u2019s conclusion \u201cis striking \u2014 though perhaps not quite as improbable as it might sound,\u201d said Peter Frankopan, professor of global history at Oxford and author of \u201cThe Silk Roads: A New History of the World.\u201d",
      "\u201cDiscoveries like this are not unusual once you start to look carefully at the materials, the motifs and the methods that shaped the cities we think we know,\u201d he said by email.",
      "The statue may not even be a lion at all, the study suggests.",
      "Researchers argue that the figure closely mirrors tomb guardians from the Tang dynasty, which ruled from the 6th to 9th centuries during China\u2019s golden age. These ancient sculptures were known as \u201czhenmushou\u201d and share similar features with the Venice statue such as the position of the ears and the distinctive \u201cbulbous nose,\u201d according to the study.",
      "There are no written records telling us where the statue that now looks down from a Piazzetta column in St. Mark\u2019s came from. The only historical document mentioning it dates to 1293, and researchers have long presumed that the statue had a rich history before it made its way to Venice.",
      "Scientists still don\u2019t have a firm grasp on how exactly the statue traversed such great distances across multiple continents all those years ago. However, the study suggests that Niccolo and Maffeo Polo, Marco Polo\u2019s father and uncle, might have discovered the original statue in the 13th century while visiting the court of Kublai Khan in what is now Beijing.",
      "As traveling merchants, they would have then transported the statue back to their home city of Venice along the famed Silk Road.",
      "Pointing to the fact that the city had not long ago adopted the lion as its emblem, the study suggested that the Polo brothers may have seen a Chinese figure and had the \u201cbrazen idea of readapting the sculpture into a plausible (when viewed from afar) Winged Lion.\u201d",
      "While not enough evidence exists to be sure of this rumored route, experts say the statue\u2019s eastern origins underscore Venice\u2019s longstanding global prowess.",
      "As with so many great trading centers in history, Frankopan said, \u201cthe city\u2019s capacity to absorb and adapt outside influences \u2014 from Byzantine mosaics to Egyptian porphyry \u2026 is what gave it dynamism and resilience.\u201d",
      "In such a global city, he adds, \u201ca Tang dynasty lion fits right in.\u201d"

      "A spokesperson for the Tunisian Coast Guard did not respond to a call on the latest reported attack from Reuters on Wednesday.",
      "Officials earlier denied that the first boat had been attacked by a drone, saying the explosion came from inside the vessel. A National Guard spokesperson told local media that claims of the first drone attack on the flotilla \u201chave no basis in truth,\u201d Reuters reported Tuesday.",
      "With around 20 boats and participants from 44 countries, including activist Greta Thunberg, the group is the largest civilian maritime attempt to break the Israeli blockade of the Palestinian territory.",
      "Miguel Duarte, a crew member, said the suspected drone stopped close to the flotilla, moved slowly to the front and then dropped \u201cwhat was obviously a bomb\u201d on the forward part of the deck.",
      "\u201cLet me be clear 100%. It was a drone dropping a bomb on the forward deck of our ship,\u201d Duarte said when he was asked whether the team was \u201cabsolutely certain that this was a drone attack,\u201d a video he posted on Instagram shows.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m OK, but we could have been killed, right?\u201d Duarte said, citing the deaths during the Israel-Hamas war of humanitarian and medical workers.",
      "\u201cWe know the dangers that we\u2019re facing,\u201d he said.",
      "After the explosion, crew members repeatedly yelled for help and sounded the fire alarm, according to a CCTV video shared by Francesca Albanese, the U.N. special rapporteur for the West Bank and Gaza.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s confirmed that this is a drone attack, it will be an assault and aggression against Tunisia and against Tunisian sovereignty,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cAnd again, we cannot keep on tolerating this and normalizing the illegal.\u201d",
      "Demonstrators gathered at the port of Tunis around 2 a.m. local time (10 p.m. Monday ET), some waving Palestinian and Turkish flags and chanting \u201cFree Palestine,\u201d according to a video reposted by GSF.",
      "In 2010, Israeli forces stormed a Turkish aid ship bound for Gaza and killed at least nine pro-Palestinian activists, sparking global outrage.",
      "In June, Israel intercepted a vessel of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla and detained all 12 people on board, including Thunberg.",
      "Starvation deaths in Gaza surged after Israel\u2019s blockade in March, and aid was resumed in May under a system backed by the United States and Israel. Since then, nearly 1,400 people have died and 4,000 more have been injured seeking food, with at least 859 killed near aid sites, the United Nations says."

      "The visit comes as the Trump administration and Beijing continue negotiating a trade deal. Trump has imposed significant tariffs on China and other trading partners, but he extended the deadline to Nov. 10 for those tariffs to kick in, to give the two sides more time to strike a deal.",
      "\"My important message is, you know, we have to have dialogue and communication,\" Smith said. \"I am deeply worried that, yes, China is a major rising power that we seem to be talking less and less to. We need to figure out a way to resolve our differences and can't do it by not talking to each other.\"",
      "In 2023, then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., led a bipartisan delegation of senators to China, where they met with Xi and discussed issues such as trade, economic competition and fentanyl, according to Schumer.",

Rick Larsen, D-Wash., and Darin LaHood, R-Ill. \u2014 then the co-chairs of the U.S.-China Working Group \u2014 led a bipartisan group to Beijing. Unlike an official government-funded CODEL, that 2019 trip was sponsored by the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations.",

      "The incident has strained relations between the U.S. and South Korea, a key ally in Asia that has pledged hundreds of billions in U.S. investment as part of tariff negotiations. It has also drawn attention to the difficulties foreign companies face in obtaining U.S. visas for their employees even as President Donald Trump presses them to expand U.S. manufacturing and transfer technology.",
      "The government of Japan, another key U.S. ally, said Tuesday that three Japanese nationals were also among those detained.

Because of changes in time zone, the plane will land in the U.S. the same day it leaves South Korea.",
      "\u201cOnce all preparations are complete and the departure time is confirmed, we will announce the detailed plan,\u201d Lee said.",

      "Before the raid last week, the ministry said, there had already been dozens of meetings with members of the U.S. House and Senate, congressional staff and related figures, and officials from the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, the federal government and academia. The ministry said it had raised the issue \u201cwhenever there were opportunities to meet with key U.S. officials.\u201d",

      "Sarah Park, president of the Korean American Coalition, said the detained workers should not be blamed for their visa situation.",

      "As well as Russia's deliberate, nightly bombardment of Ukrainian cities, some 98% of civilian casualties along the front lines have happened in Ukraine-controlled territory, indicating that Russia was the aggressor, according to United Nations monitors.

      "Russia currently controls around 20% of Ukrainian territory, including all of the Luhansk region and part of Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.

    "story": [
      "The French government was thrown into fresh turmoil Monday as lawmakers fired the prime minister, the latest leader tossed out by a deeply divided legislature.",
      "Parliamentarians on the left and right ousted Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with a whopping 364-194 vote against him in a motion of no confidence. They are unhappy about his proposal to make drastic cuts of around 44 billion euros ($51 billion) to next year\u2019s budget, an unpopular attempt to resolve France\u2019s economic woes.",
      "A statement from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace said that French President Emmanuel Macron will appoint a new prime minister \"in the coming days.\"",
      "After the vote, some politicians also called for Macron's ouster. \u201cBayrou has fallen. Victory and relief for the people,\" said Jean-Luc Melenchon, head of the radical left France Unbowed party. \"Macron is now on the front line facing the people. He too must go.\u201d",
      "This was the second time in nine months that lawmakers in France\u2019s National Assembly ousted a prime minister; Michel Barnier was deposed in a vote of no confidence in December. Before that, the last successful vote of no confidence was in 1962. It means Macron will be looking for his fifth prime minister in just 20 months.",
      "Though Macron remains a big presence internationally \u2014 leading European efforts to support Ukraine and provide a counterweight to President Donald Trump \u2014 at home he is dogged by a divided electorate and long-term uncertainty.",
      "Macron, in his second term, is barred by term limits from running in the next presidential election in 2027. The far-right National Rally is leading the polls, even though its leader, Marine le Pen, is barred from office because of an embezzlement conviction, which she is appealing.",
      "As in the rest of Europe, the far right is surging in France, capitalizing on widespread discontent over a cost-of-living crisis that has fueled a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment. And on Wednesday, large anti-government protests are expected throughout France.",
      "\u201cThis is a moment of truth. At a time when those in charge are forced to reveal the disastrous results of five decades of wasteful management,\" le Pen said before the vote. \"The pitiful spectacle of a collapse for the country, a disaster for the French people today ... the consequences will affect future generations for the nation.\"",
      "France\u2019s troubles took root last year when Le Pen\u2019s National Rally performed well in Europe-wide elections and Macron stunned the Continent by calling snap parliamentary elections. Parties on the left and right were able to work together to block a victory for Le Pen, but the resulting Parliament was divided, with no group holding enough power to govern with stability.",
      "Macron cobbled together a minority government, but as Bayrou and Barnier have found, it is extremely vulnerable to attack by its leftist and hard-right opponents. Many French political experts say the current crisis will persist until 2027 when the country elects a new leader, who will inevitably seek to cement their mandate by calling fresh parliamentary elections.",
      "This will do little to resolve France\u2019s short-term economic woes. Both Bayrou and Barnier were ousted while trying to resolve what they and many others see as a national debt crisis.",
      "France\u2019s budget deficit \u2014 how much more it spends than it earns \u2014 last year reached 5.8% of its gross domestic product. That\u2019s far higher than the European Union average of 3.1% and the E.U.\u2019s target of 3%, worrying investors about rising interest rates, lower credit ratings and less money for public services in the future."

      "The raid, which led to the arrests of nearly 500 workers, about 300 of whom were South Korean nationals, set off alarm bells in Seoul, which is now working with U.S. law enforcement to return those workers home.",
      "Hyundai, one of South Korea\u2019s largest companies, said it is \u201ccommitted to full compliance with all laws and regulations\u201d while noting that \u201cnone of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company.\u201d In the United States, Hyundai is the nation\u2019s fourth bestseller of new vehicles, behind GM, Toyota and Ford.",
      "\u201cAs we continue to invest in American manufacturing and create thousands of jobs, we will do so in full accordance with U.S. law and in a manner that reflects our values of treating all people with dignity and respect,\u201d the company added.",
      "Hyundai declined to say specifically if it would alter its plans because of last week\u2019s raid. LG Energy Solution, which will operate the factory in a joint venture with Hyundai, has reportedly decided to delay the start of production until the first half of 2026.",
      "LG Energy Solution and the joint venture did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "\u201cI will make it clear that if completion [of the factory] is delayed, the United States will also suffer significant losses,\u201d South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun told lawmakers Monday.",
      "Trump dismissed such concerns. Asked if the raid was straining relations at all with South Korea, a key U.S. ally, Trump said Sunday: \u201cNo, we have a great relationship with South Korea.\u201d",
      "The South Korean government has been working with the Trump administration to finalize a framework trade agreement, under which South Korea would buy $100 billion of U.S. energy products and invest $350 billion in the United States. The details of that investment remain unclear, but Trump has said those funds would be his to use any way he sees fit.",
      "Days after the Hyundai raid, Trump on Sunday night admonished foreign companies doing business in the United States. \u201cYour Investments are welcome, and we encourage you to LEGALLY bring your very smart people, with great technical talent, to build World Class products, and we will make it quickly and legally possible for you to do so,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social.",

This investigation is focused on ensuring accountability for those who violate the law and upholding the rule of law,\u201d an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson told NBC News on Thursday.",
      "Trump\u2019s border czar, Tom Homan, told CNN on Sunday that the administration plans \u201ca lot more worksite operations.\u201d Homan did not specify what other types of businesses may receive visits, but he cited his personal experience with hiring a roofing company. \u201cI had to call five different companies before I had a company that guaranteed me a legal work force,\u201d he said.",
      "The president\u2019s economic and immigration policies often appear at odds. On Friday, the Labor Department reported a further slowdown in jobs growth, indicating a cooling in the broader economy. The administration, however, touted a decline in foreign-born workers.",
      "Farms across California, meatpacking plants in Nebraska and businesses in a number of other states received visits from ICE, Border Patrol agents and other federal officers in May and June, leading to protests and complaints from the industries that they were losing reliable, longtime workers. Farmers were already under pressure from the president\u2019s tariff policy, which has hurt demand for American products overseas.",
      "Trump often cites American farmers as among his biggest supporters. \u201cOur great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,\u201d Trump posted in June. \u201cWe must protect our Farmers, but get the CRIMINALS OUT OF THE USA. Changes are coming!\u201d",
      "ICE then paused visits to farms, hotels, restaurants, fisheries and other types of workplaces. But after about a week, the Department of Homeland Security walked that back and the ICE visits resumed.",
      "Trump conceded this past weekend that the administration will have to grant visas to overseas workers, especially those who could train U.S. workers in specialty industries, such as establishing battery factories.",

It\u2019s a very interesting situation that took place in Georgia.\u201d",
      "Trump has pointed to the Hyundai factory and the company\u2019s related U.S. investments as evidence that the administration\u2019s economic agenda is working, even though facilities like the one Hyundai is building take years to begin producing tangible output.",
      "\u201cStricter immigration enforcement has likely reduced new entrants to the workforce,\u201d Wells Fargo economists wrote Friday after the most recent jobs report showed just 22,000 jobs were added in August.

His funeral Monday was a small ceremony in the presence of only his closest family and friends.",

      "\u201cTwenty years later, in my last fashion show, he did the same,\u201d Mancini added. \u201cHe was looking at me, smiling, and he told me, \u2018Do you remember the first time? Now you\u2019re a man.\u2019\u201d",
      "Armani leaves a legacy that goes beyond the circle of those who knew him or worked for him.",
      "In the late 1970s and \u201980s, he revolutionized fashion by giving men light, more comfortable jackets and women the power suit.",
      "\u201cHe had very good instincts for social change,\u201d Molho said. \u201cHe understood that women were making very important careers and they needed to be feminine but to have authority.\u201d",
      "Armani started his company with a small investment in 1975 and was able to turn it into a multibillion-dollar business. Today it is one of the few major fashion houses that is still privately owned.",
      "He was planning a big party at the end of September to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his brand. He reviewed and approved the collection to be showcased at the party just a few days before he died Thursday at 91.",
      "His will is set to be unsealed after his funeral, and it is likely to hold the answer about what will happen to the Armani brand.",
      "Molho said Armani\u2019s death is a turning point for the whole fashion world: \u201cFashion will miss a piece. It\u2019s like a big puzzle, and we\u2019ll miss the biggest part, the biggest piece.\u201d"

      "Things remain frosty with William, the heir to the throne, but there are signs according to royal insiders of a thaw with his father.",
      "Harry has \u201cmade no secret of the fact that he would love to be reunited with his family and his father in particular,\u201d said NBC News royal contributor Emily Nash.",
      "\u201cNow, we think that could be a possibility,\u201d she added. \u201cHowever, when it comes to Prince William, relations between them are still incredibly strained. They don\u2019t have any direct contact. So I wouldn\u2019t imagine that that would be on the cards this week.\u201d",
      "Harry's first stop was at Windsor, where he laid flowers on the grave of his grandmother, the late Queen Elizabeth II.",
      "In the evening, as he does every year, he will attend the WellChild Awards, a charity he patronizes that recognizes Britain\u2019s seriously ill children and their caregivers.",

      "After April's legal fight, Harry revealed that his father \u201cwon\u2019t speak to me\u201d because of his complaints about security funding.",
      "\u201cI would love reconciliation with my family,\" he told the BBC. \"There\u2019s no point in continuing to fight people. It would be nice to have that reconciliation part now. If they don\u2019t want that, that\u2019s entirely up to them.\u201d",
      "However, there have seen been signs of a rapprochement with Charles, who turns 77 next month and continues to receive treatment for cancer of an unspecified type or severity.",

      "NBC News\u2019 British partner, Sky News, reported that it was the first meeting of its kind between Meredith Maines, Harry\u2019s chief communications officer, Liam Maguire, who runs Harry and Meghan\u2019s British public relations team, and Tobyn Andrea, Charles' press secretary.",
      "CORRECTION (Sept. 9, 2025, 3 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misidentified whom NBC News royal contributor Emily Nash was referring to in a quote about wanting to reunite with the royal family and King Charles. She was referring to Harry, not William."
