      "Miles Mykkanen has come a long way since his musical theater dreams shifted to opera at Juilliard",
      "NEW YORK -- Miles Mykkanen grew up wanting to sing and dance on Broadway, but he was turned down by the musical theater programs he applied to for college. So he had to \u201csettle\u201d for studying opera at the Juilliard School at Lincoln Center.",
      "\u201cAt 18, when your sights are set on 42nd Street and then you\u2019re getting called to 65th Street, it was weirdly a letdown,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBut after a few hours I kind of slapped myself and said \u2018Miles, pull yourself together.\u2019\u201d",
      "That was 16 years ago, and he has since pulled himself together to such an extent that at age 34 he\u2019s just opened the Metropolitan Opera season in a leading role in a new opera, \u201cThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay.\u201d",
      "With a libretto by Gene Scheer and score by Mason Bates, the opera is based on the novel by Michael Chabon. Mykkanen portrays Sammy Clay, a Jewish kid growing up in World War II-era Brooklyn who teams with his cousin, Czech refugee Joe Kavalier, to create a comic strip hero modeled on Superman.",
      "He\u2019ll also be back at the Met in the spring in another modern opera, Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho\u2019s \u201cInnocence.\u201d He plays the Bridegroom, a part he first sang in 2024 when San Francisco Opera gave the work\u2019s U.S. premiere.",
      "Mykkanen had sung at the Met before, mostly attracting little attention in small parts, though his haunting rendition of the Holy Fool in Mussorgsky\u2019s \u201cBoris Godunov\u201d in 2021 drew critical acclaim.",
      "\u201cBut this season is so ideal,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cAll of a sudden my schedule came together, and I thought, my God, where did this all come from.\u201d",
      "When the Met was casting \u201cKavalier & Clay,\u201d it was Michael Heaston, the artistic administrator, who thought of Mykkanen for the role of Sammy.",
      "\u201cI first became acquainted with Miles when he was still a student at Juilliard, and he immediately impressed me,\u201d Heaston said. \u201cHe is a singer who can straddle genres, that rare artist who can sing a heartfelt operatic aria in one moment and then turn on a dime to a classic tune from the American Songbook.",
      "\u201cWhen I looked at Mason\u2019s score and considered the vocal and acting demands alike, it seemed tailor-made for Miles.\u201d",
      "Mary Birnbaum, who taught Mykkanen acting at Juilliard, said she\u2019s not surprised at his sudden rise to prominence.",
      "\u201cHonestly it\u2019s what I thought he would do all along,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very American sound, and it\u2019s appealing and it\u2019s lush. But also he\u2019s bold as an actor \u2026 and he makes material look better for being in it.\u201d",

      "By coincidence, both his roles this season are people who have something to hide. \u201cThey are characters with two huge secrets that are kind of gnawing away at them,\u201d Mykkanen said.",
      "In Sammy\u2019s case, it\u2019s his sexuality and ambivalence about his attraction to actor Perry Bacon.",
      "\u201cAs a gay man myself, it\u2019s been really rewarding for me to be working on this role, thinking back to my coming out process 20 years ago now,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cSammy wants to believe there\u2019s a future for him, but he keeps struggling and wondering if the world will ever get past its prejudice and accept him.\u201d",
      "\u201cInnocence\u201d deals with the lingering effects of a school shooting 10 years later, and as secrets are peeled away, the Bridegroom\u2019s role in the horrific events is gradually exposed.",
      "Mykkanen relishes the very different musical challenges the two roles provide. Saariaho\u2019s score for \u201cInnocence,\u201d he said is composed with a kind of \u201cmathematical\u201d precision. \u201cWhen I first cracked it open, it was overwhelming because of the time signatures, the key signatures. You\u2019re trying to figure out, what was she thinking, how do you put this all together?\u201d",
      "\u201cKavalier & Clay,\u201d written in a style that uses what Bates calls \u201csymphonic electronica,\u201d has been easier to learn. \u201cI almost feel it\u2019s starting to carve a new genre in opera,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cSomething American opera has been trying to find in the last decade or so. \u2026 I don\u2019t want to stay to say it\u2019s musical theater, but at times it\u2019s very colloquial.\u201d",
      "Mykkanen grew up in the remote Ironwood region of Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula, where both his parents were high school band directors. Though he displayed a talent for singing at a young age, it was show music rather than opera that inspired him. When his parents found him a classical voice teacher, \u201cFor me it was a means to an end, to develop my voice so I could sing on the Broadway stage.\u201d",
      "Though his career now takes him all over the U.S. and to Europe, Mykkanen still calls the Ironwood region home. In 2019, he launched an arts festival called Emberlight that has grown into a two-month summer program of live performance, film, art shows and talkbacks with visiting artists. When he\u2019s not on site he handles logistics remotely and also relies heavily on volunteers.",
      "\u201cJust being the person who with a lot of other people behind me brings art to this region which is rural and remote \u2026 It\u2019s been one of the big blessings of my life,\u201d he said.",
      "And when he isn\u2019t performing, he returns. \u201cI have a room in my parents\u2019 basement where I store my stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m between contracts I come back here and stay with my mom and dad. \u2026 I\u2019lll call them from Amsterdam and say \u2018OK, what are we having for dinner next Tuesday when I land.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cKavalier & Clay\u201d runs through Oct. 11. Also starring are baritone Andrzej Filo\u0144czyk as Joe; soprano Lauren Snouffer as his sister, Sarah; soprano Sun-Ly Pierce as Rosa Saks, and baritone Edward Nelson as Perry Bacon. Met music director Yannick N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin conducts the production directed by Bartlett Sher.",

      "Pamela Anderson has embraced a makeup-free lifestyle at 58, attending fashion shows and film premieres with a bare face",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Pamela Anderson has nothing against makeup. It's just that she's been there, done that in her younger years. That's why now, at 58, she's attending fashion shows and film premieres with a blissfully bare face.",
      "It's a look, especially for older women, that serves to plague and perplex. Do we chase youth (and relevancy) with a full face, or do we foster radiant skin and march on makeup free?",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be the prettiest girl in the room,\u201d Anderson told Vogue ahead of a recent show she attended during Paris Fashion Week. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s just freedom. It\u2019s like a relief.\u201d",
      "Down here in the non-celebrity world, is it just as easy and comfortable to go makeup free? Some proponents of the look, along with style and beauty experts, weigh in.",
      "Women, particularly older women, are not universally giving up makeup, but Anderson, Alicia Keys and other celebrities who have publicly shown off bare faces have certainly inspired some to cast it off.",
      "Working women, however, acknowledge difficulties doing that on the job \u2014 especially in traditional, less creative work spaces.",
      "\u201cI do still think that there are some politics associated with it. More around feeling and looking polished,\u201d said Deborah Borg, the chief of human resources for a creative-leaning company that has roughly 25,000 employees.",
      "She said she's seen more women come into work makeup-free since COVID, and thinks the pandemic significantly altered the workplace dynamic.",
      "Borg, 49, gave up makeup four years ago, save an occasional swipe of her bold, signature red lipstick. At Dalya, a cozy clothing shop in New York's trendy Soho neighborhood, she lent herself as a model to demonstrate how to help one's bare skin glow and how to use attire and accessories to accentuate the look.",
      "Makeup artist Rebecca Robles counseled Borg and others with mature skin to think hydration when choosing products to make the most of their bare faces.",
      "Robles recommends a five-step workday routine: A gentle cleanser that doesn't strip the skin; a vitamin C serum to brighten and mitigate fine lines; a moisturizer with sun protection; a separate broad-spectrum sunscreen for an extra boost (don't forget to apply that to the ears); and a glossy lip balm for a bit of added polish.",
      "No mascara? No problem. Use a lash curler to offer a bit of pop to the eye, Robles said. And gently brush brows into place to complete the look.",
      "Find products with hyaluronic acid and ceramides, Robles suggests, and always swipe up with skincare products. Minimize tugging and pulling on the skin.",
      "\u201cWhen your skin is glowing, one thing that\u2019s really fun to keep in mind is that light reflects off that moisture in the skin and can help blur out any fine lines or enlarged pores. So it\u2019s win-win,\u201d Robles said.",
      "She advised that each product should sit for a minute or two before the next step is applied.",
      "Borg emphasized the ease of her morning routine since going makeup free. She used to spend about 30 minutes just on makeup. Now, she does hair and face in half that time.",

      "First, with clothes, \"use a lot of color. I call it our filter,\u201d Tincher said.",
      "Secondly, play with texture; it determines how light will be reflected. \u201cSo if you have something more matte, that is going to create a more soft lighting on you. If you have more silk satin, like say something like a blouse, it\u2019s going to be more like a laser beam,\u201d she said.",
      "Finally, accessorize. Tincher said added touches like lapel pins, earrings and necklaces can provide a finished polish \u2014 especially if that polish is still expected at work. A considered style can offset judgments about going makeup free, she said.",
      "\u201cThink of your outfit as the big picture. When you walk in, what is the statement that it\u2019s making? It\u2019s not just about one part of you, it\u2019s your whole presence in a room,\u201d she said.",

      "Makeup, she said, \u201cfelt like prison.\u201d She stopped gradually, giving up foundation first. But still, she's not above applying a bit of mascara on special occasions.",

      "The North American box office has slowed down after a strong September.",
      "Neither a Jordan Peele-produced horror nor a Margot Robbie and Colin Farrell romantic drama were enough to continue the September hot streak at the movies. After back-to-back weekends that had films majorly overperforming, first \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rights\u201d followed by the anime \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - Infinity Castle,\u201d the North American box office slowed significantly.",
      "Overall ticket sales were down nearly 50% from last weekend, with the holdover champion \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d edging out the newcomer \u201cHim\u201d for first place, according to studio estimates Sunday. Crunchyroll and Sony Pictures\u2019 \u201cDemon Slayer\u201d added $17.3 million over the weekend, bringing its total to $104.7 million, which makes it the highest grossing anime film ever in North America.",
      "The football horror \u201cHim\u201d opened in second place with an estimated $13.5 million in ticket sales. Universal Pictures opened \u201cHim\u201d in 3,168 North American theaters, where the audience was 52% male and 65% over the age of 25. Internationally, it earned $400,000.",
      "Produced by Peele\u2019s Monkeypaw and directed by Justin Tipping, \u201cHim\u201d is about a promising young quarterback (Tyriq Withers) who is invited to train with a veteran (Marlon Wayans) at an isolated compound.",
      "\u201cHim\u201d scored with neither critics (it carries a 29% on Rotten Tomatoes) nor audiences, who gave the film a C- CinemaScore. In his review for The Associated Press, film writer Jake Coyle wrote that the film \u201cwas made with the potent premise of bringing the kind of dark, satirical perspective that characterizes a Monkeypaw production to our violent national pastime. But that promise gets fumbled in an allegorical chamber play that grows increasingly tedious.\u201d",
      "\u201cHim\u201d was also nearly upstaged by another horror, \u201cThe Conjuring: Last Rights,\u201d which made an estimated $13 million in its third weekend. With a global total of $400 million, it\u2019s now the biggest film in the Conjuring universe.",
      "They are two of three horror movies in this weekend's top 10, including \u201cWeapons.\u201d According to data firm Comscore, this year that genre alone has generated $1.1 billion in domestic box office receipts, just several million short of the 2017 record driven by \u201cIt\u201d and \u201cGet Out.\u201d",
      "\u201cHorror movies have been on a bit of a hot streak,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore's head of marketplace trends. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a record-breaking year.\u201d",
      "In addition to \u201cDemon Slayer,\u201d Sony had a new film this weekend as well: The original romance \u201cA Big Bold Beautiful Journey,\u201d starring Robbie and Farrell, but that fizzled with audiences, earning only $3.5 million from 3,300 locations. It also received largely negative reviews and currently has a 37% on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "\u201cAudiences are selective in what they want to see,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cNegative reviews can create really strong headwinds for original films with no brand recognition.\u201d",
      "In its second weekend, \u201cDownton Abbey: The Grand Finale\u201d added another $6.3 million, bringing its running total to $31.6 million. The Stephen King adaptation \u201cThe Long Walk\u201d is also estimating $6.3 million in weekend two, down only 46% from its opening. Its domestic total of $22.7 million has already exceeded its production budget of $20 million (though that sum does not account for marketing and promotion).",
      "Ron Howard\u2019s 1995 hit \u201cApollo 13\u201d played in 200 theaters this weekend for its 30th anniversary as well. It made an estimated $600,000. The 30th anniversary re-release of \u201cToy Story,\u201d now in its second weekend, added $1.4 million.",

      "Biden's team appeared to be in denial. Afterward, they gave Harris talking points that said \u201cJOE BIDEN WON.\"",

      "Sonny Curtis, a vintage rock 'n' roller who wrote the raw classic \u201cI Fought the Law\u201d and posed the enduring question \u201cWho can turn the world on with her smile?\u201d as the writer-crooner of the theme song to \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d has died at 88.",
      "Curtis, inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Crickets in 2012, died Friday, his wife of more than a half-century, Louise Curtis, confirmed to The Associated Press. His daughter, Sarah Curtis, wrote on his Facebook page that he had been suddenly ill.",
      "Curtis wrote or co-wrote hundreds of songs, from Keith Whitley's country smash \u201cI'm No Stranger to the Rain\u201d to the Everly Brothers' \u201cWalk Right Back,\u201d a personal favorite Curtis completed while in Army basic training. Bing Crosby, Glen Campbell, Bruce Springsteen and the Grateful Dead were among other artists who covered his work.",
      "Born during the Great Depression to cotton farmers outside of Meadow, Texas, Curtis was a childhood friend of Buddy Holly's and an active musician in the formative years of rock, whether jamming on guitar with Holly in the mid-1950s or opening for Elvis Presley when Elvis was still a regional act. Curtis' songwriting touch also soon emerged: Before he turned 20, he had written the hit \u201cSomeday\u201d for Webb Pierce and \u201cRock Around With Ollie Vee\u201d for Holly.",
      "Curtis had left Holly's group, the Crickets, before Holly became a major star. But he returned after Holly died in a plane crash in 1959 and he was featured the following year on the album \u201cIn Style with the Crickets,\u201d which included \u201cI Fought the Law\u201d (dashed off in a single afternoon, according to Curtis, who would say he had no direct inspiration for the song) and the Jerry Allison collaboration \u201cMore Than I Can Say,\u201d a hit for Bobby Vee, and later for Leo Sayer.",
      "Meanwhile, it took until 1966 for \u201cI Fought the Law\u201d and its now-immortal refrain \u201cI fought the law \u2014 and the law won\u201d to catch on: The Texas-based Bobby Fuller Four made it a Top 10 song. Over the following decades, it was covered by dozens of artists, from punk (the Clash) to country (Johnny Cash, Nanci Griffith) to Springsteen, Tom Petty and other mainstream rock stars.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my most important copyright,\u201d Curtis told The Tennessean in 2014.",
      "Curtis' other signature song was as uplifting as \u201cI Fought the Law\u201d was resigned. In 1970, he was writing commercial jingles when he came up with the theme for a new CBS sitcom starring Moore as a single woman hired as a TV producer in Minneapolis. He called the song \u201cLove is All Around,\u201d and used a smooth melody to eventually serve up lyrics as indelible as any in television history:",
      "\u201cWho can turn the world on with her smile? / Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile? / Well it's you girl, and you should know it / With each glance and every little movement you show it.\u201d",
      "The song's endurance was sealed by the images it was heard over, especially Moore's triumphant toss of her hat as Curtis proclaims, \u201cYou're going to make it after all.\u201d In tribute, other artists began recording it, including Sammy Davis Jr., Joan Jett and the Blackhearts and Minnesota's H\u00fcsker D\u00fc. A commercial release featuring Curtis came out in 1980 and was a modest success, peaking at No. 29 on Billboard's country chart.",
      "Curtis would recall being commissioned by his friend Doug Gilmore, a music industry road manager who had heard the sitcom's developers were looking for an opening song.",

Brooks.",
      "\u201cJames L. Brooks came into this huge empty room, no furniture apart from a phone lying on the floor, and at first, I thought he was rather cold and sort of distant, and he said 'We're not at the stage of picking a song yet, but I'll listen anyway,'\u201d Curtis recalled. \u201cSo I played the song, just me and my guitar, and next thing, he started phoning people, and the room filled up, and then he sent out for a tape recorder.\u201d",
      "Curtis would eventually write two versions: the first used in Season 1, the second and better known for the remaining six seasons. The original words were more tentative, opening with \u201cHow will you make it on your own?\u201d and ending with \u201cYou might just make it after all.\u201d By Season 2, the show was a hit and the lyrics were reworked. The producers had wanted Andy Williams to sing the theme song, but he turned it down and Curtis' easygoing baritone was heard instead.",
      "Curtis made a handful of solo albums, including \u201cSonny Curtis\u201d and \u201cSpectrum,\u201d and hit the country Top 20 with the 1981 single \u201cGood Ol' Girls.\u201d In later years, he continued to play with Allison and other members of the Crickets. The band released several albums, among them \u201cThe Crickets and Their Buddies,\u201d featuring appearances by Eric Clapton, Graham Nash and Phil Everly. One of Curtis' more notable songs was \u201cThe Real Buddy Holly Story,\u201d a rebuke to the 1978 biopic \u201cThe Buddy Holly Story,\u201d which starred Gary Busey.",
      "Curtis settled in Nashville in the mid-1970s and lived there with his wife, Louise. He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1991 and, as part of the Crickets, into Nashville's Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2007. Five years later, he and the Crickets were inducted into the Rock Hall, praised as \u201cthe blueprint for rock and roll bands (that) inspired thousands of kids to start up garage bands around the world.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Born during the Great Depression with sun-kissed California looks, Robert Redford never failed to epitomize something quintessential and hopeful about the American character.",
      "Redford, who died Tuesday at the age of 89, left a movie trail etched into land. He seemed to reside as much across the American landscape as he did on movie screens. He was in the Rocky Mountains of \u201cJeremiah Johnson,\u201d the Wyoming grasslands of \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,\u201d the Washington, D.C., alleyways of \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men\u201d and the Montana streams of \u201cA River Runs Through It.\u201d",
      "\u201cFrom the time I was just a kid, I was always trying to break free of the bounds that I was stuck with, and always wanted to go outside,\u201d Redford told The Associated Press in 2018.",
      "Redford, a movie-star paragon, was surely savvy with how he played with and used his all-American image. No one who starred in the baseball drama \u201cThe Natural\u201d (1984) and gave Bernard Malamud\u2019s novel a storybook ending couldn't have some sense of self-mythology. But it was one of Redford\u2019s greatest feats that, despite his fame, he remained innately connected to some aspirational American ideal. Redford, an open-air actor of easy, rugged charm, evoked the kind of regular guy decency that stars like Jimmy Stewart did before him \u2014 only Redford did it through an era of distrust and disillusionment.",
      "\u201cHe was to me a throwback to the actors that I was nuts about when I was growing up and going to movies: real, classical, traditional, old-fashioned movie stars who were very, very redolent of some kind of American essence,\u201d said Sydney Pollack, who directed Redford in \u201cJeremiah Johnson,\u201d \u201cThe Way We Were\u201d and \u201cThree Days of the Condor,\u201d in 1993. \u201cThey were very much a part of the American landscape and they were heroic in a kind of understated way.\u201d",
      "That was most true, perhaps, in Utah. Wanting to escape paved-over Los Angeles, Redford first began buying land there early in his career. In Utah, he would fight to protect both untrampled wilderness and a spirit of moviemaking that had grown increasingly difficult in Hollywood. As a longtime trustee of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group, Redford was an outspoken environmentalist. In the 1970s, he successfully opposed a pair of rural Utah proposals: a six-lane highway and coal-fired power plant.",
      "In the Utah mountains, Redford also launched the Sundance Institute. Beyond Sundance's annual festival for independent film, the institute has been a lifeblood young filmmakers. Its year-round laboratory \u2014 the part of Sundance that Redford was most proud of \u2014 has helped nurture some of the most vital voices in American cinema for decades.",
      "\u201cFor me, the word to be underscored is \u2018independence,\u2019\u201d Redford once said of his legacy. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed in that word. That\u2019s what led to me eventually wanting to create a category that supported independent artists who weren\u2019t given a chance to be heard. The industry was pretty well controlled by the mainstream, which I was a part of. But I saw other stories out there that weren\u2019t having a chance to be told.\u201d",
      "That spirit of independence often infused his films, too. When Redford wanted to make \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d the seminal 1976 film directed by Alan Pakula about Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein\u2019s Watergate investigation, few in the film industry thought there was much drama to be found in a story that was then several years old.",
      "\u201cNixon had already resigned, and the held opinion (in Hollywood) was \u2018No one cares. No one wants to hear about this,\u2019\u201d Redford, who also co-produced the film, said in 2006. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018No, it\u2019s not about Nixon. It\u2019s about something else. It\u2019s about investigative journalism and hard work.\u2019\u201d",
      "If \u201cAll the President\u2019s Men,\u201d one of the greatest newspaper movies, detailed the hard-earned revelations of Watergate, \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d \u2014 one of the greatest political thrillers \u2014 captured the paranoia and disillusionment that followed. If anyone was completely unfamiliar with why Redford was so good, \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d would be a good place to start.",

No one has ever been better at playing the regular guy trying to think fast on his feet, and make sense of an ever-darker world.",
      "Though some called for him to, Redford never entered politics, himself. He remained outspoken \u2014 he's in some way the model for the modern Hollywood activist \u2014 on a wide range of issues, including Indigenous and LGBTQ+ rights. The closest he came to running for office was Michael Ritchie's 1972 satire \u201cThe Candidate,\u201d in which Redford played an idealistic lawyer enlisted to challenge a highly favored incumbent Republican senator. Redford\u2019s candidate ultimately wins, but not without sacrificing his principles and seeing much of what he stands for diluted.",
      "Redford\u2019s place, instead, was outside politics. The perfect bookend to his \u201970s movies is \u201cSneakers,\u201d Phil Alden Robinson\u2019s absurdly underrated 1992 caper starring Redford as a former \u201960s radical now living under a false moniker and leading a band of security specialists. They stumble into possession of a computer device that brings the attention of the NSA, CIA, FBI and many others, forcing Redford to, yet again, try to figure out what\u2019s moral in a dangerous (and now newly digital) America.",
      "The world that Redford\u2019s films often presciently depicted seemed to push him further into the wilderness, on screen and off. He largely retreated into retirement over the last decade. When Redford died, he was at his home in the Utah mountains, outside Provo. One of his last films was 2015's \u201cA Walk in the Woods,\u201d playing Bill Bryson ambling along the Appalachian Trail.",
      "The most fitting and elegiac swan song, though was J.C. Chandor\u2019s \u201cAll Is Lost,\u201d a near-wordless 2013 drama about an old man at sea.

A visibly older and weathered Redford \u2014 no longer the golden, freckled face of his youth \u2014 suffers through increasingly rough and stormy seas, improvising his survival.",
      "For an actor who had covered so much ground, \u201cAll Is Lost\u201d was one last frontier. Redford's unnamed character was credited only as \u201cOur Man.\u201d",

      "Robert Redford, who died Tuesday at 89, transformed the film industry with the Sundance Institute and Film Festival",
      "Robert Redford was disillusioned with the Hollywood mainstream. The Sundance Kid, who died Tuesday at age 89, knew that there were more stories out there, ones that weren\u2019t getting made into films because of the rigidity of the business. So he made something different, founding Sundance Institute and the Sundance Film Festival as an alternative avenue for emerging filmmakers, where independence was a virtue, not a liability.",
      "Over the past four decades, the institute and the festival have given an early platform to countless young filmmakers, including Steven Soderbergh, Paul Thomas Anderson, Quentin Tarantino, Ryan Coogler, Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, Nicole Holofcener, Nia DaCosta, Taika Waititi, Ava DuVernay, Rian Johnson, Gina Prince-Bythewood, Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert and many more.",
      "\u201cFor me, the word to be underscored is \u2018independence.\u2019 I\u2019ve always believed in that word. That\u2019s what led to me eventually wanting to create a category that supported independent artists who weren\u2019t given a chance to be heard,\u201d Redford told The Associated Press in 2018. \u201cThe industry was pretty well controlled by the mainstream, which I was a part of. But I saw other stories out there that weren\u2019t having a chance to be told and I thought, \u2018Well, maybe I can commit my energies to giving those people a chance.\u2019 As I look back on it, I feel very good about that.\u201d",
      "In 2019, Redford said he intended to step back from his public facing role at the festival, though he remained the organization's president and founder until his death.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re at a point where I can move on to a different place, because the thing I\u2019ve missed over the years is being able to spend time with the films and with the filmmakers and to see their work and be part of their community,\u201d he said at the 2019 kickoff. \u201cI don\u2019t think the festival needs a whole lot of introduction now: It runs on its own course, and I\u2019m happy for that.\u201d",
      "Redford\u2019s love affair with Utah began much earlier, on a cross-country motorcycle road trip in 1961 when he bought 2 acres of land. By 1969, with more money in his pocket from his film successes, he\u2019d purchased 5,000 acres, some of which was a mountain resort but most of the land was for wilderness preserves. He named it Sundance, after his character in \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\u201d",
      "In 1981, the year he won best picture and director for \u201cOrdinary People,\u201d he established the Sundance Institute, a nonprofit organization and held the first filmmakers lab at the Sundance Mountain Resort, about 13 miles northeast of Provo. A few years later, in 1985, the institute took over what was then known as the U.S. Film Festival, which would later be renamed the Sundance Film Festival. The festival in the mid-80s hosted the Coen brothers \u201cBlood Simple\u201d and Jim Jarmusch\u2019s \u201cStranger Than Paradise.\u201d",
      "The festival was really put on the map when Soderbergh premiered \u201csex, lies and videotape\u201d in Park City in 1989. A true indie, the film went on to win the Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes and get an Oscar nomination, but it was its box office success that ignited a veritable indie film boom. And Sundance was where all the discoveries were happening. In 1991, the festival premiered \u201cDaughters of the Dust,\u201d \u201cParis is Burning\u201d and \u201cSlacker,\u201d in 1992, Tarantino\u2019s \u201cReservoir Dogs,\u201d in 1993, Wes Anderson brought \u201cBottle Rocket,\u201d and in 1994 \u201cHoop Dreams\u201d and \u201cClerks.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Robert Redford, independent art houses might not have succeeded,\u201d said Gary Meyer, cofounder of Landmark Theatre, and a former festival director at Telluride who also worked with Redford. \u201cHaving the \u2018Sundance Kid\u2019 give his stamp of approval to independent features and documentaries brought audiences to our theaters, while helping launch the careers of dozens of filmmakers \u2026 He made it \u2018cool\u2019 to see adventurous movies when they came to commercial neighborhood theaters.\u201d",
      "In 1994, the Sundance Institute also made a commitment to Indigenous filmmakers by launching a festival program to showcase Native and Indigenous films that continues to this day.",
      "The festival might get the most headlines, but it\u2019s the year-round work of the Institute that has really left a mark on independent cinema. The screenwriting and directing labs have been just as, if not more, influential in helping to launch the first films of many of Hollywood\u2019s top filmmakers over the past 40 years, under the leadership of Michelle Satter, who has helped shepherd projects from \u201cHard Eight\u201d to \u201cFruitvale Station\u201d and \u201cLove & Basketball.\u201d",
      "\u201cSundance changed the trajectory of my career,\u201d filmmaker and labs adviser Gina Prince-Bythewood told the AP in 2023. \u201cHow many of these special projects would have never seen the light of day without Michelle, without Robert Redford\u2019s vision, without this incredible place? It\u2019s actually really scary to think about.\u201d",
      "Native filmmaker Sterlin Harjo (\u201cRez Ball\u201d) said that his career as a young man was defined by Redford\u2019s support for independent cinema and supporting Native storytelling.",

      "Anthony Roth Costanzo, who introduced $11 tickets to Opera Philadelphia, aims to surprise audiences again with the company\u2019s new season as it celebrates its 50th anniversary",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Anthony Roth Costanzo, the man who brought $11 opera tickets to Philadelphia, hopes to keep surprising audiences during the company\u2019s new season.",
      "\u201cIt is very much opera. It\u2019s dramatic, it\u2019s cathartic, it\u2019s collaborative in interdisciplinary ways,\u201d Costanzo said of Opera Philadelphia\u2019s 50th anniversary season \u2014 the first he\u2019s been able to plan since taking charge of the financially teetering company last year. \u201cBut it\u2019s different from what your perception of opera might be.\u201d",
      "He slated a work by Rossini to kick things off, with opening night set for Friday. But instead of choosing a repertory staple, Costanzo picked the less-familiar \u201cIl viaggio a Reims.\u201d And the production will be anything but traditional: Director Damiano Michieletto has changed the original setting from an inn to an art gallery where the portraits come alive and sing.",
      "After that the offerings become even more adventurous. There\u2019s a multimedia piece by playwright Sarah Ruhl set to music by Vivaldi \u2014 including \u201cThe Seasons\u201d \u2014 and starring Costanzo, who maintains a flourishing performing career as a countertenor. Then comes a world premiere with libretto by Pulitzer-winner Michael R. Jackson and a score by 10 different composers. Another new opera follows, by Gregory Spears, in which the chorus has the starring role. Finally, bass-baritone Dav\u00f3ne Tines performs a \u201cvaudevillian rendering\u201d of a poem by Langston Hughes.",
      "\u201cAs I put all of the pieces together, I thought, how can I encapsulate this in just a few simple words,\u201d Costanzo said. \u201cAnd what occurred to me was: \u2018Opera, but different.\u2019 And that is the slogan of the season.\u201d",
      "His pride in the lineup is understandable, especially given that when he took over it wasn\u2019t certain there would even be a 2025-26 season.",
      "The company was nearing bankruptcy and needed to quickly raise $4 million, he recalled.",
      "Almost immediately he instituted a \u201cpick your price\u201d policy under which people could buy tickets to any seat in the house starting at $11. (The website gives buyers a range of higher options and invites them to make a donation on top of the purchase. Season subscriptions at higher prices are also still available.)",
      "\u201cI said OK, I have to think like a venture capitalist,\u201d Costanzo said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to spend money to make money. Besides, he said, the old pricing system was projected to bring in only 8% of the revenue the company needed, so little was at risk from the new policy.",
      "The publicity and good will generated by the move helped the company quickly raise $7 million in donations, more than enough to retire the debt. When tickets went on sale for 2024-25, all three operas sold out within three weeks, and the season ended with a surplus of $2.4 million.",
      "Corrado Rovaris, the company\u2019s longtime music director, was on the podium for the season-opening performance last fall of Missy Mazzoli\u2019s \u201cThe Listeners,\u201d a recent work having its U.S. premiere.",
      "\u201cIt was amazing to see the reaction in the house,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBeautiful to see a full house but also to see such an enthusiastic house. Beautiful and very moving.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a brilliant idea,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause the tickets only cover a fraction of the cost of an opera. But the whole point is to spread good will, bring in new people, bring in young people, people who have never been to an opera. And good will is priceless.\u201d",
      "In a good portent for the growth of the company\u2019s audience, two-thirds of those who chose the \u201cpick your price option\u201d had never bought tickets to Opera Philadelphia before, and most were under 45 years old. This year a similar percentage are either first-timers or repeats from last season.",
      "As a result of the brighter financial outlook, the new season offers twice as many performances as last, though the budget is still substantially lower than it was in 2017, when the company launched an adventurous festival format that had several different works in performance over a period of two weeks.",
      "Just how did Costanzo settle on that $11 figure?",
      "\u201cAt first I thought it should be $25,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the problem is that everywhere across the country I see \u2018tickets starting at $25\u2026\u2019 and I thought people would see that and think, Oh, yeah, you can sit up in the top balcony.",
      "\u201cSo I wanted to really distinguish it, and I thought a round number was less sticky \u2026 you don\u2019t remember $15 or $10.\u201d",
      "Marc Scorca, president and CEO of Opera America, said he\u2019s watching the company\u2019s initiatives with great interest, but he cautions that it\u2019s too soon to predict long-term victory.",

      "\u201cI think the learning from it will be important not only to the company but to the field,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAnd that will probably not play out for another couple of years until we see how much of that audience becomes a bona fide public for the company or just took advantage of an opportunity to experiment with something at a low price.\u201d",

      "Major League Baseball has canceled plans to play games in London next season due to scheduling conflicts with West Ham's Olympic Stadium and TV commitments",
      "NEW YORK -- Major League Baseball has abandoned plans to play two games in London next season because of scheduling issues with West Ham's Olympic Stadium and the sport's television partner.",
      "MLB had hoped to have the New York Yankees and Toronto Blue Jays meet in London on June 13 and 14, but West Ham is home for its Premier League finale against Leeds on May 24. That left too little time to convert the field to baseball, and MLB was unable to schedule games there for later in June because Fox lacked available broadcast slots due to World Cup commitments.",
      "Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said Tuesday after his question-and-answer session at Front Office Sports' \u201cTuned In\u201d event that the London games were definitely off.",
      "MLB played in London for the first time in 2019 when the New York Yankees swept two games from the Boston Red Sox. A planned two-game series between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs in 2020 was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic, and series were split there by the Cardinals and Cubs in 2023 and the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies in 2024.",
      "MLB's labor contract included games in Paris for 2025 but they were called off because MLB and the players' association couldn't find a promoter.",
      "\u201cWe remain interested in Europe. We think London is an important jumping off point for us,\u201d Manfred said during his Q&A session. \u201cWe have a facility that has come a long way since the first Yankee-Red Sox game. It\u2019s a much better ballpark now than it was due to their willingness to make investments in that. We continue to believe that there\u2019s an opportunity there and that we can get at the developed economies in Europe through that London entree.\u201d",
      "Manfred said MLB is working on grassroots initiatives in India because of that nation's affinity for cricket.",
      "\u201cWe're really starting from the bottom up,\u201d he said.",
      "Mexico also is a priority. MLB played regular-season games at Monterrey in 1996, 1999, 2018 and 2019, and at Mexico City in 2023 and 2024. Arizona and San Diego are likely to play at Mexico City next April 25 and 26.",
      "\u201cWe have worked very hard to develop better relationships with the Mexican professional leagues,\" Manfred said. \"We think we can ultimately build those relationships in a way that they look like Japan and Korea: The domestic professional league thrives, but we have enough players coming to the U.S. to play that it drives our business here in the U.S.\u201d",
      "MLB has gained in the Asian market, especially in recent years because of Shohei Ohtani's following. MLB opened the season at Tokyo in 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2019 and this year, and at Seoul, South Korea, in 2024.",
      "\u201cOur approach to international has always been country by country, largely because we find the places we\u2019re interested in to be in different stages of development,\u201d Manfred said. \"With respect to Japan and Korea, we made investments there. We monetarily, and players, in terms of the sweat equity involved, of making the trip to Tokyo to open the season, making the trip to Seoul to open the season, that we have started to see return on those investments.",
      "\u201cI think that the opportunity to monetize the great fan base that we have in Japan and Korea will show up in terms of purely international revenue, but it will also show up in our national media. My prediction is there will be some of the more media companies \u2014 the streamers will be really interested in the ability to get access to well-developed economies where they don\u2019t have as much penetration as they do in countries like the United States and Canada. So it\u2019s going to show up in different places out of those developed economies.\u201d",

      "Katz oversees The Relentless Award, the largest annual cash prize in American theater to a playwright in recognition of a new play. It's celebrating its 10th anniversary this year and, as always, seeking submissions that \u201cexhibit fearlessness.\u201d The award also honors musical theater.",
      "\u201cBeing able to create under financial stress is so difficult, and so anything we can do to give artists a little breathing room is what we want,\u201d says Katz.",
      "The award was inspired by Katz's friend and collaborator Philip Seymour Hoffman, the late actor who was described as relentless in his pursuit of truth in his art. A musical theater honor was added after the 2020 death of another of Katz's friends, Fountains of Wayne co-founder Adam Schlesinger.",
      "\u201cTo me, a big aspect of the award \u2014 the musical and the straight play \u2014 is not merely honoring Phil and Adam, but the idea of expanding their artistic legacies,\u201d says Katz.",
      "Some of the plays that have been recognized have gone on to great success, like Aleshea Harris\u2019 2016 winner \u201cIs God Is,\u201d which has been made into a movie starring Janelle Mon\u00e1e, Vivica A. Fox, Sterling K. Brown and Kara Young.",
      "\u201cAlicia typifies the whole point of the award,\u201d says Katz. \u201cI think at a moment in her life where she, like so many of us other artists, had kind of had it, she won the award and that was incredibly meaningful in her career.\u201d",
      "Other successes include Sarah DeLappe\u2019s \u201cThe Wolves\u201d and Clare Barron\u2019s \u201cDance Nation\u201d \u2014 joint winners in 2015 \u2014 who have gone on to become Pulitzer Prize finalists. \u201cThe impact, especially of those three plays, has been profound in theater,\u201d Katz says.",
      "The musical and the playwriting honors alternate each year. The winner this year is Jack D. Coen, who created the musical comedy \u201cJo Jenkins Before the Galactic Court of Consciousness.\u201d",
      "Cohen will receive $65,000 and his musical \u2014 as well as the works of the finalists \u2014 will be honored at a ceremony and performance on Oct. 12 at Building for the Arts\u2019 multi-theater complex, Theatre Row. Chris Collingwood, of Fountains of Wayne, will be performing as well.",

      "The decision comes two and a half months after President Donald Trump signed legislation sharply reducing food aid to the poor.

      "\u201cThe questions used to collect the data are entirely subjective and do not present an accurate picture of actual food security,'' the USDA said. \u201dThe data is rife with inaccuracies slanted to create a narrative that is not representative of what is actually happening in the countryside as we are currently experiencing lower poverty rates, increasing wages, and job growth under the Trump Administration.''",

    "story": [
      "A vaccine advisory committee handpicked by U.S. Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. met in Atlanta for two days this week to consider various vaccine recommendations",
      "NEW YORK -- A vaccine advisory committee handpicked by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met in Atlanta this week to consider whether to revise recommendations on shots against COVID-19, hepatitis B, and a combination shot that protects children against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox.",
      "The panel, which is charged with making vaccine recommendations, declined to recommend COVID-19 vaccines, saying instead that people could make individual decisions \u2014 a move that adds confusion as people weigh whether to get a dose this fall.",
      "During the sometimes chaotic two-day meeting, the panel also recommended new restrictions for a vaccine that protects against chickenpox as well as measles, mumps and rubella. In a surprise move, the group indefinitely postponed an expected vote on hepatitis B shots given to infants on the day they are born.",
      "With Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, leading the country's health agencies, the meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, struck a different tone from past gatherings. Among the 12 members, all chosen this year by Kennedy after he fired the previous 17-member panel, are people who have criticized and spread misinformation about vaccines. Critics say the panel's makeup and agenda could sow distrust in the shots.",
      "The panel's recommendations will be sent to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency that has been rocked by disagreements over Kennedy's vaccine policies. The panel's recommendations are usually adopted by the CDC, and then widely followed by doctors and insurers.",
      "Here are some takeaways from the meeting.",
      "The panel on Friday debated COVID-19 vaccinations as the virus has remained a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths last fall and winter, according to CDC data.",
      "Until now, the vaccinations had been routinely provided to nearly all Americans who wanted them. The Food and Drug Administration recently put new restrictions on this year\u2019s shots from Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax, reserving them for people over 65 or younger ones who are deemed at higher risk from the virus.",
      "Panelists declined to recommend the shots for anyone, including seniors and high-risk populations. They said individuals could make their own decisions. Removing the recommendations that were previously in place may confuse Americans trying to decide whether and how to get their fall boosters.",
      "The panel also urged the CDC to adopt stronger language around claims of vaccine risks, despite pushback from outside medical groups who said the shots had a proven safety record from the billions of doses administered worldwide.",
      "The divided panel narrowly avoided urging states to require a prescription for the shot.",
      "Several states have announced policies to try to ensure people's access to COVID-19 vaccines, worried about Friday\u2019s ACIP decision. And a group representing most health insurers, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, said earlier this week that its members will continue covering the shots through 2026.",
      "The committee recommended that a combined vaccine known as MMRV should not be given to children under 4. Instead, they said in an 8-3 vote with one abstention, children in this age group should get separate vaccines \u2014 one for MMR and another for varicella, or chickenpox.",
      "Their discussions centered on rare feverish seizures that can occur in kids who receive the first dose, between the ages of 1 and 2. Medical experts agree these seizures, while potentially frightening for families, are not linked to brain function or school problems.",
      "In 2009, the ACIP changed a previous recommendation to advise that either the combination shot or separate shots were acceptable for the first dose.",
      "Some doctors and public health experts say they are not aware of any new safety data that would explain the revisiting of those vaccination recommendations.",
      "About 85% of children already receive separate doses for the first round, according to information presented at the meeting.",

Government insurance programs like Medicaid, for example, would have to stop paying for the early combo dose if the acting CDC director accepts the panel's guidance.",
      "Ever since the ACIP panel in 2005 recommended a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine for newborns, cases of the liver virus among infants have dropped by more than half.",
      "Nonetheless, the committee opted to revisit the guidance in this week's meeting, with members questioning whether babies born to moms who test negative for hepatitis B really need a vaccine at birth.",
      "The panelists considered whether to recommend delaying that initial vaccination \u2014 something doctors and parents already can choose to do.",
      "One committee member asked if the vaccination right after birth was \u201casking our babies to solve an adult problem.\u201d Hepatitis B can spread through sex, sharing needles, or from an infected mother to a newborn baby.",
      "But several outside medical experts criticized that the committee was debating the issue at all and said the vaccine is safe and successful at reducing infant infections.",
      "After discussing it on Thursday, the panel decided Friday morning to indefinitely postpone a vote on the issue.",
      "Chairman Martin Kulldorff opened the meeting by challenging former CDC directors to a public debate. Several doctors representing outside medical groups accused the panel of not following the CDC\u2019s long-established guidelines in weighing evidence for making recommendations.",
      "CDC staff, as usual, presented numerous studies on the topics being debated, explaining how they chose which research to discuss. But a few times, panel members cited different papers they had found, including ones done in mice, which are not generally considered applicable.",
      "The committee also took a vote on Thursday that they had to redo on Friday morning concerning the government\u2019s Vaccines for Children program, which covers vaccine costs for about half of U.S. kids. On Friday, they voted to align coverage under the program with their guidance on MMRV shots. A day earlier, they had voted no on the idea.",
      "\u201cWe are rookies. \u2026 There are many technical issues that we might not grasp as of yet,\u201d Kulldorff said. He said a committee member had told him that \u201cmaybe we didn\u2019t quite understand what was going on\u201d with the vote.",
      "At one point Thursday, one of the panelists appeared to be napping, with his eyes closed and his chin resting on his chest.",
      "Doctors and public health experts watching the meeting unfold said they are concerned that the committee is creating fear and mistrust around vaccines at a time when U.S. vaccination rates are already falling.",
      "They suggested the new panel was selectively using its recommendations to justify specific conclusions, rather than considering all the evidence.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s troubling to see the erosion of the committee\u2019s integrity,\u201d said Dr. Sandra Fryhofer of the American Medical Association.",

      "Starting in 2027, most adults who seek Medicaid coverage must first show they are working, taking classes or performing community service for at least 80 hours a month. And they must be extremely poor, earning incomes no higher than the federal poverty line.",
      "The report attributes most of the administrative costs to the implementation of changes in determining eligibility and enrolling people, along with duplicative technology, training and coordination while the state litigated to overcome Biden administration objections.",
      "\u201cNow the entire country can see what we in Georgia already know \u2014 Georgia\u2019s Medicaid work reporting requirement program is the real waste, fraud, and abuse,\u201d Sen. Raphael Warnock, one of the Georgia Democrats who requested the report. \u201cThis report shows that Pathways is incredibly effective at barring working people from health coverage and making corporate consultants richer,\" his statement said.",
      "A spokesperson for Republican Gov. Brian Kemp countered that Democrats are responsible for the extra spending.",
      "\u201cNow, as other states prepare to adopt our model and reject one-size-fits-none big government healthcare, Democrats like Senators Ossoff and Warnock are trying to rewrite history after four years of inaction and blame the State for costs associated with their own stonewalling.\"",
      "Millions of eligible people will lose coverage due to the Trump law because the administrative process will make it too difficult for them to repeatedly document their work, critics say, pointing to what happened in Georgia, which is so far the only state that imposes work requirements.",
      "Georgia has among the highest rates of uninsured and is one of 10 states that refused to expand Medicaid to all adults with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level, as envisioned by President Barack Obama's health care overhaul.",
      "Instead, Kemp heralded his July 2023 launch of Georgia Pathways to Coverage, which limits Medicaid for adults to those who earn no more than poverty-level wages, now set at $15,650 a year. Georgia's traditional Medicaid still covers poorer children, disabled adults, poor people in nursing homes and a handful of other adults.",
      "Nationally, most adults on Medicaid in states that expanded it are already working, and in Georgia, an estimated 246,365 adults are potentially eligible for traditional Medicaid or Pathways. But a year after it launched, Pathways had enrolled around 4,300. As of this spring, there were 6,514 adults enrolled, according to the state Department of Community Health.",

The formulations cited by regulators are produced by specialty compounding pharmacies and aren't reviewed by the FDA.",

      "More than 100,000 Americans are on the transplant list and thousands die waiting because there aren\u2019t enough donations to go around. Last year there were more than 48,000 transplants, a record, the vast majority from deceased donors.",

      "CONAKRY, Guinea -- Vote counting was underway in some polling stations in Guinea Sunday evening in a referendum on a draft constitution that could allow the leader of the country\u2019s junta to run for the presidency.",
      "The referendum, which is a key step in the country\u2019s transition from military to civilian rule, is being closely monitored in the coup-battered region, with critics calling it a power grab. Some say it is a way for Gen. Mamadi Doumbouya, who took power by force four years ago, to seek the presidency and legitimize his military rule.",
      "Guinea is one of a growing number of West African countries, including Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, where the military has taken over.",
      "There are 6.7 million eligible voters and the referendum needs a turnout of at least 50% to pass. Some polling stations extended voting time after they were scheduled to close.",
      "The referendum was organized by the Directorate General of Elections, a new body that will oversee the vote count and whose two heads were elected by Doumbouya.",

She was going to vote \u201cyes\u201d after reading parts of the draft constitution and finding it was \u201cin our advantage.\u201d",

      "Doumbouya, wearing a white polo shirt and a cap with Guinea logo on it, arrived Sunday morning at a voting station in downtown Conakry with his wife, a French national, and his son. Dozens of heavily armed special military forces were protecting him from journalists and citizens.",

Supporters wearing T-shirts and boubous \u2014 traditional West African flowing garments \u2014 printed with Doumbouya\u2019s face, gathered at neighborhood rallies. Only one thing was missing: the opposition.",
      "Campaigning was banned on Friday and Saturday, but the referendum remained omnipresent. Public and private buildings in Conakry remained plastered with \u201cYes\" campaign billboards calling for approval of the referendum. At a concert held Friday night in one of Conakry's bars, band members sang a song about Doumbouya, repeatedly chanting \u201cOui! Oui! Oui!,\" or \u201cYes! Yes! Yes!\u201d in French, the country's official language.",

      "\u201cOur activists and supporters have no knowledge of this constitution. The moment we were excluded, they were excluded,\u201d he said. \u201cWe, who were supposed to help Guineans understand what is written in it, we are forbidden even to speak.\u201d",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- Philippine police arrested 49 people suspected of hurling rocks, bottles and fire bombs at officers and blocking heavily guarded roads and bridges leading to the presidential palace Sunday while a peaceful anti-corruption rally took place in the capital, officials and witnesses said.",
      "The melee outside the country\u2019s seat of power unfolded while more than 33,000 other protesters rallied in a historic park and a democracy monument in Manila. They expressed outrage over a corruption scandal involving lawmakers, officials and construction company owners who allegedly pocketed huge kickbacks from flood-control projects in the impoverished Southeast Asian country that is regularly buffeted by storms and typhoons.",
      "The hourslong rampage by about 100 mostly club-wielding people, some of whom waved Philippine flags and displayed carton posters with anti-corruption slogans, wounded about 70 Manila law enforcers, according to the Manila police. Schools were canceled due to the violence.",
      "Police said they lobbed tear gas to try to disperse the attackers, who sprayed graffiti on walls, toppled steel posts, shattered glass panels and ransacked the lobby of a budget inn along a popular road dotted with university campuses, banks and restaurants before dispersing at night.",
      "Hours after the assault, police have yet to identify the attackers, some of whom carried black flags with the caricature of a skull and crossbones. It was also unclear if they had earlier participated in the peaceful protests before heading toward the presidential office. It was not immediately known if President Marcos Jr. was in the Malacanang presidential palace during the chaos.",
      "Police said in a statement after the arrests that the situation was \u201ccontained\u201d but warned that violence and vandalism would not be tolerated.",
      "\u201cI feel bad that we wallow in poverty and we lose our homes, our lives and our future while they rake in a big fortune from our taxes that pay for their luxury cars, foreign trips and bigger corporate transactions,\u201d student activist Althea Trinidad told The Associated Press in Manila.",

      "Five candidates are vying for the Liberal Democratic Party's top job ahead of a highly unpredictable vote in early October. The race has a slogan: \u201cChange, LDP.\u201d",
      "The winner must act quickly to address rising prices if the party is to have any chance of winning back support following devastating losses to both the LDP and its junior partner Komeito in the past year that deprived their coalition of a majority in either house of parliament.",
      "Its new leader is still likely to be prime minister because the LDP remains the No. 1 party, while opposition groups are too splintered to form a coalition.",
      "Whoever becomes the LDP leader must also gain cooperation from main opposition parties or risk facing constant no-confidence motions and a cycle of short-lived leadership.",
      "The Oct. 4 vote is not open to the general public. It is limited to 295 LDP parliamentarians and nearly 1 million dues-paying grassroots party members. That\u2019s less than 1% of Japan's eligible voters.",
      "A candidate who secures a majority becomes a party leader. If nobody wins a majority, there will be a runoff between the top two candidates in the first round.",
      "To be elected as prime minister, the new party leader will need votes from some opposition lawmakers in a parliamentary leadership vote, to be held within days.",
      "All five candidates are incumbent and former Cabinet ministers. They call themselves moderate conservatives as they emphasize their willingness to work with opposition groups. At Monday's joint kick-off event, the candidates largely focused on the economy and stricter measures on immigration. Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi and former economic security minister Sanae Takaichi are considered the top contenders.",

      "Shinjiro Koizumi, 44: The son of a popular former prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, makes his second bid after running against Ishiba last year when he campaigned to reform the scandal-laden party. As agriculture minister for Ishiba, Koizumi released an emergency rice stockpile to lower prices and stabilize supply. Koizumi vowed to rebuild his party and listen to the people's voices more closely to address their concerns, such as rising prices, growing foreign population and public safety, but stayed away from divisive issues. If elected, he will be Japan's youngest leader since Hirobumi Ito, who in 1885 became the first Japanese premier at 44.",

      "Sunday\u2019s protests were organized by artists and left-wing groups that have struggled to mobilize large crowds compared with the right. On Sept. 7, ahead of Bolsonaro\u2019s Supreme Court trial, thousands of his supporters rallied in his defense.",
      "Two weeks ago, right-wing demonstrators unfurled a huge U.S. flag during a protest in Sao Paulo, with many thanking Trump for the sanctions against Brazil.",
      "Trump called the trial a witch hunt, and in July announced a 50% tariff on Brazilian imported goods and explicitly linked the import tax to Bolsonaro\u2019s fate. Later, the U.S. Treasury Department placed sanctions on Supreme Court JusticeAlexandre de Moraes, who oversaw the case and is seen by Bolsonaro as a foe.",
      "On Sunday, the left sought to counter that symbolism by unfurling a giant Brazilian flag on the same avenue. Posters, T-shirts and stickers not only rejected amnesty and expanded protections for lawmakers but also asserted national pride and defended Brazil\u2019s sovereignty in response to Trump\u2019s sanctions.",
      "Polls show the country remains deeply divided over Bolsonaro.",
      "According to a Datafolha poll released Sept. 16, 50% of respondents said Bolsonaro should be jailed, while 43% disagreed and 7% declined to answer. The survey interviewed 2,005 people nationwide and had a margin of error of 2 percentage points.",

      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un says he still has good memories of U.S. President Donald Trump and urged Washington to drop its demand to surrender his nukes as a precondition for resuming long-stalled diplomacy",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un says he still has good memories of U.S. President Donald Trump and urged Washington to drop its demand the North surrender its nukes as a precondition for resuming long-stalled diplomacy.",
      "Speaking to Pyongyang\u2019s rubber-stamp parliament on Sunday, Kim stressed that he has no intention of ever resuming dialogue with rival South Korea, a key U.S. ally that helped broker Kim\u2019s previous summits with Trump during the American president\u2019s first term, according to a speech published by state media on Monday.",
      "Kim suspended virtually all cooperation with the South following the collapse of his second summit with Trump in 2019 over disagreements about U.S.-led sanctions against the North. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have worsened in recent years as Kim has accelerated his weapons buildup and aligned with Russia over the war in Ukraine.",
      "Kim\u2019s comments came as South Korean President Lee Jae Myung departed for New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly, where he is expected to address nuclear tensions on the Korean Peninsula and call on North Korea to return to talks.",
      "Trump is also expected to visit South Korea next month to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, prompting media speculation that he may try to meet Kim at the inter-Korean border, as they did during their third meeting in 2019, which ultimately failed to salvage their nuclear diplomacy.",
      "During his latest speech at the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly, Kim reiterated that he would never give up his nuclear weapons program, which experts say he sees as his strongest guarantee of survival and the extension of his family\u2019s dynastic rule.",
      "\u201cThe world already knows well what the United States does after forcing other countries to give up their nuclear weapons and disarm,\u201d Kim said. \u201cWe will never lay down our nuclear weapons \u2026 There will be no negotiations, now or ever, about trading anything with hostile countries in exchange for lifting sanctions.\u201d",

      "Kim has stepped up testing activities in recent years, demonstrating weapons of various ranges designed to strike U.S. allies in Asia and the U.S. mainland. Analysts say Kim\u2019s nuclear push is aimed at eventually pressuring Washington to accept the idea of the North as a nuclear power and to negotiate economic and security concessions from a position of strength.",
      "Kim is also trying to bolster his leverage by strengthening cooperation with traditional allies Russia and China, in an emerging partnership aimed at undercutting U.S. influence.",
      "He has sent thousands of troops and huge supplies of military equipment to Russia to help support President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine. He visited Beijing earlier this month, sharing the spotlight with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Putin at a massive military parade. Experts say Kim\u2019s rare foreign trip was likely intended to boost his leverage ahead of a potential resumption of talks with the United States.",
      "There\u2019s growing concern in Seoul that it could lose its voice in future efforts to defuse the nuclear standoff on the peninsula, as the North seeks to negotiate directly with the United States. Such fears were amplified last year when Kim declared that he was abandoning North Korea\u2019s long-standing goal of peaceful unification with South Korea and ordered a rewriting of the North\u2019s constitution to cement the South as a permanent enemy.",

      "Conservationists mark world rhino day on Monday while they are still in a constant battle against poaching",
      "DINOKENG GAME RESERVE, South Africa -- The Dinokeng Game Reserve in South Africa has a thriving rhino population, but their exact numbers and the details of the security operation that keeps them safe from poaching are closely guarded secrets.",
      "They are the protocols that reserves with rhinos follow to ensure they're not the next target for poachers who still kill on average one rhino every day in South Africa for their horns despite decades of work to save the endangered species.",
      "South Africa has the largest populations of both black and southern white rhinos of any country and sees itself as the custodian of the animals' future.",
      "As conservationists mark World Rhino Day on Monday, South Africa remains in a constant and costly battle against poaching nearly 30 years after black rhinos were declared critically endangered, and more than a half-century since southern white rhinos were on the brink of extinction with just a few dozen left.",
      "South Africa has more than 2,000 of the 6,700 black rhinos left in the wild or in reserves and 12,000-13,000 of the world's 15,000 remaining southern white rhinos, which are now listed as near threatened after a turnaround. Those two species are only found in the wild in Africa. South Africa has a pivotal place in saving them but also is the epicenter of rhino poaching that is linked to organized crime.",
      "South Africa's rhinos are spread between government-run parks and private owners like Dinokeng.",
      "The country has made marked progress in the last decade with that public-private collaboration, bringing the number of rhinos killed by poachers from well over 1,000 every year to 420 last year. Yet, 195 rhinos were killed by poachers in the first half of this year, according to the South African Environment Ministry, still one every day.",
      "\u201cPlease do not tell a ranger that we\u2019re not going to win this war,\u201d said Marius Fuls, a wildlife monitor and ranger at Dinokeng. \"If we as conservationists stop believing that we\u2019re going to win this, then we have lost it. We\u2019re the last thin green line between the extinction of rhinos.\u201d",
      "In South Africa and elsewhere, anti-poaching efforts now employ high-tech tactics to help rangers. Reserves are using drones, night surveillance equipment, radar technology, motion-sensing cameras and artificial intelligence. Rhinos at Dinokeng are fitted with tracking devices so rangers know where they are. Rangers also patrol with K-9 dog units.",
      "Dinokeng has been successful in protecting its rhinos, but there is no letup. \u201cIt would be naive to think that poaching is not a threat even though we haven\u2019t had incidents in many years,\" Fuls said. \"Poaching is always a threat.\"",
      "Some reserves continue to dehorn their rhinos to make them useless to poachers who kill them because of the high demand for rhino horn products for medicinal and other uses in parts of Asia. Studies indicate that rhino horn products sold through illegal markets sometimes fetch higher prices than gold.",
      "The fight against poaching is always looking for new ways to stop rhinos being killed. This year, a group of scientists in South Africa working with the International Atomic Energy Agency launched a program to inject small amounts of radioactive material into rhinos' horns. The aim is to make them unsellable, but also detectable if they are smuggled through borders.",
      "The scientists said the radioactive material does not harm the rhinos.",
      "Conservationists are also moving rhinos to new areas in a repeat of South Africa's famous Operation Rhino of the 1960s. That operation was a reaction to the drastic situation of southern white rhinos, which were nearly extinct. It moved some of the last remaining white rhinos in eastern South Africa to other areas so they could be better protected and establish new breeding populations. It is credited with saving the southern white rhino.",

      "The operation \u2014 expensive and complicated \u2014 has returned rhinos to Zinave for the first time in more than 40 years and the population is already growing, with eight rhino calves born there since the relocation, according to Peace Parks.",
      "\"It's been an incredible success story,\" said Gillian Rhodes, combating wildlife crime program manager at Peace Parks Foundation. But she added rhino poaching rates are still \u201cdevastating.\u201d",

      "Rhinos were hunted to extinction in Uganda, but the species was reintroduced in 1996 and the country is now home to 50, said James Musinguzi, executive director of the Uganda Wildlife Authority.",

      "Defense lawyers in the Holy See\u2019s \u201ctrial of the century\u201d have asked the Vatican prosecutor to recuse himself from the appeals trial",
      "VATICAN CITY -- Defense lawyers in the Holy See's \u201ctrial of the century\u201d asked the Vatican prosecutor to recuse himself from the appeals trial Monday, arguing he was implicated in questionable behavior according to years of private WhatsApp messages that have shaken the proceedings.",
      "The chats show Prosecutor Alessandro Diddi has a personal interest in the outcome that should preclude him from heading the prosecution, the lawyers said in separate motions on the opening day of the appeals trial.",
      "The tribunal president, Archbishop Alejandro Arellano Cedillo, accepted the motions and ordered Diddi to respond within three days, underscoring how the chats have shifted the ground under the Vatican\u2019s most ambitious and high-profile prosecution of alleged financial misconduct.",
      "The trial concerning the Vatican\u2019s 350 million euro ($412 million) investment in a London property resulted in the 2023 conviction of nine people on a host of finance-related charges. The star defendant was Cardinal Angelo Becciu, once a close confidante of Pope Francis and a future papal contender.",
      "The investigation took a crucial turn in August 2020 when the prime suspect in the London deal, Monsignor Alberto Perlasca, changed his story and turned on his onetime boss, Becciu. Perlasca escaped indictment and became a prime prosecution witness; Becciu was convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to 5 1/2 years.",
      "Recently, thousands of pages of WhatsApp texts and audio messages have provided the backstory to Perlasca\u2019s change of heart. They suggest questionable behavior by Vatican police, Diddi and Francis himself.",
      "They document a behind-the-scenes effort by two women, Francesca Chaouqui and Genevieve Ciferri, to target the cardinal by persuading Perlasca to turn on him. While the claims are unverified, the defense has seized on them as evidence that the investigation was contaminated from the start and the defendants couldn\u2019t get a fair trial in the Vatican, an absolute monarchy where Francis intervened on behalf of prosecutors.",
      "The chats \"demonstrate a disturbing activity of evidence tampering,\u201d the lawyers wrote, citing various instances in which it appeared Chaouqui was in close contact with Diddi's office and provided Perlasca with advice purportedly from investigators.",
      "The existence of the messages first jolted the trial in 2022 when Diddi told the court that Ciferri had forwarded him 126 chats she exchanged with Chaouqui. Diddi entered the messages into evidence but redacted all but eight, prompting defense complaints that he was withholding crucial evidence.",
      "The additional chats now circulating show Diddi had more than 126 chats in 2022 and that Ciferri continued forwarding him content for four days. Diddi had said he blocked her after the first night. Diddi also said he didn't know either Ciferri or Chaouqui.",
      "The defense lawyers also cited an audio file suggesting Vatican Police Commissioner Stefano De Santis gave Chaouqui advice for Perlasca about how to implicate others when he was still a suspect. After Perlasca changed his story, he not only escaped prosecution but was listed as an injured party in the trial and became a prosecutor in another Vatican court.",

      "During Monday\u2019s hearing in a frescoed courtroom in the Apostolic Palace, Diddi thanked the defense for providing the opportunity to respond to the allegations and said he would take the three days to \u201cexpress my thoughts calmly, in order to dispel the doubts that have arisen in recent months about the conduct of the investigation.\u201d",

      "Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa has arrived in New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly",
      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa arrived in New York on Sunday to take part in the U.N. General Assembly, the first president of Syria to do so in nearly six decades.",
      "The last time a Syrian head of state attended the General Assembly was in 1967. That was before the 50-year rule of the Assad family dynasty, which came to an end in December when then-President Bashar Assad was ousted in a lightning insurgent offensive led by al-Sharaa. Assad\u2019s fall also brought to an end nearly 14 years of civil war.",
      "Since then, al-Sharaa has sought to restore ties with Arab countries and the West, where officials were initially wary of his past ties with the al-Qaida militant group. The rebel group he formerly led, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, was previously designated by the United States as a terrorist group.",
      "Since assuming power, al-Sharaa has preached coexistence and sought to reassure Syria\u2019s minority communities, but the country\u2019s fragile recovery has been threatened by outbreaks of sectarian violence. Fighters affiliated with the new government were also accused of killing hundreds of civilians from the Druze and Alawite religious minorities.",
      "Along with his appearance at the U.N. General Assembly, al-Sharaa is likely to use his visit to push for further sanctions relief for Syria as it attempts to rebuild its war-battered economy and infrastructure.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump met with al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia in May and announced that he would lift decades of sanctions imposed on Syria under the Assads\u2019 rule.",
      "He followed through by ordering a large swathe of sanctions lifted or waived. However, the most stringent sanctions were imposed by Congress under the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act passed in 2019 and will require a congressional vote to permanently remove them.",

      "Another topic that will loom large during al-Sharaa\u2019s visit is his country\u2019s relations with U.S. ally Israel. Since Assad\u2019s fall, Israel has been suspicious of al-Sharaa\u2019s government and has seized a formerly U.N.-patrolled buffer zone in southern Syria and launched hundreds of airstrikes on Syrian military sites.",
      "Negotiations have been underway for a security deal that al-Sharaa has said he hopes will bring about a withdrawal of Israeli forces and return to a 1974 disengagement agreement. While al-Sharaa said last week that a deal could be reached in a matter of days, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in remarks Sunday appeared to downplay the odds of a breakthrough.",
      "\u201cThere is some progress\u201d but the deal is \u201cstill a vision for the future,\u201d he said.",
      "Also on Sunday, Syrian elections officials announced that the country\u2019s first parliamentary elections since the fall of Assad will take place on Oct. 5. The members of the People\u2019s Assembly will not be chosen via a direct popular vote, however, but through an electoral college system with electoral bodies in each province voting for two-thirds of the seats, while al-Sharaa will directly appoint one third.",
      "Officials have said that holding direct elections at this stage would be too logistically challenging since many Syrians have lost personal documentation or are living as refugees abroad after the nearly 14-year civil war.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's appointee to the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors said Monday that the central bank's key interest rate should be much lower than its current 4.1% level, staking out a position far different than his colleagues.",
      "Stephen Miran, who is also a top economic adviser to Trump, said in remarks to the Economic Club of New York that sharp declines in immigration, rising tariff revenue, and an aging population all suggest that the Fed's rate should be closer to 2.5% instead. According to projections released last week, that's almost a full percentage point lower than any of his 18 colleagues on the Fed's rate-setting committee, an unusually high divergence.",
      "Miran's comments underscore the different perspective he brings to the Fed's deliberations over interest rate policy. His appointment has been controversial because he has kept his position as the head of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers while taking unpaid leave, raising concerns about the Fed's traditional independence from day-to-day politics.",
      "His term on the Fed's board expires in January, and Miran has said he expects to return to the White House after that, and is keeping his position because his Fed term is so short. But he could remain on the board until a successor is appointed. There hasn't been a member of the executive branch on the Fed's board since the 1930s.",
      "Concerns about the Fed's independence are heightened because Trump has also repeatedly attacked Chair Jerome Powell and has called for the Fed to reduce its rate to as low as 1.2%.

      "The trial scheduled to begin Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court will revolve around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google's digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue.",

The Justice Department contends a breakup would be the most effective and quickest way to undercut a monopoly that has been stifling competition and innovation for years.",

      "In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month.",
      "Even though Google didn't agree with all aspects of Mehta's decision, the ruling was widely seen as a slap on the wrist \u2014 a sentiment that has helped propel Alphabet's stock price to new highs. The 20% gain since Mehta's decision helped make Alphabet only the fourth publicly traded company to reach a market value of $3 trillion \u2014 an increase of more than $1 trillion since Brinkema branded Google's ad technology as a monopoly in April.",

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed a bill extending the state's cap-and-trade program through 2045",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday extended a signature state program aimed at reducing planet-warming emissions through 2045, a move Democrats cheered but Republicans warned would raise gas prices.",
      "The program known as cap and trade sets a declining limit on total greenhouse gas emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their pollution. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.",
      "It was set to expire after 2030. The law Newsom signed Friday at the Morrison Planetarium in San Francisco potentially boosts carbon-removal projects and requires the program to align with California's target of achieving so-called carbon neutrality by 2045. That means the state will remove as many carbon emissions as it releases. The law changes the name to \u201ccap and invest\u201d to emphasize that the money goes toward other programs.",

      "Newsom also signed a law committing $1 billion in program revenue for the state\u2019s long-delayed high-speed rail project, $800 million for an affordable housing program, $250 million for community air protection programs and $1 billion for the Legislature to decide on annually.",
      "He approved other measures aimed at advancing the state\u2019s energy transition and lowering costs for Californians. They include laws to speed up permitting for oil production in Kern County, refill a fund that covers the cost of wildfire damage when utility equipment sparks a blaze and allow the state\u2019s grid operator to partner with a regional group to manage power markets in western states.",
      "Newsom also signed a bill that would increase requirements for air monitoring in areas overburdened by pollution and codify a bureau within the Justice Department created in 2018 to protect communities from environmental injustices.",
      "California has some of the highest utility and gas prices in the country. Officials face increased pressure to stabilize the cost and supply of fuel amid the planned closures of two oil refineries that make up roughly 18% of the state\u2019s refining capacity, according to energy regulators.",

The program's \u201ccap\u201d applies to planet-warming emissions, not other pollutants impacting air quality. Cap and trade doesn't set emissions limits for individual facilities, meaning an industrial polluter could continue to emit the same amount of greenhouse gases over time so long as it has the right amount of credits or offsets.",
      "Other critics of the cap-and-trade extension are worried about it raising costs. The program has increased gas costs by about 26 cents per gallon, according to a February report from the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that analyzes the program. It has played \u201ca very small role\u201d in increasing electricity prices because the state\u2019s grid isn\u2019t very carbon intensive, the report says.",

Tony Strickland said in a statement. \u201cTheir idea of tackling affordability is extending the Cap-and-Trade program, a hidden tax that drives up costs on everything from gas to groceries. That\u2019s not climate leadership. I call it economic sabotage.\u201d",
      "But Democratic Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin, who wrote the reauthorization bill, said it will help the state fight climate change because \u201cthe cost of inaction is immeasurable.\u201d She referenced the devastating wildfire that ripped through Pacific Palisades in her district in January.",

      "The U.S. Department of Education paused federal student loan payments in March 2020, offering borrowers relief during the economic chaos of the coronavirus pandemic.

Among the jobs exempted from tax on tips are sommeliers, cocktail waiters, pastry chefs, cake bakers, bingo workers, club dancers, DJs, clowns, podcasters, influencers, online video creators, ushers, maids, gardeners, electricians, house cleaners, tow truck drivers, wedding planners, personal care aides, tutors, au pairs, massage therapists, yoga instructors, skydiving pilots, ski instructors, parking garage attendants, delivery drivers and movers.",

However, tip pools and similar arrangements qualify, so long as they are reported to the IRS and voluntary. The benefit is not available to married individuals who file their taxes separately.",
      "The tip must be given in cash, check, debit card, gift card or any item exchangeable for a fixed amount of cash, unlike digital assets. And any amount received for illegal activity, prostitution services, or pornographic activity does not qualify as a tip, according to the Treasury Department.",

Others taking the stage at the University of Minnesota's football stadium will include Dave Matthews,Margo Price,Kenny Chesney,Wynonna Judd, and Nathaniel Rateliff.",
      "This year\u2019s concert comes at a worrying time for American farmers. Farm profitability has been falling. Crop prices are low while production costs are rising. And the Trump administration\u2019s trade wars have added to the insecurity.

Organizers said they would not cross the picket lines of striking teamster service workers at the university, saying \u201cthe farm and labor movements are inseparable.\u201d Nelson got on the phone with Gov. Tim Walz. The university and union reached a deal late last week.",

      "Thursday's order from Bridges said the plaintiffs' experts confirmed and expanded upon the NTSB finding that the crash was \u201cwas due to operational and maintenance errors committed by\" the remaining defendants.",
      "The judgment entered for Jillian Myers was actually $126.3 million against the defendants \u2014 a $105 million total agreed upon by attorneys on both sides of the case and that Bridges found was a fair and reasonable settlement valuation \u2014 along with accrued interest.",
      "But by agreement the defendants' primary insurers will pay $50 million. Jillian Myers now will be able to seek the rest of the amount against the companies' excess or umbrella insurance carriers, her attorney Gary C. Robb said on Friday. Those carriers recently told the defendants they were declining their additional layers of coverage for the wrongful death claims, Thursday order says.",

      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Thursday didn\u2019t confirm the call or any upcoming summit between the leaders, but spokesperson Liu Pengyu said \u201cheads-of-state diplomacy plays an irreplaceable role in providing strategic guidance for China-U.S. relations.\u201d",

      "U.S. stocks edged back from their record heights",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. stocks edged back from their record heights on Tuesday as the countdown ticked toward what Wall Street expects will be the first cut of the year to interest rates  by the Federal Reserve.",
      "The S&P 500 fell 0.1% from its latest all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 125 points, or 0.3%, while the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.1% from its own record set the day before.",
      "Stocks have run to records on expectations that the Fed will announce the first of a series of cuts to rates on Wednesday in hopes of giving the economy a boost. The job market has slowed so much  that traders believe Fed officials now see it as the bigger danger for the economy than the threat of higher inflation because of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "The Fed has been holding off on cuts to rates because inflation has remained above its 2% target, and easier interest rates could give it more fuel.",
      "A report on Tuesday said shoppers increased their spending  at U.S. retailers by more last month than economists expected. A chunk of that could be due to shoppers having to pay higher prices for the same amount of stuff. But it could also indicate solid spending by U.S. households could continue to keep the economy out of a recession.",
      "The data did little to change traders\u2019 expectations for a cut to interest rates on Wednesday, followed by more through the end of the year and into 2026.",
      "Such high expectations have sent stocks to records, but they can also create disappointment if unfulfilled. That\u2019s why more attention will be on what Fed Chair Jerome Powell says about the possibility of upcoming cuts in his press conference following Wednesday\u2019s decision than on the decision itself.",
      "Fed officials will also release their latest projections for where they see interest rates and the economy heading in upcoming years, which could provide another potential flashpoint.",
      "For now, global fund managers are tilting their portfolios toward stocks at the highest level in seven months, according to the latest survey by Bank of America. That\u2019s even though a record 58% of them are also saying that stocks look too expensive at the moment.",
      "On Wall Street, Dave & Buster\u2019s fell 16.7% after the entertainment chain reported a weaker profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.",
      "New York Times Co. fell 1.6% after Trump filed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against the newspaper and four of its journalists on Monday. The lawsuit points to several articles and a book written by Times journalists and published in the lead up to the 2024 election as \u201cpart of a decades-long pattern by the New York Times of intentional and malicious defamation against President Trump.\u201d",

      "He anchored the net for the Philadelphia Flyers' only two Stanley Cups.",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Bernie Parent, the Hall of Famer considered one of the great goalies of all time who anchored the net for the Philadelphia Flyers' only two Stanley Cup championships during their Broad Street Bullies heyday, has died. He was 80.",
      "The Flyers made the announcement Sunday but provided no immediate details. Parent died overnight in his sleep, said Joe Watson, a star defenseman on their Stanley Cup teams.",
      "Parent's steel-eyed stare through his old-school hockey mask landed him on the cover of Time magazine in 1975 when the Flyers reigned as one of the marquee teams in sports. He won Stanley Cup, Conn Smythe and Vezina trophies in back-to-back seasons when the Flyers won the Stanley Cup in 1974 and 1975, the first NHL expansion team to win the championship.",
      "After he made his NHL debut with Boston in 1965, Parent was left unprotected by the Bruins in the 1967 expansion draft and was selected by the Flyers. After 3 1/2 seasons, he was traded to Toronto but ended up back in Philadelphia ahead of the 1973-74 season. He won a league-high 47 games that season and led the NHL in wins again the next season with 44.",
      "He retired with the Flyers in 1979 after 271 wins \u2014 231 of them with the Flyers \u2014 over a 13-year career. Parent was accidentally struck in the right eye with a stick in 1979 and was temporarily blinded. He never played again.",
      "The Flyers beat the Bruins in six games to win the Stanley Cup in 1974 and beat Buffalo in 1975.",
      "On the flight home from Buffalo, the Flyers plopped the Stanley Cup in the middle of the aisle. For close to 90 minutes, the Flyers couldn\u2019t take their eyes off the ultimate prize.",
      "\u201cWe were able to just sit back, look at the Stanley Cup and just savour it,\u201d Parent said in 2010. \u201cIt was just a special time.\u201d",

They embraced their moniker as the most despised team in the NHL and pounded their way into the hearts of Philadelphia Flyers fans. More than 2 million fans packed city streets for each of their championship parades.",

      "Parent was one of the more beloved Flyers and remained connected with the team over the years as an ambassador.",
      "The final career highlight came in 2011 when Parent was in the net for an alumni game outdoors at the baseball stadium Citizens Bank Park ahead of the NHL Classic. \u201cBernie! Bernie! Bernie!\u201d echoed throughout the park for the affable goalie, who played 5 minutes, 32 seconds and stopped all six shots. Each save made the \u201cBernie!\u201d chants return.",

      "\u201cThat was a heck of a battle,\u201d Missouri coach Eli Drinkwitz said. \u201cYou could tell they were ticked off about last week's performance and came in and fought. Really proud of our team for not really flinching. ... We just kept hammering away.\u201d",

And having said all that, we had the lead going into the fourth quarter and couldn't finish.\u201d",
      "Missouri rolled into the game amid a perfect start that included a win over rival Kansas, while the Gamecocks limped into town following a lopsided loss to Vanderbilt in which Sellers missed the second half after a hard blow to the head.",
      "There were questions about whether he would play early in the week. By game time, Sellers was off the injury report entirely.",
      "South Carolina needed his magic. The Tigers struck first with a 99-yard drive \u2014 their third full-field march of the season \u2014 before Sellers answered with a 49-yard touchdown throw to Vandrevius Jacobs to give the Gamecocks a 7-6 lead.",

      "Fallout from a cyberattack that affected check-in systems at several European airports has extended into a second full day",
      "BRUSSELS -- Fallout from a cyberattack that disrupted check-in systems at several European airports extended into a second full day on Sunday, as passengers faced dozens of canceled and delayed flights \u2014 and the impact poised to worsen for at least one major airport.",
      "Brussels Airport, seemingly the hardest hit, said it asked airlines to cancel nearly 140 departing flights scheduled for Monday because a U.S.-based software system provider \u201cis not yet able to deliver a new secure version of the check-in system.\u201d The airport said 25 outbound flights were canceled on Saturday and 50 on Sunday.",
      "Starting late Friday, airports in Berlin, Brussels and London were hit by disruptions to electronic systems that snarled up check-in and sent airline staffers trying options like handwriting boarding passes or using backup laptops. Many other European airports were unaffected.",
      "The cyberattack affected software of Collins Aerospace, whose systems help passengers check in, print boarding passes and bag tags, and dispatch their luggage. The U.S.-based company on Saturday cited a \u201ccyber-related disruption\u201d to its software at \"select\u201d airports in Europe.",
      "It was not immediately clear who might be behind the cyberattack, but experts said it could turn out to be hackers, criminal organizations or state actors.",
      "The European Commission, the executive branch of the 27-nation European Union, said that aviation safety and air traffic control were unaffected. There was currently no indication of a widespread or severe attack, while the origin of the incident remained under investigation, it added.",
      "While departure boards for London's Heathrow and Berlin's Brandenburg airports were showing signs of smoother arrivals and departures on Sunday, Brussels Airport was still facing considerable issues.",
      "Brussels Airport said in an email Sunday that it had asked airlines to cancel half of the 276 scheduled departing flights on Monday, \u201cbecause Collins Aerospace is not yet able to deliver a new secure version of the check-in system.\u201d Cancellations and delays will continue as long as manual check-in is necessary, it said.",
      "RTX Corp., the parent company of Collins Aerospace, did not immediately respond to two emails Sunday seeking comment.",

      "Formally known as the Agreement on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction, the treaty is the first legally binding agreement aimed at protecting marine biodiversity in international waters.

      "The treaty creates a legal process for countries to establish marine protected areas in the high seas, including rules for potentially destructive activities like deep-sea mining and geoengineering. It also establishes a framework for technology-sharing, funding mechanisms and scientific collaboration among countries.",

      "As AI increasingly becomes a part of daily life, it's found a foothold in medical care \u2014 providing everything from note-taking during exams to electronic nurses. While heralded by some for the efficiency it brings, others worry about its impact on patient care.",
      "Robin is about 30% autonomous, while a team of operators working remotely controls the rest under the watchful eyes of clinical staff. Khachikyan said that with each interaction, they\u2019re able to collect more data \u2014 while still complying with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA \u2014 and get closer to it being able to function independently.",
      "\u201cImagine a pure emotional intelligence like WALL-E. We\u2019re trying to create that,\u201d he said, referencing the 2008 animated film.",

      "The robot with a sleek white triangle-shaped frame that Khachikyan said was designed for hugging, rolled into a room with a teenager injured in a car accident. The robot played what it described as his favorite song \u2014 \u201cNo Fear\u201d by DeJ Loaf \u2014 and he danced along. In the hallway, Robin cracked up a young child held by her mother when it put on a series of silly glasses and a big red nose. In another room, the robot played a simplified version of tic-tac-toe with a patient.",
      "Samantha da Silva, speech language pathologist at the hospital, said patients light up when Robin comes into their room and not only remembers their names but their favorite music.",
      "\u201cShe brings joy to everyone,\u201d da Silva said. \u201cShe walks down the halls, everyone loves to chat with her, say hello.\u201d",
      "Robin mirrors the emotions of the person it is talking with, explained Khachikyan. If the patient is laughing then the robot laughs along, but if they're sharing something difficult, its face reflects sadness and empathy.",
      "In nursing homes, Robin plays memory games with people suffering from dementia, takes them through breathing exercises on difficult days and offers them a form of companionship that resembles a grandchild with a grandparent.",
      "Khachikyan recalled a moment last year at a facility in Los Angeles where a woman was having a panic attack and asked specifically for the robot. Robin played songs by her favorite musician and videos of her favorite animal \u2014 Elvis Presley and puppies \u2014 until she had calmed down.",

      "The two men also spoke in June to defuse tensions over China\u2019s restrictions on the export of rare earth elements, used in everything from smartphones to fighter jets.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m speaking with President Xi, as you know, on Friday, having to do with TikTok and also trade,\u201d Trump said Thursday. \u201cAnd we\u2019re very close to deals on all of it.\u201d",
      "He said his relationship with China is \u201cvery good\u201d but noted that Russia's war in Ukraine could end if European countries put higher tariffs on China. Trump didn\u2019t say if he planned to raise tariffs on Beijing over its purchase of Moscow's oil, as he has done with India.",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Thursday didn\u2019t confirm the call or any upcoming summit between the leaders, but spokesperson Liu Pengyu said \u201cheads-of-state diplomacy plays an irreplaceable role in providing strategic guidance for China-U.S. relations.\u201d",
      "Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Washington-based think tank Stimson Center, predicted a positive discussion.",
      "\u201cBoth sides have strong desire for the leadership summit to happen, while the details lie in the trade deal and what can be achieved for both sides from the summit,\u201d Sun said.",
      "Following a U.S.-China trade meeting earlier this week in Madrid, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the sides reached a framework deal on TikTok's ownership but Trump and Xi likely would finalize it Friday.",
      "Trump, who has credited the app with helping him win another term, has extended a deadline several times for the app to be spun off from its Chinese parent company ByteDance. It is a requirement to allow TikTok to keep operating in the U.S. under a law passed last year seeking to address data privacy and national security concerns.",
      "Trump said TikTok \u201chas tremendous value\u201d and the U.S. \u201chas that value in its hand because we\u2019re the ones that have to approve it.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials have been concerned about ByteDance\u2019s roots and ownership, pointing to laws in China that require Chinese companies to hand over data requested by the government. Another concern is the proprietary algorithm that populates what users see on TikTok.",

The next deadline is on Sept. 17, and Trump has already signaled he would extend it if needed.",
      "It is not clear how many times Trump can keep extending the ban as the government continues to try to negotiate a deal for TikTok, which is owned by China\u2019s ByteDance. While there is no clear legal basis for the extensions, so far, there have been no legal challenges against the administration. Trump has amassed more than 15 million followers on TikTok since he joined last year, and he has credited the trendsetting platform with helping him gain traction among young voters.

      "A recent Pew Research Center survey found that about one-third of Americans said they supported a TikTok ban, down from 50% in March 2023. Roughly one-third said they would oppose a ban, and a similar percentage said they weren\u2019t sure.",

      "During his first term as president, Trump led the effort to ban TikTok, saying it posed a threat to U.S. national security. But his tune changed when he returned to the White House a second time, signing an executive order on his first day in office to keep the app running.",
      "During Joe Biden\u2019s Democratic presidency, Congress and the White House used national security grounds to approve a U.S. ban on TikTok unless its Chinese parent company sold its controlling stake.",

      "The executive order signed on Tuesday by Trump was the fourth time he has bypassed federal law to prolong the deadline for the China-associated TikTok to sell its assets to an American company or face a ban. The original deadline set by Congress was Jan. 19 of this year, a day before Trump took the oath of office for his second term.",
      "Trump was asked Tuesday about the framework deal he announced a day earlier and repeated that he would discuss TikTok with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday.

      "The suit claimed stories by TMZ and Yahoo amplified and sensationalized the Times\u2019 reporting and smeared the tribe in the process. Yahoo was dismissed as a defendant earlier this month.",
      "Murillo wrote in her ruling that though some may \u201creasonably perceive\u201d the Times\u2019 and TMZ\u2019s reporting as \u201cinsensitive, disparaging or reflecting a lack of respect, the Court need not, and does not, determine which of these characterizations is most apt.\u201d",

      "The lawsuit sought at least $180 million, including both general and punitive damages, from each of the defendants.",
      "The suit argued that the Times\u2019 story by reporter Jack Nicas on how the group was handling the introduction of internet service via Starlink satellites operated by Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX \u201cportrayed the Marubo people as a community unable to handle basic exposure to the internet, highlighting allegations that their youth had become consumed by pornography.\u201d",
      "The court disagreed with the tribe\u2019s claims that the Times article falsely implied its youth were \u201caddicted to pornography,\u201d noting that the coverage only mentioned unidentified young men had access to porn and did not state that the tribe as a whole was addicted to pornography.",
      "Nicas reported that in less than a year of Starlink access, the tribe was dealing with the same struggles the rest of the world has dealt with for years due to the pervasive effects of the internet. The challenges ranged from \u201cteenagers glued to phones; group chats full of gossip; addictive social networks; online strangers; violent video games; scams; misinformation; and minors watching pornography,\" Nicas wrote.",
      "He also wrote that a tribal leader said young men were sharing explicit videos in group chats. The piece doesn't mention porn elsewhere, but other outlets amplified that aspect of the story. TMZ posted a story with the headline, \u201cElon Musk\u2019s Starlink Hookup Leaves A Remote Tribe Addicted To Porn.\u201d",
      "The Times published a follow-up story in response to misperceptions brought on by other outlets in which Nicas wrote: \u201cThe Marubo people are not addicted to pornography. There was no hint of this in the forest, and there was no suggestion of it in The New York Times\u2019s article.\u201d",
      "Nicas wrote that he spent a week with the Marubo tribe. The lawsuit claimed that while he was invited for a week, he spent less than 48 hours in the village, \u201cbarely enough time to observe, understand, or respectfully engage with the community.\"",

      "\u201cThey\u2019ve never felt the palm of a hand. We try to calm them,\u201d said Trujillo, sporting a pink dolphin bandana. \u201cTaking a dolphin out of the water, it\u2019s a kind of abduction.\u201d",
      "One person counts the dolphin's breaths. Another wets its skin with a sponge while the others conduct multiple medical tests that will help show how much mercury is coursing through the Amazon\u2019s most graceful predators.",
      "Trujillo directs the Omacha Foundation, a conservation group focused on aquatic wildlife and river ecosystems, and leads health evaluations of river dolphins. It's a painstaking operation involving experienced fishermen, veterinarians and locals that takes months of planning and happens a couple of times a year.",
      "\u201cWe take blood and tissue samples to assess mercury,\u00a8 Trujillo told The Associated Press from the Colombian riverside town of Puerto Narino. \u201cBasically, we\u2019re using dolphins as sentinels for the river\u2019s health.\u201d",
      "Mercury contamination comes mainly from illegal gold mining \u2014 a growing industry across the Amazon Basin \u2014 and forest clearing that washes mercury that naturally occurs in soil into waterways.",
      "The miners use mercury to separate gold from sediment, then dump the sludge back into rivers, where it enters fish eaten by people and dolphins. Rising global gold prices have fueled a mining boom, and mercury pollution in remote waterways has increased.",
      "Mercury can damage the brain, kidneys, lungs and immune system and cause mood swings, memory loss and muscle weakness in people, according to the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Pregnant women and young children are most at risk, with prenatal exposure linked to developmental delays and reduced cognitive function.",
      "\u201cThe maximum any living being should have is 1 milligram per kilogram,\u201d Trujillo said. \u201cHere, we\u2019re seeing 20 to 30 times that amount.\u201d",
      "In previous years, his team found 16 to 18 milligrams per kilogram of mercury in dolphins, which can suffer the same neurological damage, organ damage and other problems as humans. In Colombia\u2019s Orinoco River, levels in some dolphins have reached as high as 42, levels scientists say are among the most extreme ever recorded in the species.",
      "Trujillo said it's difficult to prove the toxin is directly killing dolphins. Further studies are underway, he added, noting that \u201cany mammal with a huge amount of mercury will die.\u201d",
      "When Trujillo and his team tested their own blood three years ago, his results showed more than 36 times the safe limit \u2014 36.4 milligrams per kilogram \u2014 a level he attributes to decades working in mercury-affected areas and a diet heavy in fish. With medical assistance, his levels have dropped to about 7 milligrams.",
      "\u201cMercury is an invisible enemy until it builds up to a sufficient amount, then it starts to affect the central nervous system,\u201d Trujillo told AP after his team managed to capture and test four pink dolphins. \u201cWe\u2019re already seeing evidence of it in Indigenous communities.\u201d",
      "A series of scientific studies and reports \u2014 including work by the International Pollutants Elimination Network and academic researchers \u2014 have found high mercury exposure among Indigenous peoples across the Amazon, including in Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Suriname and Bolivia. Hair samples showed averages well above WHO's safe threshold of 1 part per million, with one Colombian community registering more than 22 milligrams per kilogram.",

      "Dolphin populations in this part of the Amazon have plunged, with Trujillo\u2019s monitoring showing a 52% decline in pink dolphins and a 34% drop in gray river dolphins, a different species, in recent decades. The International Union for Conservation of Nature listed the pink dolphin as endangered in 2018. Trujillo said exact numbers for the Amazon are unknown, but his organization estimates 30,000 to 45,000 across the basin.",
      "Pink river dolphins also face threats from overfishing, accidental entanglement in nets, boat traffic, habitat loss and prolonged drought.",
      "Colombia says it's tackling illegal mining and mercury pollution. It banned mercury use in mining in 2018, ratified the Minamata Convention aimed at reducing mercury in the environment and submitted an action plan in 2024.

      "Other Amazon nations say they\u2019re stepping up. Brazil has launched raids and moved to restrict satellite internet used by illegal gold-mining camps that use mercury, aiming to disrupt logistics and supply lines. Peru recently seized a record 4 tons of smuggled mercury. Ecuador, Suriname and Guyana have filed action plans to cut mercury use in small-scale gold mining.",
      "The dolphin testing operation relies on Jos\u00e9 \u201cMariano\u201d Rangel, a charismatic former fisherman from Venezuela. He leads the charge when it\u2019s time to haul the animals \u2014 which can weigh as much as 160 kilograms (about 353 pounds) \u2014 into the small boats. It's a moment that can end with a stinging blow to the jaw as the dolphins thrash to break free.",
      "\u201cThe most difficult part of the captures is enclosing the dolphins,\u201d Rangel said.",
      "A portable ultrasound machine scans lungs, heart and other vital organs for disease. The team checks for respiratory problems, internal injuries and signs of reproduction, photograph the animals' skin and scars, swab blowholes and genital openings for bacterial cultures, and collect tissue for mercury testing. Microchips are implanted so researchers can identify each animal and avoid duplicating tests.",
      "Omacha has recorded antimicrobial resistance \u2014 bacteria that can\u2019t be killed by common medicines \u2014 and respiratory problems. They have also identified possible emerging diseases, such as papilloma virus, that could pose risks to both dolphins and humans.",
      "After a long morning hauling and testing dolphins, the scientists return to a laboratory in Puerto Narino that's covered with posters of dolphins and manatees and the bones and skulls of dolphins and other animals. They test some samples, prepare others to send to larger facilities and end their day repairing nets and refilling kits to do it all again at dawn.",
      "For Trujillo, each capture, scan and blood test is part of a larger fight.",
      "\u201cWe are one step away from being critically endangered and then extinct,\u201d Trujillo said.",

      "It was a combative affair for much of the night.",

      "Security was tight at the town hall-style debate at Rider University, which played out shortly after the memorial for slain conservative leader Charlie Kirk in Arizona.",
      "The tense national climate looms over the contest in New Jersey, which has drawn intense interest from the White House, activists and political leaders on both sides with Election Day just six weeks away.",
      "Long considered a reliably blue state in national elections, New Jersey has swung between Republicans and Democrats during its odd-year gubernatorial elections. Trump lost here by just 6 points last fall, a credit to his appeal among the state\u2019s large working-class population.",
      "Here are some top takeaways from Sunday night\u2019s clash:",
      "Trump, as he often does, played a central role in the debate even while being thousands of miles away at Kirk\u2019s memorial.",
      "Over and over, Sherrill linked Ciattarelli to the Republican president and his far-right MAGA movement and his more controversial policies. It was her most consistent theme throughout the 90-minute debate and underscored the extent to which she hopes to nationalize the state contest.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll do whatever Trump tells him to do,\u201d Sherrill declared in her opening statement.",
      "Ciattarelli did not criticize Trump or break with the Republican president on any issue, expressing support for his \u201cbig, beautiful\" budget bill and his plans to end the Department of Education and revise national vaccine policies.",
      "At the same time, he described himself as \u201cindependent\u201d and tried to create some space between him and the president at times.",
      "\u201cMy job is to advocate for the 9.3 million citizens of this state, and I\u2019ll always do right by the citizens of this state, no matter who occupies the White House,\u201d Ciattarelli said.",
      "Both candidates weighed in on Kirk\u2019s death, condemned political violence and vowed to defend free speech.",
      "And yet there were few moments of unity on a night that was tense from beginning to end and featured several harsh exchanges. At one point, Sherrill questioned her opponent's math skills.",

      "She also highlighted some of Kirk\u2019s more divisive rhetoric and referenced ABC's suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel after comments that he made about Kirk's killing.",
      "\u201cI think it is fair to have free speech, but I think it should go to everyone, to Jimmy Kimmel and to myself as well,\u201d Sherrill said.",
      "While Election Day is just six weeks away, it was clear that the candidates were still working to introduce themselves to voters who may just be starting to pay attention to the off-year election.",

      "Ciattarelli sought to link New Jersey\u2019s high tax rates to the Democrats who have run state government in recent years.",
      "\u201cThe Democrats have controlled our state legislature for 25 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Democrats have controlled the executive branch, the governorship for eight years and look where we are today.\u201d",

      "FORT PIERCE, Fla. -- Ryan Routh texted his three adult children and his fiancee separately to tell them he loved them, according to cellphone records, shortly before authorities say he was spotted by a U.S. Secret Service agent, who identified Routh as the man who tried to assassinate President Donald Trump at his Florida golf course.",
      "Later that same day, Routh called his fiancee from the Palm Beach County jail to tell her about his arrest, but she already knew. \u201cEverybody knows, it\u2019s been hours,\u201d the woman can be heard saying on a recording of the call. \u201cThe whole world knows.\u201d",
      "Routh is representing himself in federal court after being charged with trying kill Trump and is set to present his defense Monday, calling just three witnesses.",
      "Seasoned prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida rested their case Friday afternoon after spending seven days questioning 38 witnesses in an attempt to make sure Routh spends the rest of his life in prison.",
      "Prosecutors have said Routh spent weeks plotting to kill Trump before aiming a rifle through shrubbery as Trump played golf on Sept. 15, 2024, at his West Palm Beach country club.",
      "Routh has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations.",
      "He told U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon on Friday that he only needs half a day or so to present his defense. He has indicated that he plans to call a firearms expert and two character witnesses. He hasn\u2019t said whether he plans to testify himself.",
      "Cannon signed off on Routh\u2019s request to represent himself following two hearings in July. Routh told the judge that his court-appointed federal public defenders were diligent, but they didn\u2019t listen to him and were afraid of him.",
      "\u201cHow are they supposed to represent me and say I\u2019m not a dangerous person when they don\u2019t believe that?\u201d Routh said in July.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court has held that criminal defendants have a right to represent themselves in court proceedings, as long as they can show a judge they are competent to waive their right to be defended by an attorney. Routh's former defense attorneys have served as standby counsel since Routh took over his own defense and have been present during trial the past two weeks.",
      "Cannon said attorneys should be prepared to deliver their closing arguments Tuesday, giving each side one hour and 45 minutes. Jurors will begin deliberating after that. Cannon had initially blocked off more than three weeks for the trial at the Fort Pierce federal courthouse, but Routh's relatively short cross-examinations have led to a quicker pace than anticipated.",

      "Law enforcement obtained help from a witness who testified that he saw a person fleeing the area after hearing gunshots. The witness was then flown in a police helicopter to a nearby interstate where Routh was arrested, and the witness said he confirmed it was the person he had seen.",
      "Just nine weeks earlier, Trump had survived an attempt on his life while campaigning in Pennsylvania. That gunman had fired eight shots, with one bullet grazing Trump\u2019s ear. The gunman was then fatally shot by a Secret Service counter sniper.",

A self-styled mercenary leader, Routh spoke out to anyone who would listen about his dangerous, sometimes violent plans to insert himself into conflicts around the world, witnesses have told The Associated Press.",
      "In the early days of the war in Ukraine, Routh tried to recruit soldiers from Afghanistan, Moldova and Taiwan to fight the Russians. In his native Greensboro, North Carolina, he was arrested in 2002 for eluding a traffic stop and barricading himself from officers with a fully automatic machine gun and a \u201cweapon of mass destruction,\u201d which turned out to be an explosive with a 10-inch (25-centimeter) fuse, police said.",
      "In 2010, police searched a warehouse Routh owned and found more than 100 stolen items, from power tools and building supplies to kayaks and spa tubs. In both felony cases, judges gave Routh either probation or a suspended sentence.",
      "In addition to the federal charges, Routh also has pleaded not guilty to state charges of terrorism and attempted murder.",

      "\u201cInformation must be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if it is unclassified,\u201d the directive states. The signature form includes an array of security requirements for credentialed media at the Pentagon.",

      "\u201cIf the news about our military must first be approved by the government, then the public is no longer getting independent reporting.

      "The Pentagon this year has evicted many news organizations while imposing a series of restrictions on the press that include banning reporters from entering wide swaths of the Pentagon without a government escort \u2014 areas where the press had access in past administrations as it covers the activities of the world\u2019s most powerful military.",

He agreed to a permanent ban from law enforcement in exchange for the charges being dismissed. In another case, a DeSoto Parish deputy was charged with third-degree rape after ordering a woman he arrested to perform oral sex on him.",
      "Russell Graham, a state police spokesperson, declined to explain his agency\u2019s conclusion that there \u201cwas not sufficient evidence\u201d the deputies in Brown's case committed a crime.

      "NEW YORK -- Even as it ponders a diminished future facing cutbacks and questions of relevance, the United Nations will still draw foundations and nonprofits to New York starting Sept. 22 for a packed schedule of conferences, meetings, happy hours and dinners on the sidelines of its general assembly of world leaders.",
      "But the uncertainty has already had an impact.",
      "The Gates Foundation, which usually releases a report about progress toward global development goals before the U.N. General Assembly meets, has delayed this year\u2019s report because it's not yet clear how much foreign aid and global health funding countries will commit going forward. Former President Bill Clinton said the Clinton Global Initiative, which started convening its annual meeting on the U.N. sidelines in 2005, will change its format this year to ask leaders from business, politics and philanthropy to develop new programs during the two-day conference.",

      "The U.N.\u2019s largest funder, the United States, has frozen funding or sought to claw it back, prompting major layoffs and program reductions across U.N. agencies.

      "Since 2017, Bloomberg's organization has convened a forum on the U.N. sidelines, which Sheekey said is a unique opportunity to make connections between world leaders, businesses and philanthropies. This year it will focus on global collaboration and investment opportunities in African countries, especially around sports.",
      "The United Nations Foundation, founded by Ted Turner in 1998 to promote cooperation with the U.N., compiles a list of public events that take place on the sidelines. This year, the foundation has tracked about the same number of events as in previous years, said George Hampton, one of the foundation's executive directors. But he said there seems to be a greater emphasis on smaller roundtables, where conversations can be more frank and substantive.",
      "\u201cIt is clear that the space we have to solve problems is shrinking, the kind of global cooperation table is shrinking as the problems themselves grow,\u201d Hampton said. \u201cSo it does feel there\u2019s a new urgency, a new sense that this time matters more than those before it.\u201d",
      "Clinton Global Initiative CEO Gregory Milne said the changes the nonprofit plans for this year's meeting are similar to how it responded to the Haiti earthquake in 2010 and the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cThis is a critical moment for the global development community,\" he said. \u201cBut we also know that the CGI community and thousands of organizations that span the public and private sector have always worked to meet the unique and urgent challenges of the time.\u201d",

      "A Missouri judge has struck down ballot summary for an anti-abortion amendment backed by Republican state lawmakers",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- A Missouri judge has struck down a ballot summary for an anti-abortion amendment backed by Republican state lawmakers while concluding that it presented an unfair and insufficient description to voters.",
      "Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green ruled Friday that the ballot summary must be rewritten, but he rejected a request by abortion-rights advocates to block the proposed constitutional amendment from going to voters.",
      "The judge said the summary prepared by Republican lawmakers failed to inform voters that the new measure would repeal an abortion-rights amendment adopted by voters last year. He directed the secretary of state's office to write a new summary.",
      "The ruling marks the latest in a series of twists and turns in Missouri\u2019s abortion policies over the past three years.",
      "When the U.S. Supreme Court ended a nationwide right to abortion by overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022, that triggered a Missouri law to take effect banning abortions \u201cexcept in cases of medical emergency.\u201d But abortion-rights activists then gathered initiative petition signatures to put their own measure on the ballot.",
      "Last November, Missouri voters narrowly approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a right to abortion until fetal viability, generally considered sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy. That measure, known as Amendment 3, also allows later abortions to protect the life or health of pregnant women and creates a \u201cfundamental right to reproductive freedom\u201d that includes birth control, prenatal and postpartum care and \u201crespectful birthing conditions.\u201d",
      "In May, the Republican-led Legislature shut down Democratic opposition and approved a new referendum that would repeal Amendment 3 and instead allow abortions only for a medical emergency or fetal anomaly, or in cases of rape or incest up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. That proposed amendment also would prohibit gender transition surgeries, hormone treatments and puberty blockers for minors, which already are barred under state law.",
      "Abortion-rights advocates had argued in a lawsuit that the entire measure should be stricken, alleging that the combination of abortion and transgender policies violated a constitutional requirement that amendments contain only one subject. But Green agreed with Republican lawmakers that both topics fit under the measure's title of \u201creproductive health care.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has signed a proclamation that will require a new, $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visa applications",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Friday signed a proclamation that will require a $100,000 annual visa fee for highly-skilled foreign workers and rolled out a $1 million \u201cgold card\u201d visa as a pathway to U.S. citizenship for wealthy individuals, moves that face near-certain legal challenges amid widespread criticism he is sidestepping Congress.",
      "If the moves survive legal muster, they will deliver staggering price increases. The visa fee for skilled workers would jump from $215. The fee for investor visas, which are common in many European countries, would climb from $10,000-$20,000 a year.",
      "H-1B visas, which require at least a bachelor's degree, are meant for high-skilled jobs that tech companies find difficult to fill. Critics say the program is a pipeline for overseas workers who are often willing to work for as little as $60,000 annually, well below the $100,000-plus salaries typically paid to U.S. technology workers.",
      "Trump on Friday insisted that the tech industry would not oppose the move. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said \u201call big companies\u201d are on board.",
      "Representatives for the biggest tech companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta, did not immediately respond to messages for comment on Friday. Microsoft declined to comment.",
      "Lutnick said the change will likely result in far fewer H-1B visas than the 85,000 annual cap allows because \u201cit\u2019s just not economic anymore.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to train people, you\u2019re going to train Americans.\u201d Lutnick said on a conference call with reporters. \"If you have a very sophisticated engineer and you want to bring them in ... then you can pay $100,000 a year for your H-1B visa.\u201d",
      "Trump also announced he will start selling a \u201cgold card\u201d visa with a path to U.S. citizenship for $1 million after vetting. For companies, it will cost $2 million to sponsor an employee.",
      "The \u201cTrump Platinum Card\u201d will be available for a $5 million and allow foreigners to spend up to 270 days in the U.S. without being subject to U.S. taxes on non-U.S. income. Trump announced a $5 million gold card in February to replace an existing investor visa \u2014 this is now the platinum card.",
      "Lutnick said the gold and platinum cards would replace employment-based visas that offer paths to citizenship, including for professors, scientists, artists and athletes.",
      "Critics of H-1Bs visas who say they are used to replace American workers applauded the move. U.S. Tech Workers, an advocacy group, called it \u201cthe next best thing\u201d to abolishing the visas altogether.",

      "Lutnick said the H-1B fees and gold card could be introduced by the president but the platinum card needs congressional approval.",
      "Historically, H-1B visas have been doled out through lottery. This year, Amazon was by far the top recipient of H-1B visas with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google. Geographically, California has the highest number of H-1B workers.",
      "Critics say H-1B spots often go to entry-level jobs, rather than senior positions with unique skill requirements. And while the program isn\u2019t supposed to undercut U.S. wages or displace U.S. workers, critics say companies can pay less by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even if the specific workers hired have more experience.",
      "As a result, many U.S. companies find it cheaper to contract out help desks, programming and other basic tasks to consulting companies such as Wipro, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Tata in India and IBM and Cognizant in the U.S. These consulting companies hire foreign workers, often from India, and contract them out to U.S. employers looking to save money.",

      "Major technology companies that use H-1B visas sought changes after massive increases in bids left their employees and prospective hires with slimmer chances of winning the random lottery. Facing what it acknowledged was likely fraud and abuse, USCIS this year said each employee had only one shot at the lottery, whether the person had one job offer or 50.",
      "Critics welcomed the change but said more needs to be done. The AFL-CIO wrote last year that while changes to the lottery \u201cincluded some steps in the right direction,\u201d it fell short of needed reforms. The labor group wants visas awarded to companies that pay the highest wages instead of by random lottery, a change that Trump sought during his first term in the White House.",

I knew Joe wouldn't be doing that if it was just another of Elvis's hospital stays. Something must be terribly wrong.",
      "I did a U-turn and raced home, running traffic lights and going far too fast. Cars skidded to a halt to miss me. It's a miracle I didn't get hit. All the way home, I prayed over and over, \"Dear God, please let it be all right.\" Lisa was at Graceland, due to come home later that day, so she was part of whatever was happening.",
      "When I reached home, I could hear the phone ringing as I got out of the car. I prayed it would keep ringing until I reached it. I let myself into the house with shaking hands and grabbed the receiver.",
      "It was Joe. I said, \"What's happened?\" He replied, \"It's Elvis.\"",
      "\"Oh my God.\"",
      "\"Cilla, he's dead. We've lost him.\" His voice broke.",
      "I began screaming, \"No! No, no, no, no, no!\" I started to sob, and I could hear Joe crying on the other end of the line.",
      "\"Joe, where's Lisa?\"",
      "\"She's okay. She's with Grandma.\" I asked Joe to send a plane for me, as quickly as he could, and hung up. The questions I needed answered would have to wait.",
      "A few minutes later, the phone rang again, and when I picked it up, I heard Lisa's voice saying, \"Mommy! Mommy! Something's happened to Daddy! Everybody's crying.\"",
      "I could hear Vernon's voice in the background, sobbing and saying, \"My son! My son!\"",
      "I told Lisa, \"I know, baby,\" and reassured her that Daddy's plane was coming for me soon. I told her to wait with Grandma until I got there. She said she was going outside to play with her friend.",
      "I hung up in a kind of daze. I couldn't absorb what Joe had told me. How could Elvis be dead? I had just talked to him two days before. He'd sounded good.",
      "Joe sent Elvis's private plane, the Lisa Marie, to pick up Michelle and me, my parents, Jerry Schilling, and a handful of other close friends to fly us to Memphis. When we got to Graceland, I found Lisa playing golf carts in the yard with one of her friends. At first, I thought it was an odd reaction, and I worried about what the paparazzi would make of Lisa playing in the wake of her father's death. But then I realized it was a child's way of escaping the reality of the silent house. I hugged her close, then went inside.",
      "I still didn't know what had happened, so Joe told me. Ginger had found Elvis unconscious, face down on the floor of the bathroom, that afternoon. She called downstairs for help, and Joe had raced upstairs. He knew immediately that Elvis had passed, but he didn't want to believe it. My heart plummeted as Joe confirmed that Lisa had seen Elvis's body. Elvis was still face down on the floor when she saw him, his face buried in the shag carpet. Lisa had been afraid he was suffocating. Joe wasn't sure if she'd understood what she was seeing. He'd sent her to see Grandma while the ambulance came. He did chest compressions while they waited for the ambulance. A doctor continued efforts to resuscitate Elvis as they raced to the hospital, but all the efforts were futile. Shortly after arrival, Elvis was pronounced dead. Apparently, it was a heart attack.",
      "Inside Graceland, the atmosphere was eerie. The house seemed hollow and dead. It was as if the energy had been sucked out of it\u2014Elvis's life force. We all walked around like zombies. Vernon was distraught. He felt Elvis's passing very, very deeply. It broke my heart to see such a strong man repeatedly call out his son's name, tears streaming down his face. He was losing his only child. A part of Vernon was lost that day as well. I never again saw the energy he once had. When- ever he'd come into a room and said, \"Hey, son,\" his face would light up with a smile. I never saw that smile again. Grandma struggled to believe that Elvis was gone. After he left us, she always carried a little handkerchief. I'd see her tearing up, and she'd wipe her eyes and whisper, \"My boy.\"",
      "There was no privacy for those of us closest to Elvis, including the family. People and cameras surrounded the property. Mourners waited to be admitted to the house for a public viewing of Elvis's open casket. The funeral was a nationally televised event. The streets near Graceland were thronged with tens of thousands of people. The crowds were so large by the second day that President Jimmy Carter called up the Air National Guard to help local police. It was hot and muggy, and some in the crowd fainted from the heat and from emotion. In the afternoon, thousands of people filed past the open casket that had been set up in the front hall. Lisa stayed with Elvis's body as much as she could. She didn't want to leave him. We sat on the stairs and watched as people walked by. Crowds of strangers in Elvis's home, crying and paying their respects. Some mourners had walked away from their jobs to drive sixteen hours or more to Memphis and line up along Elvis Presley Boulevard, hoping to be admitted to the house. The trip was a financial sacrifice for many of them, for much of the crowd was made up of the everyday people who identified with Elvis as one of their own. He, too, had come from poverty. He had remained loyal to his hometown and his family, and he never got above his upbringing. They felt compelled to pay their respects as they would to a family member. It was overwhelming. There wasn't room yet for our own grief.",
      "His memorial was an international event. While mourners gathered in Memphis, Christ's Church in London held a service in Elvis's honor. Over five hundred people crowded the sanctuary and the lawn outside. At the close of the service, they all sang \"Amazing Grace\" in his honor. Elvis's passing was felt not just in Memphis, but around the world.",
      "The private funeral service was held in the living room and adjoining music room, with the peacock glass framing an archway between the two. Elvis's coffin was moved into the room for the service. Vernon had hired a local preacher who didn't know Elvis and who talked primarily about Elvis's legendary generosity. The Blackwood Brothers, longtime friends and backup singers for Elvis, sang gospel songs. I sat on the couch with Lisa and Vernon, numb with grief. It was all a blur at the time, and it still is.",
      "Lisa and I waited until we could be alone with Elvis to say goodbye. I had bought a silver bracelet engraved with the words, \"I love you, Daddy,\" for Lisa to give him. I helped her put it around his wrist. Then we each kissed him one last time. I'm not sure it hit me until then that he was really gone. The body I had held and caressed so many times was now stiff and empty. It was an eerie, aching feeling.",
      "A line of white Cadillacs formed the funeral procession to the Forest Hill Cemetery. Lisa and I rode with Vernon in the car immediately following the hearse. Elvis was entombed in the Presley family crypt with his mother. Two days later, after two thieves tried to steal the coffin, he was moved to the Meditation Garden at Graceland and kept under security. Gladys was moved to Graceland shortly afterward, to lie beside him. Elvis and I used to sit in that garden in the small hours of the morning, in the peace and the moonlight. I was glad they had brought him home.",
      "Vernon had a bronze plaque made to cover the coffin, with an inscription ending, \"We miss you, Son and Daddy.\"",
      "I returned home to LA with Lisa, feeling that a large part of me had died with Elvis. I couldn't accept that he had passed. I'd felt Elvis would always be there. He was such a force of nature. Despite all my fears for him, I never thought he would die at the age he did. He was still so young. He'd talked so much about what he still wanted to do. He had plans for his music and for his life. Elvis wasn't ready to leave. I wasn't ready.",
      "It was a constant battle to accept that he was gone. Every morning, I would wake up and remember, \"Oh God, Elvis isn't here anymore. How can I live knowing that?\" I was frightened to be in a world without Elvis in it.",
      "There would be no more calls. I would never again pick up the phone and hear his voice. There would be no more visits, no more dropping by unexpectedly. I wouldn't be going to Graceland anymore, except to visit Grandma and Vernon. There was no more Memphis Mafia. Everybody scattered. Everything changed. I changed. I had been happy-go-lucky, always excited about where we were going or what we were doing next. I had finally adjusted to the separation, feeling free and adventurous. Optimistic. My memories of Elvis had been happy ones. When I went somewhere we'd been, I would think, \"Oh my gosh, we went here.\" I remembered the times fans would cling to him and want pictures. They loved him and didn't want to let him go, and when he tried to escape, a trail of girls would follow him. It had been fun. He had so much charm and was so generous to loved ones and strangers alike. It filled him with joy when he was able to do something special for other people.",
      "Now my mind was filled with images of loss. I couldn't get away from reminders of him. The media was filled with articles and broadcasts about Elvis, and his songs flooded the radio stations. If I went out, people would come over and say, \"I'm so sorry.\" I knew they meant well, but it was painful. For a long time after Elvis passed, I rarely went anywhere. I waited a while to continue with my life.",
      "Worst of all, I no longer had a father for my daughter. I was raising my child by myself, a brokenhearted child who had lost her daddy. When we got back home from the funeral, we were surrounded by reminders of his passing. I had to protect her from all the news reports, the unwanted attention, the nonstop condolence calls. It seemed like every newspaper and magazine had a headline about his passing. If Lisa and I went to the grocery store, I'd pull the ones with headlines out of the rack and turn them around in the checkout line so Lisa wouldn't see them. To get her away from the constant reminders, I decided to send her to summer camp. I hoped it would not only insulate her from the publicity but also take her mind off her thoughts. Joanie's kids and some of her other friends were there. I checked on her regularly at camp, and she seemed to be doing pretty well. She later said that camp had helped. When it ended for the summer, my sister and I took her out of the country to give her some privacy until the incessant publicity died down. We went to England and later to Europe. We were seldom recognized there, and we could explore the sights in peace.",

    "summary": "In her new book, Priscilla Presley writes what she calls her final telling of what it was like to be a queen to the King, and what came after.",
    "story": [
      "It was a truly Vegas affair at the Aladdin Hotel; Elvis in a paisley tux, Priscilla with a rhinestone tiara. By the time they'd met, when Priscilla Beaulieu was just 14, Elvis Presley had already gyrated his way into pop culture, from his music to his movies.",
      "He redefined what celebrity was, and yet, Hollywood was no place for him. \"He would always go back to Memphis; that's where home was,\" said Priscilla.",
      "Priscilla met Elvis while he was in the Army stationed in Germany. The only thing that made more news than their relationship was their divorce in 1973. \"I mean, I was very much in love with Elvis, very much,\" said Priscilla, now 80. \"I am still very much in love with him. I didn't leave him because I didn't love him; I just couldn't live the life.\"",
      "Her split from Elvis is where she begins \"Softly, as I Leave You\" (to be published Tuesday), what she says is her final telling of what it was like to be a queen to the King, and what came after. \"I was living Elvis' life,\" she said. \"It was all about him. I had to find me. Who was I? I was Elvis' wife. I don't think we could ever have a life that I wanted. I wanted him for myself.\"",
      "But so did his fans. Elvis, it seemed was destined to be shared. \"I thought, well, what if he runs into someone he falls in love with?\" said Priscilla. \"And I mentioned it to him, and he goes, 'You don't have to worry. You never have to worry.' But when you see these beautiful girls hanging out, I'm going,\u00a0Could that be the one?",
      "\"I couldn't live a life of being in panic all the time, of losing him to someone else,\" she said.",
      "There were affairs on both sides, and yet after their divorce, they still couldn't quit each other. They stayed uncommonly close. Neither ever remarried. \"We couldn't find anyone else!\" she laughed.",
      "She started businesses, and began taking acting classes. She says it helped with her shyness, and grew her confidence. She was also busy raising her and Elvis' only daughter, Lisa Marie. They had joint custody for nearly four years \u2026 before it all ended.",
      "At age 42, Elvis was gone.",
      "Priscilla had seen the changes \u2013 the bloating, the slurred words, the drugs.",
      "I asked, \"Was there anybody around him who could convince him to stop?\"",
      "\"No,\" she replied. \"You couldn't convince Elvis on anything unless he believed in it or, you know, thought about it.\"",
      "She said doctors would basically give him anything he wanted, enabling him. \"He was Elvis; you're not going to say no to Elvis,\" she said.",
      "In his absence sat Graceland, the Memphis mansion that had been hemorrhaging money. The urge was to sell. Priscilla said, \"And I looked at the guy who was telling me, the attorney, and I said, 'That will never happen, ever.'\"",
      "Instead, she opened it to the public. It went from a home to a family shrine.",
      "By the time Lisa Marie turned 25, Elvis' inheritance was hers. It was 1993, the same year another King popped the question \u2026 the King of Pop, Michael Jackson.",
      "Priscilla recalled, \"We were walking on the beach, and she said, 'Mom, you know, Michael wants to get married.' I said, 'Lisa, I'm not really for it.' And she goes, 'Why not.' And I go, 'Who are you? Michael Jackson, Lisa Presley?' And I knew that Michael loved attention, which he did. I knew that's the reason why. They didn't even know each other that long.\"",
      "Priscilla was no fan of another celebrity, O.J. Simpson. She worked with him on the \"Naked Gun\" series. \"He could be very, very nice, but I just didn't, I just felt something about him in the way he was with his wife, and it didn't set well with me,\" she said.",
      "That said, Priscilla was a huge fan of co-star Leslie Nielsen.",
      "Before \"Naked Gun,\" Priscilla had never done comedy. She was thought of in most circles as a more serious actor after her role in \"Dallas\" a few years before.",
      "\"Dallas\" was a spotlight the size of Texas, and Priscilla's role as Jenna Wade put her in the pop zeitgeist all over again.",
      "She left the series after having her second child, Navarone, with her longtime partner Marco Garibaldi.",
      "In 2023, her last physical link with Elvis left. Lisa Marie Presley died suddenly at her home in California from complications after bariatric surgery, and once again the Presley name was draped in grief.",
      "\"I miss her every day,\" Priscilla said. \"I miss her, but I have to let that go and live my life. But her spirit is still with me very, very much.\"",
      "She's buried at Graceland, like her dad. Priscilla says she will be there one day, too. For her, the first home she had as a married woman will be her last.\u00a0 That's not looking backward, she says; it's a comfort for the future.",
      "\"When you stop and think about it, we're not here that long. We're not,\" Priscilla said. \"All of a sudden we're older and we think, Wow, I don't want to hold on to bad things. I don't want to hold on to, you know, things that are in the past that happened. I want to move forward.\"",

    "story": [
      "There was a warm glow in the mountains above Sundance this past week: Hundreds standing in line for a chairlift vigil to honor a man whose legacy is as solid as the mountain itself.",
      "Robert Redford spent most of his life up in the Utah mountains. It's where \"Sunday Morning\" first met him back in 1994.",
      "There was a gentleness between him and our Charles Kuralt; the outdoors meant the world to both of them.",
      "\"Every time I come up this canyon, every time I see that, and feel it, I realize that I'm not taking it for granted,\" Redford said.",
      "For someone so big, so famous, so incandescent, he seemed heroically untouchable, and yet, he was always more than gracious with us.",
      "Years after that first interview, he sat down with our Rita Braver, and a few years after that, he met with me.",
      "Across the decades, he never really changed; his passions, his principles, his politics \u2014 each was as firmly grounded as he was.",
      "As a kid growing up in Southern California, he'd watch other stars romance their way across the screen; frankly back then, he thought it was all pretty silly. \"Any time there was a love scene on the screen, we'd go, Aww! Boo! You tell him lover! And make fun of the scene,\" Redford said. \"Suddenly, the idea that I would be that guy was just too much for me to take.\"",
      "He wasn't always the heartthrob, of course, especially in his later works. In \"All Is Lost,\" it was all him. For an hour and forty-five minutes, he rarely even spoke, but we watched, because it was Redford.",
      "He was 77 when he shot that. He was 81 when he did \"The Old Man and the Gun.\" It was that film, he told us, that would likely be his last. As hard as it was for us to hear him say that, Redford replied, \"It's hard for me to say it! Well, yeah, it's hard to talk about your end. I mean, who does?\"",
      "Among his more than 80 films, many have become classics. He defined what a leading man was.",
      "And yet, when it came to his cultivation of younger filmmakers, celebrity was never a part of the conversation.",
      "His Sundance Institute wasn't looking for stars; it was looking for storytellers.",
      "Glenn Close was in it from the beginning. \"I think he's an extraordinary man,\" she told us last January. \"And I think the fact that he put his money and his time and his influence where his mouth was in this industry is remarkable.\"",
      "His activism left us with a lot to think about \u2013 our place in the word, the false pride of celebrity, the need for wild places.",
      "At a time when Hollywood voices are being discounted, Robert Redford's legacy reminds us that a voice in the wilderness can indeed echo a long way.",

    "published": "Sat, 20 Sep 2025 14:07:05 -0400",
    "summary": "His music dates back to the birth of rock 'n' roll, as an early bandmate of Buddy Holly, and the writer of such classic songs as \"I Fought the Law.\" But Sonny Curtis' most memorable composition may be a TV theme song that turned the world on with a smile.",
    "story": [
      "The theme song to \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" is familiar to generations of TV watchers. The name of the man who wrote and sang it, less so.",
      "Who can turn the world on with her smile?Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile?Well, it's you, girl, and you should know itWith each glance and every little movement you show it",
      "Love is all around, no need to waste itYou can have the town, why don't you take itYou're gonna make it after all",
      "But by the time Sonny Curtis recorded \"Love Is All Around\" in 1970, he'd \"made it\" several times over himself, as a songwriter, as a recording artist, and as an early bandmate of the legendary Buddy Holly.",
      "Born in 1937 in rural West Texas, Curtis grew up picking cotton on his father's farm. \"Oh, it was a miserable job,\" he told correspondent Mo Rocca. \"The heavier the cotton sack gets, the worse it is, man.\"",
      "His love of music came from family. His aunt taught him to play the guitar, and while working those fields, Curtis dreamed up his own songs: \"Driving a tractor, you go down half a mile that way, and when you get there, you turn around and come back a half mile this way. You have plenty of time to write a song!\"",
      "Curtis was just 14 when he met a young Buddy Holly in nearby Lubbock. \"Buddy had black hair, but he had dyed it blonde, and it was growing out. And he reminded me of a black-and-tan coon hound. We sorta skipped all the niceties and got our guitars and started playing.\"",
      "Rocca asked, \"How quickly did you realize this guy's serious about music?\"",
      "\"Buddy, he exuded confidence. He just knew he was gonna make it big one day.\"",
      "The two became fast friends, bonded by their love of music. Sometimes, Curtis said, he'd spend the night at Buddy's. The two would wake up at midnight and flip on the car radio for a show out of Shreveport, Louisiana, to hear some of the rhythm and blues voices that would shape rock 'n' roll: \"We heard, oh, Big Mama Thornton and Lonnie Johnson, and Lead Belly, Little Richard, Ray Charles, you name it.\"",
      "\"Were you just absorbing this?\" asked Rocca.",
      "\"Oh, boy, were we ever, yeah!\"",
      "Buddy and Sonny had formed a band and were still figuring out their own sound, when a then little-known Elvis Presley came to town. \"And I mean, the girls were goin' nuts, man. And that really got our attention. All a sudden, we thought, this not only involves music, this involves pretty girls!\"",
      "When Elvis came back to town in 1956, Buddy and Sonny's band was the opening act. \"Well, I guess we were right there sort of at the beginning of rock 'n' roll.\"",
      "\"What was Elvis like backstage?\" asked Rocca.",
      "\"He was just an old boy.\"",
      "The band went on to record some demos, but wasn't making much money.",
      "So, Curtis left to tour with country star Slim Whitman. \"He treated me kind of like a little brother,\" Curtis said. \"I remember I'd be on the stage and he'd come over and say, 'Now don't be nervous.'\"",
      "Meanwhile, Buddy Holly formed a new band, which would prove to be seminal. The Crickets shot to fame, appearing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\"",
      "Rocca asked, \"When that was happening, did you feel a little left out, like, 'Ugh'?\"",
      "\"I did feel kind of like the train left the station and I wasn't on it, you know?\" Curtis replied.",
      "But on February 3, 1959, Curtis' friend and former bandmate died in a plane crash near Clear Lake Iowa.",
      "Curtis served as a pallbearer.",
      "\"Buddy Holly was 22 when he died,\" Rocca said.",
      "\"Yes. Can you imagine the amount of music he pumped into the system in a short period of, like, 18 months? No telling how much he would've contributed had he been around.\"",
      "By that time, Curtis had joined the Crickets. But with Holly gone, the band felt rudderless.",
      "It was Curtis' talent for songwriting that helped put the wind back in his sails. His song \"Walk Right Back'' became a big hit for the Everly Brothers:",
      "And then there's this classic, which Curtis claims he wrote in about 20 minutes: \"I Fought the Law\":",
      "\"I Fought the Law\" has been covered by artists from The Bobby Fuller Four to The Clash.",
      "Sonny Curtis is 84 now. He and Louise, his wife of more than 50 years, live outside Nashville, where they raised their daughter, Sarah. He is enshrined in Nashville's Musicians Hall of Fame \u2013 as is his old guitar.",
      "In 2012, the year the Crickets retired, they were inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.",
      "But it's a song Curtis wrote for the small screen that may be his most enduring legacy.",
      "In 1970, he was living in Los Angeles when he got a call from a friend about a new sitcom being produced for Mary Tyler Moore: \"It was just this young girl gets jilted in this small community, and she moves to the big city of Minneapolis, gets a job at a news station. And that was about it.\"",
      "Curtis wrote the theme song based on a four-page description of the show. \"I honed in on the part that she rented an apartment she had a hard time affording, and wrote, 'How will you make it on your own?' \u2026 'This world is awfully big, and girl, this time you're all alone.'\"",
      "Within just a few hours, Curtis was summoned to the studio to play his song for producer James L. Brooks. Curtis recalled, \"I got my guitar out and I sang it to him. He smiled and said, 'Sing that again.' And I had to sing it about ten times. And before I left that afternoon, the room was full of people standing all around the walls. I thought, 'I believe I got a shot at this!'\"",

      "When the show became a hit, Curtis was asked to rework his song: \"When they started to do the second season, he said, 'Sonny, she's obviously made it. And we have to have some new lyrics.'\"",

    "summary": "Sonny Curtis died Friday, his wife of more than a half-century, Louise Curtis, confirmed to The Associated Press.",
    "story": [
      "Sonny Curtis, a vintage rock 'n' roller who wrote the raw classic \"I Fought the Law\" and posed the enduring question \"Who can turn the world on with her smile?\" as the writer-crooner of the theme song to \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show,\" has died at 88.",
      "Curtis, inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Crickets in 2012, died Friday, his wife of more than a half-century, Louise Curtis, confirmed to The Associated Press. A statement from his family on his Facebook page Saturday said that he had become suddenly ill.",
      "\"He made a mark on this world, and he made a mark on the hearts of all who knew him. It's a sad day, but what a life. May we look at his life with joy rather than sadness. He would have wanted that,\" the statement read.",
      "The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum also acknowledged Curtis' death.",
      "\"Sonny Curtis was a gentle, humble man who wrote extraordinary songs,\" said Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, in a statement.",
      "Curtis wrote or co-wrote hundreds of songs, from Keith Whitley's country smash \"I'm No Stranger to the Rain\" to the Everly Brothers' \"Walk Right Back,\" a personal favorite Curtis completed while in Army basic training. Bing Crosby, Glen Campbell, Bruce Springsteen and the Grateful Dead were among other artists who covered his work.",
      "Curtis' start with Buddy Holly",
      "Born during the Great Depression to cotton farmers outside of Meadow, Texas, Curtis was a childhood friend of Buddy Holly's and an active musician in the formative years of rock, whether jamming on guitar with Holly in the mid-1950s or opening for Elvis Presley when Elvis was still a regional act. Curtis' songwriting touch also soon emerged: Before he turned 20, he had written the hit \"Someday\" for Webb Pierce and \"Rock Around With Ollie Vee\" for Holly.",
      "Curtis had left Holly's group, the Crickets, before Holly became a major star. But he returned after Holly died in a plane crash in 1959 and he was featured the following year on the album \"In Style with the Crickets,\" which included \"I Fought the Law\" (dashed off in a single afternoon, according to Curtis, who would say he had no direct inspiration for the song) and the Jerry Allison collaboration \"More Than I Can Say,\" a hit for Bobby Vee, and later for Leo Sayer.",
      "Meanwhile, it took until 1966 for \"I Fought the Law\" and its now-immortal refrain \"I fought the law \u2014 and the law won\" to catch on: The Texas-based Bobby Fuller Four made it a Top 10 song. Over the following decades, it was covered by dozens of artists, from punk (the Clash) to country (Johnny Cash, Nanci Griffith) to Springsteen, Tom Petty and other mainstream rock stars.",
      "\"It's my most important copyright,\" Curtis told The Tennessean in 2014.",
      "\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\"",
      "Curtis' other signature song was as uplifting as \"I Fought the Law\" was resigned. In 1970, he was writing commercial jingles when he came up with the theme for a new CBS sitcom starring Moore as a single woman hired as a TV producer in Minneapolis. He called the song \"Love is All Around,\" and used a smooth melody to eventually serve up lyrics as indelible as any in television history:",
      "\"Who can turn the world on with her smile? / Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile? / Well it's you girl, and you should know it / With each glance and every little movement you show it.\"",
      "The song's endurance was sealed by the images it was heard over, especially Moore's triumphant toss of her hat as Curtis proclaims, \"You're going to make it after all.\" In tribute, other artists began recording it, including Sammy Davis Jr., Joan Jett and the Blackhearts and Minnesota's H\u00fcsker D\u00fc. A commercial release featuring Curtis came out in 1980 and was a modest success, peaking at No. 29 on Billboard's country chart.",
      "Curtis would recall being commissioned by his friend Doug Gilmore, a music industry road manager who had heard the sitcom's developers were looking for an opening song.",
      "\"Naturally I said yes, and later that morning, he dropped off a four-page format \u2014 you know 'Girl from the Midwest, moves to Minneapolis, gets a job in a newsroom, can't afford her apartment etc.,' which gave me the flavor of what it was all about,\" said Curtis, who soon met with show co-creator (and later Oscar-winning filmmaker) James L. Brooks.",
      "\"James L. Brooks came into this huge empty room, no furniture apart from a phone lying on the floor, and at first, I thought he was rather cold and sort of distant, and he said 'We're not at the stage of picking a song yet, but I'll listen anyway,'\" Curtis recalled. \"So I played the song, just me and my guitar, and next thing, he started phoning people, and the room filled up, and then he sent out for a tape recorder.\"",
      "Curtis would eventually write two versions: the first used in Season 1, the second and better known for the remaining six seasons. The original words were more tentative, opening with \"How will you make it on your own?\" and ending with \"You might just make it after all.\" By Season 2, the show was a hit and the lyrics were reworked. The producers had wanted Andy Williams to sing the theme song, but he turned it down and Curtis' easygoing baritone was heard instead.",
      "Solo career",
      "Curtis made a handful of solo albums, including \"Sonny Curtis\" and \"Spectrum,\" and hit the country Top 20 with the 1981 single \"Good Ol' Girls.\" In later years, he continued to play with Allison and other members of the Crickets. The band released several albums, among them \"The Crickets and Their Buddies,\" featuring appearances by Eric Clapton, Graham Nash and Phil Everly. One of Curtis' more notable songs was \"The Real Buddy Holly Story,\" a rebuke to the 1978 biopic \"The Buddy Holly Story,\" which starred Gary Busey.",
      "Curtis settled in Nashville in the mid-1970s and lived there with his wife, Louise. He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1991 and, as part of the Crickets, into Nashville's Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2007. Five years later, he and the Crickets were inducted into the Rock Hall, praised as \"the blueprint for rock and roll bands (that) inspired thousands of kids to start up garage bands around the world.\"",

      "At 24 years old, Young may appear to be an overnight sensation after her breakout hit \"Messy\" went viral online and topped charts around the world, but she has been writing songs since age 11. Her recent debut at Coachella left her stunned by the massive audience response.",
      "\"I felt a bit confused to be honest,\" Young told \"CBS Mornings\" about her April performance. \"It was absolutely bonkers. Just the amount of people that were standing there screaming. It was like, 'For me, like, what?' Do you know what I mean?\"",

      "\"I walked into the room just when you went on stage, and I was like, 'Who is this?'\" Shymansky said. \"I was completely seduced by Lola's talent and character.\"",

      "\"When the attorney asked me, like, 'What was you calling her?' You cannot sit here and lie and be like, 'I wasn't calling her no names.' That's not the truth,\" she said. \"I said what I said for real. Like, just don't lie.\"",

      "\"You can't always bottle it inside, because that turns you crazy. That's why some celebrities, they do drugs, they start developing mental issues and stuff like that,\" she said. \"You have to say it. Let it out.\"",
      "The rapper said she sometimes wants to \"go off the grid\" and disappear to a Caribbean island for a year because of the constant scrutiny, but refuses to give up because of what it would teach her daughter.",

      "The trial scheduled to begin Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court will revolve around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google's digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue.",

      "The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden's administration, threatens the complex network that Google has spent the past 17 years building to power its dominant digital advertising business. Besides accounting for most of the $305 billion in revenue that Google's services division generates for its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., digital advertising sales provide the lifeblood that keeps thousands of websites alive.",

The Justice Department contends a breakup would be the most effective and quickest way to undercut a monopoly that has been stifling competition and innovation for years.",

      "In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month.",
      "Even though Google didn't agree with all aspects of Mehta's decision, the ruling was widely seen as a slap on the wrist \u2014 a sentiment that has helped propel Alphabet's stock price to new highs. The 20% gain since Mehta's decision helped make Alphabet only the fourth publicly traded company to reach a market value of $3 trillion \u2014 an increase of more than $1 trillion since Brinkema branded Google's ad technology as a monopoly in April.",
      "In an indication that the outcome of the search monopoly case might sway things in the advertising technology proceedings, Brinkema asked both Google and the Justice Department to address Mehta's decision during the upcoming trial.",
      "As they did in the search case, Google's lawyers already have been asserting in court papers that AI technology being used by ad network rivals like Meta Platforms is reshaping the way the market works and overriding the need for the Justice Department's \"radical\" proposals.",

    "summary": "Members of the blind community have found new ways to use the AI technology to help manage everyday tasks, such as reading the mail.",
    "story": [
      "Emeline Lakrout, a busy New Yorker with a knack for running, rock climbing and swimming, doesn't let being legally blind stop her from living an active lifestyle.",
      "Despite being declared blind at 8 years old, Lakrout has taken on challenges, such as running the New York City Marathon and joining the U.S. National Paraclimbing Team. A new piece of technology \u2014 Meta's AI glasses \u2014 is her latest tool to help her stay savvy and adaptable on a daily basis.",
      "\"The glasses make my life easier,\" said the 27 year old. \"They make things faster and they make me able to do more in the day because it's just quicker and easier to do things and I feel less tired at the end of the day.\"",
      "Meta originally designed the glasses for users to stream video on the go and interact with the world around them using AI. The newest iteration of the technology was unveiled last week and includes the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses\u00a0and a new model of smart Oakley glasses aimed at sports enthusiasts.",
      "Members of the blind community have found new ways to use the technology.",
      "Users are able to connect their glasses to the \"Be My Eyes\" app which connects blind and visually impaired users with volunteers to assist with recognizing objects and managing everyday tasks in real time. Such activities may include going through mail, or helping individuals grocery shop.",
      "The new AI glasses also use optical character recognition, or OCR, which can recognize and read aloud text for users on menus, receipts and mail. For Lakrout, having access to text-based information like signs in a subway station or on street corners is what makes AI technology useful. She says Meta's AI glasses are bringing blind communities one step closer to accessing this information.",
      "The glasses, however, are work in progress says Mark Riccobono, president of the National Federation of the Blind.",
      "\"(They) work well for some things, doesn't work well in other situations,\" he said.",
      "Lakrout discovered this for herself. When she tried the glasses on in a restaurant, they read the menu to her perfectly but couldn't tell her the price for a specific item on second prompt. When using some of the AI-powered features, the glasses' battery died, and so she regularly had to keep them in their case to charge.",
      "More importantly, Riccobono said, is that Meta has \"taken an interest in working with blind people to make the technology better, make it more accurate, make it more meaningful to the experience of blind people.\"",
      "Lakrout and Riccobono both agree that AI technology and Meta's glasses are a useful step in enhancing the blind and visually impaired community's independence. But in the end, the glasses do not \"replace the need for human capacity,\" Riccobo said. \"So we need to teach blind people and we still need to make sure that blind people develop the skills that blind people need to be successful.\"",

    "summary": "Even if people qualify for financial help with their hospital bills, the care they receive may not be covered.",
    "story": [
      "Quinn Cochran-Zipp went to the emergency room three times with severe abdominal pain before doctors figured out that she had early-stage cancer in the germ cells of her right ovary. After emergency surgery four years ago, the Greeley, Colorado, lab technician is cancer-free.",
      "The two hospitals that treated Cochran-Zipp at the time determined that she qualified for 100% financial assistance, since her income as a college student was extremely low. Not having to worry about the roughly $100,000 in bills she racked up for her care was an enormous relief, she said.",
      "Then she started receiving unexpected bills from doctors who worked at the hospitals but, because they weren't on staff there, didn't have to abide by the facilities' financial assistance policies.",
      "Those bills, which came from specialists in emergency medicine, anesthesiology, and radiology who treated her, totaled more than $5,000. Although it was a fraction of the total cost of her care, to Cochran-Zipp it was an enormous amount. She went on payment plans and used scholarship and COVID stimulus money to help cover the bills.",
      "Cochran-Zipp, now 25 and working at a community health center, is applying to medical schools and hopes to enroll next fall. Her experience as a patient has shaped how she thinks about becoming a doctor.",
      "\"I don't think that I could be a provider that, in good conscience, charges patients money in addition to the hospital fees,\" she said.",
      "Hospital financial assistance programs are commonplace, and many patients rely on them. Most offer varying amounts of financial help to uninsured and lower-income people. Eligibility is typically based on a sliding income scale. Some hospitals apply other tests, such as residency.",
      "But even if people qualify for assistance, they may not get discounts. That's because many physicians working at but not for a hospital aren't bound by its financial assistance policies. Hospitals themselves might limit the types of services eligible for discounted or \"charity care,\" as it's sometimes called.",
      "\"It's a hole in the system,\" said Caitlin Donovan, a senior director at the Patient Advocate Foundation, a nonprofit that helps patients with serious illnesses cover their medical bills. Case managers who work with patients report that they've seen these problems repeatedly, Donovan said.",
      "In the coming years, more patients will encounter difficulties as demand for financial assistance grows. More than 14 million people are projected to lose health insurance over the next decade, primarily because of changes to the federal Medicaid program and state insurance marketplaces in recently passed tax and spending legislation championed by the Trump administration. Some of these people will likely qualify for discounted care.",
      "Nonprofit hospitals do not pay taxes on the money they make, but to maintain that tax-exempt status, they are required to have policies to help patients pay for emergency and other medically necessary care. For-profit hospitals are not required to offer financial assistance to needy patients, but many do.",
      "However, physicians and other providers who work in a hospital as independent contractors rather than as employees are often not subject to a hospital's financial assistance policy. According to an analysis by the Lown Institute, a health care think tank, physician services in the emergency, radiology, anesthesia, and pathology specialties are commonly excluded from hospital charity care.",
      "For example, at Hartford HealthCare, a large nonprofit health system serving Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, services performed by physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants employed by HHC, including emergency department physicians at four of its hospitals, are covered by its financial assistance policy. But treatment by emergency physicians at three HHC hospitals is not covered by the financial assistance policy, since they are not employees. Care by doctors working in radiology, pathology, and anesthesia isn't covered by the financial assistance policy at any HHC facility.",
      "Hartford HealthCare declined to comment on the record for this article.",
      "Health system researchers have identified another potential barrier to patients' receiving help from hospital financial assistance policies. IRS rules require that nonprofit hospitals include emergency and medically necessary care in their charity care policies, but they give hospitals substantial leeway to define what \"medically necessary\" care means.",
      "Historically, excluded care has been limited to services that insurance doesn't typically cover, like cosmetic surgery or experimental treatment. But in recent years, hospitals appear to be defining medically necessary care more narrowly, eliminating financial assistance for care that is needed but not urgently required. Care that might fall into this category could be a kidney stone removal, a cancer biopsy, or a cardiac valve replacement, according to a study published this year in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "Although the study of 209 nonprofit hospitals with more than 200 beds found only isolated examples of hospitals \u2014 about 6% of them \u2014 that substantially excluded medically necessary care, researchers are concerned that it could be the leading edge of a larger trend, said Mark Hall, a professor of law and public health at Wake Forest University, who co-authored the study.",
      "\"There's not really much in the way of regulatory guidance in what should be in or out\" of a financial assistance policy, said Christopher Goodman, a clinical assistant professor at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine, who has published several studies examining hospital financial assistance policies.",
      "The American Hospital Association declined to comment for this article. American Medical Association spokesperson Robert Mills said that the AMA doesn't have a position on whether all contracted physicians should be required to participate in hospital financial assistance policies.",
      "For-profit hospitals have more latitude to fashion their financial assistance policies as they wish.",
      "At HCA Healthcare, one of the country's largest for-profit health care systems, with nearly 200 hospitals in 20 states and the United Kingdom, discounted or free care is available only for \"emergent or non-elective services.\"",
      "\"Facility charity policies and uninsured discounts are typically specific to emergency services\" at HCA Healthcare, said Harlow Sumerford, an HCA Healthcare spokesperson. \"Any third-party providers are independent and would have their own financial policies.\"",
      "In recent years, several states have passed medical debt protection laws. A few apply to some doctors and other health care providers who practice at health care facilities and bill patients separately for their care.",
      "Colorado's is the most expansive. Under its Hospital Discounted Care law that first took effect in September 2022, covered hospitals have to screen all uninsured people and others who request it for eligibility for Medicaid and other health programs, and provide discounted care to people whose income is up to 250% of the federal poverty level (about $80,000 for a family of four). There are limits on how much qualifying patients can be billed each month and, after three years, their debt is retired.",
      "Under the Colorado law, licensed health care professionals who work at a covered hospital can charge qualified patients no more than the rates set by the state.",
      "\"This rule has been a game changer for folks in Colorado,\" said Melissa Duncan, consumer assistance program manager at the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, which helps patients access health care and cover their bills.",
      "Unfortunately, the law didn't pass in time to help Cochran-Zipp.",
      "As hospitals grapple with the changes expected under the federal health care legislation passed this summer, discounted care programs may make a tempting target, say some health care financing experts. Facing higher rates of uncompensated care and trouble collecting payments from patients, facilities may reduce the financial assistance that they offer.",
      "Hospitals may say \"we are going to do all we can to protect our spending,\" said Ge Bai, a professor of accounting and health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University. \"In that environment, charity care will be a burden.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 20 Sep 2025 17:48:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is targeting a visa widely used by tech companies and other employers to hire foreign workers.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is adding $100,000 to the existing fee for H-1B visa applications, taking aim at a program that is used to attract highly skilled workers to the U.S.",
      "President Trump signed a proclamation late Friday adding the new visa application fee and barring H-1B workers from entering the U.S. unless they had made the $100,000 payment.",
      "\"We're going to be able to keep people in our country that are going to be very productive people, and in many cases these companies are going to pay a lot of money for that, and they're very happy about it,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson clarified to CBS News in an email Saturday that the fee \"does not apply to anyone who has a current visa,\" and \"only applies to future applicants in the February [2026] lottery who are currently outside the U.S. It does not apply to anyone who participated in the 2025 lottery.\"",
      "\"The Proclamation does not impact the ability of any current visa holder to travel to/from the U.S.,\" Jackson said.",
      "A White House official told CBS News Saturday that the $100,000 is a one-time fee that only applies to new visas and is not an annual payment. It does not apply to renewals or current visa holders, the official said.",
      "This comes after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had told reporters Friday that the fee was \"annual.\"",
      "\"President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down wages,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told CBS News in a statement Saturday. \"It also gives certainty to American businesses who actually want to bring high-skilled workers to our great country but have been trampled on by abuses of the system.\"",
      "The additional charge would impact employers including technology giants such as Amazon, IBM, Microsoft and Google, which have\u00a0relied on the program\u00a0to hire foreign workers.",
      "The plan was\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier by Bloomberg News.",
      "H-1B visas are already expensive, with the cost ranging from about $1,700 to $4,500, depending on whether the visa is expedited. The fees are typically considered a business expense for the employer.",
      "The new fee comes amid a debate over the H-1B visa, which some critics say enables companies to hire foreign applicants at lower salaries than American workers. Some employers also award H-1Bs for entry-level roles rather than for senior positions with greater skill requirements, detractors of the program say.",
      "Tech companies have been among the primary beneficiaries of the visa program. Amazon received the\u00a0most H1-B visas\u00a0of any business in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. This year, the online retailer remains the leading recipient of the visas, with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google.",
      "\"This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers. So it'll protect American workers, but ensure that companies have a pathway to hire truly extraordinary people and bring them to the United States,\" a White House aide said.",
      "Still, Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan research group, said the plan could backfire if it incentivizes U.S. companies to shift jobs overseas, especially in specialized areas like research and development.",
      "\"The second impact will further decrease the number of international students who have an interest in coming to study in the U.S. If there's no opportunity work in the U.S., it's much less likely they'll enroll in U.S. programs,\" Anderson told CBS News.",
      "Last year, the most popular type of job for H-1B visas was software developer. To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company.",
      "President Trump plans to order the Labor Secretary to start a new rule-making process that would update wage levels for the program, Bloomberg reported. Currently, U.S. companies must offer the prevailing wage or the actual wage of similarly qualified workers, whichever is higher, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.",
      "The program is capped at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be issued for employees with a master's degree or higher, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The cap and higher-degree exemption quota is already filled for fiscal year 2026, according to the USCIS.",
      "The H-1B program is already the most restrictive visa program in the U.S., with about 20% of applications resulting in approved workers, according to a March\u00a0study\u00a0from the nonpartisan National Foundation for American Policy.",

      "Food prices grew by half a percent from July to August, marking the fastest monthly rate of change since the fall of 2022. Behind the rising cost of food items on store shelves are three main culprits, according to experts.",
      "The Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs, climate change and a shortage of agricultural workers in the U.S. are the leading causes of grocery inflation, Phil Lempert, a food industry analyst also known as the \"Supermarket Guru,\" told CBS News correspondent Jo Ling Kent.",
      "Price hikes, he added, have been steepest on goods that the U.S. imports from nations facing higher levies. For example, the U.S. imports about 35% of its coffee from Brazil, whose exports are taxed at a rate of 50%.",
      "The latest Consumer Price Index data shows that coffee prices rose 21% in August compared with a year ago.",
      "As companies see their costs rise, they pass along those burdens to consumers. In the case of tariffs, some businesses began raising prices on products even before the levies were in full force.",
      "\"There's no question that what we've seen is, we're seeing companies increased prices because of the impending tariffs,\" said Lempert.",
      "\"What they want to do is they want to protect themselves. A lot of these big food companies are public companies. So what they've gotta do is they've gotta report back to their shareholders on profit margins. So they've been hedging their bets,\" Lempert said.",
      "Sometimes, packaged-goods companies disguise price hikes by offering consumers less product for the same amount of money. The covert inflation strategy has been dubbed \"shrinkflation,\" Lempert explained.",

      "Climate change",
      "Increasing temperatures and\u00a0shifts in weather patterns have made conditions for growing some fruits and vegetables in the U.S. inhospitable. As a result, a lot of domestic production has been moved to Central and Latin America, according to Lempert.",

      "Labor shortage",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump's immigration policies, including raids on workplaces that employ large numbers of immigrants, plus waning interest in agricultural work, have led to an industrywide labor shortage, Lempert explained.",

      "Under the Gold Card program, which Mr. Trump first floated in February, non-Americans who give a gift of at least $1 million to the Commerce Department will be eligible for an \"expedited process\" to gain an immigrant visa, the executive order states. Corporations can sponsor people for Gold Cards if they give the government at least $2 million.",

      "People who are approved for a Gold Card after vetting by the State Department and Department of Homeland Security \u2014 and who pay a $15,000 \"vetting fee\" \u2014 will be considered lawful permanent residents, more commonly known as green-card holders, Lutnick told reporters Friday.

      "The change could mark a substantial crackdown on the H-1B program.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiktok-algorithm-us-china-deal-trump/",
    "published": "Fri, 19 Sep 2025 18:20:31 -0400",
    "summary": "TikTok's algorithm is the \"secret sauce\" behind the app's success, experts say. U.S.-China talks over the app's ownership must resolve who controls the technology.",
    "story": [
      "A deal in the works between the U.S. and China over the ownership of TikTok could include a licensing agreement for the closely guarded secret of the social media company's algorithm, to which access has proved a major sticking point in negotiations between the countries.",
      "The Chinese government once vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, the technology that seems to intuit user preferences almost instantaneously and that has been a driving force for the video-sharing app's explosive growth in recent years.",
      "Previously, TikTok had also seemed unwilling to budge. In May, when the platform was challenging a 2024 law banning TikTok in the U.S., the company said in a legal filing that \"divesting TikTok Inc.'s U.S. business and completely severing it from the globally integrated platform of which it is a part is not commercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\"",
      "President Trump this week\u00a0again pushed back enforcement of the TikTok law, which would require its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market. In the meantime, an agreement between the U.S. and China appears to be moving forward. Mr. Trump on Friday said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping have\u00a0\"made progress\" in talks over a potential deal to resolve the dispute over TikTok's ownership.",
      "Although key elements of the framework deal remain unclear, when some details were released earlier this week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, told reporters in Madrid that the arrangement included agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, thinks ByteDance executives may be urging the Chinese government to strike a deal so the company can continue earning revenue from the algorithm, while maintaining a foothold in the U.S.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "How would a TikTok licensing deal work?",
      "Mr. Trump, asked Thursday about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. So exactly how a licensing deal would work remains unclear, including whether ByteDance could maintain any sort of outside control over TikTok's algorithm once ownership transfers to U.S. owners.",
      "\"What I understand is they would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use it under certain terms,\" said Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization. \"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it.\"",
      "Kreps added that in retaining a measure of ownership over the algorithm, ByteDance could have the right to access internal TikTok metrics and influence how content is ranked in the U.S., akin to how a software vendor can patch or upgrade licensed software.",
      "The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter,\u00a0said\u00a0this week that TikTok would create a new U.S. app and that the company's engineers would re-create content-recommendation algorithms using technology licensed from ByteDance.",
      "A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the contours of the U.S.-China framework deal over TikTok. \"Any details of the TikTok framework are pure speculation unless they are announced by this administration,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on Monday that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, Akoto, the American University assistant professor, said the new arrangement would have to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "When Jingtao, the deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, spoke to the press earlier this week, he indicated the U.S. and China have agreed on entrusting a partner with handling U.S. user data and content security, although its unclear how exactly that would work.",

The company already makes the Santa Cruz model, a four-door compact pickup, that it started selling in 2021.",
      "Hyundai CEO Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz has said the immigration raid will delay opening\u00a0the battery plant by at least two to three months. Spokesperson Michael Stewart said Thursday that the facility will open in the first half of 2026.",
      "Both Hyundai executives and Georgia officials have been trying to calm the situation since the raid, which mushroomed into a diplomatic dispute between South Korea and the United States.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp told reporters Tuesday at a ceremony marking the groundbreaking of a Rivian Automotive electric vehicle plant that he remains confident Georgia's business advantages would \"win out\" in terms of foreign investment. The raid may even wind up smoothing the way for South Korean employees to more easily obtain legal permission to help build and operate facilities in the United States, he said.",
      "\"I've had good conversations with companies that are here doing business in Georgia, companies that are looking to do business here,\" Kemp said. \"And I've had good conversations with people in the White House about the visa issue.\"",
      "Brent Stubbs, the chief administrative officer of the Ellabell site, wrote in an opinion piece published Wednesday in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the company is still committed to Georgia.",
      "\"This situation doesn't change our plans to continue expanding and localizing in the United States,\" Stubbs wrote. \"Our investments in America are part of a long-term strategic plan.\"",
      "The $2.7 billion investment confirmed Thursday will go to expanding capacity at the plant and group affiliates, Stewart said. Hyundai and its onsite affiliates currently have 3,129 employees in Ellabell, he said.",
      "Hyundai and its joint-venture partner in the battery plant, LG Energy Solution, had previously announced $12.6 billion of investments at the Georgia site, with pledges to hire at least 8,500 workers by the end of 2031. State and local governments have promised $2.1 billion in tax breaks and other incentives.",
      "The boost at the Ellabell site is the biggest part Hyundai's plan to raise production by 1.2 million vehicles a year worldwide. That includes another 250,000 vehicles out of Pune, India; and 200,000 more at Hyundai's electric vehicle plant in Ulsan, South Korea. The automaker said it would also deliver parts for assembly into an additional 250,000 vehicles at plants in Saudi Arabia, Vietnam and North Africa.",
      "Hyundai underlined a previous announcement to deepen its investment in robotics and said that by 2027 it would launch extended-range electric vehicles with gasoline motors to extend the range of its electric batteries to more than 600 miles (960 kilometers).",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-interest-rate-cut-september-2025-rates-loans-mortgages/",
    "published": "Thu, 18 Sep 2025 13:27:19 -0400",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut since December could be followed by more reductions later in 2025. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday delivered its first rate cut since December, a move that will ripple through everything from home loans to credit cards, although not all Americans will notice the change in the same way.",
      "The Fed cut reduces its federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 by one-quarter point, shaving its target range to between 4% and 4.25%, down from its prior range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "Though incremental, the policy turn is significant. Fed officials foresee two additional cuts in 2025 and one more in 2026, a trajectory that could lower rates by a full percentage point and lighten the load for millions of borrowers. For now, the quarter-point reduction will trickle through unevenly: some borrowers will see relief almost immediately, while others may notice little change, depending on their rates and the products they hold, according to experts.",
      "\"Any reduction is welcome, and especially if this is the first of several to come, which it sounds like it might be,\"Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, said in a statement. \"That's a positive thing.\"",
      "One area where Schulz doesn't expect consumers to see significant change is on credit card rates. While banks will lower their annual percentage rates in response to the cut, it's probably not going to make much of a dent for people who carry a balance, given that the average APR currently stands at about 20%.",
      "\"That quarter point isn't going to make that much of a difference,\" Schulz said.",
      "Here's where you're most likely to feel an immediate impact from the Fed's reduction \u2014 for better and worse.",
      "Home equity line of credit",
      "A home equity line of credit (HELOC) represents one of the financial products where the Fed rate cut could provide a bigger bang for borrowers' bucks.",
      "A HELOC is a line of credit based on the value of your home. In some ways, it is similar to a credit card, because it provides a maximum credit line that borrowers can draw down and their interest rates are variable \u2014 which means they rise and fall based on the prime rate, which in turn is influenced by the fed funds rate.",
      "If you have a HELOC, you can expect your rate to decline by one-quarter point within a month or two, according to Bankrate. The average HELOC today has a rate of about 8.05%, the financial site notes.",
      "\"HELOCs are one of the types of loans that tend to be directly impacted, so if you do have a HELOC, that quarter-point reduction can be pretty significant,\" Schulz said.",
      "According to CBS News' Managing Your Money, that 0.25 percentage-point reduction could trim a borrowers' costs on a $100,000 HELOC by about $173 annually. Bigger savings could be in store if the Fed carries through with additional rate cuts later this year and in early 2026.",
      "Mortgages",
      "House hunters enjoyed a preemptive benefit from the Fed rate cut, as mortgage rates have declined this month in anticipation of lower rates.",
      "Average rates for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.35%\u00a0this week, its lowest level in nearly a year. Just two years ago, mortgages approached 8%, hitting their\u00a0highest levels since 2000.",
      "Mortgage rates aren't set by the Fed, but they're heavily influenced by its policy moves, as well as bond market investors' expectations for economic growth and inflation.",
      "\"It's not just about what the Fed is doing today, it's about what they're expected to do in the future, and that's determined by things like economic growth, what's going to happen in the labor market and what do we think inflation is going to be like over the next year or so,\" Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, told AP News.",
      "While additional rate cuts later this year aren't guaranteed to result in lower home loan rates, it's a possibility, said Stephen Kates, financial analyst at Bankrate.",
      "\"It means that they probably could go down more, and they may trend in that direction, even if they don't move in lockstep,\" he added.",
      "High-interest savings accounts",
      "Unfortunately, the Fed's rate cut could have a negative impact on one group: Savers.",
      "Since the Fed started hiking rates in 2022 to battle soaring inflation, high-interest savings accounts and certificates of deposit have been the silver lining for consumers. People who had money to sock away in one of those accounts or a CD could get rates as high as 5% in 2024.",
      "Currently, savers can still find high-interest savings accounts offering 4%, but those might drop soon as banks adjust their offers to reflect the Fed's rate reduction, Schulz said.",
      "\"Expect yields on high-interest savings accounts and CDs to drop. Savers may want to act now by locking in today's still-high rates before they fall further,\" he noted.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to allow President Trump to fire Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to allow President Trump to remove Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors while a legal challenge to her firing moves forward.",
      "In its request for emergency relief from the high court, the Justice Department said that the justices should freeze a lower court decision that ordered Cook to be reinstated to her post on the Fed Board.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled earlier this week that Cook could remain\u00a0in her role while a legal challenge to her firing moves forward.",
      "Mr. Trump's emergency appeal to the high court comes after Cook participated in a two-day meeting of the Fed's committee that sets interest rates this week. The central bank on Wednesday lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, its first cut since December. The president has repeatedly criticized the Fed for moving too slowly to lower interest rates.",
      "\"That the Federal Reserve Board plays a uniquely important role in the American economy only heightens the government's and the public's interest in ensuring that an ethically compromised member does not continue wielding its vast powers,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the request to the Supreme Court. \"Put simply, the President may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a Governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself \u2014 and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentations.\"",
      "Lisa Cook's firing",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook last month over allegations she made misrepresentations on mortgage filings. She has not been charged with any crime and denies wrongdoing. Cook's removal by Mr. Trump was unprecedented \u2014 no president has attempted to remove a Fed governor in the central bank's 112-year-history. Critics warned that it threatened the independence of the Fed.",
      "Cook swiftly filed a lawsuit against the administration, arguing her removal violated the Federal Reserve Act. The law specifies that a president can only remove a governor \"for cause.\" Cook also argued her due process rights were violated because she was not provided notice of the allegations against her and a meaningful opportunity to respond.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb sided with Cook earlier this month, finding that her firing likely violated the Federal Reserve Act and her right to due process under the Fifth Amendment. She ordered Cook to be reinstated to her post on the Fed Board.",
      "The Trump administration sought emergency relief from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which left Cobb's order intact. Judge Bradley Garcia wrote in a concurring opinion that Cook is likely to succeed in her claim that Mr. Trump's attempt to terminate her violated her due process rights. But he wrote that the court did not need to address the meaning of \"for cause\" at this stage in the case.",
      "The White House had said the administration would seek the Supreme Court's intervention, as it has done in several other legal challenges to Mr. Trump's efforts to remove Democratic-appointed officials at independent agencies. The high court has so far allowed the president to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission, but it acknowledged in May that the Fed is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "In his filing, Sauer argued that Cook received adequate notice and opportunity to contest her removal.",
      "\"The President notified Cook of the charges against her and waited five days for her to respond before removing her,\" he wrote. \"Having declined to bring any defense to the President's attention or to dispute any material facts, Cook cannot complain about insufficient process.\"",
      "The solicitor general noted that the administration is not contesting the constitutionality of the for-cause removal protection for members of the Fed Board, but instead believes the president's firing of Cook complies with it. Still, Sauer said the district court's finding that conduct that occurred before Cook was appointed to the Fed does not constitute \"cause\" under the Federal Reserve Act\u00a0 was \"flawed.\"",
      "\"The President's strong concerns about the appearance of mortgage fraud, based on facially contradictory representations made to obtain mortgages by someone whose job is to set interest rates that affect Americans' mortgages, satisfies any conception of cause,\" he wrote. \"That is especially true here, where Cook has not disputed any material fact or offered any plausible justification for her conduct.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced last month that he was\u00a0firing Cook, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, from the Fed Board of Governors and had \"sufficient cause\" to oust her. Cook's 14-year-term on the Fed is set to end in January 2038.",
      "The president cited as grounds for her removal claims made by Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that Cook made false statements on mortgage documents.",
      "Pulte alleged in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi last month that Cook claimed two different properties in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta as her principal residence on mortgage documents from 2021 in order to gain more favorable lending terms. Pulte, who was appointed to lead the FHFA by Mr. Trump, has continued to make accusations against Cook related to mortgage documents.",
      "Cook's lawyers have said she \"did not ever commit mortgage fraud.\" Documents obtained by The Associated Press this week showed that Cook referred to the property as a \"vacation home\" in a loan estimate, potentially undercutting the Trump administration's claims of fraud.",

      "\"This is a game-changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and center into the AI game,\" Ives said. \"Along with the recent U.S. government investment for 10% (equity stake in Intel) this has been a golden few weeks for Intel after years of pain and frustration for investors.\"",
      "Nvidia, meanwhile, has soared because its specialized chips are underpinning the artificial intelligence boom. The chips, known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, are highly effective at developing powerful AI systems.",
      "The deal between the two chipmakers comes as China moves to be less dependent on U.S. semiconductor technology. This week, Chinese officials reportedly forbade several large domestic technology companies from purchasing Nvidia chips, and Huawei announced that it was expanding its development of AI chips and manufacturing.",
      "While Nvidia and Intel will work together to develop new chips, a manufacturing deal has yet to be struck between the two.

      "\"As part of this change, and to ensure out partners were prepared, partners received two shirts at no cost,\" the company said Wednesday. Starbucks refers to its employees as \"partners.\"",
      "The dress code sparked a strike at 75 U.S. stores in May soon after it went into effect, with more than 1,000 workers protesting the new policy, according to Starbucks Workers United, which represents workers at 640 of Starbucks' 10,000 company-owned U.S. stores. The union said the dress code should be subject to collective bargaining but isn't a party to the suits.",
      "The new dress code requires all workers in North America to wear a solid black shirt with short or long sleeves under their green aprons. Shirts may or may not have collars, but they must cover the midriff and armpits.",
      "Employees must wear khaki, black or blue denim bottoms without patterns or frayed hems or solid black dresses that are not more than 4 inches above the knee. The dress code also requires workers to wear black, gray, dark blue, brown, tan or white shoes made from a waterproof material. Socks and hosiery must be \"subdued,\" the company said.",
      "The dress code prohibits employees from having face tattoos or more than one facial piercing. Tongue piercings and \"theatrical makeup\" are also prohibited.",
      "Starbucks said in April that the new dress code would make employees' green aprons stand out and create a sense of familiarity for customers. It comes as the company is trying to reestablish a warmer, more welcoming experience in its stores.",
      "Before the new dress code was imposed, Starbucks had a relatively lax policy. In 2016, it began allowing employees to wear patterned shirts in a wider variety of colors to give them more opportunities for self-expression.",
      "The old dress code was also loosely enforced, according to the Colorado lawsuit. But under the new dress code, employees who don't comply aren't allowed to start their shifts.",
      "Brooke Allen, a full-time student who also works at a Starbucks in Davis, California, said she was told by a manager in July that the Crocs she was wearing didn't meet the new standards and she would have to wear different shoes if she wanted to work the following day. Allen had to go to three stores to find a compliant pair, which cost her $60.09.",
      "Allen has spent an additional $86.95 on clothes for work, including black shirts and jeans.",
      "\"I think it's extremely tone deaf on the company's part to expect their employees to completely redesign their wardrobe without any compensation,\" Allen said. \"A lot of us are already living paycheck to paycheck.\"",
      "Allen said she misses the old dress code, which allowed her to express herself with colorful shirts and three facial piercings.",
      "\"It looks sad now that everyone is wearing black,\" she said.",
      "The lawsuits and complaints filed Wednesday allege that Starbucks' dress code violates state laws that require companies to reimburse workers for expenses that primarily benefit the employer. Colorado law also prohibits employers from imposing expenses on workers without their written consent, according to that lawsuit. The plaintiffs seek damages on behalf of all Starbucks workers in those states, whether or not their stores are unionized.",
      "Multiple plaintiffs, like Allen, said they requested reimbursement from Starbucks to conform to the dress code but were denied. Gilbert Cruz, an employee in Aurora, Illinois, requested $10 for the cost of removing a nose piercing.",
      "Worker-led lawsuits in state courts are a shift in tactics in the multi-year effort to unionize Starbucks' stores.",
      "Starbucks Workers United \u00a0has filed hundreds of unfair labor practice charges against Starbucks with the National Labor Relations Board.",
      "But the board's ability to hear cases has been curtailed under President Trump. He fired an NLRB member in the spring, leaving the board without the quorum it needs to decide cases.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has been unionizing U.S. stores since 2021. The company and union have yet to reach a contract agreement, despite agreeing to return to the bargaining table in February 2024.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-fomc-meeting-today-rate-cut-september-2025-powell-impact/",
    "published": "Wed, 17 Sep 2025 16:20:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve is cutting its benchmark interest rate as the U.S. economy faces headwinds, including a faltering labor market.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points \u2014 its first cut since December \u2014 as the U.S. grapples with a stalling labor market and slower economic growth.",
      "The Fed cut reduces the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 4% and 4.25%, down from its prior range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The last time the central bank eased borrowing costs was in December 2024, when it also trimmed rates by a quarter of a percentage point.",
      "Federal Reserve officials are also penciling in two more rate cuts in 2025, but only one in 2026, according to the central bank's summary of economic projections. That may disappoint Wall Street, with investors before the meeting projecting a total of five cuts over the rest of the year and 2026.",
      "According to those median\u00a0projections, Fed officials expect the nation's unemployment rate, currently 4.3%, to reach 4.5% by year-end before ticking down to 4.4% in 2026 and 4.3% the following year.",
      "Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) \u2014 the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation \u2014 is forecast to level off at 3% this year, well above the central bank's 2% annual target, before receding to 2.6% next year and 2.1% in 2027. The median projections for core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, forecast PCE of 3.1% this year.",
      "The move comes as the Fed contends with a two-fold economic challenge: curbing inflation, which has flared in recent months, while supporting job growth, which has slumped. The Fed typically seeks to tame inflation by nudging up interest rates to slow economic growth, while cutting rates in periods when the economy is faltering to encourage consumer spending and business investment.",
      "\"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,\" Powell said in a press conference following the Fed's two-day meeting.",
      "He added that recent labor data shows that what he termed \"people at the margins,\" which he said include recent college grads, are now having a harder time finding employment.",
      "\"The overall job-finding rate is very, very low, but the layoff rate is also very low,\" Powell noted. \"The concern is that if you start to see layoffs, the people who are laid off, there won't be a lot of hiring going on.\"",
      "In acting to lower interest rates, the Fed is signaling that it views the slowing labor market as a more pressing concern than rising prices, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell underlined at his\u00a0Jackson Hole address\u00a0last month in Wyoming.",
      "\"Concerns for the labor market's health are rising,\" said Cory Stahle, economist in the Indeed Hiring Lab, in a statement after the Fed's decision. \"Unemployment and layoffs are relatively stable at historically low levels, which is encouraging, but they are unlikely to stay that way if labor market conditions deteriorate further.\"",
      "At the same time, Powell said the Fed now views the pass-through of the Trump administration's tariff as being \"smaller and slower\" than central bank officials had expected earlier this year. \"We continue to expect [inflation] to move up, maybe not as much as we would have a few months ago,\" he said.",
      "The rate cut comes amid intense political pressure on the Fed, with President Trump repeatedly accusing Powell of moving too slowly to ease borrowing costs and shore up economic activity.",
      "Mr. Trump is also seeking to put his imprint on the Fed. To that end, he has\u00a0sought to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook from her seat on the central bank's board, alleging that she engaged in mortgage fraud. She has denied committing fraud and challenged Mr. Trump's authority to fire her, with an appeals court ruling Monday that Cook can keep her job.",
      "One vote for a jumbo cut",
      "An economic adviser to Mr. Trump, Stephen Miran, was\u00a0confirmed by the Senate\u00a0on Monday to take an open spot on the Fed's Board of Governors. He will also sit on the 12-member Federal Open Markets Committee, or FOMC, which sets interest rates for the Fed.",
      "\"Stephen Miran was a last-minute addition to the FOMC, but his vote won't drastically alter the outcome. He joined too late to submit an economic projection and path for monetary policy,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a report this week ahead of the Fed's rate cut.",
      "All of the voting FOMC members except one \u2014 Miran \u2014 voted in favor of the quarter-point cut, according to the central bank's statement. Miran voted for a larger cut of 0.50 percentage points, the Fed noted.",
      "A key question for consumers and businesses is whether the Fed trimming borrowing costs for the first time in nearly a year augurs additional cuts in 2025 and heading into 2026. Fed officials have two more meetings this year, set for October and December.",
      "Although the FOMC members were largely united on the size of today's cut, their projections of future cuts show a difference of opinion about the path of monetary policy moving forward. Many of the group's members don't expect the panel to make any more cuts this year, according to the summary of economic projections.",
      "\"That median hides the deep split on the FOMC \u2013\u2013 nine of 19 members don't anticipate further cuts this year,\" Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report.",
      "Powell noted that a quarter-point cut isn't likely to make a huge difference to the economy, but added, \"You have to look at the path\" of future cuts expected later this year and in 2026. \"It starts with a 25 basis point cut \u2014 it's not just one action,\" he said.",

      "Homeowners insurance rates are rising across the U.S., driven by climate change, rising cost of building materials and surging home prices.",
      "Almost half of property insurance policy holders in the U.S. said their premiums rose over the past year, the highest rate of increases in more than a decade, according to a\u00a0study\u00a0this week from data analytics company J.D. Power.",
      "Average homeowners insurance costs have risen nearly 70% over the past five years, according\u00a0to data from ICE Mortgage Technology. On average, single-family homeowners with a mortgage now pay $2,370 a year for their property policy. In 2025, homeowners insurance costs rose have risen most sharply in California, where premiums in Los Angeles were up 19.5% compared to a year ago, according to the loan analytics firm.",
      "Soaring homeowners insurance rates are leading some Americans to switch insurers, or do without coverage altogether \u2014 a risky step that can prove financially ruinous and that experts strongly discourage.",
      "\"All things being equal, if you raise prices customers aren't happy,\" J.D. Power managing director Craig Martin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"As premiums increase, it starts to impact how people perceive insurance, and they start to wonder if their insurer cares about them or their profits.\"",
      "Property insurance premiums vary by geography, and are typically higher in places where residents are more vulnerable to disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires that scientists link to climate change, according to insurance experts.",
      "\"The price of insurance is increasing as the level of risk increases,\" said Sean Kevelighan, CEO of the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group that provides information to consumers. \"We are beginning to see some trends of Americans making tougher decisions about their insurance.\"",
      "According to a recent Realtor.com survey of homeowners, nearly 60% of respondents said they might forgo purchasing property coverage if it becomes too expensive.",
      "\"Households are feeling squeezed, and more are considering going without home insurance altogether,\" Realtor.com economic data analyst Hannah Jones told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What's behind rising premiums?",
      "Several factors have led to the surge in property insurance costs:\u00a0higher home values, mounting climate-related risks, and the higher cost of lumber, steel and other building materials, insurance experts said. In June, the median home sale price in the U.S. hit a record high of nearly $400,000, according to online real estate firm Redfin.",
      "\"We've seen costs related to construction materials rise, and the price of insurance is a reflection of risk, plus the cost to pay a claim,\" Kevelighan said.",
      "\"It's a double whammy,\" Jones added. \"If your home is worth more, it costs more to insure, and also your home is more at risk, so you stand to lose more if you go without insurance.\"",
      "\"We don't recommend going without insurance because it leaves you extremely exposed in case you do suffer property damage, or a complete loss of property,\" she said.",
      "However, homeowners do have alternatives when it comes to choosing an insurer, while there are steps they can take to try to minimize their coverage costs.",
      "\"A few of these things are under people's control,\" NerdWallet homeowners insurance expert Holden Lewis told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you are in a place where there are a lot of wildfires, you can change your landscaping so you don't have flammable materials, for example.\"",
      "A home that's perceived as less vulnerable is less costly to insure, he explained.",

      "Each fall \u2014 typically in October or November \u2014 the IRS announces inflation adjustments that affects everything from the tax brackets people are subject to based on their income to the size of the standard deduction. Some experts are already projecting those changes by analyzing the same inflation data the tax agency uses as part its annual reset.",
      "Based on that analysis, the IRS is likely to apply an inflation rate of 2.7% in adjusting its brackets and other items, according to Bloomberg Tax. It based its projection on chained Consumer Price Index data for the past 12 months.",
      "Separately, the bottom two tax brackets will see a bigger adjustment next year because of the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law, which applies a more generous inflation bump for those bands. Those brackets will see a roughly 4% increase in their income thresholds next year, Bloomberg Tax calculated.",
      "The IRS tweaks those thresholds to avoid so-called \"bracket creep,\" which can occur if the bands fail to keep up with inflation. Without those annual adjustments, workers who get a cost-of-living pay increase could be pushed into a higher tax bracket even though their standard of living hasn't changed.",
      "\"If they didn't do it year after year, for example with the standard deduction, it would become less and less meaningful each year for taxpayers,\" Amber Gorski, an analyst at Bloomberg Tax and Accounting, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In other words, you'll have to earn more income next year to reach each higher band of taxation. For instance, a single taxpayer who earns $50,000 in 2025 would have a top tax rate of 22%, but in 2026 their highest marginal rate would be 12%, according to Bloomberg's projections.",
      "How the adjustments could impact you",
      "Some Americans could see a tax break due to the higher thresholds for each bracket.",
      "\"Going into 2026, they could use that information to estimate what their tax return potentially is going to be, and what they might owe in taxes,\" Gorski said.",
      "On top of the higher income thresholds for 2026, some seniors and workers could also benefit from changes implemented under the \"big, beautiful\" bill. Those include an extra $6,000 senior deduction and the elimination of some taxes on tipped income and overtime pay for qualifying workers.",
      "The passage of the tax and spending bill in July ensures that next year's tax bracket rates will remain the same. That means the individual tax rates will remain at 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37%, although the thresholds for each band will edge higher because of the inflation adjustments.",
      "Without the new tax law, enacted \u00a0by President Trump in July, the bracket rates would have reverted to their levels before the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Prior to that law, for instance, the highest individual income bracket stood at 39.6%.",
      "The IRS has based its annual inflation adjustments on the so-called\u00a0\"chained Consumer Price Index,\"\u00a0as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

    "published": "Tue, 16 Sep 2025 13:28:07 -0400",
    "summary": "CBS News looked at the cost of producing coal, gas, nuclear, wind and solar energy to determine which is the cheapest.",
    "story": [
      "The emergence of renewable energy like wind and solar as a viable alternative to oil, gas and other fossil fuels has raised critical questions about which form of power offers the best value today \u2014 a debate made all the more urgent by the ravages of climate change.",
      "In the U.S., where energy policy has been shaped by politics for more than a century, the battle continues to play out at the highest levels of government. Former President Biden delivered one of the biggest endorsements of renewable energy in the form of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which offered tax credits and rebates to businesses, organizations and households that invest in solar, wind and geothermal technologies.",
      "By contrast, President Trump has been a staunch supporter of the oil and gas industry. During his inauguration speech in January, he reaffirmed his commitment to fossil fuel production, saying, \"We will be a rich nation again, and it is that liquid gold under our feet. That will help to do it.\"",
      "Within six months of taking office, Mr. Trump signed the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" into law, which phases out clean energy tax incentives while simultaneously expanding tax breaks for the oil and gas industries. Separately, his administration has pared back offshore wind leasing and made it more difficult for clean energy projects to qualify for federal dollars.",
      "On the global trade front, Mr. Trump has issued a flurry of tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, which experts say will translate into higher costs for energy projects that rely on imports. The White House is pushing these policies amid concerns over rising U.S. energy prices, with average electricity costs up 5.5% from a year ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "To get to the bottom of which form of energy is the cheapest, CBS News analyzed the cost to produce coal, gas, nuclear, wind and solar energy, including the impact of tax incentives, tariffs and other factors.",
      "Determining the cheapest form of energy",
      "Multiple criteria come into play in trying to assess the cheapest form of energy. These include consumers' monthly costs; the cost to produce energy; and the potential social cost energy production can have on a community's health and the environment. External factors like tax incentives and fluctuations in the economy also can affect the price it costs to heat and cool our homes.",
      "CBS News set out to answer the question using what's called the Levelized Cost of Energy, or LCOE, a commonly cited benchmark for wholesale energy costs. LCOE is the price that a power-generating facility must receive for its electricity to cover all its expenses \u2014 including capital, equipment, maintenance and other financing costs \u2014 over the lifespan of a project.",
      "A 2025 LCOE report from investment bank Lazard shows the cost to produce energy without any government subsidies and how that changes when you layer in other factors, such as tax subsidies provided under the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "Yet while LCOE calculations are widely used, they don't offer a full picture when it comes to evaluating the cost and value of energy, experts told CBS News. Other factors, such as interest rates and federal regulations, can also have a major impact on the cost of building and operating energy infrastructure.",
      "LCOE also doesn't account for the value a given form of energy delivers. For example, because solar and wind are affected by the weather, they tend to be less consistent than oil and gas, meaning a backup source of energy may be necessary.",
      "\"You have to talk about, what is the additional cost of balancing that production from a resource that doesn't produce all the time?\" Severin Borenstein, faculty director of the Energy Institute at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business, told CBS News.",
      "How tax subsidies factor in",
      "The U.S. government has a long history of using tax subsidies to encourage energy production. Oil and gas companies have benefited from such support for more than a century. One example is a tax deduction known as Intangible Drilling Costs, or IDCs, which allows companies to deduct certain expenses associated with finding and preparing an oil or gas well.",
      "By comparison, only in recent decades have renewable energy projects drawn a larger share of federal dollars. The push for renewables accelerated in the 1970s, when the U.S. was facing an energy crisis defined by fuel shortages and high prices,\u00a0according\u00a0to Congress.gov.",
      "Lazard's report shows how the LCOE for renewable energy fluctuates when you account for certain provisions of the IRA aimed at lowering the cost of developing clean energy projects. Those include the investment tax credit (ITC), production tax credit (PTC) and energy community bonus, which increases the value of the ITC and PTC by 10% for projects in certain areas.",
      "Lazard's calculations assume these credits will be in place for 10 years. Notably, however, the Republican-backed \"big, beautiful bill\" signed into law by Mr. Trump this summer is slated to phase out those credits over the next two years.",
      "Although Lazard examines how the IRA affects renewable energy prices, it doesn't factor in any government subsidies flowing to the oil and gas industry, which vary widely and can be difficult to assess.",
      "The Environmental and Energy Study Institute, a bipartisan nonprofit research group,\u00a0estimates that direct U.S. subsidies to the fossil fuel industry amount to at least $20 billion per year. However, the FracTracker Alliance, a nonprofit focused on the impact of fossil fuels,\u00a0says the industry receives an estimated $760 billion annually in government subsidies and tax breaks.",
      "More benefits will go to the oil and gas industries under the \"big, beautiful bill.\" A June report from the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the legislation will funnel nearly $18 billion in tax incentives to the oil and gas industry over the next 10 years.",
      "Oil and gas companies have lauded the new law as a win for the industry. Sunil Mathew, chief financial officer of Occidental Petroleum, said during a recent company earnings call that the measure \"will provide significant cash tax benefits to Oxy.\" He expects the law will save Occidental $700 million to $800 million in \"cash taxes\" by the end of next year.",
      "How do tariffs factor into energy production costs?",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs are also projected to alter the cost it takes to fund energy projects in the U.S. To gauge the impact of tariffs on energy costs, CBS News turned to a model created by global data and analytics company Wood Mackenzie.",
      "In the following chart, dark green indicates a scenario in which the U.S. hasn't applied any country-level tariffs, but still maintains levies on copper, steel and aluminum imports; the medium shade of green represents current baseline tariffs imposed by the U.S. since Mr. Trump resumed office in January through August 7; and the light green indicates if trade relations with a U.S. economic partner is likely to worsen or deteriorate.",
      "As depicted, U.S. tariffs are projected to hit battery storage production the hardest. Chris Seiple, vice chairman of the power and renewables group at Wood Mackenzie, noted that while some energy equipment is produced domestically, other tech, such as battery cells, mostly comes from abroad, making them more susceptible to tariffs.",
      "\"The vast majority of our battery cells come from China,\" he said. \"And so the cost of a battery project is going to go up by a certain percentage.\"",
      "This could lead to what Seiple described as a \"whack-a-mole\" effect, in which over time companies move their manufacturing to non-tariffed countries to avoid an additional financial burden.",
      "What is the cheapest form of energy?",
      "Given these multiple and interconnected factors, what ends up being the cheapest form of energy to produce?",
      "According to Lazard, renewables remain the most cost-competitive form of generating and distributing energy. Onshore wind, which runs from $37 to $86 per megawatt-hour ($/MWh), is the most affordable on a baseline level and when tax subsidies are included.",
      "Utility scale solar \u2014 what most people think of when they hear about solar energy \u2014 is the next most cost-effective approach, with costs ranging from $38 to $78 per megawatt-hour.",
      "Fossil fuel and nuclear energy sources are more expensive to generate. Coal costs $71 to $173 per megawatt-hour; gas costs $48 to $109; and U.S. nuclear costs $141 to $220, Lazard found.",
      "The main reasons for these differences in cost? Experts told CBS News that while the capital cost for renewable projects is steep, the expense of operating and maintaining such facilities tends to be lower than that associated with fossil fuel production.",
      "\"Wind and solar you basically do all the investment up front, and then it operates \u2014 not quite for free \u2014 but at extremely low operating costs per kilowatt hour,\" Borenstein said.",
      "With fossil fuels, the cost of oil, gas and coal \u2014 which can be volatile \u2014 is another key factor.",
      "\"For a natural gas-fired power plant, you have to buy the natural gas,\" he explained. \"And likewise, a coal-fired power plant, you have to buy the coal. And so the price\u2026 is going to fluctuate.\"",
      "Experts who spoke with CBS News agreed that renewable energy ends up being the most competitive when it comes to costs. Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a Washington, D.C. consulting firm, concurred that solar and wind are the cheapest to run. Natural gas is the most affordable source of backup energy, which is necessary to make sure power is available around the clock, he said.",
      "Seiple said if you need a small amount of inexpensive electricity, solar is the way to go. It's \"low cost to build, it can be deployed quickly and modularly, the fuel is free and not volatile in price, and the ongoing maintenance costs are minimal,\" he said. \"And if the U.S. didn't penalize it with tariffs, it would be even lower cost.\"",
      "Despite such advantages for renewable energy, experts say the U.S. shouldn't put all of its eggs in one basket. Multiple sources told CBS News that what's needed is a diversity of energy options that can meet the country's\u00a0rising demand for electricity. Taking certain forms of energy out of the mix would compromise the system as a whole, they note.",
      "\"There is no one cheapest form that you can run the whole system on, and in fact, it depends on combining them in ways to [get] the cheapest possible cost,\" Borenstein said.",

    "published": "Mon, 22 Sep 2025 16:18:50 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump moved to fire Rebecca Kelly Slaughter from her position as a member of the Federal Trade Commission in March.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it will decide whether President Trump can fire members of the Federal Trade Commission without cause, taking up a dispute that tests the president's removal power and could weaken protections enacted by Congress that aim to insulate independent agencies from political pressure.",
      "The high court said in a brief order that it will also allow Mr. Trump to fire Rebecca Kelly Slaughter from her position at the FTC while it considers the case. It will hear arguments in its December session, and its stay will remain in place until it issues a decision. Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the majority's decision to allow Slaughter's removal.",
      "The justices will consider whether removal protections for members of the FTC violate the separation of powers and, if so, whether its 1935 decision that allowed Congress to impose removal protections for officials at independent agencies should be overturned. It will also weigh whether a federal court can prevent a person's removal from public office, as U.S. district courts have been doing in challenges stemming from Mr. Trump's firings of Democratic appointees.",
      "In her dissent, Kagan wrote that the Supreme Court has \"handed full control\" of certain independent agencies that Congress has sought to shield from political pressure to the president.",
      "\"He may now remove \u2014 so says the majority, though Congress said differently \u2014 any member he wishes, for any reason or no reason at all. And he may thereby extinguish the agencies' bipartisanship and independence,\" she said.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi cheered the Supreme Court's decision as a \"significant\" victory that she said protects the president's executive authority.",
      "\"This helps affirm our argument that the President, not a lower court judge, has hiring and firing power over executive officials,\" Bondi wrote on social media. \"We will continue fighting and winning in court to defend President Trump's agenda.\"",
      "The dispute arose out of Mr. Trump's move to oust Slaughter from her position on the FTC. A lower court found that the president's attempt to fire Slaughter violated a 1914 law that limits the grounds for removing an FTC commissioner to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, and ordered her to be reinstated. Earlier this month, Chief Justice John Roberts had\u00a0temporarily paused that lower court order blocking Slaughter's firing while the Supreme Court considered whether to grant the Trump administration emergency relief.",
      "In its emergency appeal to the high court, the Trump administration urged the justices to swiftly evaluate the constitutionality of the removal restrictions for the FTC before the appeals court has weighed in. Lawyers for Slaughter agreed that the question of whether the protections violate the separation of powers is ripe for the Supreme Court's consideration.",
      "The case is the latest in a string of emergency appeals that arrived before the Supreme Court in response to Mr. Trump's efforts to fire Democratic-appointed members of independent agencies at will. The conservative justices have endorsed the president's removal authority so far, clearing the way for Mr. Trump to fire without cause members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission despite federal laws protecting them from being removed at will.",
      "Those decisions have called into question the future of the 90-year-old precedent that upheld removal protections enacted by Congress for members of the FTC, the same body on which Slaughter served. In its 1935 decision in the case Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the Supreme Court said Congress could shield certain officials from being removed by the president without cause.",
      "Lower courts have relied on Humphrey's Executor as grounds for reinstating officials whom Mr. Trump has attempted to fire. But the steady stream of those decisions prompted calls for the Supreme Court to definitively decide whether the president has the authority to fire the leaders of independent agencies that Congress has insulated from political shifts.",
      "In a concurring opinion in a case involving the removal of three members of the Consumer Product Safety Committee, Justice Brett Kavanaugh warned that \"the downsides of delay in definitively resolving the status of the precedent sometimes tend to outweigh the benefits of further lower-court consideration.\"",
      "Mr. Trump appointed Slaughter to the FTC in 2018, and former President Joe Biden reappointed her to a second term expiring in 2029.",
      "But in March, Mr. Trump moved to oust Slaughter from her position at the FTC. Slaughter, however, sued, arguing that her firing was illegal because federal law limits a commissioner's removal to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "Lower courts ruled in Slaughter's favor and ordered her to be reinstated to her position. The Trump administration then sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "In court filings, lawyers for the Trump administration argued that the modern FTC exercises \"vast executive authority,\" a change from the 1935-era commission. The Supreme Court in Humphrey's Executor said Congress could insulate members of independent agencies from being removed without cause if that entity met certain criteria, including performing only quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial functions.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the FTC wields \"substantial executive authority,\" like the other agencies whose members the president has been allowed to remove.",
      "\"[D]istrict courts cannot compel reinstatement of agency heads and allow them to purport to exercise executive power when the President has determined they should exercise none,\" he wrote.",
      "But lawyers for Slaughter said that for the past 90 years, every president, including Mr. Trump during his first term, has respected the Supreme Court's finding that the for-cause removal requirement for the FTC is valid under the Constitution.",
      "\"The protracted and unanimous acquiescence of all three branches of government in the law at issue here \u2014 a law that affirmatively empowers the President to remove commissioners for good cause \u2014 defeats Applicants' assertion that their continued adherence to that still-binding precedent while their appeal is pending would cause them irreparable harm,\" they wrote in a Supreme Court filing.",
      "Slaughter's legal team warned that if she could be fired by the president without cause, the FTC would be \"severely wounded and radically transformed.\"",
      "The Supreme Court's 90-year-old precedent provided a narrow exception to the president's removal authority. But the high court has in recent years chipped away at that ruling.",
      "In 2020, the Supreme Court found that the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, headed by a single leader removable only for inefficiency, neglect or malfeasance, was unconstitutional. Then, the following year, it ruled that the structure of the Federal Housing Finance Agency violates the separation of powers because it is led by a single director who could be removed by the president only for cause.",

    "story": [
      "The White House on Monday announced basic details of a plan it says will \"save\" TikTok for the social media app's 170 million U.S. users through a new ownership deal, although China has suggested a deal has yet to be finalized.",
      "The structure would move TikTok U.S. operations into a new \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, a senior White House official told reporters on the condition of anonymity. Software maker Oracle would serve as the security provider for U.S. operations, the senior White House official said, providing \"top to bottom\" security, including security of the algorithm. Oracle's chairman and chief technology officer is Larry Ellison, whose son, David Ellison, is the chairman & CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.",
      "The structure brings the algorithm \"under control of the U.S. joint venture,\" the official said.",
      "\"It's going to be continuously monitored as it operates to ensure that it's behaving appropriately, right, that it's not being used for any kind of malicious purpose, and that it's not being unduly influenced,\" the official said.",
      "The official anticipated the president will sign an executive order later this week declaring the terms of the deal meet America's national security interests, and extend the enforcement pause on the law banning TikTok for an additional 120 days.",
      "Congress has effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. based on national security concerns, telling TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance to divest or face a ban in the U.S., but Mr. Trump has paused its enforcement three times. Congress may still need to sign off on any finalized TikTok deal.",
      "A possible sticking point in the plan to transfer TikTok's ownership to U.S. parties is the question of who would control TikTok's algorithm, the complex and powerful software code that has driven the app's rapid growth around the world. Some policy experts think allowing ByteDance personnel to retain access to all or part of the algorithm could expose U.S. users of the platform to risk.",
      "It's not clear if any Chinese officials would be allowed on the board of directors, and investors are still being sought. The official said there has been \"an overwhelming interest in this project\" from \"household\" names that Americans would recognize. Over the weekend, the president indicated media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan would likely be involved somehow.",
      "But Beijing has yet to publicly acknowledge a deal has been reached or a framework has been agreed upon. Last week, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Beijing would \"support their teams in reaching a proper deal on TikTok through consultation.\" And on Friday, the president said he had \"made progress\" on a TikTok deal during a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The senior White House official said they don't have plans for additional talks with the Chinese delegation on behalf of the U.S. government.",
      "\"We feel confident that China has approved the deal,\" the senior White House official said.",
      "The president told reporters last week he may be a little bit \"prejudiced\" in favor of TikTok because he said it helped him win over young voters in 2024.",
      "\"I'm a little prejudiced because I frankly did so well on it,\" he said. \"It got me numbers that nobody's ever even heard of before.\"",

    "story": [
      "Ahead of an expected announcement from the Trump administration that Tylenol use in pregnancy is linked to an increased risk of autism in children, the drugmaker and medical experts are pushing back on the claims.",
      "According to a report from the Washington Post, officials on Monday plan to tie autism to acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, while also promoting a lesser-known drug called leucovorin, which is used as a treatment for some symptoms in children with autism. The Wall Street Journal previously reported the announcement was in the works, which the Department of Health and Human Services called \"speculation\" at the time.",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump seemingly confirmed the plans, telling reporters \"we're going to do it tomorrow\" when asked about the reports.",
      "\"I think it's a very big factor. I think you'll see what it is tomorrow. We have various things, but you'll see what it is tomorrow,\" the president said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a briefing Monday that she didn't want to scoop Mr. Trump or HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. on the announcement later today, but said, \"They are paying attention to studies and the gold standard of science and research that many in this city for far too long have turned a blind eye to.\"",
      "Autism has become more prevalent in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But there is no scientific consensus on the reasons why. Most experts say it is likely due to a combination of factors, including changes in the way the condition is diagnosed.",
      "Tylenol maker responds to autism claims",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said \"independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism.\"",
      "\"We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise,\" the statement continues, highlighting what the company says is the greater health risk for expecting mothers from other conditions if they give up on taking the drug. \"Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy. Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives.\"",
      "\"The facts are that over a decade of rigorous research, endorsed by leading medical professionals and global health regulators, confirms there is no credible evidence linking acetaminophen to autism,\" the company said, adding that it \"will continue to explore all options to protect the health interests of American women and children.\"",
      "Medical experts on Tylenol and autism research",
      "In a statement to CBS News when reports of the administration's plans first surfaced, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said, \"There is no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and fetal developmental issues.\"",
      "In a major study published last year, researchers followed nearly 2.5 million children in Sweden over 25 years and found acetaminophen use during pregnancy did not increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children.",
      "The study, which used sibling comparisons to account for genetic factors, found no increase in risk of autism, ADHD or other intellectual disabilities when women used the medication during pregnancy.",
      "\"The best evidence does not show an association between Tylenol and autism,\" said Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. \"The medical community, the scientific community has the same consensus, which is that Tylenol, acetaminophen, is safe in pregnancy.\"",
      "Gounder said acetaminophen is considered the safest option for treating issues like pain and high fever during pregnancy.",
      "\"If you have a high fever during pregnancy, that can cause neurodevelopment issues in the baby, so you don't want to let that fever go untreated,\" Gounder explained, adding she's worried that expectant mothers may turn to other options that would be less safe.",
      "\"Will women end up taking other medications like aspirin or ibuprofen during pregnancy? Those actually can be dangerous, especially in the third trimester, you can end up with kidney issues, cardiac issues in the baby,\" she said.",
      "While some previous research suggested there could be a possible association between acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders, those studies involved relatively small groups and did not prove a link. Larger and more robust studies have found no connection.",
      "\"Any association between acetaminophen and autism is based on limited, conflicting, and inconsistent science and is premature given the current science,\" the Autism Science Foundation said in a statement.",
      "The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents some of the largest makers of over-the-counter medications, including acetaminophen, said, \"Safety is the top priority for manufacturers,\" and \"the well-established profile of acetaminophen is supported by decades of research and real-world use.\"",
      "\"Scientific and medical authorities around the world recognize acetaminophen as the only analgesic considered safe for use during pregnancy when used according to the Drug Facts label, which specifically reminds pregnant women to always consult their healthcare provider before use,\" the group said.",
      "In response to a question from CBS News' Ed O'Keefe about whether the announcement could create confusion for pregnant women, Leavitt said women are confused about the chronic disease epidemic and \"that's exactly what this administration is focused on finding (answers for).\"",
      "\"As a mother myself, I believe for many mothers across the country who really want answers to what is happening to our nation's children,\" she added.",
      "What is leucovorin?",
      "Leucovorin, an inexpensive, generic drug derived from folic acid (also known as folate or vitamin B9), is expected to be touted as an autism treatment in the administration's announcement, the reports said. Leucovorin is currently prescribed to ease the side effects of cancer chemotherapy.",
      "Pregnant women are prescribed multivitamins with folic acid to prevent neural tube defects. The neural tube develops into the brain and spinal cord.",
      "Specialists say leucovorin can be helpful in treating some autism cases, but it is not a universal remedy.",
      "\"You can have a perfectly normal folate level in your blood, but it may not be getting into the brain, and so there's a defect in the transport of folate into the brain. Leucovorin works around that,\" Gounder explained. \"Not all children with autism have this defect, so there's a test you can do to assess whether that's what's at play. For those kids, leucovorin has been shown to help, particularly with speech, getting kids to be more verbal than they were before.\"",
      "Leucovorin isn't a cure for autism, but \"it could really have a substantial impact on a very good percentage of children with autism,\" Dr. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist, told CBS News earlier this year.",

    "story": [
      "After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department's attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire in a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising.",
      "The trial scheduled to begin Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court will revolve around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google's digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue.",
      "Google and the Justice Department will spend the next two weeks in court presenting evidence in a \"remedy\" trial that will culminate in Brinkema issuing a ruling on how to restore fair market conditions.",
      "Although the judge hasn't set a timetable for making that decision, it's unlikely to come down before the end of this year because additional legal briefs and courtroom arguments are expected to extend into November before Brinkema takes the matter under submission.",
      "No matter how the judge rules, Google says it will appeal the earlier decision labeling the ad network as a monopoly. Appeals can't be filed until the remedy is determined.",
      "The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden's administration, threatens the complex network that Google has spent the past 17 years building to power its dominant digital advertising business. Besides accounting for most of the $305 billion in revenue that Google's services division generates for its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., digital advertising sales provide the lifeblood that keeps thousands of websites alive.",
      "If the Justice Department gets its way, Brinkema will order Google to sell parts of its ad technology \u2014 a proposal that the company's lawyers warned would \"invite disruption and damage\" to consumers and the internet's ecosystem. The Justice Department contends a breakup would be the most effective and quickest way to undercut a monopoly that has been stifling competition and innovation for years.",
      "Google believes it has already made enough changes to its \"Ad Manager\" system, including providing more options and pricing options, to resolve the issues the Brinkema flagged in her monopoly ruling.",
      "The legal battle over Google's advertising technology mirrors another showdown that the company recently navigated after another federal judge condemned its dominant search engine as an illegal monopoly and then held remedy hearings earlier this year to consider how to stop the misconduct.",
      "In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month.",
      "Even though Google didn't agree with all aspects of Mehta's decision, the ruling was widely seen as a slap on the wrist \u2014 a sentiment that has helped propel Alphabet's stock price to new highs. The 20% gain since Mehta's decision helped make Alphabet only the fourth publicly traded company to reach a market value of $3 trillion \u2014 an increase of more than $1 trillion since Brinkema branded Google's ad technology as a monopoly in April.",
      "In an indication that the outcome of the search monopoly case might sway things in the advertising technology proceedings, Brinkema asked both Google and the Justice Department to address Mehta's decision during the upcoming trial.",
      "As they did in the search case, Google's lawyers already have been asserting in court papers that AI technology being used by ad network rivals like Meta Platforms is reshaping the way the market works and overriding the need for the Justice Department's \"radical\" proposals.",
      "The Justice Department is \"fighting for a remedy that would vanquish a past that has been overtaken by technological and market transformations in the way digital ads are consumed,\" Google's lawyers argued leading up to the trial.",

    "published": "Sun, 21 Sep 2025 16:16:06 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump is renewing his call to reestablish a U.S. presence at Bagram, even saying \"we're talking now to Afghanistan\" about the matter.",
    "story": [
      "The Taliban government on Sunday rejected U.S. President Trump's bid to retake Bagram Air Base, four years after America's chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan left the sprawling military facility in the Taliban's hands.",
      "Mr. Trump on Saturday renewed his call to reestablish a U.S. presence at Bagram, even saying \"we're talking now to Afghanistan\" about the matter. He did not offer further details about the purported conversations. Asked by a reporter if he'd consider deploying U.S. troops to take the base, the president demurred.",
      "\"We won't talk about that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We want it back, and we want it back right away. If they don't do it, you're going to find out what I'm going to do.\"",
      "Mr. Trump followed up with a social media post saying \"If Afghanistan doesn't give Bagram Airbase back to those that built it, the United States of America, BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN!!!\"",
      "On Sunday, chief Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid rejected Mr. Trump's assertions and urged the U.S. to adopt a policy of \"realism and rationality.\"",
      "Afghanistan had an economy-oriented foreign policy and sought constructive relations with all states on the basis of mutual and shared interests, Mujahid posted on X.",
      "It had been consistently communicated to the U.S. in all bilateral negotiations that Afghanistan's independence and territorial integrity were of the utmost importance, he said.",
      "\"It should be recalled that, under the Doha Agreement, the United States pledged that 'it will not use or threaten force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Afghanistan, nor interfere in its internal affairs,'\" he said. The U.S. needed to remain faithful to its commitments, he added.",
      "Mujahid did not reply to questions from The Associated Press about conversations with the Trump administration regarding Bagram and why Mr. Trump believed the U.S. could retake it.",
      "'Ceding Afghan soil is out of the question'",
      "Earlier Sunday, the chief of staff at the Defense Ministry, Fasihuddin Fitrat, addressed Mr. Trump's comments. \"Ceding even an inch of our soil to anyone is out of the question and impossible,\" he said during a speech broadcast by Afghan media.",
      "In August last year, the Taliban celebrated the third anniversary of their takeover at Bagram with a grand military display of abandoned U.S. hardware, catching the eye of the White House. Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized his predecessor, Joe Biden, for his \"gross incompetence\" during the withdrawal of U.S. forces after the country's longest war.",
      "Mr. Trump last week, during his state visit to the United Kingdom, hinted that the Taliban, who have struggled with an economic crisis, international legitimacy, internal rifts and rival militant groups since their return to power in 2021, could be game to allow the U.S. military to return.",
      "\"We're trying to get it back because they need things from us,\" Mr. Trump said of the Taliban. While the U.S. and the Taliban have no formal diplomatic ties, the sides have had hostage conversations. An American man who was abducted more than two years ago while traveling through Afghanistan as a tourist was released by the Taliban in March.",
      "The Taliban also said they reached an agreement with U.S. envoys on an exchange of prisoners as part of an effort to normalize relations between the United States and Afghanistan.",
      "They gave no details of the detainee swap, and the White House did not comment on the meeting in Kabul or the results described in a Taliban statement. The Taliban released photographs from their talks, showing their foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, with Mr. Trump's special envoy for hostage response, Adam Boehler.",

      "And this week on Face the Nation: As world leaders gather in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, we will talk exclusively with two of them.",
      "Plus, the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by a quarter-point. What does that signal for the economy?",
      "With Russia and Israel intensifying their offensive efforts in both the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict, we will preview a crucial week ahead, as President Trump heads to his first U.N. meeting of his second term.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron tells us why France and other U.S. allies will recognize Palestinian statehood, despite strong opposition from the U.S. and Israel.",
      "Plus, we traveled to Syria for an upcoming 60 Minutes piece and spoke to the country's new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa. He will be the first Syrian president to address the U.N. in nearly 60 years. We will tell you why he's such a controversial figure.",
      "Finally, former White House economic adviser Gary Cohn will join us to talk about the cooling labor market, tariffs and more.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "Most of our conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron was about his plan to end the war in Gaza. You will see that in our next half-hour.",
      "When we spoke with him Thursday at the Elysee Palace in Paris, we asked him about NATO scrambling jets for the first time in the alliance's history to shoot down Russian drones that had crossed into Poland and Romania. The day after we spoke, three Russian warplanes crossed into Estonia too.",
      "President Trump was asked about the incident in Poland 10 days ago.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Could have been a mistake. Could have been a mistake. But, regardless, I'm not happy about anything having to do with that whole situation.",
      "(End VT)",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe that these incursions could have been a mistake, as President Trump has suggested?",
      "EMMANUEL MACRON (French President): Very clearly, Russia is a destabilizing and aggressive power in Europe. They increased during the past few weeks the attacks against Kiev and killing a lot of civilians.",
      "They destroyed official buildings of the Ukrainian government, but as well premises of the U.K. government, of the European Union. And, at the same time, during the same weeks, they violated the Polish and the Romanian air.",
      "There is no mistake. There is just a project which is to destroy the maximum territories of Ukraine, to have a victory in Ukraine, and just to highlight what they want, the weakness of NATO.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: NATO says they're still investigating. They are not as certain as you seem to be\u2026",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: No. I'm not saying\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 that Russia did this intentionally.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: I just say this is not totally \u2013 I \u2013 this is not a specific point. If we had a situation where they were declining or decreasing the attacks against Kiev and \u2013 and on the battlefield, I could accept this argument.",
      "My point is to say, it's largely beyond that. My point is to say, look at what they did during the past few weeks. So, I sincerely believe that your president was committed and is committed to make peace in Ukraine.",
      "And he engaged. He took the risk to make a summit with President Putin in Anchorage. And \u2013 and he asked for negotiations. And I think he's right.",
      "But, at the same time, I have to \u2013 just to recognize that there is no clear willingness of President Putin to be sincerely engaged in such a move, because, as we were working on a diplomatic way, as we were trying to organize bilateral, trilateral, quadrilateral summit, the Russians were increasing the assaults in Donbass, but not just in Donbass, intensified provocations on one side and attacks on Kyiv on the other side.",
      "So I just look at the facts, and your president is as well looking at the facts. So, now what do we do? We have to increase sanctions against Russia, but we have to find the way to precisely put more pressure on Russia to bring them back at the table.",
      "In parallel, let me insist on one point. When we came to Washington, D.C., a series of European leaders with President Zelenskyy, we took a commitment. We will work to provide to Ukraine security guarantees. And we delivered. A few days ago here in Paris, we gathered what we call the coalition of the willing.",
      "You have 30 countries working together in order to provide the day-after peace security guarantees to Ukraine. So we have all these elements now with an historical commitment of the Europeans who provide the security guarantees to Ukraine. What we need now is Ukraine to be at the table with Russia and negotiating what the peace agreement could be on territory, on security guarantee, on the escalation, on recovery, et cetera.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't see any evidence of Russian interest? I mean, it's been more than a\u2026",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: So, now we have to step up, and we need political, military and economic surge in order to bring them back at the table and to negotiate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's now more than a month since that Alaska Summit, that big risk you said President Trump took. When he's been asked, so why not put sanctions or secondary tariffs on Russia, he points back here at Europe and the consumption of Russian oil and gas that still takes place.",
      "I know Hungary and Slovakia, for example, continue to use it.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: This is true. And we are fixing it. And we had discussion with Ursula von der Leyen. And she made great work with her teams to fix that.",
      "But let's be honest. This is very marginal. This is not a key driver today. We decreased by more than 80 percent the consumption of oil and gas. And I can tell you, because we were not the most impacted as a country because we were less dependent on this oil, oil and gas coming from Russia.",
      "But we have to finalize, to finish the job. This is true. But now it's clearly much more that when we are to do \u2013 what we have to do. We \u2013 we have to step up our support to Ukraine, and we have to provide the way to better resist to the new attacks on Kiev and civilians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What's the delay on the sanctions or tariffs then?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: As soon as possible. If it depends just on me, tomorrow, but it doesn't just depend on me.",
      "So I hope \u2013 I think we have to react collectively. If you want my \u2013 my strong view, I think it's very important. I think we all agree we want peace. We all agree the problem is Russia, because they don't want peace. So now we have to increase the pressure to convince Russia to come back at the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. has not contributed fighter jets to that new effort that was just recently announced after the drone incursions. The supreme allied commander is an American.",
      "But does that signal something to you, does that concern you that the United States isn't more muscular here?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: No, I'm not concerned or worried about that.",
      "I want to say that the NATO secretary-general worked very hard, and we all gathered and exchanged information with the Polish prime minister and the Polish president in the hours right after this \u2013 what happened. And, for instance, U.K. and France stepped up. And we sent fighters.",
      "But it's fine. We were in a situation to do so, and we are totally credible. But, at the same time, look at what the U.S. is doing in \u2013 on the eastern flank of NATO. You are a very strong contributor and reliable partner. So I don't want to \u2013 to diminish this role and your commitment.",
      "And \u2013 and I think your president was very clear about as well his commitment to NATO. But I'm totally in line with the fact that the Europeans have to step up. I have defended for years the fact that we need more independence, more strategic autonomy in Europe. And we need a stronger European pillar.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A year ago, if Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa had tried to come to New York, he would have risked being arrested. The U.S. had a $10 million bounty on him because of his past connections to the Islamic State and al Qaeda.",
      "Al-Sharaa turned against those groups years ago.",

      "(CHANTING)",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In December, he led the rebel forces that toppled Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, who used bombs and chemical weapons against his own people.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "(PRESIDENT AHMED AL-SHARAA SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Last week, I went to Syria and spoke with al-Sharaa for 60 Minutes. He accused the Assad regime of destroying entire communities and displacing 14 million people. He said foreign investment is desperately needed to rebuild.",
      "In June, President Trump temporarily waived some economic sanctions to help Syria recover. But Congress, the U.N. and European nations would have to permanently lift more sanctions to draw long-term investment.",
      "On Capitol Hill and in foreign capitals, there are people who don't trust Ahmed al-Sharaa. In New York, he hopes to reintroduce Syria to the world and perhaps spend more time with President Trump.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you want to meet again with President Trump when you're standing on U.S. soil?",
      "AHMED AL-SHARAA (Syrian President) (through translator): President Trump took a big step towards Syria by lifting the sanctions with a quick, courageous and historic decision.",
      "He recognized that Syria should be safe, stable and unified. This is in the greatest interest for all countries of the world, not just Syria. I believe the answer is yes. We need to discuss a great many issues and mutual interests between Syria and the USA. We must restore relations in a good and direct way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Many of the officials that I spoke to about you describe you as a pragmatist. Other skeptics say that you change to meet what you need to be in that moment and that's important to understand who you are and the direction you're taking Syria in.",
      "Are you saying that you are just a completely changed man?",
      "PRESIDENT AHMED AL-SHARAA (through translator): I don't entirely agree with the description of pragmatist, because, in Arabic, it has some negative connotations.",
      "The point is, let's look at what's happening now, regardless of what was said in the media. Today, we have really saved the people from the oppression that was being thrust on them by the criminal regime. And we have restored hope for the people who are refugees or internally displaced, so they can return to their homeland.",
      "We supported the people who were bombed with chemical weapons. We also confronted ISIS. We expelled the Iranian militias and Hezbollah from the region. All of these noble acts we took in Syria should have been the role of the international community. But the international community was unable to free a single prisoner or break the siege on a single town where people were starving to death.",
      "The international community failed to deter the regime from using chemical weapons. So I don't believe we should be standing accused at the defense table, but we should be the one asking others, why did you stand silent as these terrible crimes were taking place in Syria?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You believe the world failed Syria and now the world should help rebuild it?",
      "PRESIDENT AHMED AL-SHARAA (through translator): Of course. And I believe the world must not be complicit again in the killing of the Syrian people by slowing down or preventing the lifting of sanctions and preventing them from reconstructing their nation.",
      "Anybody who stands against the lifting of sanctions would be complicit in killing the Syrian people once again.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: More of my interview with President al-Sharaa will appear on the new season of 60 Minutes.",
      "And regarding that Russian incursion into Estonia on Friday, President Trump said this morning he would help Poland and the Baltic countries if Russia continues with its escalation.",
      "Up next, former White House Economic Council Director Gary Cohn will join us.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to a look at the U.S. economy.",
      "Gary Cohn was the head of the White House National Economic Council in the first Trump administration.",
      "Good morning. Great to have you back.",
      "GARY COHN (Former Director, White House National Economic Council): Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it finally happened. The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by a quarter-point, which was expected. So, rates are now in this range of 4 to 4.25 percent, lowest level since 2022.",
      "The president had said all this was overdue. What changes now?",
      "GARY COHN: So, look, I think the Fed gave us a lot of important information this last week. As you said, they started down the path of cutting interest rates, going to 4 \u2013 to 4.25.",
      "They also gave us their outlook. So, the 17 governors gave us their projections to where they think interest rates are going. So that plot that they put out shows that, overall, they believe that interest rates will be cut two more times over the course of this year. Now, it's not 100 percent clear because the committee is divided.",
      "There are about seven members of the committee that do not want another cut this year, but there are 10 members of the committee that want at least two more cuts, and one wants more than two cuts. So that averages out to two cuts this year, which would take the federal funds rate \u2013 and it's important to understand it's the federal funds rate \u2013 would take that down to 3.6 percent for the \u2013 for year-end.",
      "Well, what is also important is, the committee was fairly unanimous. I think people were worried about the independence of the Fed. I think the Fed clearly showed themselves to be independent thinkers. They took into account all of the economic data, and they came out with a \u2013 projections that made sense based on what is going on in the economy today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when rates go lower, money gets cheaper to borrow, essentially.",
      "GARY COHN: Well\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what does it actually mean for consumers?",
      "GARY COHN: Yes and no.",
      "So, what the Federal Reserve sets is, they set the federal funds rate. That's the overnight rates that banks charge each other to borrow on a secured basis. It has nothing to do where \u2013 with where American consumers borrow money.",
      "Unfortunately, American consumers borrow money on more of the five-year, the seven-year, the 10-, and the 30-year rates, because that's where automobile loans, credit card loans, student loans, and mortgages are indexed to. Those interest rates are not determined by the Federal Reserve. They're determined by the open market.",
      "Those rates, in fact, after they cut rates earlier this week, went up a little bit. That said, they are down over the last few months, but those rates do not automatically go down when the Federal Reserve cuts rates. They have more to do with the market. And it's a supply-demand situation that determines those rates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one of the other things the Fed highlighted here is that the labor market is \u2013 quote \u2013 \"really cooling off.\"",
      "That's what Fed Chair Powell says.",
      "GARY COHN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The administration, the treasury secretary says, data is bad. They're not seeing that in the jobs numbers.",
      "So, which is it? What's happening here?",
      "GARY COHN: Well, the chairman went out of his way to talk about the dual mandate that the Fed has. The Fed has two requirements that they're supposed to run interest rate policy off of. One is called stable prices, which means 2 percent inflation. The other is full employment. Full employment is exactly what it sounds like.",
      "The chair said, look, we are going to have to deal with the full employment part of the equation, even though we still have inflation in the system. So the Federal Reserve itself and the Board of Governors admitted that we are having a declining job market. And we see that. The data over the last three or four months, we have gone from creating well over 100,000 jobs a month to creating less than 50,000 jobs a month.",
      "It may be temporary. It may be quite temporary, but the reality is, we have seen the job market degrade. We have also seen companies announce an enormous amount of CapEx and \u2013 capital expenditures that's going to come into the system.",
      "I think it's interesting to take a step back and look at what's going on in the world today. I do think that we have seen companies cut back on the amount of employees they have. When you take companies, and you put them in a very difficult environment, and you increase the cost of input costs \u2013 and inputs have been going up because of tariffs. They have been going up other reasons.",
      "And they're not able to raise prices to the final consumer. The one lever they can pull to make sure they keep their margins intact is, they can cut down on the cost of labor. We came out of a tough situation in COVID, where companies were actually afraid about being able to attract and retain people. So they were hoarding labor.",
      "So we went from a hoarding labor situation to a situation today where companies are being very aggressive about managing their expenses. And the one expense they can manage is the cost of labor. So they're letting their labor force decline naturally as people retire out of the labor system. And we're seeing that in the data.",
      "And I think it's clearly showing up. And the Federal Reserve recognized that in this \u2013 in this week's action.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you ask the administration about this point, they will say, well, productivity is going to increase, and there are these technological shifts that are happening, so this data is distorted.",
      "Are you speaking specifically about tech, or are you saying across the board?",
      "GARY COHN: I'm saying across the board.",
      "I mean, we are \u2013 we have seen across the board. And we see anecdotal evidence of this. I have seen and I have heard it directly from corporate CEOs in every business line that they have gone out of their way to cut their human capital overhead.",
      "So, just the data for Q2 was pretty \u2013 pretty interesting. Corporate revenues rose about 6.3 for Q2, and corporate profits rose close to 12 percent. The way you do that, unless you're raising prices on the consumer \u2013 and we haven't seen a lot of prices go up to the consumer \u2013 is, you have to cut something out of the expense bucket.",
      "The one thing they're cutting is, they're cutting labor costs. We have seen it in the U.S. data. We have seen it in the private data. And we have seen it in the anecdotal data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president signed an executive order on Friday that I want to ask you about, because you have this role at IBM and some insight into tech.",
      "The order is going to impose a $100,000 one-time fee for visas granted to foreign workers, highly skilled workers, H-1B visas. \"The Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that this caused, like, a panic, because there wasn't a lot of detail, at, like, Apple, and Google, and Microsoft.",
      "Did it cause a panic at IBM?",

      "It's been cleaned up over the weekend. So, at this point, there's not a panic in the system. Everyone who's got an H-1B visa understands their status and understands how it \u2013 how it's \u2013 how it's going to work. I actually think this is a good idea.",
      "If you understand the H-1B visa program in the United States, historically, it has been a lottery system. So companies have turned in for these visas, and then the U.S. government lotteries them off. If you're now telling a company, look, you need to spend $100,000 to get one of these visas, you're not just going to ask for a visa and put a name in the lottery unless that is a highly skilled person who you need who you cannot hire in the United States.",
      "This visa program is meant for high-skilled labor where you cannot hire that person in the United States. So if that's what it's used for, ultimately, we're going to bring high-skilled people into the United States. It's going to help grow our economy. And that's good for all of us.",

It's a move the U.S. is opposed to.",

      "EMMANUEL MACRON (President of France): We have to preserve the condition of a political perspective for everybody. So, we would announce a recognition that which is the beginning of a political process, and a peace and security plan for everybody.",
      "So, right after this \u2013 this recognition, we have a first phase, which is, I would say, is the emergency phase. Ceasefire, release of all hostages, and, third, restoring the humanitarian roads and stabilization of Gaza.",
      "You know, the second package, which is the day after, we will revert into (ph) that, how to organize gathering (ph) in terms of governance, security, and construction.",
      "And third package, a perspective of the two states. But recognizing a Palestinian state today is the only way to provide a political solution to a situation which has to stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you are not making the release of the hostages a condition before recognition? That comes after?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: It will be \u2013 it will be first the requirements very clearly before opening, for instance, any embassy in \u2013 in Palestine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this is a reckless decision. That's the word he used. He said, \"it gives Hamas little incentive to actually start diplomacy to release the hostages.\"",
      "Why do you disagree with that sequencing?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: I think probably this is an excessive word, and I disagree with this approach. Why? Because the objective of Hamas is absolutely not to create a Palestinian state. The objective of Hamas is to destroy Israel, to convince a maximum number of people that they have no chance to have peace and stability in precisely a Palestinian state, and \u2013 and to kill the maximum number of Israeli people. And this is why. If we \u2013 we want to stop this war, if we want to isolate Hamas, the recognition process and the peace plan which goes with this recognition process is a pre-condition.",
      "So, my first point is to say, I don't answer (INAUDIBLE). I don't mix the expectations of Hamas. Hamas is just opposite (ph) by destroying Israel. But I recognize the legitimacy of so many Palestinian people who want a state, who are a people, they want a nation, they want a state, and we should not push them toward Hamas. If we don't offer them a political perspective and such a recognition, the unique answer would be security, and they will be completely tapped by Hamas as a unique (ph) option.",
      "My second point is, thanks to the recognition, and thanks to the diplomatic move we launched, we started to isolate Hamas because we, at the New York declaration, which was voted, as you know, by 142 countries, we gathered all of (INAUDIBLE) states, all of the leaders of the regions to work closely with us to precisely dismantle and disarm Hamas. To know that we're not engaging in such a move.",
      "Now, we gathered all these states, all these people who work closely with us in this move. So, I think this is why we can create the condition of a concrete action first to give this right to the Palestinian people, second, to isolate Hamas from the rest of the Palestinians in the whole region and precisely build security.",
      "But let me tell you something which for me very important in this context. Israel had wonderful security results against Hezbollah, Hamas, top leaders, and they managed to \u2013 to \u2013 to neutralize (ph) a lot of top decision makers of (INAUDIBLE). They did it. This is their merit.",
      "But in terms of fighting against Hamas, this is a failure today. They start",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What is a failure?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: Because they \u2013 they killed all of the key leaders. This is a success. But at the beginning of this war, you had more or less 25,000 Hamas fighters. The Israeli army killed probably half of them. But Hamas managed to recruit the equivalent. You have as many fighters as at the very beginning, which is the best evidence of the fact, if we want to dismantle Hamas, the total war is not the answer because it's just killing the credibility of Israel. And, by the way, weakening and killing our own credibility if we don't make a move as the one we are organizing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you just pointed to something that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu would say, well this is why we need to continue until we get rid of every Hamas member. You're saying, you can't kill that idea. You need to provide a different idea?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: Exactly. But this is so \u2013 this is the whole perspective. And look at the situation, not just by the way in Gaza, but everywhere in the region. Hamas was clearly not backed by a lot of people before the 7th of October. If you took the pulse (ph) in Gaza, but in all the countries of the region, they were very low in all the polls (ph). Today, the level of support is much higher because they are making the mistake, in fact, to reduce all of the perspective of the Palestinians to Hamas. What we have to say is, we want the dismantling of Hamas. You had the success. There is no more top leaders. We want to isolate them. We want to \u2013 to bring everybody working with us to dismantle the Hamas, but recognizing this right to have a Palestinian state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: So, a diplomatic challenge. This is just giving another channel and \u2013 and offering a political way in isolating Hamas. So, I think there is no future with the option which would be just, let's kill the maximum number of Hamas people because they just recruit others and others because each time they launch this type of operations, they kill so many civilians that they are just destroying their own reputation and credibility and they are creating an unsustainable framework of security in the whole region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But since October 7th, popular support in Israeli for a Palestinian state has also declined. Prime Minister Netanyahu has been opposed for a very, very long time. And now he says that, just look at those attacks that day. If you allow for any kind of Palestinian state, it will be a launchpad for terrorism. I mean that is his argument, that this shows you can't allow for the safety and security of Israel if there are two states. Why is he wrong?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: First, I want to \u2013 I want to say that the 7th of October was a total trauma for everybody in \u2013 in our country here because we had so many French people being killed during the 7th of October terrorist attack launched by Hamas. And \u2013 and it was, for us, one of the biggest terrorist attacks against our own fellow citizens. But we \u2013 we did share and we do share the pain and the suffer of the Israeli people and so many families. And for me, the top priority remains the release of hostages.",
      "And I met very regularly families of \u2013 of hostages. And I have to say that what they live is unbearable. And I \u2013 I had the opportunity to met with them. Yeta Hargiz (ph) mother and so many of them. And what they describe is \u2013 is absolutely unbearable.",
      "But I consider that if we want precisely to build a sustainable peace for Israel, it's a \u2013 and for the Israeli people, a political process and the recognition of a Palestinian state, if the state recognizes the right of Israel to leave and defend itself is demilitarized, has security forces with the vetting process by Israel, with obviously a proper governance and reformed governance, and \u2013 and is precisely \u2013 we have a series of reform, which are a part of the process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that that's it, right? You are talking about recognizing the Palestinian Authority, with some governance over the West Bank. Already was working with Israeli Security Forces. But Hamas came to power through the ballot box in the first place.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: Look, it's \u2013 if we are honest, it started (ph) different. And this is why I think \u2013 let's accept the fact that a lot of people have worked very hard to kill the credibility of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza years ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Uh-uh.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: And Hamas appeared as a \u2013 precisely a sort of alternative option.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Uh-uh.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: But (INAUDIBLE) attacks were launched by Hamas, not by Palestinian Authority. And if we say all those living in Gaza, and all those backing the Palestinian state are de facto parts of Hamas, there is no end to this war, except that you will kill everybody. And this is \u2013 this is terrible.",
      "So, we have to recognize that the Palestinian Authority has to be reformed, the governance is not satisfactory today. We need a new \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The leader is nearly 90 years old.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: You have a new \u2013 we need a new Palestinian Authority. But let's just remark and please notice with me that thanks to the work of mission process (ph) we launched. For the first time for many years, we got 9th of June a series of clear commitments from the Palestinian Authority. They refused him (ph). Now, the \u2013 the reform, a new vice president being elected, a reform of the education program, (INAUDIBLE) of the (INAUDIBLE) program as well with the monitoring by a U.S. (INAUDIBLE).",
      "So, we launched a series \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they denounced the attack. They denounced October 7th.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: And for the very first time there were \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Twenty months later.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: This is true, but for what? Because we made this move.",
      "So, the recognition is the way (INAUDIBLE) to reengage and bring them back and to table. And my point is to say, let's isolate Hamas. And let's focus on the dismantling of Hamas from a military and a political point of view. In order to do so, we have to reengage with those who can be, I would say, a political achievement for the Palestinian people. And this is why the recognition is so important. And if we revert to West Bank, one of the key element which triggered my decision to announce in July the perspective of \u2013 as a recognition for the 22nd of September, is a vote of the Knesset. When the Knesset decided to start the (INAUDIBLE) again, in West Bank, it was the best evidence of the fact that they don't want to \u2013 to fight against Hamas. There is no Hamas in West Bank. They just want to destroy the existing political bodies and the possibility of two states. And I really believe this is a terrible mistake for Israel itself because, in doing so, they just kill any other perspective that (ph) war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. But when you \u2013 I understand the argument you are making, but it has put you at direct odds with the Trump administration, who argue that your decision to make this recognition announcement, along with all these U.N. members, that it, in fact, kills the diplomacy they had underway. They said they were working to get, for example, the tax money from the Israelis to hand back over to the Palestinian Authority. That they were doing practical things on the ground to help Palestinians.",
      "Secretary Rubio said that West Bank division you were talking about with the settlements, he drew a direct line to your recognition. Why do you think they're blaming you for that?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: We \u2013 we \u2013 we are closely coordinated with the U.S. administration when we speak about the ceasefire and the release of hostages. We were always in close coordination with the secretary of state or key \u2013 key \u2013 President Trump's advisers in order to work with Qatar, Egypt and Israel on the release of hostages, a ceasefire.",
      "But your administration is focusing on the day after. And what we propose is a full-fledged plan where we have first the emergency package. So, let's deliver the release of hostages, ceasefire and \u2013 and humanitarian access.",
      "The day we have that, we start the day after. And I think we are very convergent with the work which is being done by \u2013 by your administration. What we want is a de facto governance in Gaza with clearly a sort of transitional administration, including the Palestinian Authority, excluding, clearly, Hamas, but with a vetting process of Israel, and an association of all the neighbors. We have a security package in this \u2013 in this day after approach, which is, let's scale up the training of the policemen and security forces of the Palestinians. And \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who will do that?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: We \u2013 we are already are doing that \u2013 are doing so. Many country (INAUDIBLE). It does exist. But we need to scale up. And in parallel, we proposed, and we worked very closely with the United Kingdom and all the leaders of the region precisely to offer a military, I would say, an international force to be deployed in Gaza with a U.N. mandate, which is a unique framework to be defended, and \u2013 which could be legitimate to assist and \u2013 and back, I would say, this policemen and security forces. And \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know Israel does not trust the United Nations at all.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: No, I \u2013 this is a U.N. framework, but this \u2013 first they would have a vetting process for (INAUDIBLE), and it would involve Jordan, Egypt, and some others \u2013 some others are ready as well to finance. But, obviously, it needs to be made in close coordination with Israel.",
      "And in the second (ph) package of \u2013 is a core element is a dismantling of Hamas. There is no other option. If you want to fix the situation, to disarm Hamas, and precisely to demobilize so many fighters, to organize what we call a DDR (ph) process, which is very familiar to all the experts in this type of situation. And this is in this day after for Gaza, in the security package, as we can organize such a DDR vis-\u2026-vis Hamas and to be sure that Hamas will never be involved in the Golans (ph) but sets \u2013 Hamas will be disarmed, dismantled, with some key people to leave Gaza and some other to be deradicalized and the weapons to be taken.",
      "In order to do so, you need clear security forces here. You need international forces to be here. And, obviously, we have the (INAUDIBLE). On that, I think there is a strong alignment with the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: My point is the recognition and the process we launch with that is the only way to bring with us on this track all the neighbors and key countries in order to deliver such a package. And \u2013 and look at the situation. Today, when Egypt, when so many leaders of the region are not uncomfortable with what is being done, you need to re-engage them. And this is exactly what we are doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So \u2013",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: But my point is to see, if we don't have this full package, the day after is impossible because today, de facto, you are accepting the displacement of population in Gaza City. How do you want the day after to be possible if you displace thousands of people?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, exactly on this point. When you say day after, that means when the war ends and some kind of rebuilding happens. What you're talking about with the Trump administration is this idea of having Palestinians leave Gaza, by choice, they say, but some would say that is a step towards ethnic cleansing. In fact, an independent commission set up by the U.S. concluded Israel has a, quote, \"intent to destroy Palestinians in Gaza as defined by the genocide convention.\" Does France agree with that report?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: No, we don't qualify as a genocide who's happening because it is not a political statement. This is judges (ph) or the end \u2013 or the historians to qualify a genocide by a series of evidence and a clear jurisprudence and \u2013 and clear elements.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you reject that report and that finding?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: No, I don't reject the report. This is not my point. My point is, it should not \u2013 it should not be a political debate. What's happening is clearly a lot of civilians are being killed de facto underground, and the project is to displace people. So, I think this is a big mistake. And this is where I try to convince your administration that if we agree on the day after, and we want this de facto authority, this security package, the dismantling of Hamas and the reconstruction (ph), let's work on the \u2013 on the current day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: If you accept de facto, Israel to displace its people, you will never see the day after. And by the way, I look very carefully at all the plans being shared by your administration or shared by experts working for your administration, they always reiterate, let's work and be together for Gazans. It means that they are ready to preserve and protect Palestinian people because Gazans are those who are living in Gaza. But if the precondition of such a plan is to push them out, this is just a craziness. So, we \u2013 we should not be, for the credibility of the United States, for the credibility of France, we cannot be implicitly or explicitly complacent with such a project because such a project, we know it. And by the way, all of the security expert, even in Israel, are very clear on the fact it will be a humanitarian disaster. And this project will kill the possibility of the day after.",
      "So, we have to be very explicit on the fact that attacking civilians just to get a few \u2013 a few terrorists and a few fighters is clearly not acceptable, but displacing people in order just to take a territory, which is not in the hands of \u2013 of \u2013 of Israel, in order to prepare the day after, is not just a tad crazy,, but unacceptable for all of us.",
      "(END VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The final part of our interview, when we come back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: France has one of the largest Muslim and Jewish populations in Europe. And there has been a significant rise in the number of anti-Semitic acts around the world. In France, it's most than tripled recently.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. ambassador to France, Charles Kushner, the father of the son-in-law to the president of the United States, Jared's father, he published an article, and I know you've \u2013 you've read it, saying France is not dealing with anti-Semitism in France. He said, \"not a day passes without Jews assaulted in the streets, synagogues or schools defaced, or Jewish-owned businesses vandalized. Your own interior ministry reported anti-Semitic incidents, even at preschools.",
      "Do you accept this criticism as \u2013 as genuine and valid?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: Not at all. I think this is a mistake. And \u2013 and an unacceptable statement for somebody who is supposed to be a diplomat. This is my \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Unacceptable statement?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: Yes. Never a French ambassador would be allowed to do so.",
      "So \u2013 and so you are a person who wants to express freely (ph), fine. If you are a diplomat, you have to follow the role of diplomacy. And I'm not the one. This is (INAUDIBLE) to be the ambassador of the United States in France. But the taxpayer money is not properly used to finance this \u2013 this kind of statement.",
      "So, this is not a speech letter (ph) \u2013 word of an ambassador. This is unacceptable. Now the matter is much more important. And the matter about anti-Semitism is, for me, one of my top priority. I was the first president in France to adopt a definition of anti-Semitism, making it the equivalent of anti-Zionism (ph). And \u2013 And I have always been very engaged against anti-Semitism. We've worked very hard during the past few years in order to precisely reengage, have faster sanctions, and I never neglected this topic. And we took \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know in the U.S. sometimes people hear criticism of Israel as anti-Semitic. And you are saying it's different?",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: No, but \u2013 no. My point is to say, you can \u2013 you cannot reject the existence of Israel. Anti \u2013 anti-Zionism (ph) is unacceptable and is anti-Semitism. But it doesn't mean that you are not allowed to be in disagreement with the government of Israel, otherwise we will become crazy. I'm sorry, but I \u2013 I want to fight very hard against anti-Semitism. I \u2013 I'm totally (ph) against any anti-Zionist (ph) speech. But I do endorse to be in disagreement with Prime Minister Netanyahu and some of his ministers on many topics. It doesn't make me an anti-Semitic.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Gary Cohn, IBM vice chair and former National Economic Council director in President Trump's first term, said Sunday that \"we've seen the job market degrade,\" though he noted that it may be \"temporary.\"",
      "\"The Federal Reserve itself and the board of governors admitted that we are having a declining job market. And we see that,\" Cohn said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Last week, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, in the first rate cut since December, amid slower economic growth and a stalling labor market. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has a dual mandate to ensure that both inflation and unemployment remain low, said \"what's different now is that you see a very different picture of the risks to the labor market.\" And though Powell noted that he didn't want to put \"too much emphasis on payroll job creation,\" he said \"it's just one of the things that suggests that the labor market is really cooling off.\"",
      "\"That tells you that it's time to take that into account,\" Powell said.",
      "Meanwhile the jobs numbers, which have shown an ongoing slowdown in the labor market, have been under scrutiny in recent weeks, as the administration has questioned the validity of the government data. Last month, President Trump fired former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after a disappointing July jobs report.",
      "Cohn pointed to job data on Sunday, saying, \"over the last three or four months, we have gone from creating well over 100,000 jobs a month to creating less than 50,000 jobs a month.\" And he noted that \"I do think that we have seen companies cut back on the amount of employees they have.\"",
      "The IBM vice chair outlined that when companies are put in a \"very difficult environment,\" with input costs going up due to tariffs and other reasons, and they're unable to raise prices on consumers, \"the one lever they can pull to make sure they keep their margins intact is they can cut down on the cost of labor.\"",
      "\"We came out of a tough situation in COVID where companies were actually afraid about being able to attract and retain people, so they were hoarding labor,\" Cohn said. \"So we went from a hoarding labor situation to a situation today where companies are being very aggressive about managing their expenses, and the one expense they can manage is the cost of labor.\"",
      "Cohn said companies are now \"letting their labor force decline naturally as people retire out of the labor system.\" He said in the data, \"I think it's clearly showing up, and the Federal Reserve recognized that in this week's action.\"",
      "Cohn said he didn't think this change is specific to tech, but \"across the board.\" He noted that he's \"heard it directly from corporate CEOs in every business line that they have gone out of their way to cut their human capital overhead.\"",
      "On the rate cut more broadly, Cohn said \"the Fed gave us a lot of important information this last week,\" pointing to the rate cut, along with Fed officials providing their outlook, with projections of where they think interest rates are going. And he also noted that \"what is also important is the committee was fairly unanimous,\" acknowledging concerns about the independence of the Fed that have come to a head in recent weeks.",
      "\"I think the Fed clearly showed themselves to be independent thinkers,\" he said. \"They took into account all of the economic data, and they came out with a projection that made sense based on what is going on in the economy today.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 21 Sep 2025 12:34:57 -0400",
    "summary": "In an interview with CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" the French president pushed back on criticism for recognizing a Palestinian state.",
    "story": [
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said it was out of line for Charles Kushner, the U.S. ambassador to France and the father of President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, to publicly accuse him of taking insufficient action to combat antisemitism, and for him to link France's foreign policy positions to domestic incidents of violence against Jews in France.",
      "In a letter he published in the Wall Street Journal to Macron in August, Kushner wrote that he had \"deep concern over the dramatic rise of antisemitism in France and the lack of sufficient action by your government to confront it.\"",
      "\"Public statements haranguing Israel and gestures toward recognition of a Palestinian state embolden extremists, fuel violence, and endanger Jewish life in France,\" he wrote, urging Macron to \"enforce hate-crime laws without exception; ensure the safety of Jewish schools, synagogues and businesses, prosecute offenders to the fullest extent; and abandon steps that give legitimacy to Hamas and its allies.\"",
      "In an interview with \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan on Thursday in Paris, Macron called Kushner's criticism a \"mistake\" and an \"unacceptable statement for somebody who is supposed to be a diplomat.\"",
      "\"This is unacceptable,\" he said.",
      "Macron said a French ambassador would never be allowed to make similar public remarks about another country because it would risk diplomacy with those nations.",
      "\"So either you are a person who wants to express freely,\" Macron said. \"If you are a diplomat, you have to follow the rule of diplomacy. \u2026 The [American] taxpayer money is not properly used to finance this kind of statement.\"",
      "France's foreign ministry summoned the ambassador last month in a formal rebuke. The French ministry said Kushner's claims \"run counter to international law,\" citing the \"obligation not to interfere in the internal affairs of states\" in the 1961 Vienna Convention of Diplomatic Relations.",
      "Kushner also wrote that \"anti-Zionism is antisemitism \u2014 plain and simple.\"",
      "The State Department said at the time in a statement to the Associated Press, that Kushner \"is our U.S. government representative in France and is doing a great job advancing our national interests in that role.\"",
      "Macron acknowledged that at times people who criticize the state of Israel and its government may be motivated by hate of Jews, but rejected the idea that any of his criticism of the policies of the Netanyahu government is inherently anti-semitic.",
      "He told Brennan, \"I was the first president in France to adopt the definition of antisemitism, making it the equivalent of anti-Zionism.\"",
      "Macron firmly rejected the notion that his objections to the killing in Gaza or his call for the creation of a Palestinian state is inherently antisemitic or puts at risk French Jews. He argued \"it doesn't mean that you are not allowed to be in disagreement with the government of Israel.\" Disagreeing with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"doesn't make me an antisemitic,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu currently leads the most right- wing government in Israeli history, opposes the creation of a Palestinian state, and has waged a nearly two- year- long war in Gaza that succeeded in killing the Hamas leaders who carried out the bloody October 7th terrorist attack that killed 1200 of his people. The war since that time has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, and his policies including a blockade of humanitarian aid has led to famine in Gaza.",
      "Hamas still operates in Gaza, and Macron said Hamas continues to be able to recruit more fighters despite Israel killing the top echelons of the terror group. The failure to eliminate support for Hamas via military force is proof, Macron argues, that support is needed for an alternate government in the form of the Palestinian Authority.",
      "Netanyahu accused Macron of fueling antisemitism after the French president announced France would recognize Palestinian statehood this Monday at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.",
      "The high-level gathering of world leaders and their representatives, and other countries, including the U.K., Australia and Canada, also plan to join France in recognizing Palestinian statehood. The majority of the world's countries - 147 UN members - recognize the right of Palestinians to self-determination but the decision by Western powers including UN Security Council member France and UK is symbolically significant. It is also a sign of the increased isolation of the current Israeli government, which has refused to end the nearly two year war in Gaza.",
      "The plan developed by France and Saudi Arabia involves several phases, including a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, Hamas releasing the remaining hostages it's held since its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel and the restoration of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Those conditions would have to be met before France opens an embassy there, Macron said. The second phase involves Gaza's reconstruction and governance and the third phase focuses on a two-state solution.",
      "Macron succeeded in getting Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas, the 90-year-old leader who governs the Occupied West Bank, to publicly denounce Hamas and agree to reform the Authority and hold elections.",
      "\"Recognizing the Palestinian state today is the only way to provide a political solution to a situation which has to stop,\" Macron said.",
      "The position puts France in direct conflict with the Trump administration, which blocked Palestinian Authority members from obtaining visas to attend the diplomatic gathering. Despite President Trump's statements that starvation is happening in Gaza and Israel should end its war there, Netanyahu has brushed off any American urging to do so. Recently Trump said he 'wasn't thrilled' with Netanyahu's decision to bomb US ally Qatar while Hamas members were meeting to discuss a US proposal to end the Gaza war.",
      "The current U.S. administration also appears to oppose the creation of a Palestinian State, with Trump supporting a proposal to remove Gazans and send them to other countries. The U.S. remains a staunch supporter of Israel, as well as its main weapons provider.",
      "Margaret Brennan is moderator of \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on CBS. Based in Washington, D.C., Brennan is also the Network's chief foreign affairs correspondent and a contributing correspondent to 60 Minutes. Additionally, she appears regularly on the \"CBS Evening News,\" leading coverage from Washington when news breaks on the political and foreign affairs fronts."

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Gary Cohn, IBM vice chairman and former director of the U.S. National Economic Council, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 21, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to a look at the U.S. economy. Gary Cohn was the head of the White House National Economic Council in the first Trump administration. Good morning. Great to have you back.",
      "GARY COHN: Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it finally happened. The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by quarter point, which was expected. So, rates are now in this range of four to four and a quarter percent, lowest level since 2022 the President had said all of this was overdue. What changes now?",
      "GARY COHN: So, look, I think the Fed gave us a lot of important information this last week. As you said, they started down the path of cutting interest rates, going to four to four and a quarter.\u00a0 They also gave us their outlook. So the 17 governors gave us their projections to where they think interest rates are going. So that plot that they put out shows that overall, they believe that interest rates will be cut two more times over the course of this year. Now it's not 100% clear, because the committee is divided. There are about seven members of the committee that do not want another cut this year, but there are 10 members of the committee that want at least two more cuts, and one wants more than two cuts. So that averages out to two cuts this year, which would take the federal funds rate, and it's important to understand the federal funds rate, would take that down to 3.6% for the- for year end. What is also important is the committee was fairly unanimous. I think people were worried about the independence of the Fed. I think the Fed clearly showed themselves to be independent thinkers. They took into account all of the economic data, and they came out with a projections that made sense based on what is going on in the economy today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when rates go lower, money gets cheaper to borrow, essentially. But what does it actually mean?",
      "GARY COHN: Yes and no. So, what the Federal Reserve sets is they set the federal funds rate. That's the overnight rates the banks charge each other to borrow on a secured basis. It has nothing to do where- with where American consumers borrow money. Unfortunately, American consumers borrow money on more of the five year, the seven year, the ten and the thirty year rates, because that's where automobile loans, credit card loans, student loans and mortgages are indexed to those. Interest rates are not determined by the Federal Reserve. They're determined by the open market. Those rates, in fact, after they cut rates earlier this week, went up a little bit that said they are down over the last few months. But those rates do not automatically go down when the Federal Reserve cuts rates. They have more to do with the market, and it's a supply demand situation that determines those rates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So one of the other things the Fed highlighted here is that the labor market is, quote, \"really cooling off.\" That's what Fed Chair Powell says.",
      "GARY COHN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The administration, the Treasury secretary, says, data's bad. They're not seeing that in the jobs numbers. So which is it? What's happening here?",
      "GARY COHN: Well, look, the chairman went out of his way to talk about the dual mandate that the Fed has. The Fed has two requirements that they're supposed to run interest rate policy off of, one is called stable prices, which means 2% inflation. The other is full employment. Full employment is exactly what it sounds like. The Chair said, look, we are going to have to deal with the full employment part of the equation, even though we still have inflation in the system. So, the Federal Reserve itself and the Board of Governors admitted that we are having a declining job market, and we see that, the data over the last three or four months, we have gone from creating well over 100,000 jobs a month to creating less than 50,000 jobs a month. It may be temporary, it may be quite temporary, but the reality is, we have seen the job market degrade. We've also seen companies announce an enormous amount of CapEx and capital expenditures that's going to come into the system. I think it's interesting to take a step back and look at what's going on in the world today. I do think that we have seen companies cut back on the amount of employees they have. You know, when you take companies and you put them in a very difficult environment and you increase the cost of input costs. And inputs have been going up because of tariffs. They've been going up be- other reasons, and they're not able to raise prices to the final consumer. The one lever they can pull to make sure they keep their margins intact is they can cut down on the cost of labor. We came out of a tough situation in COVID where companies were actually afraid about being able to attract and retain people, so they were hoarding labor. So we went from a hoarding labor situation to a situation today where companies are being very aggressive about managing their expenses, and the one expense they can manage is the cost of labor. So they're letting their labor force decline naturally as people retire out of the labor system, and we're seeing that in the data, and I think it's clearly showing up.And the Federal Reserve. Recognize that in this in this week's action,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you ask the administration about this point, let's say, well, productivity is going to increase, and there are these technological shifts that are happening. So this data is distorted. Are you-, speaking specifically about tech, or are you saying across the board?",
      "GARY COHN: I'm saying across the board. I mean, we are-- we have seen across the board, and we've seen anecdotal evidence of this. I've seen, and I've heard it directly from corporate CEOs in every business line that they have gone out of their way to cut their- their human capital overhead. So just the data for Q2 is pretty, pretty interesting. Corporate revenues rose about 6.3% for Q2 and corporate profits rose close to 12%. The way you do that, unless you're raising prices of the consumer, and we, and we haven't seen a lot of prices go up to consumer, is you have to cut something out of the expense bucket. The one thing they're cutting is they're cutting labor costs. We've seen it in the U.S. data. We've seen it in the private data, and we've seen it in the anecdotal data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the president signed an executive order on Friday that I want to ask you about, because you have this role at IBM, and some insight into tech. The order is going to impose a $100,000 one-time fee for visas granted to foreign workers, highly skilled workers, H-1B visas. The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that this caused, like, a panic, because there wasn't a lot of detail, at, like, Apple, and Google, and Microsoft. Did it cause a panic at IBM? I mean, what's going on?",
      "GARY COHN: The- the- I think it caused a panic over the weekend because people weren't sure what was going on with the existing H-1B visas. It's been cleaned up over the weekend, so at- at this point, there's not a panic in the system. Everyone who's got an H-1B visa understands their status and understands how it- how it's- how it's going to work. I actually think this is a good idea. If you understand the H-1B visa program in the United States, historically, it has been a lottery system. So companies have turned in for these visas, and then the U.S. government lotteries them off. If you're now telling a company, look, you need to spend $100,000 to get one of these visas, you're not just going to ask for a- a visa and put a name in the lottery, unless that is a highly skilled person who you need, who you cannot hire in the United States. This visa program is meant for high skilled labor, where you cannot hire that person in the United States. So if that's what it's used for, ultimately we're going to bring high skilled people in the United States. It's going to help grow our economy, and that's good for all of us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll see. Gary Cohn, thank you for your insights, as always. We'll be right back."

      "ABC, owned by Disney, took \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" off the air indefinitely on Wednesday, two days after Kimmel faced criticism for his comments on conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination. Just hours before the company's decision, FCC Chair Brendan Carr had publicly urged ABC to \"take action\" in response to Kimmel's remarks, saying in an interview: \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way.\"",
      "On his podcast Friday, Cruz called Carr a \"good guy\" but skewered him for his outspoken intervention.",
      "\"I gotta say, that's right out of 'Goodfellas.' That's right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, 'nice bar you have here, it'd be a shame if something happened to it,'\" the Texas senator said, mimicking a mob boss's accent.",
      "Kimmel had drawn conservatives' ire for saying during his monologue on Monday's show: \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\" Kimmel also mocked President Trump's reaction to the shooting.",
      "Cruz had little sympathy for Kimmel, whom he called \"profoundly unfunny\" and \"bitter and nasty.\" The senator also called the comedian's disappearance from the airwaves a \"fantastic thing\" and argued his show was preempted because he \"flat-out lied\" about Kirk's killing.",

      "CBS News has reached out to the FCC for comment.",
      "Carr called for action on Kimmel in an interview Wednesday with right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson. The FCC commissioner \u2014 a staunch Trump ally \u2014 called Kimmel's remarks \"some of the sickest conduct possible,\" and suggested it would be appropriate for ABC to suspend Kimmel. He also said the independent companies that own ABC's local affiliates ought to \"push back\" against the network and possibly take Kimmel's show off the air, pointing to FCC rules requiring broadcast TV stations to act in the public interest.",
      "Shortly after Carr's comments on Wednesday, media giants Nexstar and Sinclair Broadcast Group \u2014 which each own dozens of ABC affiliate stations \u2014 announced they would preempt Kimmel's show, condemning Kimmel's remarks about Kirk's assassination.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is ending the Temporary Protected Status of thousands of immigrants from Syria living in the U.S., arguing it is not in America's interest to continue the humanitarian program, the Department of Homeland Security announced Friday.",
      "The department said conditions no longer prevent Syrians from returning to their war-ravaged homeland. Syria faced a bloody civil war for over a decade until dictator Bashar al-Assad was ousted last year. Sectarian violence has continued even after the Assad government was overthrown.",
      "In a statement, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin also cited terrorist activity in Syria as additional grounds to terminate the TPS program.",
      "\"Syria has been a hotbed of terrorism and extremism for nearly two decades, and it is contrary to our national interest to allow Syrians to remain in our country,\" McLaughlin added. \"TPS is meant to be temporary.\"",
      "Syrians who don't have another legal mechanism to remain in the U.S. once their TPS expires in roughly 60 days will be eligible to be arrested and deported by federal immigration officials. The Trump administration on Friday advised Syrians enrolled in the TPS program to self-deport from the U.S. using its CBP Home smartphone app.",
      "Syria's TPS designation dates back to the Obama administration, which in 2012 announced the program in response to the civil war that broke out there the year prior. The designation was extended multiple times, including by the first Trump administration. Government data indicates nearly 4,000 Syrians in the U.S. had TPS protections as of the end of March.",
      "Since its creation by Congress in 1990, TPS has been used by Democratic and Republican administrations to offer a temporary safe haven to foreigners from nations dealing with an armed conflict, environmental disaster or other crises. It allows recipients to work and live in the U.S. legally, but does not directly give them a path to permanent legal status.",
      "The Biden administration expanded TPS eligibility to a record number of migrants from crisis-stricken countries, including many who crossed the U.S. southern border illegally.",
      "The second Trump administration has sought to dismantle most TPS programs, moving to terminate the legal status of hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua and Venezuela. Pro-immigrant advocates have called the effort the largest de-documentation campaign in U.S. history, challenging the terminations in federal courts across the country.",
      "Trump administration officials have argued that TPS designations have been extended for far too long by Democratic administrations, despite the temporary nature of the policy. It has also argued conditions in many of the affected countries have improved or that the programs are magnets for illegal immigration.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-designating-antifa-terrorist-organization/",
    "published": "Fri, 19 Sep 2025 10:18:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Legal experts say Trump lacks authority to designate domestic terrorist organizations, but the planned move could still affect some law enforcement approaches.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced on social media Wednesday that he's designating antifa as a \"major terrorist organization.\" But what that action would mean for the movement remains unclear, given that antifa has no official leadership or organization structure, and the president lacks authority to designate domestic terrorist organizations, experts say.",
      "The president's announcement comes as he and his supporters continue to denounce \"radical left wing political violence\" following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk last week. After Kirk's killing, Mr. Trump blamed rhetoric from the \"radical left,\" saying that it is \"directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.\"",
      "Officials described the attack on Kirk as \"targeted,\" and family members of the suspected shooter, Tyler Robinson, said he had \"become more political\" in recent years. Robinson wrote in text messages to his roommate that he had carried out the attack because he \"had enough of [Kirk's] hatred,\" according to court filings. There has not been evidence presented to the public linking Robinson to antifa.",
      "This is not the first time Mr. Trump has argued antifa poses a threat \u2014 in his first term, he claimed the movement was behind looting and rioting during protests against police brutality in 2020. A November 2021 report on anarchist and left-wing violence in the U.S. from George Washington University's Program on Extremism and the National Counterrorism, Innovation, Technology and Education Center noted that the first Trump administration largely labeled the threat from anarchist violent extremists as originating from antifa.",
      "What is antifa?",
      "Short for \"anti-fascist,\" antifa activism can be traced back to antiracists who opposed the activities of members of the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis, according to a June 2020 report from the Congressional Research Service. But the movement gained attention after the violent clashes between white nationalists and anti-racism protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017.",
      "The Congressional Research Service describes antifa as \"decentralized\" and lacking a \"unifying organizational structure or detailed ideology.\" Instead, it consists of \"independent, radical, like-minded groups and individuals\" that largely believe in the principles of anarchism, socialism and communism.",
      "\"There is no single organization called antifa. That's just not the way these activists have ever organized themselves,\" said Michael Kenney, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh who has studied antifa. \"There's tremendous variation inside that movement, even on issues like political violence.\"",
      "The FBI has warned about violence perpetrated by antifa adherents, and in 2017, then-FBI Director Chris Wray told Congress that the bureau was looking into \"a number of what we would call anarchist extremist investigations, where we have properly predicated subjects who are motivated to commit violent criminal activity on kind of an antifa ideology,\" according to CRS.",
      "Wray, who was appointed FBI director by Mr. Trump during his first term, also acknowledged in congressional testimony in 2019 that the FBI doesn't investigate ideology, but does investigate violence. Then, in 2020, he said antifa is a \"movement or an ideology,\" not an organization.",
      "A 2020 assessment from the Center for Strategic and International Studies found that far-right attacks and plots have outpaced those from other perpetrators, including far-left networks. A 2022 study from the University of Maryland's National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism also found that \"right-wing extremists\" are more violent than left-wing actors.",
      "But CSIS said its data has indicated a rise in violent activity by \"antifa extremists, anarchists and related far-left extremists,\" which it said is likely connected to the \"concurrent increase in violent far-right activity.\"",
      "What could Trump's suggested designation do?",
      "Mr. Trump announced in May 2020 that the U.S. would be designating antifa as a \"major terrorist organization following nationwide unrest in response to the death of George Floyd,\" but nothing followed from that.",
      "Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the president does not have the authority to designate domestic terrorist organizations, even if this were an \"organization.\"",
      "\"There is no legal mechanism that I'm aware of within U.S. code that would give the president or the federal government the power to declare a domestic 'group' as a major terrorist organization or a major terrorist group,\" he said.",
      "The administration could, however, shift antifa to a higher priority for federal law enforcement, Baumgartner said, which could lead to more frequent investigations or arrests.",
      "The FBI and Department of Homeland Security don't officially designate U.S. extremist groups as \"domestic terrorist organizations,\" in part because of First Amendment concerns, according to CRS.",
      "A 2023 report from the research entity also noted that the government does not provide a \"precise, comprehensive, and public explanation of any particular groups it might consider to be domestic terrorist organizations,\" and it warned that listing groups in that way may infringe on free speech rights or \"the act of belonging to an ideological group, which in and of itself is not a crime in the United States.\"",
      "\"At this point, it's not a crime in America to have 'leftist' political beliefs along the lines that some anti-fascists do,\" Kenney said.",
      "He added that designating groups as domestic terrorist organizations could also raise Fourth Amendment concerns regarding surveillance.",
      "\"Do we as Americans still enjoy the right to free speech, to nonviolent political expression of our views, however unpalatable the Trump administration might find those views? Yes,\" Kenney said.",
      "While the U.S. does not have a list of domestic terrorist organizations, it does have a Foreign Terrorist Organizations list. Among the groups on the list are Hamas, al Qaeda and ISIS, which are known to operate transnationally. These groups are not related to the antifa movement.",
      "Kenney said that if the president were to try to designate antifa as a foreign terrorist organization, it would unlock tools like economic sanctions to bring greater pressure on the movement. Mr. Trump hasn't said he has this in mind, though he said he'd recommend \"those funding ANTIFA be thoroughly investigated.\" A foreign terrorist designation, if it were possible, would make it a crime to provide material support to antifa. Making this designation would present other challenges, however.",
      "\"When the president refers to antifa, whether in remarks to reporters or speeches, he's usually referring to domestic non-state actors and domestic incidents, so how are they going to portray that as foreign? That's not clear to me,\" Kenney said.",
      "Can the Justice Department charge someone associated with antifa with domestic terrorism?",
      "No. The FBI defines domestic terrorism as \"violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups to further ideological goals stemming from domestic influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature.\" But it is not a chargeable offense under federal law.",
      "\"You can't prosecute an ideology,\" Baumgartner said.",
      "But there are numerous federal criminal statutes that could apply to domestic terrorism.",
      "In the case of Dylann Roof, a white supremacist who killed nine Black parishioners at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015, he was convicted of 33 counts of federal hate crimes, obstruction of religious exercise and firearms charges.",
      "Payton Gendron, who killed 10 Black people at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, in 2022, is facing federal hate crime and weapons charges. Gendron also pleaded guilty to a state terrorism charge.",
      "Thirty-two states and the District of Columbia criminalize the act of domestic terrorism, according to the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law. In 21 states and D.C., it is a crime to provide support to further an act of terrorism or a terror.",
      "Harsher punishments a possibility",
      "But Baumgartner said that where alleged domestic terrorism does come into play at the federal level is in increased penalties for perpetrators. Prosecutors have sought harsher punishments for felony offenses that \"involved, or was intended to promote, a federal crime of terrorism.\"",
      "The Justice Department asked federal judges in 2023 to apply a terrorism adjustment in cases involving members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, far-right organizations whose members were convicted on charges stemming from the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, including seditious conspiracy.",
      "When ex-Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio was sentenced for multiple crimes related to the riot, prosecutors succeeded in applying the terrorism enhancement to his sentencing, although the judge did not allow it to heavily affect the length of the 22-year sentence. Mr. Trump issued Tarrio a full pardon upon taking office in January. He also commuted the sentences of members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers.",

    "story": [
      "In the week since conservative activist Charlie Kirk was assassinated at a Utah university event, comments from some of his critics have ignited a battle over free speech in an increasingly polarized nation.",
      "Kirk, who routinely debated progressive students at his Turning Point USA events and espoused controversial opinions on his podcast, was a stalwart proponent of the First Amendment.",
      "\"Hate speech does not exist legally in America,\" he wrote on X last year. \"There's ugly speech. There's gross speech. There's evil speech. And ALL of it is protected by the First Amendment.\"",
      "But over the last several days, the administration he supported and the president he helped reelect have vowed to crack down on some speech about his death.",
      "Last week, Pentagon officials promised to \"address\" federal employees who mock or celebrate Kirk's death. On Monday, the State Department said it will revoke visas\u00a0over social posts that \"celebrate\" Kirk's death.",
      "That same day, Vice President JD Vance hosted Kirk's podcast and encouraged listeners to call the employers of anyone \"celebrating Charlie's murder.\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi on Monday said people who post \"hate speech\" should be \"shut down\" and suggested that the Trump administration would pursue people who engage in hate speech.",
      "\"There's free speech, and then there's hate speech,\" Bondi said in an\u00a0interview. \"We will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech.\" The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld free speech rights, even if it is hate speech. She later said on X that \"hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected.\" The Justice Department referred CBS News to Bondi's comments when asked whether the administration considers celebrations of Kirk's assassination as threats of violence.",
      "\"Democrat critics are lying about the Administration's actions \u2014 this effort will target those committing criminal acts and hold them accountable,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Asked about Bondi's remarks, President Trump told ABC News' Jonathan Karl on Tuesday: \"We'll probably go after people like you because you treat me so unfairly; it's hate.\"",
      "Kimmel \"indefinitely\" taken off air",
      "Late Wednesday, ABC announced it would \"indefinitely\" pre-empt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" after Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr said the network should \"take action\" for the comedian's suggestion that Kirk's alleged killer is a Trump supporter. ABC's move came after station owners Nexstar and Sinclair said they were pulling the show indefinitely. Carr thanked Nexstar and Sinclair for taking action.",
      "Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the FCC to approve it. Nexstar told CBS News in a statement it made the decision to pre-empt Kimmel \"unilaterally\" and did not consult with the FCC beforehand.",
      "On Truth Social, Mr. Trump referred to it as a cancellation and congratulated ABC for \"finally having the courage to do what had to be done,\" and added: \"That leaves Jimmy [Fallon] and Seth [Meyers], two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!!\"",
      "Anna Gomez, one of two FCC commissioners working with Carr and the lone Democrat on the commission, called Kimmel's penalty a dangerous new precedent.",
      "\"This administration is increasingly using the weight of government power to suppress lawful expression, not because it glorifies violence or breaks the law, but because it challenges those in power and reflects views they oppose,\" she said on CNN Wednesday.",
      "In a statement on Thursday, she added: \"This FCC does not have the authority, the ability, or the constitutional right to police content or punish broadcasters for speech the government dislikes. \u2026 Free speech is the foundation of our democracy, and we must push back against any attempt to erode it.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, also criticized the move.",
      "\"When the head of the FCC is talking openly about taking away the broadcast license, then that is the government trying to exercise censorship. It's not a question of whether you agree with Mr. Kimmel or disagree with Mr. Kimmel. The point is one of the government not coming in and making decisions about whose speech gets heard,\" she said, adding, \"Everyone should care, no matter what your political view is.\"",
      "After a week of controversy, Disney said Kimmel's show will return on Tuesday, Sept. 23. The company said some of the host's comments were \"ill-timed and thus insensitive,\" but after several days of \"thoughtful conversations with Jimmy ... we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.\"",
      "The First Amendment and hateful speech",
      "In general, the First Amendment \u2014 which bars the government from \"abridging the freedom of speech\" \u2014 protects most forms of hateful speech, aside from a narrow set of exceptions that include threats of violence and incitement.",
      "Bondi's initial comments about hate speech stood out among those made by administration officials because of her position as the nation's top prosecutor, said Adam Goldstein, vice president of strategic initiatives at the nonprofit Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.",
      "\"I especially don't want to see an attorney in charge of the Justice Department saying that,\" he said. \"It's the kind of thing that would get you a bad grade in your constitutional law class.\"",
      "Jenin Younes, a First Amendment attorney who worked on a case accusing the Biden administration of social media censorship, told CBS News, \"These are all the same people who were railing against cancel culture and the idea of hate speech just a few years ago, when it was the left doing it.\"",
      "\"The worry is that lawmakers will just define hate speech to mean anything the opposite party says, and so that's why the court has said it's not up to the government to decide what's within the bounds of acceptable discourse and what's not,\" Genevieve Lakier, a University of Chicago law professor, told CBS News. \"There's no definition of hate speech, because the whole point is there's no neutral definition of hate speech.\"",
      "In most cases, Lakier said, \"simply saying 'he had it coming' \u2026 does not fit the very, very, very narrow definition of incitement that is available in the case law.\"",
      "Are offensive comments illegal?",
      "First Amendment legal scholar Eugene Volokh told CBS News that, in most circumstances, the government cannot go after ordinary people for making insensitive or offensive public comments about Kirk's killing.",
      "\"It may be in bad taste. It may be bad for the country when people are trying to normalize political violence. But it is protected by the First Amendment,\" said Volokh, a professor emeritus of law at the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "\"I would say it's basically prohibited for the government to say you can't mock or make fun of or even celebrate his death,\" said Younes, who currently serves as national legal director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.",
      "Volokh says comments like Bondi's \"are likely to further confuse people, whether citizens or law enforcement or others, about what's protected and what's not protected.\"",
      "\"I think they may also kind of send a message that we are going to try to find a way of punishing this speech,\" Volokh added.",
      "Bondi also said Monday the Justice Department could prosecute businesses that refuse to print photos of Kirk for customers, citing a worker at an Office Depot who declined to print flyers for a Kirk vigil. Office Depot called the incident \"completely unacceptable\" and said the staff member no longer works for the company.",
      "\"There is no federal law that prohibits copy shops or print shops from discriminating based on the content of the message,\" Volokh said.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said Bondi was solely referencing the Office Depot incident, which the department's civil rights division looked into.",
      "Less clear, according to legal experts, is whether the federal government can deport non-citizens or revoke their visas over their views on Kirk, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio has floated. Volokh says the laws around this are \"unsettled.\"",
      "\"While it is true that the executive's power when it comes to immigration is very vast, I think the First Amendment constrains it,\" Younes said. She pointed to the Trump administration's attempts to remove students for participating in pro-Palestinian protests, which have been met with pushback at the district court level.",
      "What can private companies do?",
      "The First Amendment doesn't stop private employers from choosing to fire people for speech, though some states like California have their own legal protections.",
      "However, in some cases, it can be illegal for the government to use its power to pressure a private company into firing a staff member \u2014 a concept known as \"jawboning.\"",
      "Government officials can try to persuade private companies to take a certain action, according to Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, but they cannot coerce companies by making threats.",
      "Volokh said it likely doesn't qualify as jawboning if elected officials merely express the view that people should be fired, as long as they don't cross the line into threatening to take action. For example, on Vance's call for people to contact the employers of anybody who celebrates Kirk's death, Volokh said, \"it's hard to see that as unconstitutional.\"",
      "\"You would have to show the private employer didn't want to fire you, but they were just acting because they were afraid of some kind of repercussions from the government,\" noted Younes.",
      "There's a fine line between broadly encouraging companies to fire employees who praised Kirk's assassination, and giving instructions to specific firms, according to Goldstein. He pointed to a contrast between Vance's comments advising podcasts listeners to call people's employers, and a tweet by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.",
      "Duffy praised American Airlines, United and Delta for suspending employees, and wrote, \"The next step should be to fire them.\"",
      "\"A rational airline who sees this message might feel some coercive effect on their decision making,\" said Goldstein, noting Duffy's power over the airline industry.",
      "Lakier said it's not a violation of the First Amendment if a company fires an employee of their own volition. But, she said, \"the problem is, in many of these cases, it's going to be because of political sympathy.\"",
      "\"The employers who are firing them, maybe implicitly fear that if they don't, they're going to face the government's wrath or they want to curry favor by firing,\" she said.",
      "In general, however, \"If we're talking about private companies and you are an at-will employee, then that means exactly as it sounds like, which is that an employer can fire you at will,\" said CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School.",

      "In many cases, Trump allies have spotlighted public employees who criticize Kirk.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called celebrations of Kirk's death by service members or civilian workers \"unacceptable\" last week, and said the Pentagon is \"tracking\" them. Since then, at least one Marine officer has been relieved of his recruiting duties pending an investigation into his post about Kirk, and two Army officers have been suspended pending a review into their posts, according to a Marine official and an Army official.",

      "Prior court rulings have established several factors for assessing the speech rights of government employees, according to Calvert and Volokh.

      "But the military is a slightly separate case, according to Volokh, because \"there are more restrictions that are permissible on service members' speech.\"",
      "Volokh said the military is different \"in part because of a sense that \u2026 this is an environment where discipline is really important, where self-discipline is really important, where unit cohesion is really important, where commitment to the right ideas is very important.\"",

Two of the Vibrio vulnificus deaths in Louisiana this year were in people who ate contaminated raw oysters, the state health department said in August.",
      "Louisiana and other states have been seeing an increase in Vibrio vulnificus diagnoses. Experts suggest the trend may be because of\u00a0warming oceans. The bacteria is usually found in the Gulf Coast, but has begun to become more common further north, said Dr. Fred Lopez, an infectious disease specialist at LSU Health.",

      "Scientists have discovered prehistoric insects preserved in amber for the first time in South America, providing a fresh glimpse into life on Earth at a time when flowering plants were just beginning to diversify and spread around the world.",
      "Many of the specimens found at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador date to 112 million years ago, said Fabiany Herrera, curator of fossil plants at the Field Museum in Chicago and co-author of the study published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth and Environment. At least six types of arthropods were found preserved, according to the study.",
      "Almost all known amber deposits from the past 130 million years have been in the Northern Hemisphere, and it's long been \"an enigma\" that scientists have found few in southern regions that once comprised the supercontinent Gondwana, said David Grimaldi, an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History who was not involved in the discovery.",
      "This marks the first time researchers have identified ancient beetles, flies, ants and wasps in fossilized tree resin in South America, said Ricardo P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente, a paleoentomologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, who also was not involved in the new study.",
      "\"Amber pieces are little windows into the past,\" P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente said, adding that the discovery will help researchers understand the evolving interactions between flowering plants and insects that lived during the era of the dinosaurs.",
      "The researchers uncovered hundreds of fragments of amber, some containing ancient insects, pollen and tree leaves, at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador that's on the edge of what is today the Amazon basin.",
      "Two types of amber were discovered, according to the study: There was a more common form of amber found around the roots of resin-producing plants, and a rarer form of the material formed from resin exposed to air. The amber formed around the roots did not hold any specimens, the study said.",
      "\"A different kind of forest\"",
      "The discoveries provide evidence that the area was once a \"humid, resinous forest ecosystem,\" according to the study.",
      "But today's rainforest is much different from what dinosaurs roamed through, Herrera said. Based on an analysis of fossils in the amber, the ancient rainforest contained species of ferns and conifers, including the unusual Monkey Puzzle Tree, that no longer grow in Amazonia.",
      "\"It was a different kind of forest,\" said Herrera.",
      "The amber deposits were previously known to geologists and miners who worked at the Genoveva quarry. Study co-author Carlos Jaramillo at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute first heard of them about a decade ago and set out to find the exact location, aided by geology field notes.",
      "\"I went there and realized this place is amazing,\" Jaramillo said. \"There's so much amber in the mines,\" and it's more visible in the open quarry than it would be if hidden under dense layers of vegetation.",
      "Researchers will continue to analyze the amber trove to learn more about Cretaceous-era biodiversity \u2014 including the insects that contributed to evolution by feeding on flowering plants. \"Amber tends to preserve things that are tiny,\" said Grimaldi.",

    "summary": "A new study on chimpanzees in Uganda and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire supports a theory that humans may have inherited a taste for alcohol from primate ancestors.",
    "story": [
      "In the forests of Uganda and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, chimps crowd into fig and plum trees, feasting on fruit that's sweet, soft and just a little boozy. A new study shows those daily snacks quietly add up to the equivalent of nearly two alcoholic beverages for humans.",
      "A team of scientists at University of California Berkeley and other institutions tested the fruit chimps actually snack on: figs in Uganda's canopy and the plum-like fruits on the forest floor in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Collecting the data wasn't easy \u2014 with little electricity beyond solar panels and constant humidity threatening the instruments, researchers spent three seasons hauling equipment and calibrating test kits to measure alcohol in many different tropical fruits.",
      "In the end, they found that on average, the fruit's alcohol content came in at about .3% by weight. This is kombucha-level, but when chimpanzees eat 10 pounds of fruit a day and weigh around 90 pounds, it adds up to about 14 grams of ethanol, equating to about two cocktails for a human.",
      "But don't picture chimps swinging drunkenly from the trees. To actually get drunk, they'd have to binge on fruit until their bellies ballooned, the researchers said. Instead, they're exposed to a steady low dose, a quiet buzz from nature's own fermentation process.",
      "Senior author of the paper and UC Berkeley professor of integrative biology Robert Dudley first floated the \"drunken monkey\" hypothesis in 2000, arguing that our attraction to alcohol could come from ancestral fruit-eating habits. Dudley argued that it makes sense primates would be tuned to alcohol, since their diets have long revolved around ripe fruit.",
      "\"Once you start eating, it acts as an aperitif,\" he said. \"The pleasure of association with drinking alcohol increases feeding rates.\"",
      "Other animals chase the same buzz too.",
      "\"Open a bottle of beer outside and a fruit fly appears almost instantly,\" Dudley said.",
      "Spider monkeys in Panama, slow lorises in Malaysia and even elephants have been documented consuming naturally fermented fruit or nectar.",
      "What makes this study different is that it provides the first direct chemical measurements of ethanol in the fruits that wild chimps routinely eat, and then connects those numbers to daily intake.",
      "The open question is whether chimps are actually selecting fruit for its alcohol content or just chasing sugar and calories. Either way, Dudley says the story connects to us.",
      "\"We inherited the taste for alcohol,\" Dudley said. \"Even though our diets have diversified \u2026 that bias to consume quickly when this molecule is present could still be a powerful force.\"",

The process can happen naturally in places like the sands of Chile's Atacama Desert or the bogs of Ireland where conditions can fend off decomposition. Humans across various cultures also mummified their ancestors through embalming to honor them or send their souls to the afterlife.",

      "Studying the bones further, scientists discovered the bodies were likely exposed to heat. That suggested the bodies had been smoke-dried over a fire and mummified by hunter-gatherer communities in the area.",
      "The practice \"allowed people to sustain physical and spiritual connections with their ancestors, bridging time and memory,\" study author Hirofumi Matsumura with Sapporo Medical University in Japan said in an email.",

      "The capture came after Northrop Grumman engineers adjusted the sensitivity of the main engine fault detection software that prematurely triggered shutdowns during two rendezvous thruster firings Tuesday.",
      "As it turned out, the main engine was healthy all along and once the software was adjusted, the spacecraft was able to press ahead with the rendezvous, pulling up to a point just below the station so robot arm operator Jonny Kim, assisted by Zena Cardman, could capture the ship.",

    "story": [
      "Northrop Grumman's Cygnus XL cargo ship, carrying more than 11,000 pounds of equipment and supplies for the International Space Station, is scheduled to rendezvous with the space station Thursday morning, NASA announced Wednesday.",
      "This comes after two premature engine shutdowns Tuesday forced flight controllers to interrupt a carefully planned rendezvous and delay the ship's arrival at the outpost.",
      "On Wednesday evening, NASA announced that the issue had been resolved and the cargo ship was expected to arrive at the space station at 7:18 a.m. Eastern Time Thursday.",
      "\"Data shared by the spacecraft confirmed that Cygnus XL operated as intended during two planned maneuvers when an early warning system initiated a shutdown command and ended the main engine burn because of a conservative safeguard in the software settings,\" NASA explained in a statement.",
      "NASA said that astronaut Jonny Kim, with support from NASA astronaut Zena Cardman, will capture Cygnus XL using the station's Canadarm2 robotic arm.",
      "The Cygnus was launched Sunday from Cape Canaveral atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The cargo ship was released from the booster's upper stage as planned, kicking off a precisely planned sequence of rendezvous rocket firings to catch up with the space station.",
      "Unlike SpaceX's cargo Dragon and Russian Progress freighters, which carry out autonomous dockings at their respective ports, the Cygnus was designed to be captured by the station's robot arm and pulled in for berthing.",
      "The Cygnus XL capture had been planned for Wednesday morning, but was put on hold while engineers work to understand the problem and develop an alternate rendezvous plan.",
      "\"Early Tuesday morning, Cygnus XL's main engine stopped earlier than planned during two burns designed to raise the orbit of the spacecraft for rendezvous with the space station,\" NASA had said in a previous blog post. \"All other Cygnus XL systems are performing normally.\"",
      "A Progress launched last week successfully docked at the station Saturday. The Cygnus XL launch is a long-awaited milestone for Northrop Grumman after an earlier Cygnus was damaged during transit from a subcontractor in Europe to Cape Canaveral. That vehicle is still grounded pending analysis and repairs.",
      "Sunday's launch was the third of at least four SpaceX flights purchased by Northrop Grumman while the company recovers from the transit setback and presses ahead with work to develop a new booster of its own.",
      "And it was the maiden flight of the Cygnus XL, so named because the upgraded cargo ship has been lengthened to carry more cargo to the station per flight.",
      "\"We've been partnering with Northrop Grumman on this update, and we're excited that Northrop is ready to deliver this incredibly beneficial increase in capacity,\" Dina Contella, deputy manager of the space station program for NASA, said before launch. \"It's about 1.6 meters (5 feet) longer and it carries about 2,600 additional pounds more cargo.\"",
      "For its first flight, the XL ship is loaded with more than five-and-a-half tons of needed spare parts, research material and crew supplies, including holiday treats for the station crew.",
      "\"The (Cygnus) is packed with consumables, like nitrogen, oxygen, food and toilet parts, and it has a large number of spare parts that are required for systems like, for example, our urine processor,\" said Contella. \"We're stocking up on these items since we were short over the past year, and we'd like to have a good reserve for the future.\"",

    "story": [
      "The sun has become more and more active over the last 16 years, in a turn that surprised scientists and could affect space weather and technology on Earth, NASA announced\u00a0this week.",
      "A new research, conducted by two NASA scientists and published earlier in September in the peer-reviewed\u00a0Astrophysical Journal Letters, shows that solar activity has ramped up after 2008 \u2014 an unexpected reversal following a decades-long decline that was initially thought to foreshadow a period of historic inaction on the surface of the sun.",
      "\"All signs were pointing to the Sun going into a prolonged phase of low activity,\" Jamie Jasinski, a space plasma physicist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the study's lead author, said in a statement. \"So it was a surprise to see that trend reversed. The Sun is slowly waking up.\"",
      "An uptick in solar activity could influence space weather, potentially leading to more solar storms,\u00a0solar flares\u00a0and coronal mass ejections, the researchers found. Space weather patterns have the potential to directly impact spacecraft operations and the safety of astronauts, but\u00a0they may be felt on Earth, too, as space weather can affect power grids, GPS systems and radio communication, according to NASA.",
      "The downward trend was documented from the 1980s until 2008, when the space agency determined that the sun had reached its weakest point on record. The sun's action, or inaction, tends to fluctuate in 11-year cycles, according to NASA, although some patterns draw on longer.",
      "Earth is currently in\u00a0Solar Cycle 25, which began in 2020. The last cycle maintained an average length of 11 years and was the weakest solar cycle to occur in a century, according to the National Weather Service. Scientists thought the sun would stay in what they dubbed \"deep solar minimum,\" believing that the stretch of quietness from the sun would continue, eventually leading to a new phase of record low activity.",
      "\"But then the trend of declining solar wind ended,\" Jasinski said in NASA's announcement.",
      "His study, co-authored by Marco Velli, a fellow researcher at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, instead tracked increasing bursts of solar plasma and stronger magnetic field measurements throughout the solar system, which are all affected by the sun.",
      "Solar Cycle 26 is expected to begin some time between January 2029 and December 2032, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said, but the agency has not yet produced a prediction for the next cycle.",
      "In order to better track space weather, NASA announced that it will launch the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) and\u00a0Carruthers Geocorona Observatory\u00a0missions, as well as the NOAA's\u00a0SWFO-L1\u00a0mission, from Falcon 9 as early as next week. It comes just a few months after\u00a0SpaceX helped NASA launch TRACERS twin satellites which are studying how the electrically-charged solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetic field.",
      "\"Space weather predictions are critical for supporting the spacecraft and astronauts of NASA's Artemis campaign, as understanding the space environment is a vital part of mitigating astronaut exposure to space radiation,\" NASA said Monday.",
      "In May 2024, NASA officials recorded the\u00a0strongest geomagnetic storm in more than 20 years. Several X-class solar flares \u2014 the largest of B-class, followed by C and M \u2014 sent the\u00a0northern lights\u00a0to far lower latitudes than normal,\u00a0as far south as Mexico.",
      "Geomagnetic storms have the ability to impact how and whether technology functions on a massive scale, electrical engineer David Wallace explained in\u00a0The Conversation\u00a0last year.",
      "\"Internet service providers could go down, which in turn would take out the ability of different systems to communicate with each other. High-frequency communication systems such as ground-to-air, shortwave and ship-to-shore radio would be disrupted,\" Wallace wrote.",

    "story": [
      "A deal in the works between the U.S. and China over the ownership of TikTok could include a licensing agreement for the closely guarded secret of the social media company's algorithm, to which access has proved a major sticking point in negotiations between the countries.",
      "The Chinese government once vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, the technology that seems to intuit user preferences almost instantaneously and that has been a driving force for the video-sharing app's explosive growth in recent years.",
      "Previously, TikTok had also seemed unwilling to budge. In May, when the platform was challenging a 2024 law banning TikTok in the U.S., the company said in a legal filing that \"divesting TikTok Inc.'s U.S. business and completely severing it from the globally integrated platform of which it is a part is not commercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\"",
      "President Trump this week\u00a0again pushed back enforcement of the TikTok law, which would require its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market. In the meantime, an agreement between the U.S. and China appears to be moving forward. Mr. Trump on Friday said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping have\u00a0\"made progress\" in talks over a potential deal to resolve the dispute over TikTok's ownership.",
      "Although key elements of the framework deal remain unclear, when some details were released earlier this week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, told reporters in Madrid that the arrangement included agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, thinks ByteDance executives may be urging the Chinese government to strike a deal so the company can continue earning revenue from the algorithm, while maintaining a foothold in the U.S.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "How would a TikTok licensing deal work?",
      "Mr. Trump, asked Thursday about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. So exactly how a licensing deal would work remains unclear, including whether ByteDance could maintain any sort of outside control over TikTok's algorithm once ownership transfers to U.S. owners.",
      "\"What I understand is they would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use it under certain terms,\" said Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization. \"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it.\"",
      "Kreps added that in retaining a measure of ownership over the algorithm, ByteDance could have the right to access internal TikTok metrics and influence how content is ranked in the U.S., akin to how a software vendor can patch or upgrade licensed software.",
      "The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter,\u00a0said\u00a0this week that TikTok would create a new U.S. app and that the company's engineers would re-create content-recommendation algorithms using technology licensed from ByteDance.",
      "A White House spokesperson declined to comment on the contours of the U.S.-China framework deal over TikTok. \"Any details of the TikTok framework are pure speculation unless they are announced by this administration,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said on Monday that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, Akoto, the American University assistant professor, said the new arrangement would have to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "When Jingtao, the deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, spoke to the press earlier this week, he indicated the U.S. and China have agreed on entrusting a partner with handling U.S. user data and content security, although its unclear how exactly that would work.",

      "In morning trading, Intel shares jumped 25%, its biggest one-day percentage gain in decades. Nvidia shares added 2%.",
      "For data centers, Intel will make custom chips that Nvidia will use in its AI infrastructure platforms. While for PC products, Intel will build chips that integrate Nvidia technology.",
      "The agreement provides a lifeline for Intel, which was a Silicon Valley pioneer that enjoyed decades of growth as its processors powered the personal computer boom, but fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone's 2007 debut.",
      "Intel fell even farther behind in recent years amid the artificial intelligence boom that's propelled Nvidia into the world's most valuable company. Intel lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, and expects to slash its workforce by a quarter by the end of 2025.",
      "The U.S. government stepped in last month to secure a 10% stake, making it one of Intel's biggest shareholders. Federal officials said they invested in Intel in order to bolster U.S. technology and domestic manufacturing.",
      "The deal is \"bullish for U.S. tech,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said in a client note.",
      "\"This is a game-changer deal for Intel as it now brings them front and center into the AI game,\" Ives said. \"Along with the recent U.S. government investment for 10% (equity stake in Intel) this has been a golden few weeks for Intel after years of pain and frustration for investors.\"",
      "Nvidia, meanwhile, has soared because its specialized chips are underpinning the artificial intelligence boom. The chips, known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, are highly effective at developing powerful AI systems.",
      "The deal between the two chipmakers comes as China moves to be less dependent on U.S. semiconductor technology. This week, Chinese officials reportedly forbade several large domestic technology companies from purchasing Nvidia chips, and Huawei announced that it was expanding its development of AI chips and manufacturing.",
      "While Nvidia and Intel will work together to develop new chips, a manufacturing deal has yet to be struck between the two. The potential access to Intel's chip foundries by Nvidia poses a risk to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which currently manufactures the tech giant's flagship processors.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it will decide whether President Trump can fire members of the Federal Trade Commission without cause, taking up a dispute that tests the president's removal power and could weaken protections enacted by Congress that aim to insulate independent agencies from political pressure.",
      "The high court said in a brief order that it will also allow Mr. Trump to fire Rebecca Kelly Slaughter from her position at the FTC while it considers the case. It will hear arguments in its December session, and its stay will remain in place until it issues a decision. Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented from the majority's decision to allow Slaughter's removal.",
      "The justices will consider whether removal protections for members of the FTC violate the separation of powers and, if so, whether its 1935 decision that allowed Congress to impose removal protections for officials at independent agencies should be overturned. It will also weigh whether a federal court can prevent a person's removal from public office, as U.S. district courts have been doing in challenges stemming from Mr. Trump's firings of Democratic appointees.",
      "In her dissent, Kagan wrote that the Supreme Court has \"handed full control\" of certain independent agencies that Congress has sought to shield from political pressure to the president.",
      "\"He may now remove \u2014 so says the majority, though Congress said differently \u2014 any member he wishes, for any reason or no reason at all. And he may thereby extinguish the agencies' bipartisanship and independence,\" she said.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi cheered the Supreme Court's decision as a \"significant\" victory that she said protects the president's executive authority.",
      "\"This helps affirm our argument that the President, not a lower court judge, has hiring and firing power over executive officials,\" Bondi wrote on social media. \"We will continue fighting and winning in court to defend President Trump's agenda.\"",
      "The dispute arose out of Mr. Trump's move to oust Slaughter from her position on the FTC. A lower court found that the president's attempt to fire Slaughter violated a 1914 law that limits the grounds for removing an FTC commissioner to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, and ordered her to be reinstated. Earlier this month, Chief Justice John Roberts had\u00a0temporarily paused that lower court order blocking Slaughter's firing while the Supreme Court considered whether to grant the Trump administration emergency relief.",
      "In its emergency appeal to the high court, the Trump administration urged the justices to swiftly evaluate the constitutionality of the removal restrictions for the FTC before the appeals court has weighed in. Lawyers for Slaughter agreed that the question of whether the protections violate the separation of powers is ripe for the Supreme Court's consideration.",
      "The case is the latest in a string of emergency appeals that arrived before the Supreme Court in response to Mr. Trump's efforts to fire Democratic-appointed members of independent agencies at will. The conservative justices have endorsed the president's removal authority so far, clearing the way for Mr. Trump to fire without cause members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission despite federal laws protecting them from being removed at will.",
      "Those decisions have called into question the future of the 90-year-old precedent that upheld removal protections enacted by Congress for members of the FTC, the same body on which Slaughter served. In its 1935 decision in the case Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the Supreme Court said Congress could shield certain officials from being removed by the president without cause.",
      "Lower courts have relied on Humphrey's Executor as grounds for reinstating officials whom Mr. Trump has attempted to fire. But the steady stream of those decisions prompted calls for the Supreme Court to definitively decide whether the president has the authority to fire the leaders of independent agencies that Congress has insulated from political shifts.",
      "In a concurring opinion in a case involving the removal of three members of the Consumer Product Safety Committee, Justice Brett Kavanaugh warned that \"the downsides of delay in definitively resolving the status of the precedent sometimes tend to outweigh the benefits of further lower-court consideration.\"",
      "Mr. Trump appointed Slaughter to the FTC in 2018, and former President Joe Biden reappointed her to a second term expiring in 2029.",
      "But in March, Mr. Trump moved to oust Slaughter from her position at the FTC. Slaughter, however, sued, arguing that her firing was illegal because federal law limits a commissioner's removal to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "Lower courts ruled in Slaughter's favor and ordered her to be reinstated to her position. The Trump administration then sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court.",
      "In court filings, lawyers for the Trump administration argued that the modern FTC exercises \"vast executive authority,\" a change from the 1935-era commission. The Supreme Court in Humphrey's Executor said Congress could insulate members of independent agencies from being removed without cause if that entity met certain criteria, including performing only quasi-legislative and quasi-judicial functions.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the FTC wields \"substantial executive authority,\" like the other agencies whose members the president has been allowed to remove.",

      "\"The protracted and unanimous acquiescence of all three branches of government in the law at issue here \u2014 a law that affirmatively empowers the President to remove commissioners for good cause \u2014 defeats Applicants' assertion that their continued adherence to that still-binding precedent while their appeal is pending would cause them irreparable harm,\" they wrote in a Supreme Court filing.",
      "Slaughter's legal team warned that if she could be fired by the president without cause, the FTC would be \"severely wounded and radically transformed.\"",

    "story": [
      "The White House on Monday announced basic details of a plan it says will \"save\" TikTok for the social media app's 170 million U.S. users through a new ownership deal, although China has suggested a deal has yet to be finalized.",
      "The structure would move TikTok U.S. operations into a new \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, a senior White House official told reporters on the condition of anonymity. Software maker Oracle would serve as the security provider for U.S. operations, the senior White House official said, providing \"top to bottom\" security, including security of the algorithm. Oracle's chairman and chief technology officer is Larry Ellison, whose son, David Ellison, is the chairman & CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.",
      "The structure brings the algorithm \"under control of the U.S. joint venture,\" the official said.",
      "\"It's going to be continuously monitored as it operates to ensure that it's behaving appropriately, right, that it's not being used for any kind of malicious purpose, and that it's not being unduly influenced,\" the official said.",
      "The official anticipated the president will sign an executive order later this week declaring the terms of the deal meet America's national security interests, and extend the enforcement pause on the law banning TikTok for an additional 120 days.",
      "Congress has effectively banned TikTok in the U.S. based on national security concerns, telling TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance to divest or face a ban in the U.S., but Mr. Trump has paused its enforcement three times. Congress may still need to sign off on any finalized TikTok deal.",
      "A possible sticking point in the plan to transfer TikTok's ownership to U.S. parties is the question of who would control TikTok's algorithm, the complex and powerful software code that has driven the app's rapid growth around the world. Some policy experts think allowing ByteDance personnel to retain access to all or part of the algorithm could expose U.S. users of the platform to risk.",
      "It's not clear if any Chinese officials would be allowed on the board of directors, and investors are still being sought. The official said there has been \"an overwhelming interest in this project\" from \"household\" names that Americans would recognize. Over the weekend, the president indicated media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan would likely be involved somehow.",
      "But Beijing has yet to publicly acknowledge a deal has been reached or a framework has been agreed upon. Last week, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Beijing would \"support their teams in reaching a proper deal on TikTok through consultation.\" And on Friday, the president said he had \"made progress\" on a TikTok deal during a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The senior White House official said they don't have plans for additional talks with the Chinese delegation on behalf of the U.S. government.",
      "\"We feel confident that China has approved the deal,\" the senior White House official said.",
      "The president told reporters last week he may be a little bit \"prejudiced\" in favor of TikTok because he said it helped him win over young voters in 2024.",
      "\"I'm a little prejudiced because I frankly did so well on it,\" he said. \"It got me numbers that nobody's ever even heard of before.\"",

    "story": [
      "Ahead of an expected announcement from the Trump administration that Tylenol use in pregnancy is linked to an increased risk of autism in children, the drugmaker and medical experts are pushing back on the claims.",
      "According to a report from the Washington Post, officials on Monday plan to tie autism to acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, while also promoting a lesser-known drug called leucovorin, which is used as a treatment for some symptoms in children with autism. The Wall Street Journal previously reported the announcement was in the works, which the Department of Health and Human Services called \"speculation\" at the time.",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump seemingly confirmed the plans, telling reporters \"we're going to do it tomorrow\" when asked about the reports.",
      "\"I think it's a very big factor. I think you'll see what it is tomorrow. We have various things, but you'll see what it is tomorrow,\" the president said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a briefing Monday that she didn't want to scoop Mr. Trump or HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. on the announcement later today, but said, \"They are paying attention to studies and the gold standard of science and research that many in this city for far too long have turned a blind eye to.\"",
      "Autism has become more prevalent in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But there is no scientific consensus on the reasons why. Most experts say it is likely due to a combination of factors, including changes in the way the condition is diagnosed.",
      "Tylenol maker responds to autism claims",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said \"independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism.\"",
      "\"We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise,\" the statement continues, highlighting what the company says is the greater health risk for expecting mothers from other conditions if they give up on taking the drug. \"Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy. Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives.\"",
      "\"The facts are that over a decade of rigorous research, endorsed by leading medical professionals and global health regulators, confirms there is no credible evidence linking acetaminophen to autism,\" the company said, adding that it \"will continue to explore all options to protect the health interests of American women and children.\"",
      "Medical experts on Tylenol and autism research",
      "In a statement to CBS News when reports of the administration's plans first surfaced, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said, \"There is no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and fetal developmental issues.\"",
      "In a major study published last year, researchers followed nearly 2.5 million children in Sweden over 25 years and found acetaminophen use during pregnancy did not increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children.",
      "The study, which used sibling comparisons to account for genetic factors, found no increase in risk of autism, ADHD or other intellectual disabilities when women used the medication during pregnancy.",
      "\"The best evidence does not show an association between Tylenol and autism,\" said Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. \"The medical community, the scientific community has the same consensus, which is that Tylenol, acetaminophen, is safe in pregnancy.\"",
      "Gounder said acetaminophen is considered the safest option for treating issues like pain and high fever during pregnancy.",
      "\"If you have a high fever during pregnancy, that can cause neurodevelopment issues in the baby, so you don't want to let that fever go untreated,\" Gounder explained, adding she's worried that expectant mothers may turn to other options that would be less safe.",
      "\"Will women end up taking other medications like aspirin or ibuprofen during pregnancy? Those actually can be dangerous, especially in the third trimester, you can end up with kidney issues, cardiac issues in the baby,\" she said.",
      "While some previous research suggested there could be a possible association between acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders, those studies involved relatively small groups and did not prove a link. Larger and more robust studies have found no connection.",
      "\"Any association between acetaminophen and autism is based on limited, conflicting, and inconsistent science and is premature given the current science,\" the Autism Science Foundation said in a statement.",
      "The Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents some of the largest makers of over-the-counter medications, including acetaminophen, said, \"Safety is the top priority for manufacturers,\" and \"the well-established profile of acetaminophen is supported by decades of research and real-world use.\"",
      "\"Scientific and medical authorities around the world recognize acetaminophen as the only analgesic considered safe for use during pregnancy when used according to the Drug Facts label, which specifically reminds pregnant women to always consult their healthcare provider before use,\" the group said.",
      "In response to a question from CBS News' Ed O'Keefe about whether the announcement could create confusion for pregnant women, Leavitt said women are confused about the chronic disease epidemic and \"that's exactly what this administration is focused on finding (answers for).\"",
      "\"As a mother myself, I believe for many mothers across the country who really want answers to what is happening to our nation's children,\" she added.",
      "What is leucovorin?",
      "Leucovorin, an inexpensive, generic drug derived from folic acid (also known as folate or vitamin B9), is expected to be touted as an autism treatment in the administration's announcement, the reports said. Leucovorin is currently prescribed to ease the side effects of cancer chemotherapy.",
      "Pregnant women are prescribed multivitamins with folic acid to prevent neural tube defects. The neural tube develops into the brain and spinal cord.",
      "Specialists say leucovorin can be helpful in treating some autism cases, but it is not a universal remedy.",
      "\"You can have a perfectly normal folate level in your blood, but it may not be getting into the brain, and so there's a defect in the transport of folate into the brain. Leucovorin works around that,\" Gounder explained. \"Not all children with autism have this defect, so there's a test you can do to assess whether that's what's at play. For those kids, leucovorin has been shown to help, particularly with speech, getting kids to be more verbal than they were before.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 22 Sep 2025 12:44:46 -0400",
    "summary": "The two sides will spend the next two weeks presenting evidence in a \"remedy\" trial that threatens to dismantle the search giant's empire.",
    "story": [
      "After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department's attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire in a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising.",
      "The trial scheduled to begin Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court will revolve around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google's digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue.",
      "Google and the Justice Department will spend the next two weeks in court presenting evidence in a \"remedy\" trial that will culminate in Brinkema issuing a ruling on how to restore fair market conditions.",
      "Although the judge hasn't set a timetable for making that decision, it's unlikely to come down before the end of this year because additional legal briefs and courtroom arguments are expected to extend into November before Brinkema takes the matter under submission.",
      "No matter how the judge rules, Google says it will appeal the earlier decision labeling the ad network as a monopoly. Appeals can't be filed until the remedy is determined.",
      "The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden's administration, threatens the complex network that Google has spent the past 17 years building to power its dominant digital advertising business. Besides accounting for most of the $305 billion in revenue that Google's services division generates for its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., digital advertising sales provide the lifeblood that keeps thousands of websites alive.",
      "If the Justice Department gets its way, Brinkema will order Google to sell parts of its ad technology \u2014 a proposal that the company's lawyers warned would \"invite disruption and damage\" to consumers and the internet's ecosystem. The Justice Department contends a breakup would be the most effective and quickest way to undercut a monopoly that has been stifling competition and innovation for years.",
      "Google believes it has already made enough changes to its \"Ad Manager\" system, including providing more options and pricing options, to resolve the issues the Brinkema flagged in her monopoly ruling.",
      "The legal battle over Google's advertising technology mirrors another showdown that the company recently navigated after another federal judge condemned its dominant search engine as an illegal monopoly and then held remedy hearings earlier this year to consider how to stop the misconduct.",
      "In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month.",
      "Even though Google didn't agree with all aspects of Mehta's decision, the ruling was widely seen as a slap on the wrist \u2014 a sentiment that has helped propel Alphabet's stock price to new highs. The 20% gain since Mehta's decision helped make Alphabet only the fourth publicly traded company to reach a market value of $3 trillion \u2014 an increase of more than $1 trillion since Brinkema branded Google's ad technology as a monopoly in April.",
      "In an indication that the outcome of the search monopoly case might sway things in the advertising technology proceedings, Brinkema asked both Google and the Justice Department to address Mehta's decision during the upcoming trial.",
      "As they did in the search case, Google's lawyers already have been asserting in court papers that AI technology being used by ad network rivals like Meta Platforms is reshaping the way the market works and overriding the need for the Justice Department's \"radical\" proposals.",
      "The Justice Department is \"fighting for a remedy that would vanquish a past that has been overtaken by technological and market transformations in the way digital ads are consumed,\" Google's lawyers argued leading up to the trial.",

      "Emeline Lakrout, a busy New Yorker with a knack for running, rock climbing and swimming, doesn't let being legally blind stop her from living an active lifestyle.",
      "Despite being declared blind at 8 years old, Lakrout has taken on challenges, such as running the New York City Marathon and joining the U.S. National Paraclimbing Team. A new piece of technology \u2014 Meta's AI glasses \u2014 is her latest tool to help her stay savvy and adaptable on a daily basis.",
      "\"The glasses make my life easier,\" said the 27 year old. \"They make things faster and they make me able to do more in the day because it's just quicker and easier to do things and I feel less tired at the end of the day.\"",
      "Meta originally designed the glasses for users to stream video on the go and interact with the world around them using AI. The newest iteration of the technology was unveiled last week and includes the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses\u00a0and a new model of smart Oakley glasses aimed at sports enthusiasts.",

Such activities may include going through mail, or helping individuals grocery shop.",
      "The new AI glasses also use optical character recognition, or OCR, which can recognize and read aloud text for users on menus, receipts and mail. For Lakrout, having access to text-based information like signs in a subway station or on street corners is what makes AI technology useful.

      "Lakrout and Riccobono both agree that AI technology and Meta's glasses are a useful step in enhancing the blind and visually impaired community's independence.

    "summary": "As President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. raise concerns about autism and the use of Tylenol by pregnant women, here's what medical research shows.",
    "story": [
      "Recent reports in the\u00a0Washington Post\u00a0and\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0say President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are expected to announce that the use of Tylenol by pregnant women may be linked to autism in children. But many top medical experts in the field say the evidence does not support that.",
      "This comes after Kennedy said in April that HHS would undertake a \"massive testing and research effort\" to determine the cause of autism. Kennedy at the time said the plan was to release a comprehensive report in September. However, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said later that month the findings could take up to a year.",
      "Kennedy has in the past made the unfounded claim that autism is a \"preventable disease,\" drawing heavy criticism from many medical experts, who say evidence shows there are multiple factors, including genetics, that play a role.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News on Sept. 5, an HHS spokesperson said, \"We are using gold-standard science to get to the bottom of America's unprecedented rise in autism rates. Until we release the final report, any claims about its contents are nothing more than speculation.\"",
      "What does Tylenol maker Kenvue say about autism?",
      "In response to the WSJ story on Sept. 5, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol \u2014 whose active ingredient is acetaminophen \u2014 said: \"We have continuously evaluated the science and continue to believe there is no causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and leading medical organizations agree on the safety of acetaminophen, its use during pregnancy, and the information provided on the label.\"",
      "Kenvue added, \"We appreciate the Secretary acknowledging media coverage on the upcoming HHS report is 'nothing more than speculation.'\"",
      "In another statement on Sept. 21, the company said:",
      "\"We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned with the health risk this poses for expecting mothers.",
      "Acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy. Without it, women face dangerous choices: suffer through conditions like fever that are potentially harmful to both mom and baby or use riskier alternatives.",
      "The facts are that over a decade of rigorous research, endorsed by leading medical professionals and global health regulators, confirms there is no credible evidence linking acetaminophen to autism. We stand with the many public health and medical professionals who have reviewed this science and agree. We will continue to explore all options to protect the health interests of American women and children.\"",
      "What do medical experts say?",
      "The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said in a statement provided to CBS News that \"there is no clear evidence that proves a direct relationship between the prudent use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and fetal developmental issues.\"",
      "\"Neurodevelopmental disorders, in particular, are multifactorial and very difficult to associate with a singular cause,\" ACOG said. \"Pregnant patients should not be frightened away from the many benefits of acetaminophen, which is safe and one of the few options pregnant people have for pain relief.\"",
      "Dr. Christopher Zahn, ACOG's chief of clinical practice, said, \"Pregnant patients should not be frightened away from the many benefits of acetaminophen, which is safe and one of the few options pregnant people have for pain relief.\"",
      "\"If you have a high fever during pregnancy, that can cause neurodevelopment issues in the baby, so you don't want to let that fever go untreated,\" said Dr. C\u00e9line Goudner, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. She said pregnant women should talk with their OB-GYN, especially if they're needing it frequently, and use the lowest effective dose for the shortest time.",
      "While some research suggested there could be a possible association between acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders, those studies involved relatively small groups and did not prove a link. Larger and more robust studies have\u00a0found no connection\u00a0between acetaminophen and autism.",
      "\"I spoke this afternoon to a researcher who was part of a\u00a0major study\u00a0published just last year that followed 2.5 million children in Sweden over 25 years,\" CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook said after the WSJ report came out. \"He said use of acetaminophen ... was not associated with an increased risk of autism in children.\"",
      "LaPook said he is looking forward to reading the upcoming report pledged by Kennedy, \"especially the evidence behind any conclusions and recommendations.\"",
      "Autism has become more prevalent in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years, according to\u00a0statistics compiled\u00a0by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But there is no scientific consensus on the reasons why.",
      "Research shows the causes of autism \"are complex,\" Dr. Christine Ladd-Acosta, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the vice director for the Wendy Klag Center for Autism and Developmental Disabilities, told CBS News in an interview.",
      "\"There have been a few dozen studies looking at Tylenol and whether use during pregnancy is associated with risk of autism in those women's children, and the evidence has been really kind of conflicting,\" Ladd-Acosta said. \"Some studies have shown no association. Some have shown a positive association. Some have shown negative associations. And I think part of that is because it's really hard to tease apart ... whether it's the medication itself that is influencing autism risk in the child, or if it has to do with the condition ... the mother is using the medicine to treat that is the thing that is important in autism risk.\"",
      "Ladd-Acosta noted that the dosage, the length of time that pregnant women take Tylenol, and the \"specific condition\" they are taking it for are all factors that have been considered when attempting to determine if there is a potential association between the medication and autism.",
      "\"There have been some associations, but there has been no conclusive evidence I've seen to show that Tylenol itself causes autism definitively,\" Ladd-Acosta said.",

      "Moments after becoming alert, Epstein gave officers his first account of what happened, the records show. He told them he thought he had been attacked by his cellmate, an ex-cop who was awaiting trial on four murders.",
      "\"He sat up on the bed and began telling me that he [thinks] his bunkie \u2026 tried to kill him,\" a responding officer wrote in one memo. A senior officer wrote in a separate incident report that Epstein initially implicated his cellmate in the incident, claiming he had previously said things that made Epstein feel threatened.",
      "Epstein would later back off the claim, saying instead that he couldn't remember what happened. Nicholas Tartaglione, the cellmate, has repeatedly disputed the initial allegation and said he tried to revive Epstein. As with Epstein's eventual death, any camera footage of the incident was either mislaid, lost or never captured by the facility's faulty system.",
      "Tartaglione has not responded to emailed questions from CBS News. His lawyer said Epstein's initial claim that Tartaglione tried to kill him was flatly \"not true.\"",
      "\"He saved his life the first time,\" said Inga Parsons, the attorney. Tartaglione said in a recent interview with the podcast \"House Inhabit\" that Epstein also left a suicide note and had even offered Tartaglione money to kill him. Neither of those details, if true, are referenced in any of the Bureau of Prison records that were reviewed by CBS News.",
      "News outlets have reported previously on Epstein's allegation and investigators' conclusions \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 about the incident.",
      "Epstein expressed concern about his cellmate the day before the incident, according to a corrections memo and a source who agreed to speak with CBS News on the condition they not be identified.",
      "Epstein claimed to both the corrections officer and the source that he felt threatened by Tartaglione, a hulking retired cop-turned-drug-dealer, who was charged and later convicted for four murders.",
      "Epstein said to the officer that he hadn't previously been comfortable reporting the alleged threat because \"his bunkie told him that if he beat him up, because of [Epstein's child sex trafficking] charges, the officers would not report it.\"",
      "The wealthy former financier told jail officers that he believed Tartaglione was trying \"to extort money from him and stated that if he didn't pay him that he would beat him up,\" the officer wrote. \"He stated that this has been going on for a week.\"",
      "Epstein told a different officer that on the eve of the July incident, his cellmate had gotten ahold of a copy of the New York Daily News. Epstein \u2014 a former financial adviser, confidant to some of the world's most powerful people, and prolific sexual abuser of girls and young women \u2014 said Tartaglione pointed to a story about Epstein in the paper. Tartaglione said it placed his net worth at $77 million, according to Epstein. (That figure instead matches a valuation for Epstein's New York mansion cited in multiple articles in the paper that month.)",
      "Epstein said he crumpled up the article and threw it out and turned in for bed. He told an officer he remembered waking up at 1 a.m. to get a drink of water, and walking back to his bed. The next thing he recalled, he said, was roughly half an hour later when corrections officers rushed into his cell.",
      "Epstein initially said he thought he was attacked, but later equivocated. He asked to be put back in the same cell with Tartaglione, according to a 2023 report by the Department of Justice inspector general, but also insisted he would never have tried to kill himself.",
      "After the incident, Epstein was moved to a room where he was placed on suicide watch and closely monitored for the next 31 hours. In his first minutes there, he twice \"sat on the edge of the bed and began moving forward as if he was attempting to fall over head first,\" a corrections officer wrote. Told to stop, Epstein responded, \"'Okay, I won't do it again,' and gave the thumbs up.\"",
      "Another corrections officer assigned to watch over Epstein in the hours following the July 23 incident was Michael Thomas, according to a document obtained by CBS News. Thomas is the officer who discovered Epstein dead in his cell on Aug. 10, 2019, according to the Justice Department. He and another officer were later charged with falsifying documents related to the night of Epstein's death, but those charges were dropped.",
      "Because Epstein was on suicide watch after the July 23 incident, Thomas was required to record a log of observations about Epstein in 15-minute increments.",
      "Those notations were released by the Bureau of Prisons in 2023 along with just one entry he made in the log: a note made at 2:15 a.m., 45 minutes after the incident.",
      "Fifteen minutes later, at 2:30 a.m., Thomas wrote, \"[inmate] sitting on bed trying to remember what happened.\"",
      "Around that time, a corrections supervisor was interviewing Tartaglione about the incident.",
      "Tartaglione said he had given the bottom bunk to Epstein because \"he was old,\" and had moved his own mattress to the floor. Tartaglione told a corrections officer he was sleeping with his headphones on when he felt something hit his legs.",
      "\"Jeff, what [are you] doing?\" Tartaglione said he asked into the darkness. He said he turned on the light and found Epstein, sitting, slumped on the floor, \"leaning to the side with his eyes opened,\" but unresponsive, with fabric around his neck, according to another officer's memo.",
      "Tartaglione said he then yelled for jail staff.",
      "Documents reviewed by CBS News do not indicate what steps jail staff took to investigate Epstein's allegations related to Tartaglione. In response to questions from CBS News, the Bureau of Prisons said the agency does not provide information related to investigations.",
      "The jail's chief psychologist later speculated to investigators for the inspector general that there were three possible explanations for the incident: In one version of events, she wrote, either Epstein or Tartaglione were gaming the system to get something they wanted; another explanation was that Epstein had conducted a rehearsal of his eventual suicide; a third possibility was that, as Epstein initially claimed, he was assaulted. She told investigators that she considered the third scenario less plausible, \"although she did not know for certain.\"",
      "Epstein remained on suicide watch for a little more than a day; during that time, inmate volunteers kept logs, briefly documenting check-ins at 15-minute intervals. The morning updates were largely mundane: \"inmate Epstein is pacing around,\" \"inmate Epstein is hungry,\" \"inmate Epstein washed his neck.\" By the next evening, he became more chatty, according to the logs: \"I/M (inmate) Epstein is talking about finance,\" \"I/M Epstein is talking about science,\" \"I/M Epstein is talking about math,\" \"I/M Epstein is talking about the prison environment,\" \"I/M Epstein is talking about his experience teaching mathematics and physics,\" one volunteer wrote in successive updates.",
      "On the morning of July 24, Epstein's status was downgraded from suicide watch to psychological observation. That day, a regional administrator who oversaw more than a dozen jails and prisons asked for an explanation of the change. Inmates placed under psychological observation, as opposed to suicide watch, were considered \"not imminently suicidal,\" he was told. One of the forensic psychologists told investigators it was \"not healthy for inmates to stay on suicide watch for extended periods of time.\" She observed signs of positivity and that Epstein \"adamantly denied suicide.\"",
      "Even the downgraded status bothered Epstein, the records show. He insisted to jail staff that he wouldn't try to kill himself.",
      "\"He denied feeling hopeless. He is reporting positive future plans and reasons to live for,\" one\u00a0 staffer wrote in an Aug. 1 report. He described himself to one source that week as \"too much of a coward\" to kill himself, and wondered aloud to another source if the incident had been a prank gone wrong.",
      "The event was expunged from Epstein's official record after the jail's disciplinary proceedings failed to prove he committed self-mutilation.",
      "Following the incident, Epstein expressed concern to Bureau of Prison employees about being housed back in the same unit, saying he \"felt it was dangerous,\" according to the IG report.",
      "Epstein was assigned a new cellmate, Efrain Reyes, and moved back on July 30. Nine days later, Reyes was transferred.",
      "As night fell, Epstein found himself without a bunkie.",
      "Hours later, the early morning quiet of the secure housing unit was once again punctured as a corrections officer called for help. Epstein was once again on the floor of his cell. This time, his body was cold to the touch.",

    "summary": "Gary Cohn, IBM vice chair and director of the National Economic Council in the first Trump term, said for companies in a \"very difficult environment,\" cutting down on the cost of labor is \"the one lever they can pull.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Gary Cohn, IBM vice chair and former National Economic Council director in President Trump's first term, said Sunday that \"we've seen the job market degrade,\" though he noted that it may be \"temporary.\"",
      "\"The Federal Reserve itself and the board of governors admitted that we are having a declining job market. And we see that,\" Cohn said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Last week, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, in the first rate cut since December, amid slower economic growth and a stalling labor market. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has a dual mandate to ensure that both inflation and unemployment remain low, said \"what's different now is that you see a very different picture of the risks to the labor market.\" And though Powell noted that he didn't want to put \"too much emphasis on payroll job creation,\" he said \"it's just one of the things that suggests that the labor market is really cooling off.\"",
      "\"That tells you that it's time to take that into account,\" Powell said.",
      "Meanwhile the jobs numbers, which have shown an ongoing slowdown in the labor market, have been under scrutiny in recent weeks, as the administration has questioned the validity of the government data. Last month, President Trump fired former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after a disappointing July jobs report.",
      "Cohn pointed to job data on Sunday, saying, \"over the last three or four months, we have gone from creating well over 100,000 jobs a month to creating less than 50,000 jobs a month.\" And he noted that \"I do think that we have seen companies cut back on the amount of employees they have.\"",
      "The IBM vice chair outlined that when companies are put in a \"very difficult environment,\" with input costs going up due to tariffs and other reasons, and they're unable to raise prices on consumers, \"the one lever they can pull to make sure they keep their margins intact is they can cut down on the cost of labor.\"",
      "\"We came out of a tough situation in COVID where companies were actually afraid about being able to attract and retain people, so they were hoarding labor,\" Cohn said. \"So we went from a hoarding labor situation to a situation today where companies are being very aggressive about managing their expenses, and the one expense they can manage is the cost of labor.\"",
      "Cohn said companies are now \"letting their labor force decline naturally as people retire out of the labor system.\" He said in the data, \"I think it's clearly showing up, and the Federal Reserve recognized that in this week's action.\"",
      "Cohn said he didn't think this change is specific to tech, but \"across the board.\" He noted that he's \"heard it directly from corporate CEOs in every business line that they have gone out of their way to cut their human capital overhead.\"",
      "On the rate cut more broadly, Cohn said \"the Fed gave us a lot of important information this last week,\" pointing to the rate cut, along with Fed officials providing their outlook, with projections of where they think interest rates are going. And he also noted that \"what is also important is the committee was fairly unanimous,\" acknowledging concerns about the independence of the Fed that have come to a head in recent weeks.",
      "\"I think the Fed clearly showed themselves to be independent thinkers,\" he said. \"They took into account all of the economic data, and they came out with a projection that made sense based on what is going on in the economy today.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 20 Sep 2025 17:48:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is targeting a visa widely used by tech companies and other employers to hire foreign workers.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is adding $100,000 to the existing fee for H-1B visa applications, taking aim at a program that is used to attract highly skilled workers to the U.S.",
      "President Trump signed a proclamation late Friday adding the new visa application fee and barring H-1B workers from entering the U.S. unless they had made the $100,000 payment.",
      "\"We're going to be able to keep people in our country that are going to be very productive people, and in many cases these companies are going to pay a lot of money for that, and they're very happy about it,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson clarified to CBS News in an email Saturday that the fee \"does not apply to anyone who has a current visa,\" and \"only applies to future applicants in the February [2026] lottery who are currently outside the U.S. It does not apply to anyone who participated in the 2025 lottery.\"",
      "\"The Proclamation does not impact the ability of any current visa holder to travel to/from the U.S.,\" Jackson said.",
      "A White House official told CBS News Saturday that the $100,000 is a one-time fee that only applies to new visas and is not an annual payment. It does not apply to renewals or current visa holders, the official said.",
      "This comes after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had told reporters Friday that the fee was \"annual.\"",
      "\"President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down wages,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told CBS News in a statement Saturday. \"It also gives certainty to American businesses who actually want to bring high-skilled workers to our great country but have been trampled on by abuses of the system.\"",
      "The additional charge would impact employers including technology giants such as Amazon, IBM, Microsoft and Google, which have\u00a0relied on the program\u00a0to hire foreign workers.",
      "The plan was\u00a0reported\u00a0earlier by Bloomberg News.",
      "H-1B visas are already expensive, with the cost ranging from about $1,700 to $4,500, depending on whether the visa is expedited. The fees are typically considered a business expense for the employer.",
      "The new fee comes amid a debate over the H-1B visa, which some critics say enables companies to hire foreign applicants at lower salaries than American workers. Some employers also award H-1Bs for entry-level roles rather than for senior positions with greater skill requirements, detractors of the program say.",
      "Tech companies have been among the primary beneficiaries of the visa program. Amazon received the\u00a0most H1-B visas\u00a0of any business in 2024, Department of Labor data shows. This year, the online retailer remains the leading recipient of the visas, with more than 10,000 awarded, followed by Tata Consultancy, Microsoft, Apple and Google.",
      "\"This will ensure that the people they're bringing in are actually very highly skilled and that they're not replaceable by American workers. So it'll protect American workers, but ensure that companies have a pathway to hire truly extraordinary people and bring them to the United States,\" a White House aide said.",
      "Still, Stuart Anderson, executive director of the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan research group, said the plan could backfire if it incentivizes U.S. companies to shift jobs overseas, especially in specialized areas like research and development.",
      "\"The second impact will further decrease the number of international students who have an interest in coming to study in the U.S. If there's no opportunity work in the U.S., it's much less likely they'll enroll in U.S. programs,\" Anderson told CBS News.",
      "Last year, the most popular type of job for H-1B visas was software developer. To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company.",
      "President Trump plans to order the Labor Secretary to start a new rule-making process that would update wage levels for the program, Bloomberg reported. Currently, U.S. companies must offer the prevailing wage or the actual wage of similarly qualified workers, whichever is higher, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.",
      "The program is capped at 65,000 new visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be issued for employees with a master's degree or higher, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The cap and higher-degree exemption quota is already filled for fiscal year 2026, according to the USCIS.",
      "The H-1B program is already the most restrictive visa program in the U.S., with about 20% of applications resulting in approved workers, according to a March\u00a0study\u00a0from the nonpartisan National Foundation for American Policy.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-designating-antifa-terrorist-organization/",
    "published": "Fri, 19 Sep 2025 10:18:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Legal experts say Trump lacks authority to designate domestic terrorist organizations, but the planned move could still affect some law enforcement approaches.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced on social media Wednesday that he's designating antifa as a \"major terrorist organization.\" But what that action would mean for the movement remains unclear, given that antifa has no official leadership or organization structure, and the president lacks authority to designate domestic terrorist organizations, experts say.",
      "The president's announcement comes as he and his supporters continue to denounce \"radical left wing political violence\" following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk last week. After Kirk's killing, Mr. Trump blamed rhetoric from the \"radical left,\" saying that it is \"directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.\"",
      "Officials described the attack on Kirk as \"targeted,\" and family members of the suspected shooter, Tyler Robinson, said he had \"become more political\" in recent years. Robinson wrote in text messages to his roommate that he had carried out the attack because he \"had enough of [Kirk's] hatred,\" according to court filings. There has not been evidence presented to the public linking Robinson to antifa.",
      "This is not the first time Mr. Trump has argued antifa poses a threat \u2014 in his first term, he claimed the movement was behind looting and rioting during protests against police brutality in 2020. A November 2021 report on anarchist and left-wing violence in the U.S. from George Washington University's Program on Extremism and the National Counterrorism, Innovation, Technology and Education Center noted that the first Trump administration largely labeled the threat from anarchist violent extremists as originating from antifa.",
      "What is antifa?",
      "Short for \"anti-fascist,\" antifa activism can be traced back to antiracists who opposed the activities of members of the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis, according to a June 2020 report from the Congressional Research Service. But the movement gained attention after the violent clashes between white nationalists and anti-racism protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017.",
      "The Congressional Research Service describes antifa as \"decentralized\" and lacking a \"unifying organizational structure or detailed ideology.\" Instead, it consists of \"independent, radical, like-minded groups and individuals\" that largely believe in the principles of anarchism, socialism and communism.",
      "\"There is no single organization called antifa. That's just not the way these activists have ever organized themselves,\" said Michael Kenney, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh who has studied antifa. \"There's tremendous variation inside that movement, even on issues like political violence.\"",
      "The FBI has warned about violence perpetrated by antifa adherents, and in 2017, then-FBI Director Chris Wray told Congress that the bureau was looking into \"a number of what we would call anarchist extremist investigations, where we have properly predicated subjects who are motivated to commit violent criminal activity on kind of an antifa ideology,\" according to CRS.",
      "Wray, who was appointed FBI director by Mr. Trump during his first term, also acknowledged in congressional testimony in 2019 that the FBI doesn't investigate ideology, but does investigate violence. Then, in 2020, he said antifa is a \"movement or an ideology,\" not an organization.",
      "A 2020 assessment from the Center for Strategic and International Studies found that far-right attacks and plots have outpaced those from other perpetrators, including far-left networks. A 2022 study from the University of Maryland's National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism also found that \"right-wing extremists\" are more violent than left-wing actors.",
      "But CSIS said its data has indicated a rise in violent activity by \"antifa extremists, anarchists and related far-left extremists,\" which it said is likely connected to the \"concurrent increase in violent far-right activity.\"",
      "What could Trump's suggested designation do?",
      "Mr. Trump announced in May 2020 that the U.S. would be designating antifa as a \"major terrorist organization following nationwide unrest in response to the death of George Floyd,\" but nothing followed from that.",
      "Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the president does not have the authority to designate domestic terrorist organizations, even if this were an \"organization.\"",
      "\"There is no legal mechanism that I'm aware of within U.S. code that would give the president or the federal government the power to declare a domestic 'group' as a major terrorist organization or a major terrorist group,\" he said.",
      "The administration could, however, shift antifa to a higher priority for federal law enforcement, Baumgartner said, which could lead to more frequent investigations or arrests.",
      "The FBI and Department of Homeland Security don't officially designate U.S. extremist groups as \"domestic terrorist organizations,\" in part because of First Amendment concerns, according to CRS.",
      "A 2023 report from the research entity also noted that the government does not provide a \"precise, comprehensive, and public explanation of any particular groups it might consider to be domestic terrorist organizations,\" and it warned that listing groups in that way may infringe on free speech rights or \"the act of belonging to an ideological group, which in and of itself is not a crime in the United States.\"",
      "\"At this point, it's not a crime in America to have 'leftist' political beliefs along the lines that some anti-fascists do,\" Kenney said.",
      "He added that designating groups as domestic terrorist organizations could also raise Fourth Amendment concerns regarding surveillance.",
      "\"Do we as Americans still enjoy the right to free speech, to nonviolent political expression of our views, however unpalatable the Trump administration might find those views? Yes,\" Kenney said.",
      "While the U.S. does not have a list of domestic terrorist organizations, it does have a Foreign Terrorist Organizations list. Among the groups on the list are Hamas, al Qaeda and ISIS, which are known to operate transnationally. These groups are not related to the antifa movement.",
      "Kenney said that if the president were to try to designate antifa as a foreign terrorist organization, it would unlock tools like economic sanctions to bring greater pressure on the movement. Mr. Trump hasn't said he has this in mind, though he said he'd recommend \"those funding ANTIFA be thoroughly investigated.\" A foreign terrorist designation, if it were possible, would make it a crime to provide material support to antifa. Making this designation would present other challenges, however.",
      "\"When the president refers to antifa, whether in remarks to reporters or speeches, he's usually referring to domestic non-state actors and domestic incidents, so how are they going to portray that as foreign? That's not clear to me,\" Kenney said.",
      "Can the Justice Department charge someone associated with antifa with domestic terrorism?",
      "No. The FBI defines domestic terrorism as \"violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups to further ideological goals stemming from domestic influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature.\" But it is not a chargeable offense under federal law.",
      "\"You can't prosecute an ideology,\" Baumgartner said.",
      "But there are numerous federal criminal statutes that could apply to domestic terrorism.",
      "In the case of Dylann Roof, a white supremacist who killed nine Black parishioners at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015, he was convicted of 33 counts of federal hate crimes, obstruction of religious exercise and firearms charges.",
      "Payton Gendron, who killed 10 Black people at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, in 2022, is facing federal hate crime and weapons charges. Gendron also pleaded guilty to a state terrorism charge.",
      "Thirty-two states and the District of Columbia criminalize the act of domestic terrorism, according to the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law. In 21 states and D.C., it is a crime to provide support to further an act of terrorism or a terror.",
      "Harsher punishments a possibility",
      "But Baumgartner said that where alleged domestic terrorism does come into play at the federal level is in increased penalties for perpetrators. Prosecutors have sought harsher punishments for felony offenses that \"involved, or was intended to promote, a federal crime of terrorism.\"",
      "The Justice Department asked federal judges in 2023 to apply a terrorism adjustment in cases involving members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, far-right organizations whose members were convicted on charges stemming from the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, including seditious conspiracy.",
      "When ex-Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio was sentenced for multiple crimes related to the riot, prosecutors succeeded in applying the terrorism enhancement to his sentencing, although the judge did not allow it to heavily affect the length of the 22-year sentence. Mr. Trump issued Tarrio a full pardon upon taking office in January. He also commuted the sentences of members of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers.",

      "\"There's free speech, and then there's hate speech,\" Bondi said in an\u00a0interview. \"We will absolutely target you, go after you, if you are targeting anyone with hate speech.\" The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld free speech rights, even if it is hate speech. She later said on X that \"hate speech that crosses the line into threats of violence is NOT protected.\" The Justice Department referred CBS News to Bondi's comments when asked whether the administration considers celebrations of Kirk's assassination as threats of violence.",
      "\"Democrat critics are lying about the Administration's actions \u2014 this effort will target those committing criminal acts and hold them accountable,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Asked about Bondi's remarks, President Trump told ABC News' Jonathan Karl on Tuesday: \"We'll probably go after people like you because you treat me so unfairly; it's hate.\"",
      "Kimmel \"indefinitely\" taken off air",
      "Late Wednesday, ABC announced it would \"indefinitely\" pre-empt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" after Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr said the network should \"take action\" for the comedian's suggestion that Kirk's alleged killer is a Trump supporter. ABC's move came after station owners Nexstar and Sinclair said they were pulling the show indefinitely. Carr thanked Nexstar and Sinclair for taking action.",
      "Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the FCC to approve it. Nexstar told CBS News in a statement it made the decision to pre-empt Kimmel \"unilaterally\" and did not consult with the FCC beforehand.",
      "On Truth Social, Mr. Trump referred to it as a cancellation and congratulated ABC for \"finally having the courage to do what had to be done,\" and added: \"That leaves Jimmy [Fallon] and Seth [Meyers], two total losers, on Fake News NBC. Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!!\"",
      "Anna Gomez, one of two FCC commissioners working with Carr and the lone Democrat on the commission, called Kimmel's penalty a dangerous new precedent.",
      "\"This administration is increasingly using the weight of government power to suppress lawful expression, not because it glorifies violence or breaks the law, but because it challenges those in power and reflects views they oppose,\" she said on CNN Wednesday.",
      "In a statement on Thursday, she added: \"This FCC does not have the authority, the ability, or the constitutional right to police content or punish broadcasters for speech the government dislikes. \u2026 Free speech is the foundation of our democracy, and we must push back against any attempt to erode it.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, also criticized the move.",
      "\"When the head of the FCC is talking openly about taking away the broadcast license, then that is the government trying to exercise censorship. It's not a question of whether you agree with Mr. Kimmel or disagree with Mr. Kimmel. The point is one of the government not coming in and making decisions about whose speech gets heard,\" she said, adding, \"Everyone should care, no matter what your political view is.\"",
      "After a week of controversy, Disney said Kimmel's show will return on Tuesday, Sept. 23. The company said some of the host's comments were \"ill-timed and thus insensitive,\" but after several days of \"thoughtful conversations with Jimmy ... we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.\"",
      "The First Amendment and hateful speech",
      "In general, the First Amendment \u2014 which bars the government from \"abridging the freedom of speech\" \u2014 protects most forms of hateful speech, aside from a narrow set of exceptions that include threats of violence and incitement.",
      "Bondi's initial comments about hate speech stood out among those made by administration officials because of her position as the nation's top prosecutor, said Adam Goldstein, vice president of strategic initiatives at the nonprofit Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.",
      "\"I especially don't want to see an attorney in charge of the Justice Department saying that,\" he said. \"It's the kind of thing that would get you a bad grade in your constitutional law class.\"",
      "Jenin Younes, a First Amendment attorney who worked on a case accusing the Biden administration of social media censorship, told CBS News, \"These are all the same people who were railing against cancel culture and the idea of hate speech just a few years ago, when it was the left doing it.\"",
      "\"The worry is that lawmakers will just define hate speech to mean anything the opposite party says, and so that's why the court has said it's not up to the government to decide what's within the bounds of acceptable discourse and what's not,\" Genevieve Lakier, a University of Chicago law professor, told CBS News. \"There's no definition of hate speech, because the whole point is there's no neutral definition of hate speech.\"",
      "In most cases, Lakier said, \"simply saying 'he had it coming' \u2026 does not fit the very, very, very narrow definition of incitement that is available in the case law.\"",
      "Are offensive comments illegal?",
      "First Amendment legal scholar Eugene Volokh told CBS News that, in most circumstances, the government cannot go after ordinary people for making insensitive or offensive public comments about Kirk's killing.",
      "\"It may be in bad taste. It may be bad for the country when people are trying to normalize political violence. But it is protected by the First Amendment,\" said Volokh, a professor emeritus of law at the University of California, Los Angeles.",
      "\"I would say it's basically prohibited for the government to say you can't mock or make fun of or even celebrate his death,\" said Younes, who currently serves as national legal director at the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.",
      "Volokh says comments like Bondi's \"are likely to further confuse people, whether citizens or law enforcement or others, about what's protected and what's not protected.\"",
      "\"I think they may also kind of send a message that we are going to try to find a way of punishing this speech,\" Volokh added.",
      "Bondi also said Monday the Justice Department could prosecute businesses that refuse to print photos of Kirk for customers, citing a worker at an Office Depot who declined to print flyers for a Kirk vigil. Office Depot called the incident \"completely unacceptable\" and said the staff member no longer works for the company.",
      "\"There is no federal law that prohibits copy shops or print shops from discriminating based on the content of the message,\" Volokh said.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson said Bondi was solely referencing the Office Depot incident, which the department's civil rights division looked into.",
      "Less clear, according to legal experts, is whether the federal government can deport non-citizens or revoke their visas over their views on Kirk, as Secretary of State Marco Rubio has floated. Volokh says the laws around this are \"unsettled.\"",
      "\"While it is true that the executive's power when it comes to immigration is very vast, I think the First Amendment constrains it,\" Younes said. She pointed to the Trump administration's attempts to remove students for participating in pro-Palestinian protests, which have been met with pushback at the district court level.",
      "What can private companies do?",
      "The First Amendment doesn't stop private employers from choosing to fire people for speech, though some states like California have their own legal protections.",
      "However, in some cases, it can be illegal for the government to use its power to pressure a private company into firing a staff member \u2014 a concept known as \"jawboning.\"",
      "Government officials can try to persuade private companies to take a certain action, according to Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, but they cannot coerce companies by making threats.",
      "Volokh said it likely doesn't qualify as jawboning if elected officials merely express the view that people should be fired, as long as they don't cross the line into threatening to take action. For example, on Vance's call for people to contact the employers of anybody who celebrates Kirk's death, Volokh said, \"it's hard to see that as unconstitutional.\"",
      "\"You would have to show the private employer didn't want to fire you, but they were just acting because they were afraid of some kind of repercussions from the government,\" noted Younes.",
      "There's a fine line between broadly encouraging companies to fire employees who praised Kirk's assassination, and giving instructions to specific firms, according to Goldstein. He pointed to a contrast between Vance's comments advising podcasts listeners to call people's employers, and a tweet by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.",
      "Duffy praised American Airlines, United and Delta for suspending employees, and wrote, \"The next step should be to fire them.\"",
      "\"A rational airline who sees this message might feel some coercive effect on their decision making,\" said Goldstein, noting Duffy's power over the airline industry.",
      "Lakier said it's not a violation of the First Amendment if a company fires an employee of their own volition. But, she said, \"the problem is, in many of these cases, it's going to be because of political sympathy.\"",
      "\"The employers who are firing them, maybe implicitly fear that if they don't, they're going to face the government's wrath or they want to curry favor by firing,\" she said.",
      "In general, however, \"If we're talking about private companies and you are an at-will employee, then that means exactly as it sounds like, which is that an employer can fire you at will,\" said CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School.",
      "Government workers have some free speech protections, but it's complicated",
      "In many cases, Trump allies have spotlighted public employees who criticize Kirk.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called celebrations of Kirk's death by service members or civilian workers \"unacceptable\" last week, and said the Pentagon is \"tracking\" them. Since then, at least one Marine officer has been relieved of his recruiting duties pending an investigation into his post about Kirk, and two Army officers have been suspended pending a review into their posts, according to a Marine official and an Army official.",
      "A Secret Service agent who expressed negative opinions about Kirk on Facebook was also placed on leave last week.",
      "At the state level, Oklahoma's top education official has said teachers who celebrate Kirk's assassination \"will be banned from teaching,\" and teachers in several other states have been investigated or placed on leave over their comments. Others have pushed for action against employees at public colleges like Clemson University.",
      "People who work for the government have some free speech protections, especially for speech that they make while off the clock, legal experts say.",
      "\"Government employees do have First Amendment rights of freedom of speech,\" said Calvert. \"However, those rights are not unlimited and may be restricted if the employee's speech somehow interferes with the ability of the employer \u2026 to effectively and efficiently deliver its services to the public.\"",
      "Calvert said \"every case is going to be unique.\"",
      "Prior court rulings have established several factors for assessing the speech rights of government employees, according to Calvert and Volokh. Those include whether the worker spoke in their personal capacity, whether it relates to a matter of public concern and whether the worker's right to speak out outweighs the government's interest in delivering its services.",
      "But the military is a slightly separate case, according to Volokh, because \"there are more restrictions that are permissible on service members' speech.\"",
      "Volokh said the military is different \"in part because of a sense that \u2026 this is an environment where discipline is really important, where self-discipline is really important, where unit cohesion is really important, where commitment to the right ideas is very important.\"",
      "\"It's going very, very far\"",
      "Some First Amendment advocates are uncomfortable with vocal calls for people to be fired \u2014 even if they don't run afoul of the Constitution.",
      "\"It's going very, very far. This is not being limited to people saying, 'I'm glad Charlie Kirk is dead and I wish everyone like him was dead, too,'\" Younes said. \"It's being applied to people who just are saying they didn't like Charlie Kirk.\"",
      "Goldstein said that some officials may be understandably lashing out after the death of their friend, but particularly in the context of Kirk's career as free speech advocate, the reaction has gone too far.",
      "\"What a weird way to react in memory of Charlie Kirk, who was known for listening to people and disagreeing with them, and moving on,\" Goldstein said.",
      "Graham  Kates, \n                                                  \n                                  Eleanor  Watson, \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen and \n                                                  \n                      Alan  He\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "A number of charities on Monday severed ties with Sarah Ferguson, the ex-wife of Prince Andrew, after British newspapers published an email that she reportedly wrote to the late convicted sex offender\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein, describing him as a \"supreme friend.''",
      "Julia's House, a children's hospice, said that the reported correspondence made it inappropriate for Ferguson, also known as the Duchess of York, to remain a patron. A spokesman for Ferguson said that she sent an email on the advice of her lawyers after Epstein threatened to sue her for associating him with sexual abuse in a media interview, Britain's Press Association reported.",
      "\"Following the information shared this weekend on the Duchess of York's correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein, Julia's House has taken the decision that it would be inappropriate for her to continue as a patron of the charity,'' the charity said. \"We have advised the Duchess of York of this decision and thank her for her past support.\"",
      "A food allergy charity, The Natasha Allergy Research Foundation, and Prevent Breast Cancer, were also among the charities that cut ties in light of recent revelations.",
      "\"We were disturbed to read of Sarah, Duchess of York's, correspondence with Jeffrey Epstein,\" Nadim and Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, founders of the food allergy charity, said in a statement. \"Sarah Ferguson has not been actively involved with the charity for some years. She was a patron but, in the light of the recent revelations, we have taken the decision that it would be inappropriate for her to continue to be associated with the charity. We would like to thank her for her kindness and support in the past.\"",
      "The Teenage Cancer Trust, which had an association with Ferguson for 35 years, also dropped her as a patron.",
      "The email referred to a 2011\u00a0interview with the Evening Standard newspaper in which she apologized for accepting 15,000 pounds from Epstein.",
      "\"I abhor paedophilia and any sexual abuse of children and know that this was a gigantic error of judgment on my behalf. I am just so contrite I cannot say,'' Ferguson said in the interview. \"Whenever I can, I will repay the money and have nothing ever to do with Jeffrey Epstein ever again.\"",
      "But the following month, Ferguson sent an email to Epstein in which she \"humbly apologized\" for linking him to sex abuse, saying \"you have always been a steadfast, generous and supreme friend to me and my family,\" The Sun newspaper reported over the weekend.",
      "The Associated Press couldn't independently confirm that the email is authentic.",
      "Epstein\u00a0died by suicide in 2019 while he was in custody facing federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "The story comes less than a month after Andrew himself was criticized for staying in touch with Epstein for five years longer than previously claimed.",
      "Leaked email correspondence between Epstein and former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak indicated that the prince had been in touch with Epstein as late as 2015, the Times of London reported. Andrew told the BBC in 2019 that he ceased all contact with Epstein in December 2010, after the late disgraced financier pleaded guilty to sex crimes in Florida.",
      "Andrew and his ex-wife have faced a series of scandals amid concerns that the prince has tried to profit from his royal status.",
      "He was forced to give up all royal duties and charity roles after the 2019 interview with the BBC in which he was criticized for trying to minimize his connections with Epstein and failing to show sympathy for his victims. Last year, it emerged that a suspected Chinese spy had developed close links with Andrew, raising concerns about efforts to put undue influence on other members of the royal family.",

      "An unknown number of inmates escaped in the clash between rival gangs, during which another 14 people were injured, a masked police officer identified as commander Colonel William Calle told the Ecuavisa channel.",
      "Thirteen inmates have been recaptured.",
      "Calle said gunfire broke out in the early morning hours, alerting prison guards and police who rushed to that part of the prison in Machala, in southwest Ecuador near the Peruvian border.",
      "One guard was killed as he entered, and others were taken hostage, said the officer.",
      "Calle said the confrontation lasted about 40 minutes, during which inmates \"fired guns, threw bombs, grenades.\"",
      "The dead inmates belonged to the rival Los Choneros and Los Lobos gangs, two of the biggest drug trafficking groups in Ecuador. Earlier this month, the\u00a0U.S. designated\u00a0both gangs as foreign terrorist organizations in the Trump administration's latest move against cartels.",
      "Police said the violence was the result of \"fighting between gangs\" in a facility housing double the number of inmates it was designed for.",

      "But despite hopeful messages from Mr. Trump in the wake of his Alaskan summit in August with Putin, there has been no indication that Moscow is ready to accept a negotiated solution that involves it making any concessions, and Ukraine and Russia have instead continued accusing each other of carrying out near-daily deadly strikes, including on civilian areas.",
      "Russia has launched several of its largest strikes of the war on Ukraine's capital Kyiv over the last few weeks. European leaders have warned repeatedly that Putin is essentially playing for time\u00a0\u2014 convincing Mr. Trump to keep negotiations going while he steps up his military assault, without any real interest in a ceasefire as his forces are making incremental gains on the ground.",
      "Concern Russia's war could spread as NATO nations condemn border incursions",
      "Far from an imminent ceasefire in the war, concern has been increasing that the conflict could escalate beyond Ukraine's borders. Several of America's European NATO allies have accused Russia of a series of provocations.",
      "Russian drones were shot down by Polish and allied NATO warplanes after crossing into Polish airspace on Sept. 9. Ten days later, Estonia said Russian fighter jets entered its airspace, drawing recriminations from several NATO nations again.",
      "Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics said on social media that Russia was testing NATO's political and military response and aiming to reduce Western support for Ukraine by compelling countries to redirect resources toward the defense of alliance countries.",
      "Russia has denied that its planes entered Estonia's airspace, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying Russian aircraft remained in international airspace and accusing the European nations of \"escalating tensions and provoking a confrontational atmosphere.\"",
      "Jonatan Vseviov, who heads the Estonian foreign ministry, told the country's ERR public broadcaster on Monday that the government had \"irrefutable evidence\" of the Russian incursion, however, adding: \"The fact that Russia is provocatively and dangerously violating the airspace of a NATO country is one thing. The fact that it is openly lying to the whole world about it is another.\"",
      "Underlying all of the Ukrainian president's efforts during his visit to the U.S. for the United Nations assembly this week, will be a push for his partners to implement further sanctions aimed at punishing the Russian economy, particularly around oil and energy trade, which Mr. Trump has hinted he is willing to do.",
      "Speaking during a state visit to the U.K. last week, Mr. Trump lamented his inability to broker a ceasefire in Ukraine since he took office in January, noting that he thought it would be easier to achieve. He said Putin had \"really let me down,\" and called on America's European allies to completely halt all purchasing of Russian energy products to financially squeeze Moscow.",
      "\"It is vital that this week strengthen the world's resolve for robust action (against Russia),\" Zelenskyy said in his social media post. \"For without strength, peace will not prevail.\"",

      "Authorities in the Dominican Republic said Sunday they have confiscated some of the cocaine transported by a speedboat that was destroyed recently by the U.S. Navy, in what the Caribbean nation called the first operation of its kind.",
      "In a news conference, the Dominican Republic's National Directorate for Drug Control (DNCD) said it recovered 377 packages of cocaine from the boat which was allegedly carrying 1,000 kilograms, or more than 2,200 pounds, of the drug. The drugs were recovered after \"an aerial military strike by the United States against a speedboat of narcoterrorists,\" the DNCD said in a statement.",
      "At the news conference, a spokesperson for the U.S. embassy said the attack is the one President Donald Trump first announced Friday without saying where it had taken place, following several U.S. attacks on alleged drug boats off Venezuela. Mr. Trump at the time said three \"male narcoterrorists\" were killed.",
      "Officials said the boat was destroyed about 80 nautical miles south of Isla Beata, a small island that belongs to the Dominican Republic. They said the Dominican's Republic Navy worked in conjunction with U.S. authorities to locate the speedboat which was allegedly trying to dock in the Dominican Republic and use the nation as a \"bridge\" to transport cocaine to the United States.",
      "Officials released a video of the operation, showing officers unloading and inspecting bricks of the alleged drugs, some bearing the word \"MEN\" on the packaging.",
      "\"This is the first time in history that the United States and the Dominican Republic carry out a joint operation against narco terrorism in the Caribbean,\" the directorate said in a statement.",
      "In August, the U.S. sent eight warships and a submarine to the southern Caribbean, in what the Trump administration has said was a mission to fight drug trafficking.",
      "The White House says the naval flotilla has destroyed at least three boats carrying drugs so far. The separate strikes have killed more than a dozen people aboard the vessels.",
      "Human rights groups have said the strikes on the boats amount to extra judicial killings, and on Friday two Democratic senators introduced a resolution in Congress that seeks to block the administration from carrying out further strikes.",
      "The Trump administration says two of the boats that have been sunk left from Venezuela, whose president is often described by White House officials as a drug trafficker and leader of a gang known as the Cartel of the Suns.",
      "Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro denies the charges and has described the U.S naval build up in the Caribbean as an attack on his country. Maduro has called the warships an \"absolutely criminal and bloody threat.\"",
      "On two occasions earlier this month, Venezuelan fighter jets flew near a U.S. naval ship, in what multiple Defense Department officials\u00a0described to CBS News\u00a0as a \"game of chicken.\"",

    "summary": "In an interview with CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" the French president pushed back on criticism for recognizing a Palestinian state.",
    "story": [
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said it was out of line for Charles Kushner, the U.S. ambassador to France and the father of President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, to publicly accuse him of taking insufficient action to combat antisemitism, and for him to link France's foreign policy positions to domestic incidents of violence against Jews in France.",
      "In a letter he published in the Wall Street Journal to Macron in August, Kushner wrote that he had \"deep concern over the dramatic rise of antisemitism in France and the lack of sufficient action by your government to confront it.\"",
      "\"Public statements haranguing Israel and gestures toward recognition of a Palestinian state embolden extremists, fuel violence, and endanger Jewish life in France,\" he wrote, urging Macron to \"enforce hate-crime laws without exception; ensure the safety of Jewish schools, synagogues and businesses, prosecute offenders to the fullest extent; and abandon steps that give legitimacy to Hamas and its allies.\"",
      "In an interview with \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan on Thursday in Paris, Macron called Kushner's criticism a \"mistake\" and an \"unacceptable statement for somebody who is supposed to be a diplomat.\"",
      "\"This is unacceptable,\" he said.",
      "Macron said a French ambassador would never be allowed to make similar public remarks about another country because it would risk diplomacy with those nations.",
      "\"So either you are a person who wants to express freely,\" Macron said. \"If you are a diplomat, you have to follow the rule of diplomacy. \u2026 The [American] taxpayer money is not properly used to finance this kind of statement.\"",
      "France's foreign ministry summoned the ambassador last month in a formal rebuke. The French ministry said Kushner's claims \"run counter to international law,\" citing the \"obligation not to interfere in the internal affairs of states\" in the 1961 Vienna Convention of Diplomatic Relations.",
      "Kushner also wrote that \"anti-Zionism is antisemitism \u2014 plain and simple.\"",
      "The State Department said at the time in a statement to the Associated Press, that Kushner \"is our U.S. government representative in France and is doing a great job advancing our national interests in that role.\"",
      "Macron acknowledged that at times people who criticize the state of Israel and its government may be motivated by hate of Jews, but rejected the idea that any of his criticism of the policies of the Netanyahu government is inherently anti-semitic.",
      "He told Brennan, \"I was the first president in France to adopt the definition of antisemitism, making it the equivalent of anti-Zionism.\"",
      "Macron firmly rejected the notion that his objections to the killing in Gaza or his call for the creation of a Palestinian state is inherently antisemitic or puts at risk French Jews. He argued \"it doesn't mean that you are not allowed to be in disagreement with the government of Israel.\" Disagreeing with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \"doesn't make me an antisemitic,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu currently leads the most right- wing government in Israeli history, opposes the creation of a Palestinian state, and has waged a nearly two- year- long war in Gaza that succeeded in killing the Hamas leaders who carried out the bloody October 7th terrorist attack that killed 1200 of his people. The war since that time has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, and his policies including a blockade of humanitarian aid has led to famine in Gaza.",
      "Hamas still operates in Gaza, and Macron said Hamas continues to be able to recruit more fighters despite Israel killing the top echelons of the terror group. The failure to eliminate support for Hamas via military force is proof, Macron argues, that support is needed for an alternate government in the form of the Palestinian Authority.",
      "Netanyahu accused Macron of fueling antisemitism after the French president announced France would recognize Palestinian statehood this Monday at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.",
      "The high-level gathering of world leaders and their representatives, and other countries, including the U.K., Australia and Canada, also plan to join France in recognizing Palestinian statehood. The majority of the world's countries - 147 UN members - recognize the right of Palestinians to self-determination but the decision by Western powers including UN Security Council member France and UK is symbolically significant. It is also a sign of the increased isolation of the current Israeli government, which has refused to end the nearly two year war in Gaza.",
      "The plan developed by France and Saudi Arabia involves several phases, including a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, Hamas releasing the remaining hostages it's held since its Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel and the restoration of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Those conditions would have to be met before France opens an embassy there, Macron said. The second phase involves Gaza's reconstruction and governance and the third phase focuses on a two-state solution.",
      "Macron succeeded in getting Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas, the 90-year-old leader who governs the Occupied West Bank, to publicly denounce Hamas and agree to reform the Authority and hold elections.",
      "\"Recognizing the Palestinian state today is the only way to provide a political solution to a situation which has to stop,\" Macron said.",
      "The position puts France in direct conflict with the Trump administration, which blocked Palestinian Authority members from obtaining visas to attend the diplomatic gathering. Despite President Trump's statements that starvation is happening in Gaza and Israel should end its war there, Netanyahu has brushed off any American urging to do so. Recently Trump said he 'wasn't thrilled' with Netanyahu's decision to bomb US ally Qatar while Hamas members were meeting to discuss a US proposal to end the Gaza war.",
      "The current U.S. administration also appears to oppose the creation of a Palestinian State, with Trump supporting a proposal to remove Gazans and send them to other countries. The U.S. remains a staunch supporter of Israel, as well as its main weapons provider.",
      "Margaret Brennan is moderator of \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on CBS. Based in Washington, D.C., Brennan is also the Network's chief foreign affairs correspondent and a contributing correspondent to 60 Minutes. Additionally, she appears regularly on the \"CBS Evening News,\" leading coverage from Washington when news breaks on the political and foreign affairs fronts."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it finally happened. The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by quarter point, which was expected. So, rates are now in this range of four to four and a quarter percent, lowest level since 2022 the President had said all of this was overdue. What changes now?",
      "GARY COHN: So, look, I think the Fed gave us a lot of important information this last week. As you said, they started down the path of cutting interest rates, going to four to four and a quarter.\u00a0 They also gave us their outlook. So the 17 governors gave us their projections to where they think interest rates are going. So that plot that they put out shows that overall, they believe that interest rates will be cut two more times over the course of this year. Now it's not 100% clear, because the committee is divided. There are about seven members of the committee that do not want another cut this year, but there are 10 members of the committee that want at least two more cuts, and one wants more than two cuts. So that averages out to two cuts this year, which would take the federal funds rate, and it's important to understand the federal funds rate, would take that down to 3.6% for the- for year end. What is also important is the committee was fairly unanimous. I think people were worried about the independence of the Fed. I think the Fed clearly showed themselves to be independent thinkers. They took into account all of the economic data, and they came out with a projections that made sense based on what is going on in the economy today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when rates go lower, money gets cheaper to borrow, essentially. But what does it actually mean?",
      "GARY COHN: Yes and no. So, what the Federal Reserve sets is they set the federal funds rate. That's the overnight rates the banks charge each other to borrow on a secured basis. It has nothing to do where- with where American consumers borrow money. Unfortunately, American consumers borrow money on more of the five year, the seven year, the ten and the thirty year rates, because that's where automobile loans, credit card loans, student loans and mortgages are indexed to those. Interest rates are not determined by the Federal Reserve. They're determined by the open market. Those rates, in fact, after they cut rates earlier this week, went up a little bit that said they are down over the last few months. But those rates do not automatically go down when the Federal Reserve cuts rates. They have more to do with the market, and it's a supply demand situation that determines those rates.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So one of the other things the Fed highlighted here is that the labor market is, quote, \"really cooling off.\" That's what Fed Chair Powell says.",
      "GARY COHN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The administration, the Treasury secretary, says, data's bad. They're not seeing that in the jobs numbers. So which is it? What's happening here?",
      "GARY COHN: Well, look, the chairman went out of his way to talk about the dual mandate that the Fed has. The Fed has two requirements that they're supposed to run interest rate policy off of, one is called stable prices, which means 2% inflation. The other is full employment. Full employment is exactly what it sounds like. The Chair said, look, we are going to have to deal with the full employment part of the equation, even though we still have inflation in the system. So, the Federal Reserve itself and the Board of Governors admitted that we are having a declining job market, and we see that, the data over the last three or four months, we have gone from creating well over 100,000 jobs a month to creating less than 50,000 jobs a month. It may be temporary, it may be quite temporary, but the reality is, we have seen the job market degrade. We've also seen companies announce an enormous amount of CapEx and capital expenditures that's going to come into the system. I think it's interesting to take a step back and look at what's going on in the world today. I do think that we have seen companies cut back on the amount of employees they have. You know, when you take companies and you put them in a very difficult environment and you increase the cost of input costs. And inputs have been going up because of tariffs. They've been going up be- other reasons, and they're not able to raise prices to the final consumer. The one lever they can pull to make sure they keep their margins intact is they can cut down on the cost of labor. We came out of a tough situation in COVID where companies were actually afraid about being able to attract and retain people, so they were hoarding labor. So we went from a hoarding labor situation to a situation today where companies are being very aggressive about managing their expenses, and the one expense they can manage is the cost of labor. So they're letting their labor force decline naturally as people retire out of the labor system, and we're seeing that in the data, and I think it's clearly showing up.And the Federal Reserve. Recognize that in this in this week's action,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you ask the administration about this point, let's say, well, productivity is going to increase, and there are these technological shifts that are happening. So this data is distorted. Are you-, speaking specifically about tech, or are you saying across the board?",
      "GARY COHN: I'm saying across the board. I mean, we are-- we have seen across the board, and we've seen anecdotal evidence of this. I've seen, and I've heard it directly from corporate CEOs in every business line that they have gone out of their way to cut their- their human capital overhead. So just the data for Q2 is pretty, pretty interesting. Corporate revenues rose about 6.3% for Q2 and corporate profits rose close to 12%. The way you do that, unless you're raising prices of the consumer, and we, and we haven't seen a lot of prices go up to consumer, is you have to cut something out of the expense bucket. The one thing they're cutting is they're cutting labor costs. We've seen it in the U.S. data. We've seen it in the private data, and we've seen it in the anecdotal data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the president signed an executive order on Friday that I want to ask you about, because you have this role at IBM, and some insight into tech. The order is going to impose a $100,000 one-time fee for visas granted to foreign workers, highly skilled workers, H-1B visas. The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that this caused, like, a panic, because there wasn't a lot of detail, at, like, Apple, and Google, and Microsoft. Did it cause a panic at IBM? I mean, what's going on?",
      "GARY COHN: The- the- I think it caused a panic over the weekend because people weren't sure what was going on with the existing H-1B visas. It's been cleaned up over the weekend, so at- at this point, there's not a panic in the system. Everyone who's got an H-1B visa understands their status and understands how it- how it's- how it's going to work. I actually think this is a good idea. If you understand the H-1B visa program in the United States, historically, it has been a lottery system. So companies have turned in for these visas, and then the U.S. government lotteries them off. If you're now telling a company, look, you need to spend $100,000 to get one of these visas, you're not just going to ask for a- a visa and put a name in the lottery, unless that is a highly skilled person who you need, who you cannot hire in the United States. This visa program is meant for high skilled labor, where you cannot hire that person in the United States. So if that's what it's used for, ultimately we're going to bring high skilled people in the United States. It's going to help grow our economy, and that's good for all of us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll see. Gary Cohn, thank you for your insights, as always. We'll be right back."

      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with French President Emmanuel Macron, a portion of which aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 21, 2025.",
      "The interview was taped on Thursday, September 18 at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris. See previously released clips\u00a0here\u00a0and\u00a0here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, Mr. President, if you're ready, we'll dive right in.",
      "PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for having us here. You know, most countries in the world recognize Palestinian statehood. It's 147 of 193 countries at the UN, but France is going to be the first western UN Security Council member to do so. What conditions are there for this?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Look, thank you, and thank you for being here and offering me the opportunity to have such a discussion. I think it was a necessity first to decide this recognition, and I will announce it on the 22nd of September at the United Nations, precisely because we are at the very moment where if we want peace and security for all in the region, we have to preserve the condition of a political perspective for everybody. So we will announce the recognition, but which is the beginning of a political process and a peace and security plan for everybody. So right after this- this recognition, we have a first phase, which is, I would say, the emergency phase, ceasefire, release of all hostages..and third, restoring the humanitarian roads and the stabilization of Gaza. We have a second package, which is the day after we will revert on that how to organize Gaza in terms of governance, security and reconstruction. And third package, the perspective of the two states.\u00a0 But recognizing the Palestinian state today is the only way to provide a political solution to a situation which has to stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you are not making the release of the hostages a condition before recognition--",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: \u00a0So this is a clear condition before we will open an embassy. This is the first series of conditions and requirements we will push-\u00a0 we will put in the peace process. But we will announce the 22nd this recognition of Palestinian state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this is a 'reckless decision.' That's the word he used. He said it gives Hamas little incentive to actually start diplomacy to release the hostages. Why do you disagree with that sequencing?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: So my first point is to say, I don't answer the Hamas with that. I don't meet the expectations of Hamas. Hamas is just obsessed by destroying Israel, but I recognize the legitimacy of so many Palestinian people who want a state, who are a people. They want a nation, they want a state, and we should not push them towards Hamas. If we don't offer them a political perspective and such a recognition, the unique answer will be security, and they will be completely trapped by Hamas as a unique option. My second point is, thanks to this recognition, and thanks to the diplomatic move we launched, we started to isolate Hamas because we- at the New York declaration, which was voted, as you know, by 142 countries. We gathered all the Arab League states, all the leaders of the regions, to work closely with us to precisely dismantle and disarm Hamas. Till now, they were not engaged in such a move. Now we gathered all these states, all these people to work closely with us in this move. So I think this is why we can create the condition of a concrete action, first, to give this right to the Palestinian people, second, to isolate Hamas from the rest of the Palestinians and the whole region, and precisely build security. But let me tell you something which is, for me, very important in this context, Israel had wonderful security results against Hezbollah Hamas top leaders, and managed to- to neutralize a lot of top decision makers of terrorist groups. They did it. This is their merit. But in terms of fighting against Hamas, this is a failure of today. They started--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What is a failure?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: --Because they- they killed all the key leaders- this is a success. But at the beginning of this war, you had more or less 25,000 Hamas fighters. The Israeli army killed probably half of them, but Hamas managed to recruit the equivalent. You have as many fighters at the very beginning, which is the best evidence of the fact, if we want to dismantle Hamas, the total war is not the answer, because it's just killing the credibility of Israel- and by the way, weakening and killing our own credibility if we don't make a move as the one we are organizing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you just pointed to something that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu would say, well, this is why we need to continue until we get rid of every Hamas member. You're saying you can't kill that idea, you need to provide a different idea?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Exactly. But this is so- this is the whole perspective. And look at the situation, not just by the war in Gaza, but everywhere in the region. Hamas was clearly not backed by a lot of people before the seventh of October. If you took the polls in Gaza, but in all the countries of the region, they were very low in all the polls. Today, the level of support is much higher, because they are making the mistake, in fact, to reduce all the perspective of the Palestinians to the Hamas. What we have to say is we want the dismantling of Hamas. You had this success, there is no more top leaders. We want to isolate them. We want to bring everybody working with us to dismantle the Hamas. But recognizing this right to have a Palestinian state through a diplomatic channel, this just giving another channel and offering a political way and isolating Hamas. So, I think there is no future with the option, which would be just, let's kill the maximum number of Hamas people, because they just recruit others and others. Because each time they launch this type of operation, they kill so many civilians that they are just destroying their own reputation and credibility, and they are creating an unsustainable framework of security in the whole region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, since October 7th, popular support in Israel for a Palestinian state has also declined. Prime Minister Netanyahu has been opposed for a very, very long time, and now he says that just look at those attacks that day. If you allow for any kind of Palestinian state, it will be a launch-pad for terrorism. I mean, that is his argument, that this shows you can't allow for the safety and security of Israel if there are two states. Why is he wrong?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: First, I want to- I want to say that the seventh of October was a total trauma for everybody in our country here, because we had so many French people being killed during the seventh of October terrorist attack launched by Hamas. And- and it was, for us, one of the biggest terrorist attack against our own fellow citizen. But we- we did share, and we do share, the pain and the suffer of Israeli people and so many families. And for me, the top priority remains the release of hostages. And I met very regularly families of hostages, and I have to say that what they live is unbearable. And I had the opportunity meet with (unintel) Guy's mother and so many of them, and what they describe is absolutely unbearable. But, I consider that if we want precisely to build a sustainable peace for Israel itself and for Israeli people, a political process and the recognition of a Palestinian state, if the state recognizes the right of Israel to live and defend itself, is demilitarized, has security forces with the vetting process by Israel, with, obviously, a proper governance and reform governance and- and is precisely we have a series of reform which are part of the process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's it, right? You are talking about recognizing the Palestinian Authority, which has some governance over the West Bank, already was working with Israeli security forces. But Hamas came to power through the ballot box in the first place.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Look, it's- if we are honest, it's totally different. And this is why I think- let's accept the fact that a lot of people worked very hard to kill the credibility of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza years ago, and Hamas appeared as precisely as sort of an alternative option. But, terrorist attacks were launched by Hamas, not by Palestinian Authority. And if we say all those living in Gaza, and all those backing the Palestinian state are de-facto the support of Hamas, there is no end to this war except the you kill everybody. And this is this is terrible. So we have to recognize that the Palestinian Authority has to be reformed. The governance is not satisfactory today. We need a new- you have a new- we need a new Palestinian Authority. But, let's just remark, and, please notice with me, that thanks to the recognition process we launched, for the first time for many years, we got, the ninth of June, a series of clear commitments from the Palestinian Authority. They refused till now. The reform; a new vice president being elected, reform of the education program, a pay forcely, obviously, program as well, with the monitoring by a US audit structure. So we don't just theories --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And they denounced October 7th--",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: -- And for the very first time --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --20 months later.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: This is true. But for what? Because we made this move. So the recognition is the way as well to re engage and bring them back in the table. And my point is to say, let's isolate Hamas, and let's focus on the dismantling of Hamas from a military and a political point of view. In order to do so, we have to re-engage with those who can be, I would say, a political achievement for Palestinian people. And this is why the recognition is so important. And if we revert to West Bank, one of the key elements which triggered my decision to announce in July, the perspective of the recognition for the 22nd of September is a vote of the Knesset. When the Knesset decided to start the settlements again in West Bank, it was the best evidence of the fact that they don't want to fight against Hamas. There is no Hamas in West Bank. They just want to destroy the existing political bodies, and the possibility of the two states. And I really believe this is a terrible mistake for Israel itself, because in doing so, they just kill any other perspective that war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you- I understand the argument you are making, but it has put you at direct odds with the Trump administration, who argue that your decision to make this recognition announcement, along with all these UN members, that it, in fact, kills the diplomacy they had underway. They said they were working to get, for example, the tax money from the Israelis to hand back over to the Palestinian Authority, that they were doing practical things on the ground to help Palestinians. Secretary Rubio said, that West Bank division you were talking about with the settlements, he drew a direct line to your recognition. Why do you think they're blaming you for that?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Look, first, I think we all work very hard in order to improve the situation of- of people on the ground. And let me tell you that France, a lot of French people, French doctors, French citizen, French members of NGOs, are working very hard with our administration as well to help Palestinian people. And during the past years, we worked very (UNINTEL) and financed a lot of actions as well being led by UNRWA. Second, I think my- my objective is precisely to- to provide another perspective. We- we- we are closely coordinated with the U.S. administration when we speak about the ceasefire and the release of hostages. We were always in close coordination with Secretary of State, or- or key- key President Trump's advisors, in order to work with Qatar, Egypt, and Israel on the release of hostages, of ceasefire. But your administration is focusing on the day after. And what we propose is a full-fledged plan, where we have first, the emergency package. So let's deliver release of all hostages, ceasefire, and- and humanitarian access. The day we have that, we start the day after. And I think we are very convergent with the work which is being done by- by your administration. What we want is a de facto governance in Gaza, with clearly a sort of transitional- transitional administration, including the Palestinian Authority, excluding, clearly, Hamas. But with a vetting process of Israel and an association of all the neighbors, we have a security package in this- in this day after approach, which is, let's scale up the training of the policemen and security forces of the Palestinians, and--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who will do that?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: We- we are already doing that, we're doing so. Many countries of the regions. It does exist, but we need a scale up, and in parallel, we proposed, and we work very closely with the United Kingdom, and all the leaders of the region, precisely to offer a military- I would say, an international force to be deployed in Gaza, with a UN mandate. Which is a unique framework to be defended, and which could be legitimate, to assist and- and back, I would say, this policemen and security forces. And--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know, Israel does not trust the United Nations at all.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: No- this is a UN framework, but this- first, they would have a vetting process of all the structure, and it would involve Jordan, Egypt, and some of- some others are ready as well to finance. But obviously it is to be made in close coordination with Israel. And in the security package, obviously, the core element is a dismantling of Hamas. There is no other option if you want to fix the situation, to disarm the Hamas, and precisely, to demobilize so many fighters, to organize what we call a DDR process, which is very familiar to all the experts in- in this type of situation. And this is in this day after for Gaza, in the security package, that we can organize such a DDR, vis a vis Hamas. And to be sure that Hamas will never be involved in the government, but that Hamas will be disarmed, dismantled, with some key people to leave Gaza and some other to be deradicalized, and the weapons to be taken. In order to do so, you need clear security forces here. You need these international forces to be here. And obviously we have the reconstruction. On that, I think there is a strong alignment with the United States. My point is, the recognition and the process we launched with that is the only way to bring with us, on this track, all the neighbors and key countries in order to deliver such a package. And- and look at the situation today, when Egypt, when so many leaders of the region, are not comfortable with what is being done. You need to re-engage them. And this is exactly what we are doing. But my point is to say, if we don't have this full package, the day after is impossible, because today, de facto, you are accepting the displacement of population in Gaza City. How do you want the day after to be possible if you displace thousands of people?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, exactly on this point, when you say, day after, that means when the war ends and some kind of rebuilding happens. What you're talking about with the Trump administration is this idea of having Palestinians leave Gaza, by choice, they say. But some would say that is a step towards ethnic cleansing. In fact, an independent commission set up by the UN concluded Israel has a, quote, \"intent to destroy Palestinians in Gaza, as defined by the Genocide Convention.\" Does France agree with that report?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: No, we don't qualify as a genocide what's happening because it is not a political statement. This is the judges or the, and or the historians to qualify a genocide by a series of evidence and a clear jurisprudence and clear elements.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you reject that report and that finding?",
      "And this is where I try to convince your administration that if we agree on the day after and we want this de facto authority, the security package, the dismantling of Hamas and the reconstruction, let's work on the current day.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: If you accept de facto Israel to displace these people, you will never see a day after. And by the way, I look very carefully at all the plans being shared by your administration or shared by experts working for your administration. They always reiterate, let's work and build Gaza for Gazans. It means that they are ready to preserve and protect Palestinian people because Gazans are those who are living in Gaza. But if the precondition of such a plan is to push them out, this is just a craziness. So we, we should not be\u2014for the credibility of the United States, for the credibility of France\u2013we cannot be implicitly or explicitly complacent with such a project. Because such a project, we know it. And by the way, all the security experts, even in Israel, are very clear on the fact it will be a humanitarian disaster. And this project will, will kill the possibility of a day after. So we have to be very explicit on the fact that attacking civilians just to get a few, a few terrorists and a few fighters is clearly not acceptable. But displacing people in order just to take a territory, which is not in the hands of Israel, in order to prepare the day after, is not just totally crazy, but unacceptable for all of us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN : So France has one of the largest both Muslim and Jewish populations --",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: -- This is true. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- in all of Europe. The U.S. Ambassador to France, Charles Kushner, the father of the son-in-law to the President of the United States, Jared's father, he published an article, and I know you've you've read it, saying France is not dealing with antisemitism here in France. He said \"not a day passes without Jews assaulted in the street, synagogues or schools defaced, or Jewish-owned businesses vandalized. Your own Interior Ministry has reported antisemitic incidents even at preschools.\" Do you accept this criticism as genuine and valid?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Not at all. I think this is a mistake and an unacceptable statement for somebody who is supposed to be a diplomat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Unacceptable statement.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Yes, never a French Ambassador will be allowed to do so. So either you are a person who wants to express freely. Fine. If you are a diplomat, you have to follow the rule of diplomacy. And I'm not the one, this is you to pay the Ambassador of the United States in France, but the taxpayer money is not properly used to finance this kind of statement. So this is not a speech, a letter or a word of an ambassador. This is unacceptable. Now, the matter is much more important. And the matter about antisemitism is, for me, one of my top priority. I was the first president in France to adopt the definition of antisemitism, making it the equivalent of anti-zionism. And I've always been very engaged, again, antisemitism. We've worked very hard during the past few years in order to precisely re-engage, have faster sanctions and I never neglected this topic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know in the U.S. sometimes people hear criticism of Israel as antisemitic. --",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: No. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- But you're saying it's different. --",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: --No. My point is to say, you can, you cannot reject the existence of Israel. Ani, anti-Zionism is unacceptable and is antisemitism. But it doesn't mean that you are not allowed to be in disagreement with the Government of Israel. Otherwise we will become crazy. I'm sorry, but I want to fight very hard against anti, antisemitism. I am very against any anti-Zionist speech, but I do endorse to be in disagreement with Prime Minister Netanyahu and some of his ministers on many topics. It doesn't make me an antisemitic. Otherwise we are completely trapped in an impossible world. And this is precisely why the public debate makes this situation completely crazy. If we want peace and stability and unity, we have to be precise, sharp and respectful. So in this country, for many years, we had this problem with antisemitism like in a lot of other countries. What I disagree with is the argument made by your ambassador and the Prime Minister of Israel, in another public letter, making a link between the recognition and antisemitism. You have, you have a surge of antisemitism in the U.S. and you don't recognize. You have a surge of antisemitism in Germany. Nothing to do with recognition. Everywhere we have such a surge of antisemitism. It started before the seventh of October. A lot of these guys expressed their antisemitism the seventh of October itself. How, as awful it could be, but they did and it increased after. We have to fight against this phenomenon. We have to read - first, we have to sanction. We just passed a law for our high schools and universities to improve the regulations and to be in a situation to sanction all the antisemitism being expressed there. So we are very hard. We work very hard with the Jewish community in, in our country. And, and Jewish people are part of the DNA of the French Republic. So no chance anybody here will abandon the situation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Has this hurt your relationship with the U.S.?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: No, I don't think so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you do have a few other points of friction right now, or different views than the Trump administration.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: My objective on this- on this- on this issue, is- is very clearly to- to engage on the basis of the plan we will put on the table with, with the U.S. administration. And there is a work, an important work, which is made by Mr. Witkoff, Secretary Rubio, but as well Jared Kushner and Tony Blair. So we had many exchange with, with these people and and they work very hard on, on, on important ideas. So my objective is clearly to to engage with this administration, and to show that we can clearly articulate what they have in mind and a full-fledged peace and security plan for all.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what's happening here in Europe. In regard to Russia, NATO jets were scrambled twice within just the past few weeks because of these Russian drones that have been crossing into Poland and into Romania. It's the first time in NATO's history that they had to shoot down enemy crafts that had crossed in do you believe that these incursions could have been a mistake, as President Trump has suggested?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Very clearly, Russia is a destabilizing and aggressive power in Europe. They increased, during the past few weeks, the attacks against Kiev and killing a lot of civilians. They destroyed official buildings of the Ukrainian government, but as well premises of the UK Government, of the European Union. And at the same time, during the same weeks, they violated the Polish and the Romanian air. There is no mistake. There is just a project which is to destroy the maximum territories of Ukraine, to have a victory in Ukraine, and just to highlight what they want, the weakness of NATO.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: NATO says they're still investigating. They are not as certain as you seem to be--",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: --No. I'm not saying--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --that Russia did this intentionally.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: I just say this is not totally i- This is not a specific point. If we had a situation where they were declining or decreasing the attacks against Kiev and and on the battlefield. I could accept this argument. My point is to say it's largely beyond that. My point is to say, look at what they did during the past few weeks. So, I sincerely believe that your president was committed and is committed to to make peace in Ukraine, and he engaged, he took the risk to make a summit with President Putin in Anchorage and- and he asked for negotiations. And I think he's right. But at the same time, I have to, just to recognize that there is no clear willingness of President Putin to be sincerely engaged in such a move, because as we were working on a diplomatic way, as we were trying to organize bilateral, trilateral, quadrilateral summit, the Russians were increasing the assaults in Donbas, but not just in Donbas, intensified provocations on one side and attacks on Kyiv on the other side. So I just look at the facts, and your president is as well looking at the facts. So now, what do we do? We have to increase sanctions against Russia, but we have to find the way to precisely put more pressure on Russia to bring them back at the table. In parallel, let me insist on one point. When we came to Washington D.C., a series of European leaders with President Zelenskyy, we took a commitment, we will work to provide to Ukraine security guarantees, and we delivered. A few days ago here in Paris, we gathered what we call the coalition of the willing. You have 30 countries working together in order to provide the day after peace security guarantees to Ukraine. So we have all these elements now with an historical commitment of the Europeans who provide the security guarantees to Ukraine. What we need now is Ukraine to be at the table with Russia and negotiating what the peace agreement could be, on territory, on security guarantee, on the escalation, on recovery etc.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't see any eviden- evidence of Russian interest. I mean it's been more than--",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: --So now we have to step up, and we need political, military and economic surge in order to bring them back at the table and to negotiate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So to that point, because it's now more than a month since that Alaska Summit, that big risk you said President Trump took. When he's been asked, so why not put sanctions or secondary tariffs on Russia, he points back here at Europe and the consumption of Russian oil and gas that still takes place. I know Hungary and Slovakia, for example, continue to use it.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: This is true, and we are fixing it. And we had discussion with Ursula von der Leyen, and she made a great work with with her teams to fix that. But let's be honest, this is very marginal. This is not a key driver today. We decreased by more than 80% the consumption of oil and gas. And I can tell you, because we were not the most impacted as a country, because we were less dependent on this oil- oil- oil and gas coming from Russia. But we have to finalize- to finish the job. This is true, but now it's clearly much more that when we are to do- what we have to do. We- we have to step up our support to Ukraine, and we have to provide the way to better resist to the new attacks on Kiev and civilians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What's the delay on the sanctions or tariffs then?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: As soon as possible. If it depends just on me, tomorrow. But it doesn't just depend on me. So I hope, I think we have to react collectively if you want my- my strong view, I think it's very important. I think we all agree we want peace. We all agree the problem is Russia because they don't want peace. So now we have to increase the pressure to convince Russia to come back at the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As the Trump administration has pointed to the idea that there are billions of dollars sitting in European bank accounts that could be seized, for example. Or that, you know, here you could put more tariffs on China or sanctions on China. Are these valid arguments by the administration, or are these--",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: --Look, regarding the frozen assets we are all very much attached to- to be compliant with international rules. And you cannot seize these assets from the central bank even in such a situation. And I think it's a matter of credibility, and it's very important that our countries remain [inaudible] and do respect the international laws. Because this is our problem everywhere. If we speak about Middle East, if we speak about the situation in Ukraine, when some countries start to disrespect international laws and when we are not sufficiently strong, this is the beginning of a total chaos. So we will respect international law. We are predictable, and we will not do all impossible things with these frozen assets. We already took them as, not as a collateral, but we took this frozen asset, and all the proceeds coming from this frozen asset were used to finance our efforts, part of our effort to Ukraine. This is the first point. As for your second point, it was sorry--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I asked about the China aspect. That the administration would like you to push back on China more.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Look, I think we will have our own diplomacy on China, and we are very much attached to our independence, which is normal. And we have a de-risking strategy, but we are not in a decoupling strategy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So that's a no on the pressure from the administration to do that?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: My point is, let's focus on some secondary sanctions, if they make sense. I think what we- what we have to do is to engage a serious dialogue in order to see where and in which capacity Russia is helped by third countries, and to increase the pressure. So I think this approach is a good one, but it should be targeted and directly related to Russia. And I think- what I don't think what we- what we will do as Europeans with the US administration, it is working hard in all capacity by capacity, product by product, to see the key countries allowing Russia, sometimes to have a third way and to avoid sanctions or to benefit from the current situation. This is what we call the secondary sanction, because you don't sanction directly Russia, but a third country which is helping them, and this job has to be made, has already started technically. I'm totally in favor of this job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And just a final question here to ask you again about NATO. The US has not contributed fighter jets to that new effort that was just recently announced after the drone incursions. The Supreme Allied Commander is an American, but does that signal something to you? Does that concern you that the United States isn't more muscular here?",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: No, I'm not concerned or worried about that. I want to say that the NATO Secretary General worked very hard, and we all gathered and exchanged information with the Polish Prime Minister and the Polish president in the hours right after this, what happened. And for instance, UK and France stepped up and we sent fighters. But it's fine. We were in a situation to do so, and we are totally credible. But at the same time, look at what the US is doing in on the Eastern flank of NATO. You are a very strong contributor and reliable partner. So I don't want to- to diminish this role and your commitment and- and I think your President was very clear about, as well, his commitment to NATO. But I- I'm totally in line with the fact that the Europeans have to step up. I've defended for years the fact that we need more independence, more strategic autonomy in- in Europe, and we need a stronger European pillar. This is why, by the way, right after my first election, I started to increase the budget of our army, and in 10 years, we will have doubled this budget. And- and I am already in favor of having all the Europeans increasing their budget, their defense expenditures, and as well building an actual industry research and development basis for defense and security, working together and building a strong, consistent European pillar in NATO. Because it's fair that the US wants to focus much more on its own security, or wants to work much more on the Pacific side, and asks Europeans to be more engaged and committed for their own security. I share this perspective, and this is one of the priority of the Europeans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. President. Thank you for your time today.",
      "PRESIDENT MACRON: Thank you very much for being here and offering me this opportunity to explain our views. Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you."

      "Police used tear gas and a water cannon to disperse rioters who threw objects at officers and torched a police car. There was no immediate word on injuries or arrests. Dutch media showed rioters also attacking an office of a centrist political party, D66.",

      "Genevieve Smith spent her summer compiling an application to study at a university in the Netherlands \u2013 a vague goal now solidified, she says, due to rising costs and political turmoil in the U.S. The California-based student spent two years studying at Santa Rosa Junior College after graduating high school, all the while plotting her next steps to complete her higher education.",
      "At the top of her list was affordability. The 19-year-old said she had initially considered attending UC Santa Cruz, but after reviewing the costs and not exactly knowing what she wanted to do, she decided to live at home, study and save money. After the 2024 election, she said, she began to worry about her safety and that of her friends in the U.S.",
      "She decided to leap. Smith searched for four-year colleges abroad\u00a0and then, after narrowing her career focus to international law, she decided to study in Europe. She said she's preparing applications for programs in Leiden University at The Hague and Utrecht University in Utrecht.",

      "The rise can be attributed mostly to costs, experts say, but also to the political landscape. Campuses across the country have been rocked by protests. Thousands of international student visas have been canceled, and universities and the Trump administration have been embroiled in litigation.",

      "American student applications to the United Kingdom rose 14% this year, according to UCAS, the UK's shared admissions service for higher education. This was the largest increase since UCAS started collecting the data in 2006.",
      "Mounting costs and student debt shift focus",
      "Other students were focused on costs \u2014 one in six Americans has federal student debt,\u00a0which now exceeds $1.6 trillion, according to Congress. The median tuition rate in Europe and the U.K. costs roughly $9,000 per year, while in the U.S., tuition for a four-year public university\u00a0averages $11,000 - $30,000.",

      "\"I feel like education should be free and accessible,\" Davis, 21, said, when she latched onto the idea after viewing a video on TikTok.",
      "She didn't know anyone in her high school interested in studying abroad, but since she grew up in a military family and moved around a lot, the leap didn't feel insurmountable. She said she found Beyond the States after viewing a TikTok video and doing some research and used their database to search for schools.",
      "She applied to and chose the Anglo-American University in Prague to study business, arriving in August 2023. Davis said she paid for her studies via a grant for military families, savings and some scholarships.",
      "Davis said since she began university, she has experienced other cultures, and her best friends are from Brazil, Japan and all around the world.",
      "\"I've traveled to 21 countries total,\" she said since moving to Prague.",
      "She also spent a semester abroad at Sophia University in Tokyo, which she said, \"ruined Europe for me, once I saw what school was like in Japan.\"",
      "Now in her senior year, Davis cautioned others on some of the downsides of studying abroad. She detailed the hassles of visas, international bureaucracy, and being far from family.",
      "But her biggest concern was not feeling prepared to enter the U.S. job market without an American education, internships and networking opportunities \u2013 which so many of her friends who attended school in the U.S. had.",
      "Davis said she felt her education in business marketing and communication was not \"on par\" with American schools, and she might have had more opportunities if she had studied international relations. She said she wasn't sure if she was going to return to the U.S. or stay abroad for some time.",
      "Regardless, Davis said she had \"no regrets\" about attending school in Prague and Japan and she would encourage other prospective students to explore a similar path.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have discovered prehistoric insects preserved in amber for the first time in South America, providing a fresh glimpse into life on Earth at a time when flowering plants were just beginning to diversify and spread around the world.",
      "Many of the specimens found at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador date to 112 million years ago, said Fabiany Herrera, curator of fossil plants at the Field Museum in Chicago and co-author of the study published Thursday in the journal Communications Earth and Environment. At least six types of arthropods were found preserved, according to the study.",
      "Almost all known amber deposits from the past 130 million years have been in the Northern Hemisphere, and it's long been \"an enigma\" that scientists have found few in southern regions that once comprised the supercontinent Gondwana, said David Grimaldi, an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History who was not involved in the discovery.",
      "This marks the first time researchers have identified ancient beetles, flies, ants and wasps in fossilized tree resin in South America, said Ricardo P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente, a paleoentomologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, who also was not involved in the new study.",
      "\"Amber pieces are little windows into the past,\" P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente said, adding that the discovery will help researchers understand the evolving interactions between flowering plants and insects that lived during the era of the dinosaurs.",
      "The researchers uncovered hundreds of fragments of amber, some containing ancient insects, pollen and tree leaves, at a sandstone quarry in Ecuador that's on the edge of what is today the Amazon basin.",
      "Two types of amber were discovered, according to the study: There was a more common form of amber found around the roots of resin-producing plants, and a rarer form of the material formed from resin exposed to air. The amber formed around the roots did not hold any specimens, the study said.",
      "\"A different kind of forest\"",
      "The discoveries provide evidence that the area was once a \"humid, resinous forest ecosystem,\" according to the study.",
      "But today's rainforest is much different from what dinosaurs roamed through, Herrera said. Based on an analysis of fossils in the amber, the ancient rainforest contained species of ferns and conifers, including the unusual Monkey Puzzle Tree, that no longer grow in Amazonia.",
      "\"It was a different kind of forest,\" said Herrera.",
      "The amber deposits were previously known to geologists and miners who worked at the Genoveva quarry. Study co-author Carlos Jaramillo at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute first heard of them about a decade ago and set out to find the exact location, aided by geology field notes.",
      "\"I went there and realized this place is amazing,\" Jaramillo said. \"There's so much amber in the mines,\" and it's more visible in the open quarry than it would be if hidden under dense layers of vegetation.",
      "Researchers will continue to analyze the amber trove to learn more about Cretaceous-era biodiversity \u2014 including the insects that contributed to evolution by feeding on flowering plants. \"Amber tends to preserve things that are tiny,\" said Grimaldi.",
      "\"It's the time when the relationship between flowering plants and insects got started,\" said P\u00e9rez-de la Fuente. \"And that turned out to be one of the most successful partnerships in nature.\"",

      "For Macron, the United Nations General Assembly is a stage to project France as an alternative power. \"Macron\u2019s policy on the Israel-Palestine conflict reflects his broader ambitions on France\u2019s foreign policy, that is, the idea that the country, as a middle European power, can offer an alternative to the U.S.-China competition,\" Jean-Loup Samaan, a senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore\u2019s Middle East Institute, told Fox News Digital. \"In this specific case, Macron believes that his push for a Palestinian state will increase French credibility in the Arab world and the so-called \u2018Global South.\u2019\"",

      "\"Macron is certainly driven by his beleaguered domestic political situation and the large French Muslim population, but in his own mind he's also been down this road in Lebanon, where France has historic equities. The record is pretty clear: Macron has never delivered on anything; security improvements have only come through U.S. pressure and Israeli military might,\" Goldberg said.",

      "Kurt \u2018The Cyberguy\u2019 Knutsson explains how to keep your Windows computer safe and security risks of online retail giant Temu.",
      "Earlier this year, Australian police arrested a passenger for running a malicious Wi-Fi network both at an airport and during a flight. The setup looked just like the airline's own Wi-Fi service, but it wasn't. Instead, it was what cybersecurity researchers call an \"evil twin,\" a fake hotspot designed to trick people into handing over their credentials.",
      "The idea isn't new, but the setting is. For years, fake Wi-Fi networks have been a common trick in cafes, hotels, and airports. What makes this case stand out is that the attacker took it to the skies, exploiting the growing reliance on in-flight Wi-Fi for entertainment and internet access.",

      "What is an evil twin Wi-Fi attack?",
      "An evil twin hotspot is a wireless network that impersonates a legitimate one by copying its name, also known as the SSID. When multiple networks with the same name exist, your phone or laptop often connects to the one with the stronger signal, which is usually the attacker's.",
      "Travelers check their phones while navigating delays and flight cancellations at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport on July 19, 2024, in Austin, Texas. (Brandon Bell/Getty Images)",
      "Once connected, victims are often redirected to a fake login or landing page. In this case, the malicious portal requested passengers' email addresses, passwords, or even social media credentials under the pretense of granting access to the airline's entertainment system. The stolen information could then be used for account takeovers, identity theft, or further attacks.",
      "Why travel Wi-Fi is a prime target",
      "Travel creates a perfect storm for these kinds of attacks. Whether you're in a hotel, airport, cruise ship or airplane, you often have limited choices for getting online. Mobile data may be patchy or expensive, which pushes people toward the available Wi-Fi networks. Because these services feel official and are tied to trusted brands, travelers tend to assume they're safe and let their guard down when login requests pop up.",
      "Another trend adds to the risk. Travel providers are increasingly moving entertainment and services onto personal devices instead of offering built-in options. Airlines replace seatback screens with streaming portals, cruise lines promote app-based services and hotels direct guests to digital check-in platforms. All of these require a Wi-Fi connection, which means more people are logging on than ever before.",
      "QANTAS DATA BREACH EXPOSES MILLIONS OF CUSTOMER RECORDS",
      "How hackers trick you with fake in-flight Wi-Fi",
      "Here's how it worked in the Australian case. The attacker carried a portable hotspot onboard and named it to match the airline's official Wi-Fi network. Passengers, seeing the fake network with stronger signal strength, connected automatically. They were then taken to a counterfeit login page asking for personal details.",

      "YOUR DISCARDED LUGGAGE TAGS ARE WORTH MONEY TO SCAMMERS",
      "Why you need a VPN for in-flight Wi-Fi security",
      "One of the best defenses against rogue Wi-Fi is a Virtual Private Network, or VPN. A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet, making it far harder for attackers to intercept your data even if you connect to the wrong hotspot.",
      "There is a catch, though. In-flight Wi-Fi systems often require you to disable your VPN temporarily to access the onboard portal. Even then, a VPN remains an important safeguard. Once you have cleared the login page and, if you have paid, connected to the internet, enabling your VPN ensures that any browsing, messaging, or app traffic stays private.",

      "Before you even think about connecting to in-flight Wi-Fi, make sure your device has a strong antivirus installed. It's your first line of defense against malicious sites and apps that attackers may try to push through fake portals. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Most phones and laptops are set to reconnect automatically to familiar networks. This makes it easier for a fake hotspot with the same name to trick your device. Before you board, switch off auto-connect and manually choose the correct airline Wi-Fi.",
      "When browsing in-flight, check for the padlock icon in your browser's address bar. HTTPS encrypts the connection between your device and the website, making it harder for attackers on public Wi-Fi to intercept your data.",
      "Even with precautions, in-flight Wi-Fi should be treated as untrusted. Avoid logging in to sensitive accounts like online banking or work systems. Stick to light browsing, streaming or messaging until you're back on a secure connection.",
      "Outdated operating systems and apps often have security holes attackers exploit. Before your trip, install the latest updates on your phone, tablet or laptop. Many updates include security patches that protect you against known vulnerabilities.",
      "When possible, switch your device to airplane mode and then enable only Wi-Fi. This reduces exposure from other radios (like Bluetooth or cellular roaming) that attackers sometimes target on flights.",
      "Some fake in-flight portals use pop-ups or redirects designed to trick you into entering login details or clicking on malicious links. If a page asks for unnecessary information, like your full Social Security number, banking details or unrelated logins, treat it as a red flag. Close the page immediately and don\u2019t click.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The rise of evil twin attacks in the air is a reminder that convenience often comes with hidden risks. As airlines push more passengers toward in-flight Wi-Fi, attackers are finding ways to exploit that dependency. Next time you fly, think twice before blindly connecting to the first Wi-Fi network that pops up. Sometimes, the safest choice is to stay offline until you land.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "AI browsers are no longer just an idea; they're already here. Microsoft has built Copilot into Edge, OpenAI is testing a sandboxed browser in agent mode and Perplexity's Comet is one of the first to fully embrace the concept of browsing for you.",
      "This is agentic AI stepping into our daily routines, from searching and reading to shopping and clicking. Instead of simply assisting us, these tools are beginning to replace us.",
      "But with this shift comes a new era of digital deception. AI-powered browsers may promise convenience by handling shopping, emails and other tasks, yet research shows they can stumble into scams faster than humans ever could. This dangerous mix of speed and trust is what experts call Scamlexity, a complex, AI-driven scam landscape where your agent gets tricked, and you pay the price.",

      "Falling for the same old tricks",
      "AI browsers are not immune to classic scams. In fact, they can fall for them even faster. When researchers at Guardio Labs told an AI browser to buy an Apple Watch, it confidently completed the purchase on a fake Walmart store set up in minutes. It autofilled personal and payment details without hesitation. The scammer got the money, while the human never saw the red flags.",
      "AI browsers promise convenience, but security experts warn they can fall for online scams faster than humans. (David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Handling phishing emails from \"your bank\"",
      "Old phishing tactics also remain effective. In testing, researchers at Guardio Labs sent a fake Wells Fargo email to the AI browser. The browser clicked the malicious link with no verification and even helped the user fill out login credentials on the phishing page. By removing human intuition from the loop, the AI created a perfect trust chain that scammers could exploit.",
      "PromptFix: A modern AI injection scam",
      "The real danger comes from attacks designed specifically for AI. Researchers at Guardio Labs created PromptFix, a scam disguised as a CAPTCHA page. While humans would only see a checkbox, the AI agent read hidden malicious instructions in the page code. Believing it was \"helping,\" the AI clicked the button, triggering a download that could have been malware. This type of prompt injection bypasses human awareness and targets the AI's decision-making directly. Once compromised, the AI can send emails, share files or execute harmful tasks without the user ever knowing.",
      "The growing risks of AI browsers",
      "As agentic AI becomes mainstream, scams will scale at an alarming speed. Instead of fooling millions of people individually, attackers need only to compromise one AI model to reach millions at once. Security experts warn this is a structural risk, not just a phishing problem.",
      "Tips to protect yourself from AI browser scams",
      "AI browsers can save time, but they can also put you at risk if you rely on them too much. Use these practical steps to stay in control and reduce your chances of becoming a victim.",
      "Always double-check sensitive actions like purchases, downloads or logins. Keep final approval in your hands instead of letting the AI complete tasks on its own. This way, you prevent scammers from sneaking past your awareness.",
      "Scammers rely on exposed personal details to make their tricks more convincing. A trusted data removal service can help scrub your information from broker sites, reducing the chance that your AI agent hands over details that are already floating around online. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.

    "published": "Sat, 20 Sep 2025 06:37:34 -0400",
    "summary": "Expert tips for buying refurbished electronics reveal what to check before purchase, including warranty policies and seller reputation.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt the CyberGuy joins 'Fox & Friends' to share his tips to stay safe from online scammers and recent warnings on how AI toys can harm children.",
      "Buying refurbished electronics sounds like a no-brainer. You get the latest gadgets at a fraction of the cost while giving devices a second life, which is better for the environment. It seems like the perfect solution for those on a budget, but it isn't always that simple. Not every refurbished device is equal, and the fine print matters more than you think.",
      "Some sellers do a fantastic job restoring products, while others barely touch them before reselling. If you're considering refurbished tech, here are important lessons I wish I knew beforehand. These insights will help you make smarter choices, avoid headaches and get real value for your money.",

      "AMAZON'S SECRET RENEWED STORE DEALS: SAVE ON APPLE PRODUCTS, NINJA AIR FRYERS, SHARK VACUUMS AND MORE",
      "Researching a seller\u2019s track record is more important than chasing after the lowest refurbished price point. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Imo/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "1) Refurbished does not always mean like new",
      "In the tech industry, the label refurbished carries no uniform standard. From factory-certified devices that meet stringent quality checks to third-party refurbishments that address only surface-level defects, the range is vast. My experience shows that treating refurbished items as \"like new\" is a mistake. Many come with cosmetic blemishes or partially worn components, and some sellers stop at a basic reset and cleaning.",
      "The key is to scrutinize the seller's refurbishment process and request detailed specifications or photos to ensure the item is in good condition. Look for transparency about what has been repaired or replaced. A reputable refurbisher will disclose whether critical components such as screens, batteries or motherboards were replaced or simply tested.",
      "Pro tip: Many refurbishers use a grading system (A, B, C). Grade A means near new, Grade B usually has light scratches, while Grade C shows heavier wear. Knowing the grade helps set realistic expectations.",
      "2) Check the warranty and return policy",
      "One of the most overlooked yet critical aspects of buying refurbished electronics is the warranty and return policy. Through years of testing products, I've seen warranties vary wildly from generous 90-day coverage to none at all. A solid warranty is not just a formality; it's a reflection of the refurbisher's confidence in the quality of the product. Without it, you're taking a gamble.",
      "Industry best practices suggest opting for sellers who provide at least a 90-day warranty and a clear, no-hassle return window. I have consistently seen reliable refurbishers like Amazon Renewed, eBay Certified Refurbished and Back Market stand by their work with transparent policies.",
      "Also look at Apple Certified Refurbished and Dell Outlet, which are industry leaders for high-quality laptops, tablets and phones.",
      "3) Know the seller's reputation",
      "Not all sellers are equal when it comes to refurbished tech. My years covering consumer electronics have made it clear that choosing a reputable seller is more important than chasing the lowest price. Factory-certified refurbishers and authorized resellers tend to follow strict testing and quality control procedures. In contrast, independent sellers often vary in quality and reliability.",
      "I always emphasize researching the seller's history, reading verified customer reviews and ensuring they offer clear refurbishment guarantees. Established marketplaces and brand-certified stores provide additional layers of security, including dispute resolution mechanisms.",
      "Red flags include: vague warranty language, listings with only stock photos, \"open box\" items marketed as refurbished and any product sold \"as-is.\" If you see those, walk away.",
      "4) Don't forget accessories and packaging",
      "A less obvious but important consideration is the state of accessories and packaging. In industry practice, refurbished products rarely arrive in original packaging or with the full set of accessories. I've seen that some sellers ship devices with generic boxes and subpar third-party accessories or omit chargers and manuals altogether.",
      "If accessories are important to your workflow, don't assume they'll be included. Always verify the listing description and, when in doubt, ask the seller directly. Knowing exactly what comes in the box prevents surprises and ensures you don't have to hunt for compatible chargers or cables after the fact, potentially eroding any savings you initially gained.",
      "5) Battery life may not be the same",
      "A common misconception is that refurbished devices come with batteries that perform like new, but that's not the case. Batteries naturally degrade with use, and not all refurbishers replace them.",
      "Some sellers disclose battery replacement while others do not. It is critical to confirm whether the battery is new, tested or original. Otherwise, expect performance issues such as rapid discharge or failure to hold a charge. A device with a worn-out battery is rarely worth the lower upfront cost, as you'll likely need to replace the battery soon after purchase.",
      "SAVE UP TO 64% ON DYSON, DEWALT, ANKER, ADIDAS AND MORE DURING EBAY'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY SALE",
      "A good warranty and return policy are essential safeguards for choosing refurbished devices. (Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "6) Software updates and compatibility",
      "You should only use electronic items like phones, laptops, tablets and smartwatches as long as they're receiving software updates. Many might disagree with this, but the truth is that once software support ends, your device becomes vulnerable to all kinds of unpatchable security flaws. Some good brands known for reliable software support are Apple, Samsung, Google, MSI and Lenovo.",
      "Before purchasing, always verify that the device is still supported with regular updates. This information is often available on the manufacturer's website or through trusted tech resources.",
      "7) Test the device thoroughly after purchase",
      "Testing a refurbished device thoroughly upon arrival is a best practice I've recommended repeatedly in my writing. Even trusted sellers can occasionally miss a defect. I always advise checking every essential function, such as the screen, charging port, Wi-Fi, sound and camera, within the seller's return period. Many problems won't be obvious from photos or descriptions alone.",
      "Immediate testing ensures you catch issues early enough to return or replace the product without hassle. It's a small investment of time that prevents far bigger frustrations later.",
      "And don't forget to perform your own factory reset on\u00a0iPhone,\u00a0Android,\u00a0PC or Mac to ensure no old accounts, locks or data are lingering on the device. For Apple devices, make sure \"Find My iPhone\" has been disabled before purchase, or it may be unusable.",
      "8) Install strong antivirus software",
      "Refurbished devices can sometimes carry hidden risks, especially if the previous owner didn't wipe the device properly or if the seller missed deep software issues. Installing\u00a0 strong antivirus software is essential to protect your device from malware, spyware or other security threats that may be lurking.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "9) Use a password manager",
      "Security doesn't end with antivirus protection. Many refurbished devices come with pre-installed software or misconfigured settings that could expose you to risk. One of the smartest moves you can make is using a reliable password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "10) Know the real value of your savings",
      "Refurbished doesn't always mean a bargain. As a rule of thumb, expect to save 20-40% compared to new, depending on the brand, age and condition. If you're only saving 10-15%, the trade-off on warranty, lifespan or battery may not be worth it. Calculate the long-term cost, especially if you'll need to buy a new battery or accessories soon after.",
      "6 KITCHEN ITEMS THAT EXPERTS 'WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND' BUYING AT SECONDHAND SHOPS",
      "Refurbished products often arrive without original packaging or accessories, leaving buyers unprepared. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Bonus: The eco-friendly upside",
      "Every refurbished device purchased keeps one more gadget out of the landfill and reduces carbon emissions from manufacturing. Studies show buying refurbished can cut a product's carbon footprint nearly in half. That means you're not only saving money but also helping the planet.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Buying refurbished electronics can be a great way to save money and reduce e-waste. But it pays to be careful. By sticking with certified sellers, knowing what \"refurbished\" really means and insisting on warranties and clear return policies, you can protect both your wallet and your data.",

      "Opt for mobile boarding passes instead of printed ones. This removes the risk of discarded paper passes falling into the wrong hands.",
      "Avoid printing your full home address or primary phone number. Instead, use your name, a travel-only email and either a P.O. box or work address. You can even create a simple alias email just for travel, which forwards to your main inbox but keeps your real address private. This way, airlines and honest finders can still reach you without exposing sensitive personal details to scammers.",
      "For recommendations on private and secure email providers that offer alias addresses, visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Another way to protect yourself is by putting a small tracker inside your luggage, such as an\u00a0Apple AirTag or a\u00a0similar Bluetooth tracker. These devices connect to your phone and let you see where your bag is in near real-time. If your suitcase goes missing or ends up in the wrong place, you\u2019ll know faster than waiting for the airline to track it down.",
      "Place the tracker inside your bag rather than on the handle so it can\u2019t be easily removed. Check its location through your phone before leaving the airport, and keep an eye on it during layovers. While AirTags can\u2019t prevent someone from misusing an old luggage tag, they give you proof of where your bag actually is if you ever need to dispute a lost luggage claim or theft.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "While the luggage tag scam may not be widespread yet, it exploits a simple oversight that most travelers rarely consider. Until airlines and airports put better safeguards in place, the burden falls on passengers to protect their own information.

      "In a copy of Stefanik\u2019s letter reviewed by Fox News Digital, she accuses Doctors Without Borders, often known by its French acronym MSF, of having gone on a media offensive against U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, accusing the organization of \"orchestrated killing.\"",

      "Stefanik described several hostages who required specialized care. One hostage was being treated for cancer on Oct. 7. Another lost his hand during a grenade explosion at the Nova festival. A third was kidnapped while nine months pregnant and gave birth while held captive. \"None is included in MSF\u2019s \u2018humanitarian\u2019 advocacy,\" Stefanik said.",
      "Stefanik also called into question the \"extremist actions and rhetoric\" of MSF staff, which have led to criticism of the organization. In one case, after MSF lamented the death of a staffer who was killed in Gaza in June 2024; the Israel Defense Forces confirmed he was a rocket expert for Palestinian Islamic Jihad. In another, a staffer publicly called for Palestinians to \"fight and die as martyrs\" according to the French publication Le Journal du Dimanche in March 2024.",

      "\"This is not a matter of routine oversight,\" Stefanik concluded. \"It is a matter of national security, the protection of U.S. taxpayers and donors, and the defense of legitimate humanitarian organizations in one of the most dangerous conflict zones in the world. President Trump has made clear that the United States will never tolerate support for terrorist organizations in any form, and this case demands that same clarity and resolve.\"",

      "Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz criticized a United Nations report accusing Israel of genocide, warning that the Trump administration and Congress had tools at their disposal to sanction those behind it.",
      "The report, issued Tuesday by the United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory (COI), said, \"the State of Israel bears responsibility for the failure to prevent genocide, the commission of genocide, and the failure to punish genocide against the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.\"",
      "In a statement to Fox News Digital, Cruz said, \"This latest announcement by the United Nations is no different than any of the other antisemitic smears and libels that have been leveled against Israel in their ongoing response to Hamas' atrocities on Oct. 7.",
      "\"This campaign directly undermines American national security interests by eroding Israel's freedom of action against Hamas terrorists who killed Americans and fueling international lawfare against Israel, which will be turned against American servicemembers, and indeed American citizens in general. The Republican Trump administration and Republican Congress have developed tools and sanctions to deal with these threats, and they should be used against everyone involved in this travesty,' his statement concluded.",

      "Anne Bayefsky, director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust and president of Human Rights Voices, told Fox News Digital that \"the latest report of the U.N.\u2019s phony \u2018inquiry\u2019 promotes genocide \u2013 against Jews.\"",
      "Bayefsky said the report \"obscenely rationalizes the crimes against humanity committed by Hamas and other Palestinians on Oct. 7 as an understandable reaction to prior Israeli wrongs,\" and \"downgrades the mass murder, rape, torture, and trauma of Israelis by suggesting that not enough Jews were harmed to pose an \u2018existential threat\u2019 to Israel.\"",
      "Bayefsky said that the COI, which has previously been accused of omitting important facts from its reporting, \"makes zero recommendations for Hamas.\" She also said the report mentions the terror group\u2019s tunnel network, which was \"integral to the Oct. 7 atrocities,\" only \"in the context of criticizing Israel.\"",
      "Sen. Ted Cruz condemned the latest attack against Israel by the U.N.\u00a0 (Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)",
      "Salo Aizenberg, director of media watchdog group HonestReporting, pushed back on the COI report\u2019s assertion that Israel has \"impos[ed] measures intended to prevent births.\" He told Fox News Digital that, \"If Israel truly aimed to destroy Gaza\u2019s population, why did it allow WHO teams earlier in 2025 to vaccinate 603,000 children under age 10 \u2014 matching pre-Oct. 7 numbers?\"",

      "In its recommendations, the COI report specifically calls for Israel to \"ensure full, unimpeded access of humanitarian aid at scale\" and \"end the distribution of food aid through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.\" The report cites the commissioner-general of the controversial U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), who has called GHF \"an abomination\" and \"a death trap\" that is \"costing more lives than it saves.\"",
      "According to recent U.N. statistics, however, between July 21 and Aug. 18 there were double the number of deaths along U.N. convoy routes (576) as there were surrounding GHF sites (259).",
      "Hamas terrorists killed civilians, including women, children and the elderly, when they attacked Israel on Oct. 7.\u00a0 (Israel Defense Forces via AP)",
      "Additionally, only 14.5% of U.N. aid trucks sent into Gaza have reached their intended destinations since May due to armed looting and theft. During the same period, GHF has distributed 165 million meals to Palestinians at its secure distribution sites.",
      "GHF released a statement explaining that the COI published its report \"without ever contacting\" the organization, calling its statements \"falsehoods that could have been easily corrected had we been asked.\" GHF said there have been no shootings at its sites, and that claims, particularly that children have been shot, are \"not only false\" but \"reckless.\"",

      "While the COI currently casts specific blame on three Israeli officials for alleged genocide, COI member Chris Sidoti told the press on Monday, \"there are many, many statements by Israeli political and civilian leaders that incite genocide, and also by others, including some media commentators in Israel, that have been inciting genocide.\"",
      "St\u00e9phane Dujarric, spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, did not respond to questions on whether Sidoti\u2019s remarks were an attack on Israel\u2019s media.",

      "In response to press questions about the COI report, Guterres said that \"it is not in the attributions of the Secretary-General to do the legal determination of genocide. That belongs to the adequate judicial entities, namely, the International Court of Justice.\" Guterres said, \"the truth is that this is something that it is morally, politically, and legally intolerable.\"",
      "In a statement to Fox News Digital, a State Department spokesperson condemned the world body for the report: \"Accusing Israel of genocide is the height of hypocrisy. Oct. 7 was a genocidal event undertaken by a terrorist organization with openly genocidal ambitions. Israel went to war in self-defense and has consistently taken steps to minimize civilian casualties. That is not a genocide. This kind of equivocation by the U.N. is further evidence of its moral bankruptcy.",
      "The spokesperson confirmed that the U.S. did not provide funding to the COI, and would not preview sanctions against its members, but noted, \"Ensuring that foreign visitors to the United States do not pose a threat to U.S. national security or public safety remains a paramount priority of the U.S. government. Due to visa confidentiality and other considerations, we do not have anything to announce regarding these specific cases.\"",
      "Bayefsky, however, said that while \"U.S. law withholds funds for the COI, but clearly it has not had the intended impact.\" She argued it is \"high time\" to do a \"lot more to terminate the dangers that the U.N. and its COI pose to both the United States and Israel.\"",

      "\"It is not the government\u2019s job to bully talk show hosts off of the air. It is not the government\u2019s job to tell us what we can and cannot talk about,\" Mamdani said at a campaign event on Roosevelt Island in New York City, adding that the message sent by the sequence of events at ABC \u201cis a message that the First Amendment is no longer a right that can be counted on.\"",
      "Mamdani referred to \u201cthe responsibility that all of us have in this moment to showcase just how unacceptable these kinds of actions are, how unacceptable it is that we are living in a moment where Donald Trump\u2019s actions are the ones which determine whether or not we can enjoy that which we have taken for granted for so many years.\u201d",
      "He added that, \"We cannot be free if we are subservient to those who abuse power for their own ends,\" taking shots not only at Trump, but his two main competitors in the mayoral election, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams.",

The move came after Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr threatened to \u201ctake action\u201d against Disney and ABC over Kimmel\u2019s remarks.",
      "Following Carr\u2019s comments, Nexstar Media Group Inc. announced that the company\u2019s ABC affiliates would pre-empt \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d for the foreseeable future. Nexstar, which has more than 200 stations in the U.S., is waiting on FCC approval for a $6.2 billion acquisition of the media company Tegna.",
      "Kimmel\u2019s suspensions has sparked outrage from Democrats and free speech advocates who say the comedian was punished for saying things the administration disliked.",

      "While the court is deciding the case, a lower court ruling in favor of the commissioner in question, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, will remain on hold, the court said. That means she will not remain in office while the case is litigated.",
      "In weighing the case, the conservative-majority court will decide whether a key 1935 Supreme Court ruling called Humphrey's Executor v. United States, which upheld restrictions on the president's power to fire FTC members, should be overturned.",

      "Complaining about the court's growing number of decisions that grant emergency requests filed by the Trump administration, Kagan said that the process had been used \"to transfer government authority from Congress to the president, and thus to re-shape the nation's separation of powers.\"",
      "The court's actions would suggest the conservative majority is sympathetic to the Trump administration's arguments that the legal provisions restricting the president's ability to remove FTC members without cause unlawfully limit his powers under Article 2 of the Constitution.",

      "The sport\u2019s growing popularity has even captured the attention of athletes and celebrities like Eva Longoria, Derek Jeter, Jimmy Butler and Adam Levine.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like pickleball but kind of a little cooler,\u201d Levine told Jimmy Fallon in April on \u201cThe Tonight Show.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s super fun,\u201d the singer added, explaining he was first introduced to the sport by Michael Bubl\u00e9, his fellow coach on \u201cThe Voice,\u201d when they were vacationing together in Mexico.",
      "Padel differs from other racket sports in that the court is about one-third the size of a tennis court and is typically surrounded by a glass or mesh wall. The ball can be hit off the walls and even from outside the court, as players can exit the court through a door to return the ball. Players must have a teammate, as the sport can only be played in doubles.",
      "A big draw, fans say, is the community it fosters as well as the game\u2019s fast pace.",
      "\u201cWhat got me hooked is the community. I feel like I met a lot of my best friends here, so coming to see them specifically turned into my love for playing padel,\u201d Rachel Kuan, who's now a customer experiences employee at Reserve Padel, told \"TODAY.\"",
      "Santiago Gomez, who fell in love with the game while growing up in Acapulco, founded Padel Haus, a sprawling padel social and cultural hub located in New York City \u2014 and among the first dedicated padel courts in the U.S. Padel Haus has since opened more courts across the New York City area as well as in Atlanta, Nashville and Denver.",
      "\u201cA lot of Latinos were first \u2014 they were the first ones to come because they play the sport at home,\u201d Gomez said.",
      "\u201cAmericans didn\u2019t know about the sport when we first opened in 2022,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then after that, a lot of tennis players, former tennis players, former squash players \u2014 Americans \u2014 came and tried it for the first time and they fully converted to padel.\u201d",
      "Gomez estimates that about 70% of Padel Haus\u2019 members are from the U.S. while the remaining 30% hail from other countries. The growth has increased so significantly that there\u2019s now a waitlist for people looking to sign up.",
      "Fast pace 'keeps you hooked'",
      "In addition to the social aspect of the game, Gomez said it\u2019s addictive because of how fast-paced it can get compared to other racket sports.",
      "\u201c[In tennis], a ball passes you, your mind is wired to think that the point is over. But here, given the wall\u2019s in the back, you can still save the point. So you feel like a hero when you\u2019re catching a ball that you couldn\u2019t catch in tennis,\u201d Gomez said.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re still in the game, and that gives you [a] big dopamine rush and that\u2019s what keeps you hooked.\u201d",
      "The International Padel Federation is working on getting the sport included in the 2032 Olympics. But for some like Marnie Perez-Ochoa, the game has also become a point of cultural pride: her grandmother Yola Ramirez was a former professional tennis player from Mexico and her grandfather built padel courts for professional tournaments in Acapulco, .",
      "\u201cThe power of sport is so prevalent \u2014 it\u2019s just now getting started in the States. You see it in Mexico. It already boomed in Europe \u2014 Spain in particular. So I\u2019m really excited to see where it\u2019s going to go in the States. And I think it\u2019s really beautiful that it started in Mexico,\u201d Perez-Ochoa said."

      "Could Laura Ever Have Been a Good Mother-in-Law?",
      "A turning point in \u201cThe Girlfriend\u201d comes when Laura makes up a lie to try and get rid of Cherry for good. After Daniel gets into an accident, she tells Cherry he\u2019s died, but he\u2019s actually on the mend.",
      "Was she destined to despise the woman Daniel brought home? Frances, who was raising her young children while she was writing \u201cThe Girlfriend,\u201d thinks Laura would \u201calways find fault\u201d with a potential romantic partner.",
      "But \u201cshe probably would have been more accepting with some people who played the game a little bit differently,\u201d Frances says. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly an essence of snobbery about Laura, not necessarily from where Cherry comes from, that because she lies about where she comes from.\u201d",
      "She thinks Laura\u2019s personality is a result of the loss of her daughter, Rose. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if she\u2019s looking for a Rose replacement\u201d in a daughter-in-law, she says.",
      "Can Daniel Be Blamed for the Ending?",
      "\u201cThe Girlfriend\u201d hurtles toward conflict as Laura and Cherry circle each other like adversaries. Meanwhile, Daniel watches on, somewhat clueless.",
      "How much can Daniel and his conflict avoidance be blamed for what comes next?",
      "\u201cI think he is probably subconsciously ignoring a lot of the conflict because he just doesn\u2019t want to deal with it. It isn\u2019t until it\u2019s too late that he sort of wakes up to the fact that, oh s---, this is actually quite serious,\u201d Frances says.",

      "How the Book\u2019s Ending Compares to the Show",
      "Warning: Spoilers continue from here.",
      "The toxic triangle of \u201cThe Girlfriend\u201d concludes differently depending on whether it\u2019s in book or TV form.",
      "In both, Cherry, Daniel and Laura gather for a showdown at Laura\u2019s house. Laura is trying to convince Daniel that his girlfriend is dangerous and has some compelling evidence. (Her actions in the book are especially gruesome and involve killing a puppy \u2014 seriously).",
      "Frances knew, while writing, one of them wasn\u2019t going to make it out alive, but she didn\u2019t know who.",
      "\u201cIt was really interesting, because it could have been any one of the three,\u201d she says. \u201cAs I wrote it, I did not know. I was just kind of playing out, playing out and seeing what happened on the pages.\u201d",
      "Laura emerges victorious in the book. Cherry charges at her and Laura steps out of the way, but also subtly pushes her out the window.",
      "The ending is far different in the show, and the changes were star, director and executive producer Wright\u2019s idea. After seeing Laura and Cherry wrestling in Laura\u2019s home pool, Daniel jumps in and drowns his own mother. This leaves Cherry alive, and after a one-year time jump, viewers see she's pregnant with Daniel\u2019s baby at the end of the series.",
      "\u201cI would say maybe she\u2019s won the battle. Maybe not the war,\u201d Frances says of Cherry. \u201cThese things tend to come back and bite you on the bum, don\u2019t they, in some form or another?\u201d",
      "Frances says the calculation also had to do with the potential continuation of the story (which, as of the writing of this article, has not been renewed).",
      "\u201cWell, if you have a Series 2, how\u2019s that going to work? If we have a series, you\u2019re thinking, 'OK, which one of these do you want to keep alive the most?'\u201d she says.",
      "Frances\u2019 Writing Obsession",
      "Frances has followed up \u201cThe Girlfriend\u201d with other novels including \u201cThe Temp,\u201d about an ambitious woman who fills in for a maternity leave, and \u201cThe Boyfriend,\u201d about a woman doubting her new relationship.",
      "She says her books all have a connective tissue \u2014\u00a0beyond the unexpected twists.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the wealth divide. That gulf between the very, very rich and those who are struggling just to keep afloat, and how unfair all that is,\u201d she says.",
      "\"It bothers me more and more and more as we go on. It\u2019s just heading so far in one direction It\u2019s actually quite terrifying,\" she says."

      "The Grammy-winning songwriter was among three people who died Sept. 18 after a small plane crashed near Franklin, North Carolina.",
      "James wrote a number of Underwood\u2019s hit songs like \u201cJesus, Take the Wheel,\u201d which earned him his first Grammy win, \u201cFlat On the Floor\u201d and \u201cCowboy Casanova,\" among others.",
      "Sharing photos of them together, Underwood called his death \u201cunfathomable.\u201d On Instagram on Sept. 19, she wrote that the loss is \u201ctoo great to put into words,\u201d before reflecting on their time together.",
      "\u201cBrett was the epitome of \u2018cool.\u2019 I see him in my mind riding up to my cabins to write on his motorcycle\u2026 his hair somehow perfectly coiffed despite being under a helmet for however long,\u201d Underwood wrote. \u201cI always loved hearing him sing \u2018Cowboy Casanova\u2019 because a sassy girl anthem should\u2019ve sounded ridiculous coming from a macho dude like him, but somehow, he even made that cool.\u201d",
      "The \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d winner described his as a \u201cgood guy.\" She recalled one time when he had already written 75% of a song for her but insisted that they split the credit.",
      "\u201cWe filled in the blanks and added a little melody and I told him after that I didn\u2019t feel right splitting the credit evenly when he did most of the work. He wouldn\u2019t have it,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe insisted that everything be equal. He was just that kind of guy.\u201d",
      "Underwood wrote that James \u201cloved the Lord\u201d and remembered singing with James at church. She added that her favorite songs to sing that they created together were the ones they wrote about Jesus \u201cbecause the thoughts and feelings behind them are so genuine and pure.\u201d",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t ever sing one note of them again without thinking of him. Brett\u2019s passing is leaving a hole in all of us that I fear won\u2019t ever go away,\u201d Underwood wrote. \u201cIt will forever be a reminder that this life is but a moment\u2026we have to make the most of each day we\u2019re given here on earth.\u201d",
      "She concluded her message by acknowledging that each day is a gift and asking for prayers for James' family, friends and \u201call of us that were blessed enough to know Brett. Love you, man. I\u2019ll see you again someday.\u201d",
      "In a statement to NBC News, the North Carolina State Highway Patrol said that it responded to a plane crash around 3 p.m. on Sept. 18. Upon arrival, all three people, identified as Brett James Cornelius, the artist\u2019s full name, Melody Carole and Meryl Maxwell Wilson, were pronounced dead at the scene.",
      "Upon news of his death, the music industry and those who worked with James have expressed their condolences on social media.",
      "Kathie Lee Gifford, who co-wrote \u201cHe Saw Jesus\u201d with James and dedicated it to late husband Frank Gifford, paid tribute on X, writing, \"He lit a fire in my heart again for music and we wrote many songs together, including the song we wrote about my husband Frank\u2019s death, HE SAW JESUS.\"",
      "\"It comforts me to know that that\u2019s exactly what happened to Brett as well, the moment he left this earth for the glory of eternal life,\" Gifford said.",
      "Jason Aldean, Dierks Bentley, Bobby Bones and many others also honored the late songwriter."

    "summary": "U.S. allies called an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Monday after a series of incidents raised alarm about Russian threats to NATO.",
    "story": [
      "Drones over Poland. Fighter jets above Estonia. Surveillance planes over the Baltic Sea.",
      "To U.S. allies in Europe, the pattern is unmistakable: A deliberate campaign of escalation from the Kremlin, designed to probe NATO\u2019s defenses and political resolve.",
      "The question hanging over an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Monday is how exactly the alliance will respond.",
      "As NATO struggles to turn alarm into action, officials and analysts urged a more forceful response and warned that hesitation risks emboldening  Russian President Vladimir Putin. But questions about U.S. support, escalation risks and what this growing threat means for Ukraine remain unresolved.",
      "Estonia, which called for the Security Council meeting after three Russian MiG-31 fighter aircraft entered its airspace for 12 minutes without permission last week, pressed members to address what it described as a \u201cblatant, reckless, and flagrant violation of NATO airspace\u201d and Russia\u2019s \u201crepeated violations of international law.\u201d",
      "Russia\u2019s actions \u201cundermine principles vital to the security of all U.N. member states,\u201d Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said Sunday in a post on X.",
      "Claims that Russia violated Estonian airspace were \"baseless\" and \"aimed at escalating tensions,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday, adding that Russia operated within international regulations.",
      "So far, NATO\u2019s response has largely been limited to meeting rooms as Moscow's probing exposes a contrast between European leaders\u2019 urgent calls for action and President Donald Trump\u2019s more muted response.",
      "Asked by reporters Sunday whether Washington would come to the defense of Poland and the Baltic states if Russia attacks, Trump said: \"Yeah I would.\"",
      "And on Monday Mike Walz, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations told the Security Council meeting that the events left \u201cthe impression either Russia wants to escalate or doesn\u2019t have full control of its fighter planes and drones.\u201d Either scenario, he said, was \u201cvery disconcerting.\u201d",
      "The U.S. \u201cwill defend every inch of NATO territory,\u201d he said, adding that he expected \u201cRussia to seek ways to de escalate, not risk expansion.\u201d",
      "At the same meeting, Britain\u2019s Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper also warned that Russia\u2019s incursions into NATO territory risked triggering an armed conflict.",
      "\u201cYour reckless actions risk direct armed confrontation between NATO and Russia. Our alliance is defensive but be under no illusion we stand ready to defend NATO\u2019s skies and NATO\u2019s territory,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we need to confront planes operating in NATO space without permission then we will do so,\u201d she added.",
      "This drew an immediate rebuke from Moscow, which dismissed Europe\u2019s concerns as groundless and hysterical.",
      "NATO's response to this ratcheting Russian activity amounts to the launch of operation \"Eastern Sentry\" earlier this month to bolster the defense of Europe\u2019s eastern flank in response to a series of Russian drone incursions over Poland.",
      "After Germany and Sweden scrambled fighter jets Sunday to intercept and track a Russian surveillance plane flying unidentified over the Baltic Sea, one regional leader said Russia was not just testing NATO\u2019s response, but was also aiming to reduce support for Ukraine by compelling countries to redirect resources.",
      "Calibrating how to respond to Russia was not easy, Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics said on social media, adding that Russia was doing just enough not to cross a red line.",
      "European confidence about backing from Washington has been shaken by Ukraine, where Trump has so far stopped short of imposing his promised punishment of further sanctions on the Kremlin for refusing peace talks.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that he was preparing for an \u201cintense week\u201d at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, where he hopes to build support for efforts to stop Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "Ukraine has also submitted a request to attend the Security Council meeting and present its position.",
      "But Europe's security will require decisive action, and that will not happen at a Security Council meeting, \u201cfor the very simple reason that Russia has a veto on the council,\u201d said Keir Giles, a senior fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank",
      "Unable to rely on Trump\u2019s \u201cshifting position\u201d on Russia, Giles told NBC News, the \"coalition of the willing\" \u2014 European nations that say they are prepared to underwrite security guarantees for Ukraine \u2014 must become the \u201ccoalition of the able and actually doing something.\u201d",
      "Poland will not hesitate to shoot down objects that violate its airspace and pose a threat, its prime minister said Monday. But, he said, his country would take a more cautious approach when dealing with situations that are less clear-cut, and would need to know it had its allies' support.",
      "\"You really need to think twice before deciding on actions that could trigger a very acute phase of conflict,\u201d Donald Tusk told a news conference.",
      "Hesitation, analysts said, risks sending a dangerous signal.",
      "\u201cEurope and NATO have to show the will to respond forcefully to Russia,\u201d said Moritz Brake, a senior fellow at the Center for Advanced Security, Strategic and Integration Studies.",
      "\u201cRussia is trying to gauge whether it\u2019s possible to single out individual elements of the alliance,\u201d he said in a phone interview.",
      "A forceful approach, Brake argued, would involve not just intercepting Russian aircraft, but also sending \u201cmanned fighter jets\u201d that could shoot Russian jets down \u201cat any minute.\u201d",
      "As an example, he pointed to 2015, when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian warplane seconds after it violated the country\u2019s airspace near the Syrian border. Moscow did not retaliate militarily.",
      "\u201cRussia didn\u2019t declare war on Turkey,\u201d Brake said. \u201cWavering is much more dangerous than a forceful approach.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A Palestinian state is getting a powerful new push.",
      "Dozens of world leaders will gather Monday to rally support for a two-state solution, with the United States and Israel set to boycott the summit as they find themselves increasingly isolated by a rising tide of traditional allies responding to Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip.",
      "The summit, convened by France and Saudi Arabia, comes after the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Portugal all announced their formal recognition of the state of Palestine on Sunday, with several other nations expected to follow suit at the United Nations General Assembly this week.",
      "These Western powers may be hoping to breathe new life into the idea as a way to resolve the conflict, but Israel's hard-line government has instead vowed to retaliate while pressing ahead with its deadly assault on Gaza City that has forcibly displaced hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.",
      "Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon said both Israel and the U.S. would boycott Monday's summit, branding it a \"circus.\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decried the moves as a \"huge reward to terrorism\" and vowed there \"will be no Palestinian state.\"",
      "A source briefed on the Israeli cabinet\u2019s discussions said Israel would not respond before Netanyahu met with Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to do anything without the backing of the U.S., they said.",
      "The Trump administration has also warned of possible repercussions for countries taking measures against Israel, including France, whose President Emmanuel Macron was expected to officially recognize Palestine later Monday, according to Reuters.",
      "Hopes for a two-state solution have dwindled in the midst of Israel's nearly two-year offensive in Gaza \u2014 and as efforts to negotiate a ceasefire to end the war and free the remaining hostages have repeatedly failed.",
      "Palestinian statehood, which would see an internationally recognized state in territories seized by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War, is now formally recognized by around 75% of U.N. member countries. But that recognition remains largely symbolic.",
      "Gershon Baskin, an Israeli who has acted as a mediator with Hamas for decades and a staunch advocate of a two-state solution, said that he welcomed the growing recognition. But without further action, including sanctions against Israel, he said the move will do little to \"change the lives of Palestinians\" on the ground.",
      "\"It's really a step in the right direction,\" Baskin said in a phone interview Monday of the summit at the General Assembly. But, calling Israel's offensive in Gaza \"a genocide,\" he said, \"the most important thing now ... is to end the war in Gaza and that comes before everything else.\"",
      "It is unclear how effective Monday\u2019s summit will be in advancing efforts to end the war in the face of furious opposition from Israel and the U.S., which blocked Palestinian officials from even attending the U.N. gathering.",
      "Baskin noted the possibility of retaliation from Israel in response to the diplomatic moves by France, the U.K. and others, with far-right members of Netanyahu's government pushing for the annexation of part of the occupied West Bank.",
      "Speaking with the BBC ahead of Monday's summit, British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said she had directly warned her Israeli counterpart against such a move.",
      "Baskin warned that any \"annexation steps by Israel, which would be illegal against international law\" would only result in further isolation of the country on the international stage.",
      "\u201cThis conflict has to be resolved \u2014 and the only way to resolve it is through the two-state solution,\u201d he said.",
      "Palestinians in the West Bank also welcomed the growing international recognition, but said more must be done.",

      "\"We're trying to get it back,\" Trump said of Bagram during a news conference Thursday alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer that capped a whirlwind state visit to the United Kingdom.",
      "Taking aim at the Biden administration's fraught withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan as a \"total disaster,\" Trump criticized the decision to relinquish Bagram Airfield, which quickly fell under the control of the Taliban as they swept back into power in 2021.",
      "\"We gave it to them for nothing,\" said Trump, who has long criticized the Biden administration's handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. \"We want that base back,\" he said.",
      "About an hour's drive north of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, Bagram served for years as a crucial hub in the war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda. At its peak around 2012, the sprawling airfield saw more than 100,000 U.S. troops pass through its compound.",
      "Late Thursday, Zakir Jalaly, an official at the Afghan Foreign Ministry, dismissed the idea of Bagram returning to the U.S.",
      "\u201cAfghanistan and the U.S. need to interact with each other and can have economic and political relations based on mutual respect and common interests,\u201d Jalaly said on the social platform X. \u201cThe Afghans have not accepted a military presence in history, and this possibility was completely rejected during the Doha talks and agreement, but the door is open for further interaction.\u201d",
      "Trump made clear at least one motivating factor for his interest in reclaiming Bagram, noting its proximity to rival superpower China.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons,\u201d Trump said during his comments Thursday, which came a day before he was spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping amid ongoing trade negotiations.",
      "Addressing journalists later on Air Force One, Trump said Bagram was \"one of the most powerful bases in the world in terms of runway strength and length,\" adding: \"You could land anything there.\" He emphasized again that the base was \"an hour away from where they make their missiles \u2014 China.\"",
      "Addressing Trump's comments Friday, Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that China \"respects Afghanistan\u2019s independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.",
      "\"Afghanistan\u2019s future should be decided by its own people,\" Lin said, adding: \"Stirring up tension and creating confrontation in the region won\u2019t be popular.\"",
      "China, which has made strides in rapidly expanding its nuclear stockpile, is estimated to have accumulated about 600 warheads, according to the Chicago-based nonprofit Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.",
      "Of course, greater surveillance on China wouldn't be the only advantage to regaining Bagram.",
      "A presence at the base could also aid in regional counterterrorism efforts, among other factors that could appeal to Trump.",
      "It remains unclear to what extent, if any, the U.S. has been in talks with the Taliban on the future of Bagram.",
      "\u201cEven if the Taliban considered this, China most certainly would do everything it can to entice the Taliban to keep the U.S. out of Afghanistan and has far more leverage and enticements to make this happen,\" Bill Roggio, editor of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\u2019 Long War Journal, cautioned in comments shared online Thursday.",
      "\"The Trump administration should be very careful not to grant the Taliban concessions only to be prevented access to Bagram in the end,\" he said.",
      "The Taliban have been working to rehabilitate their global standing, with the militant group freeing American George Glezmann, a Delta Air Lines mechanic, in March amid efforts to normalize relations between Afghanistan and the U.S.",
      "On Friday, the Taliban also released British couple Barbie Reynolds, 76, and her husband, Peter Reynolds, 80, who were detained by the Interior Ministry in February, according to Sky News, NBC News' sister outlet in the United Kingdom.",
      "Trump's comments came as the Pentagon continues to push ahead with a review into the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, during which 13 U.S. service members and 170 Afghans were killed at Kabul's airport in a bombing by the Islamic State terrorist group.",
      "Trump, who began the process for the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan during his first term, has been a fierce critic of the Biden administration's handling of the drawdown.",
      "The White House under President Joe Biden largely blamed the Trump administration for the chaotic withdrawal, with a National Security Council report released in 2023 arguing that Biden's options for executing the operation were \"severely constrained by conditions created by his predecessor.\""

      "Speculation had gone into overdrive prior to the announcement, with experts wondering whether Masaryk may have conveyed a fateful warning before Europe's descent back into war. His words are believed to have been dictated to his son Jan, surviving both World War II and subsequent communist rule.",
      "Jan\u2019s former secretary handed the envelope to the National Archives in 2005 on the condition that it not be opened for another 20 years.",
      "Even the Masaryk family did not know what mystery the white envelope contained. But when it was opened early Friday, it still managed to surprise.",
      "Inside was another yellow envelope, containing five pages of handwritten notes in Czech and English (Masaryk's wife, Charlotte Garrigue, was born in the United States.)",
      "Rather than a final message before his death in 1937, experts assessed that the message was instead dictated three years earlier.",
      "\u201cI am ill, seriously ill \u2014 it is the end, but I am not afraid. You will continue the work, you know how, but you must be careful. You know how to behave; I don\u2019t need to tell you anything more,\u201d the letter read, according to the country's official broadcaster.",
      "At the time, Masaryk was gravely ill after a stroke, and those around him thought his days were numbered.",
      "Masaryk became the first president of Czechoslovakia in 1918 after it declared independence from the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was defeated in World War I. He served until 1935. Jan became foreign minister at the end of World War II, until his sudden death in 1948.",
      "In the envelope, Masaryk talked extensively about his death and subsequent funeral and reflected on the complex political situation in the ethnically diverse country.",
      "As well as derisive comments about a Slovak politician, he urged keeping the German minority part of the state. \u201cGive them what they deserve, but no more,\u201d he said of the Germans, according to the state broadcaster.",
      "\u201c[This was a] crucial time in Czechoslovakia with Hitler just coming to power in Germany,\u201d said Mark Cornwall, an emeritus professor of modern European history at the University of Southampton in England.",
      "\u201cIt was a very turbulent period in Europe about what was going to happen,\u201d said Cornwall, nodding to the Nazis' subsequent annexation of the Sudetenland, a Czech region that had a significant German-speaking population, and the later outbreak of World War II.",
      "\u201cMasaryk is still very revered\u201d in the country, Cornwall told NBC News in a telephone interview. \u201cI can\u2019t think of an American equivalent. Perhaps he\u2019s George Washington or Abraham Lincoln.\u201d"

      "The email was published in two newspapers Sunday. It was sent by the duchess \u2014 the former wife of Prince Andrew, the Duke of York \u2014 in 2011, just weeks after she had publicly distanced herself from Epstein.",
      "A spokesperson for the duchess said the email was sent to counter a threat Epstein had made to sue her for defamation.",
      "But the duchess was dropped as a patron of several U.K. charities after the email was published. Both cited her correspondence with Epstein as the reason.",

      "In a 2011 interview, the duchess said her involvement with Epstein \u2014 who was jailed in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor \u2014 had been a \u201cgigantic error of judgment,\u201d promising she would never have anything to do with him again.",

      "But the Natasha Allergy Research Foundation, a food allergy charity, said in a statement to NBC News that it was \u201cdisturbed to read\u201d Ferguson\u2019s correspondence with Epstein and that it would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d for her to continue to be associated with the charity.",
      "A spokesperson for Julia\u2019s House, a children\u2019s hospice charity, also said it would be \u201cinappropriate for her to continue as a patron,\u201d and several other charities lso dropped the duchess.",

      "BRUSSELS \u2014 A cyberattack on a provider of check-in and boarding systems disrupted operations on Saturday at several major European airports including London\u2019s Heathrow, the continent\u2019s busiest, causing flight delays and cancellations.",
      "The disruption is the latest in a string of increasingly sophisticated cyber and ransomware attacks targeting governments and companies across the world, hitting sectors from healthcare and defence to retail and autos. A recent breach at luxury carmaker Jaguar Land Rover brought its production to a halt.",
      "Collins Aerospace, which provides systems for several airlines at airports globally, is experiencing a technical issue that may cause delays for departing passengers, Heathrow said.",
      "Brussels Airport and Berlin Airport were also affected, they said separately. Hours later, Dublin Airport said it was also facing minor impact from the issue, along with Cork Airport, Ireland\u2019s second biggest after Dublin.",
      "Collins Aerospace\u2019s parent company, said it was aware of a \u201ccyber-related disruption\u201d to its MUSE software at selected airports, without naming them.",
      "ELECTRONIC CHECK-IN IMPACTED",
      "\u201cThe impact is limited to electronic customer check-in and baggage drop and can be mitigated with manual check-in operations,\u201d RTX said in an emailed statement, adding that it was working to fix the issue as quickly as possible. It did not give any information on who might be behind the attack.",
      "A spokesperson for the European Commission said there were currently no indications of a \u201cwidespread or severe attack\u201d and that the origin of the incident was still under investigation.",
      "At Heathrow, Berlin and Brussels, 29 departures and arrivals have been cancelled so far, aviation data provider Cirium said. In total, 651 departures were scheduled from Heathrow, 228 from Brussels and 226 from Berlin on Saturday.",
      "These kinds of sweeping outages are typically the result either of ransomware attacks, where online extortionists paralyse corporate networks in the hope of payment, or deliberate sabotage.",
      "Hisham Al Assam, who teaches computer science at the University of Buckingham, said the incident underscored how the use of common digital infrastructure can lead to \u201csingle points of failure\u201d.",
      "\u201cSuch models turn efficiency into fragility, where a single compromise can disrupt several airlines at once,\u201d he said.",
      "Several breach-tracking websites have previously said that Collins Aerospace was hit by ransom-seeking hackers in 2023. The company did not return a message seeking comment on those allegations or details about Saturday\u2019s incident.",
      "DELAYS AND CANCELLATIONS",
      "Germany\u2019s federal office for information security, the BSI, said it was in touch with Berlin Airport over \u201cinfrastructure disruptions\u201d as a result of an outage affecting a global system for handling passengers.",
      "Britain\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre said it was working with Collins Aerospace and affected UK airports to fully understand the incident\u2019s impact.Brussels Airport said on its website it was having to use manual check-in and boarding procedures, adding the incident occurred on Friday night.",
      "\u201cThis has a large impact on the flight schedule and will unfortunately cause delays and cancellations,\u201d it said.",
      "The airport said that 10 flights had been cancelled so far, with an average delay of one hour for all departing flights.",
      "PASSENGERS LEFT IN THE DARK",
      "Passengers with a flight scheduled for Saturday were advised by the affected airports to confirm their travel with airlines before heading to the airport.",
      "Tereza Pultarova, a journalist, spoke to BBC News from inside Heathrow, where she was due to fly to Amsterdam at 6:30 a.m. for a connecting flight to Cape Town.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the airline I\u2019m with ... they don\u2019t have a service desk here, so we\u2019ve been left in the dark,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been great chaos, and it\u2019s been quite ... frustrating for most people here.\u201d",
      "Berlin Airport said on its website that there were longer waiting times at check-in and it was working on a quick solution. Frankfurt Airport, Germany\u2019s largest, was not affected, a spokesperson said.",
      "At Berlin Airport, Kim Reisen told Reuters there was a lack of clarity, with passengers only informed that there was \u201ca technical fault\u201d.",
      "Another traveller, Siegfried Schwarz, said: \u201cI ... find it inexplicable that, with today\u2019s technology, there\u2019s no way to defend yourself against something like that.\u201d",
      "EasyJet, among Europe\u2019s biggest airlines, said it was operating as normal and did not expect the issue to impact its flights for the rest of the day.",
      "Ryanair and British Airways owner IAG did not immediately respond to requests for comment.U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines  said it expected minimal impact, adding it had implemented a workaround to minimise disruption. United Airlines said the issue was \u201ccausing minor departure delays,\u201d but it had not cancelled any flights.",
      "British transport minister Heidi Alexander said she was receiving regular updates on the situation."

      "A series of unprecedented Russian incursions into NATO members' airspace in recent weeks has raised the alarm across Europe, which is looking towards an emboldened Kremlin for clues to its intentions and next moves.",
      "The incidents have also exposed a contrast between European leaders' urgent calls for action and President Donald Trump's more muted response, as he continues to hold back on imposing additional sanctions on Moscow as its war on Ukraine rages on.",
      "On Friday, for the second time in 10 days, a NATO ally invoked Article 4 following airspace violations linked to Russia \u2014 a mechanism that prompts urgent talks among allies and that had only been triggered seven times in its 76-year history before this month.",
      "Earlier in the day, three MiG-31 fighter aircraft entered Estonian airspace without permission and remained there for a total of 12 minutes, according to the country's Ministry of Defense. NATO aircraft intercepted the jets, the military alliance\u2019s spokesperson Allison Hart said.",
      "Estonia's Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna called the incursion \"unprecedentedly brazen,\" saying Russia had already violated its airspace four times this year.",
      "It was \u201can extremely dangerous provocation,\u201d added Kaja Kallas, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief.",
      "Russia denied violating Estonian airspace, saying aircraft were making a scheduled flight from from Russia to Kaliningrad, an exclave wedged between Poland and Lithuania, that was conducted in \u201cstrict compliance\u201d with international regulations.",
      "While European leaders have responded with urgency, signaling deep concern and pushing for stronger measures on Moscow amid Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, President Donald Trump has struck a more restrained note as he continues to hold back on imposing further sanctions on the Kremlin.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t love it,\u201d Trump said Friday on the latest incursion. \u201cI don\u2019t like when that happens. Could be big trouble.\u201d",
      "Although Trump has expressed frustration and disappointment with Putin, saying on Thursday that the Russian leader \u201chas let me down,\u201d relations with the Kremlin have warmed dramatically during this administration.",
      "Trump has also been unwilling to impose further sanctions on Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, despite repeated threats.",
      "The President said last week he was \"ready to do major sanctions on Russia,\" once NATO nations had \"agreed, and started, to do the same thing,\" and criticized allies for continuing to purchase Russian oil.",
      "Estonia and the United States are members of NATO, which at its core is a mutual defense pact formed after World War II to counter the threat posed by the Soviet Union, meaning an attack on one may be considered an attack on all.",
      "Friday's incident marked the third incursion into NATO airspace linked to Russia in ten days.",
      "On Sept. 10, Poland reported Russian drones entering its territory, triggering the first Article 4 request this month. Four days later, Romania scrambled jets to respond to a Russian drone breach. Romania did not invoke Article 4.",
      "Moscow downplayed the incident, saying it had \u201cno plans to target\u201d facilities in Poland, but Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said it was \u201cthe closest we have been to open conflict since World War II.\u201d",
      "Trump, again, offered a more muted response, saying the suspected incursion \"could have been a mistake.\"",
      "His acting U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Dorothy Shea, sought to reassure allies. Violating the airspace of a U.S. ally, \u201cintentionally or otherwise,\u201d showed \u201cimmense disrespect for good-faith U.S. efforts to bring an end to this conflict,\u201d she told the U.N. Security Council.",
      "\"Rest assured, we will defend every inch of NATO territory,\" she added.",
      "Moscow has not commented on the Romanian claims.",
      "Brett Erickson, a sanctions expert and adviser to Loyola University\u2019s Chicago School of Law, warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin was testing the West\u2019s resolve, and battlefield readiness.",
      "\u201cIf the West hesitates, Russia will keep testing, probing, and collecting data on our response,\u201d he told NBC News via email. \u201cEvery incursion is a rehearsal. Unless we act decisively now, we are training Moscow to believe NATO is predictable, divided, and slow.\u201d",
      "The divergence between Europe's urgent stance and Trump's restraint comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pressed Washington for stronger measures, who has urged Trump to take a clearer position on Moscow.",
      "\"If the war continues and there are no movements towards peace, we expect sanctions,\" he told reporters Friday evening, adding that he expects Trump to take such actions.",
      "Russian air strikes killed at least three people and wounded dozens more as it launched a large-scale missile and drone attack across multiple Ukrainian regions on Friday night.",
      "Poland said it scrambled jets overnight to ensure \"maximum readiness\" and safety in areas bordering the parts of Ukraine under attack.",
      "Loyala's Erickson said sanctions were essential, and must be \u201call-out\u201d and \u201call-together,\u201d urging Washington to align with its allies.",

    "summary": "After it was barred from the Eurovision Song Contest Russia is reviving a Soviet-era version of the camp competition.",
    "story": [
      "Perhaps the Eurovision ban is starting to bite, because three years after Russia was booted from the beloved song contest following the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, it is reviving a Soviet-era version of the camp competition.",
      "The Intervision Song Contest will see 23 artists from around the world \u2014 including one representing the U.S. \u2014 offer a heady mix of musical styles, from moody Belarusian pop to Colombian folk and high-energy Vietnamese rap at an arena in the capital of Moscow on Saturday night.",
      "Unlike the Eurovision Song Contest, which mainly includes European countries and a few others like Australia and Israel, Intervision bills itself as a truly global event by offering artists from countries around the world, including those in the Global South, a chance to compete for the top prize of 30 million rubles (roughly $360,000).",
      "\u201cBack in the Soviet times, the government would decide to promote a positive image of Russia abroad. We need to promote an objective image. We want to be known with all our merits and shortcomings,\u201d Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told a news conference this week in response to a presubmitted question from NBC News.",
      "Asked whether Russia was using the competition as an exercise in soft power, he replied, \u201cIf by soft power you mean the opportunity to let people know about us, then of course we\u2019re interested in this.\u201d",
      "A pop phenomenon drawing around 160 million viewers each May, Eurovision began at the height of the Cold War in 1956 as a technical experiment to try and broadcast a simultaneous program across the member stations of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).",
      "A divided continent had mirror organizations like the NATO defense alliance in Western Europe and the Warsaw Pact in Eastern Europe, and the EBU in the West matched by the International Radio and Television Organisation (OIRT) on the other side of the Iron Curtain.",
      "In answer to Eurovision came Intervision, which was broadcast by the OIRT on several occasions between 1965 and 1980, with contests held in what was then Czechoslovakia and later in Poland.",
      "But Dean Vuletic, who has written and edited books on Eurovision and led a research project on Intervision, says Russia is getting its history wrong with the relaunch, \u201cpresenting Intervision as something that was Russian- or Soviet-led, but it actually wasn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Instead, he said, the competitions \u201cweren\u2019t that focused on the Soviet participants,\u201d although they had to be invited. Having studied the archives of Czech and Polish TV stations, he said it was \u201castonishing how critical they are of the Soviet participants.\u201d",
      "He added that it was actually created during a period of liberalization in an attempt \u201cto promote East-West cooperation in popular music and television,\u201d and Western performers like Gloria Gaynor were invited to perform in the intervals. Performers from Eastern Europe were also hoping to be signed by Western labels, he added.",
      "Before it was kicked out in 2022 after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Russia was frequently a top-10 finalist at Eurovision, which Vuletic called \u201ca huge platform for cultural diplomacy for any country,\u201d big or small.",
      "The country\u2019s leaders \u201csaw it as a very prestigious cultural project and one which could reach a huge amount of people,\u201d he added.",
      "But Eurovision\u2019s embrace of LGBTQ rights drew the ire of conservative Russian lawmakers and the country\u2019s Orthodox Church, particularly after the 2014 victory of bearded drag queen Conchita Wurst.",
      "Saturday\u2019s Intervision contest is getting a full-court press promotion from organizers, who have drafted a series of celebrity \u201cambassadors\u201d to get the word out. Among them are Dima Bilan, a Russian singer who won Eurovision in 2008, and Alexander Ovechkin, the Washington Capitals hockey star, who holds the record for most goals scored in NHL history.",
      "The goal is to \u201cpromote universal, spiritual, family, cultural, ethical, and religious traditions of different nations,\u201d according to the competition\u2019s website, although that seems potentially at odds with the entrant representing the U.S., Vassy, who has a history of performing at Pride events and supporting LGBTQ rights.",
      "Vassy, an Australian-born singer living in Los Angeles, has been a vocalist on dance tracks from David Guetta and Ti\u00ebsto, while several of her own topped Billboard\u2019s Dance Club Songs chart in the 2010s.",
      "The 42-year-old, whose real name is Vasiliki Karagiorgos, was a last-minute addition to the contest after the previous selection pulled out due to \u201cunforeseen family circumstances.\u201d",
      "Her outlook is markedly different from that of Russia\u2019s entrant, Shaman, who mixes politics and pop and rose in popularity after he became a strident supporter of the war in Ukraine.",
      "So vocal is his backing of the Kremlin that he has ended up on Australian and European Union sanction lists.",
      "Russia will be hoping that Shaman\u2019s popularity can bring a younger audience to the contest as well as his fans, many of whom are based outside major Russian metropolises like Moscow and St. Petersburg, according to Yulia Yurtaeva-Martens, a researcher at the Free University of Berlin who has written a book on Intervision.",
      "With his fulsome embrace of Russian nationalism in his music and performances, Shaman is viewed by the government as \u201ca new political symbol for new audiences,\u201d according to Yurtaeva-Martens, adding that it was unlikely they would have chosen anyone else because he \u201cwas the best choice for the Russian government.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Kenya\u2019s Sanaipei Tande is competing with her song \u201cFlavour,\u201d an Afropop tune that mixes English and Kiswahili.",
      "In between rehearsals in Moscow, she said in a Zoom interview this week that she hadn\u2019t heard of Intervision before this year and was only really familiar with Eurovision because 2011\u2019s contest had featured Norwegian-Kenyan singer Stella Mwangi.",
      "For artists who may have had success at home, performing at Intervision is a chance to step onto a larger stage, she said. In her case, this is both metaphorically and literally true because \u201cthe live arena is so huge.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen any stage in my country that\u2019s this big,\u201d she said, adding that coming to the Russian capital \u201cto compete against other international artists \u2014 that, for me, has put me on a whole new level.\u201d",
      "The fact she had been selected and was representing Kenya was a victory in itself, she said.",
      "\u201cI mean, $300,000 wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing to add on to that,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cBut just being here and being able to perform on this stage and experiencing things on a whole new level, that already is a win.\u201d"

      "Trump summarized their conversation, which he said began at 8 a.m. ET, in a Truth Social post in which he said he appreciates \u201cthe TikTok approval,\u201d but stopped short of announcing any kind of finalized deal. As expected, the call also appeared to touch on the ongoing trade war between the world\u2019s two largest economies.",
      "\u201cI just completed a very productive call with President Xi of China. We made progress on many very important issues including Trade, Fentanyl, the need to bring the War between Russia and Ukraine to an end, and the approval of the TikTok Deal,\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "For more on this story, listen to \u2018Here\u2019s the Scoop,\u2019 a daily evening podcast that brings you a fresh take on the day\u2019s top stories in 15 minutes or less.",
      "Trump said that he agreed with Xi that they would meet at the Oct. 31-Nov. 1 APEC summit in South Korea, that Trump would go to China early next year, and that Xi would eventually come to the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe call was a very good one, we will be speaking again by phone, appreciate the TikTok approval, and both look forward to meeting at APEC!\u201d the president wrote.",
      "The White House is not disputing the characterization that there is no final TikTok deal. An announcement on a final deal would ultimately come from the president, a White House official said.",
      "Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office Friday afternoon, Trump offered some mixed messages on the status of TikTok talks. He said Xi \"approved the TikTok deal,\" and then said \"we look forward to getting that deal closed.\"",
      "Asked directly if the deal was fully approved, Trump said, \"Well, I think so. I mean \u2014 when you say fully approved, I don\u2019t know what that means. We have to get, we have to get it signed. I guess it could be a formality.\"",
      "He added that \"the TikTok deal is well on its way.\"",
      "Separately, Chinese state media said Trump and Xi had a \u201ccandid and in-depth exchange of views\u201d and that the call was \u201cpragmatic, positive, and constructive.\u201d Xi said the U.S. should avoid taking restrictive trade measures \u201cto prevent undermining the outcomes achieved through multiple rounds of consultations,\u201d according to a readout published by Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency.",
      "On TikTok, Xi said the Chinese government \u201crespects the will of companies and is pleased to see companies conduct business negotiations on the basis of market rules and reach solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and balance interests,\u201d the readout said.",
      "\u201cWe hope the U.S. side will provide an open, fair, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies investing in the United States,\u201d it said.",
      "In a statement, TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, thanked Xi and Trump \u201cfor their efforts to preserve TikTok in the United States\u201d and said it will \u201cwork in accordance with applicable laws to ensure TikTok remains available to American users through TikTok U.S.\u201d",
      "Friday's call was the first between Trump and Xi since June, when Trump said they had spoken for about 90 minutes in a discussion focused on trade.",
      "At the height of trade tensions in April, U.S. and Chinese tariff rates reached as high as 145%, in what amounted to a mutual trade embargo. Since then they have been lowered under another \u201cframework\u201d deal, with new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods capped at 30%, while China imposes a 10% additional tariff on U.S. goods.",
      "The lower tariff rates are set to expire on Nov. 10 unless a deal is reached or the trade truce is extended again.",
      "The two countries also continue to tussle over export controls on strategically important products such as rare earths, which China has a near-monopoly over, and U.S. chip technology.",
      "TikTok, which is estimated to have about 170 million active users in the U.S., faces a ban unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, agrees to sell the app\u2019s U.S. assets to U.S. owners. The sale is required under a law Congress passed last year, citing national security concerns.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump formally extended the deadline for a TikTok deal for a fourth time, until Dec. 16, a day after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Beijing and Washington had struck a \u201cframework\u201d for an agreement, without providing details such as who would be taking over TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations.",
      "Trump has gone back and forth on the ban, but he credits TikTok with helping him win last year\u2019s presidential election and has expressed concern about alienating its huge and youthful user base. He said Thursday during a visit to the U.K. that the app \u201chas tremendous value\u201d and that \u201cvery rich people and companies are going to be owning it.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials have said the TikTok sale is necessary because of Chinese laws that require Chinese companies to share data requested by the government. They also cite concerns about data collection and the algorithm the app uses to recommend content to users, which they say is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese officials.",
      "TikTok denies sharing user data with Chinese authorities and says the U.S. has never provided evidence of Beijing trying to manipulate the algorithm.",
      "Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance say the powerful algorithm, which has helped fuel the app\u2019s global success, is proprietary and thus difficult to sell to a U.S. company under Chinese law.",
      "There are concerns that TikTok may continue to use the Chinese algorithm in the U.S.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., the committee\u2019s ranking member, have both expressed opposition to any deal that keeps the algorithm under Chinese control or allows ByteDance to maintain an operational relationship with the new American TikTok.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump has all the leverage he needs to strike a deal that saves TikTok and complies with the law \u2014 which means making sure TikTok\u2019s data and algorithm are truly in American hands,\u201d Krishnamoorthi said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Any deal would most likely need to be approved by Congress as well as ByteDance\u2019s board.",
      "Compared with five years ago, when Trump first called for a ban during his first term, TikTok is more mature as a platform and less likely to keep growing, said Dimitar Gueorguiev, an associate professor of political science and director of Chinese studies at Syracuse University.",
      "\u201cTikTok is, I think, a less valuable bargaining chip from the Chinese perspective, and an easier concession,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, for the United States, it\u2019s as visible and kind of politically salient as ever.\u201d",
      "While the details of the TikTok deal remain unclear, Gueorguiev said, the broader question is \u201ccan the Trump administration, as well as their counterparts in Beijing, convert on whatever progress we observe today and keep it going\u201d to achieve a \u201clarger bargain\u201d between the U.S. and China.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re thinking about what is the ultimate outcome of this, and who wins and who loses, there\u2019s still a lot to be told,\u201d he said."

      "\u201cA sign that denies Jews access to a store is a frightening signal and an attack on the principles of our free coexistence,\" Stenke said in the statement. \"We cannot allow such things to continue in our society and must take decisive action against it together. Antisemitism is a threat to our democracy and must not be tolerated in any form.\"",
      "Ulrich filed a criminal complaint for \"incitement of hatred,\" against the shop owner, according to the statement. The officials did not identify the business owner or the type of business.",
      "\"Antisemitic hate speech like this not only hurts those affected, but also disrupts public peace. The Flensburg incident, with its contemptuous rhetoric, is fatally reminiscent of the Nazi hate speech against Jews.\u201d",
      "Antisemitism has been on the rise in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany's northernmost state, according to officials. In 2024, the region saw a 390% increase in antisemitic incidents.",
      "\"We must stand together against every form of antisemitism,\" Ulrich said. \"The fight against antisemitism is a special responsibility that we bear as Germans.\"",
      "Stenke said that \"a state of action plan against antisemitism\" will be adopted next year. The official did not elaborate on what the plan will entail."
