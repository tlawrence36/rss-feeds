      "Superstar singer Rihanna made her first appearance at the trial of her partner, rapper A$AP Rocky, and may have outshined key testimony in the case",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The most important testimony at the trial of rapper A$AP Rocky got second billing as the defendant\u2019s partner and the mother of their children sat quietly but shined bright like a diamond in the audience.",
      "Rihanna showed up at his Los Angeles trial \u2014 where he\u2019s charged with two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm \u2014 for the first time on Wednesday, sitting between his sister and mother as his former friend testified about the moment he alleges Rocky fired at him.",
      "The singing superstar was escorted in and out of the courtroom surreptitiously, and was already sitting in Rocky\u2019s section before the jurors and the media entered. It\u2019s not clear if the jurors noticed she was there, but all other eyes in the room shifted to her.",
      "Wearing a long black dress with buttons that resembled an overcoat, she watched the proceedings calmly and periodically moved oversized, tortoiseshell glasses from atop her head to her eyes.",
      "The witness, who goes by A$AP Relli and was born Terell Ephron, described the night in November of 2021 when he and Rocky, their relationship straining, had a confrontation and scuffled on a Hollywood street, and Rocky pointed a gun at him before walking away.",
      "He testified Wednesday that he was shouting at Rocky as he walked after him, then Rocky pulled the gun again and held it in the air.",
      "\u201cHe turned around and then it was like BOOM!\u201d he told the jury. \u201cThe whole thing was like a movie, he kind of like pointed down and he shot the first shot.\u201d",
      "He said he felt a burning on his hand where a bullet grazed it.",
      "Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Athelston Mayers, could get up to 24 years in prison. Wearing a tan sport coat and patterned tie, Rocky watched intently as Relli testified about the moment Rocky allegedly fired a gun at him on a Hollywood street in 2021.",
      "Rocky fired another shot that he didn't see because had hidden behind a mutual friend who was there with the rapper, who ran away after that.",
      "He said, \u201cI felt my hand hot,\u201d and later added, \u201cI was hit. Or I was grazed. I didn\u2019t have a hole or nothing.\u201d",
      "Rocky\u2019s lawyer, who will get to cross-examine Relli on Thursday, says the shots he fired were not even from a real gun \u2014 they were blanks from a starter pistol that he carried as a prop. The lawyer said Relli knew this, and that was why he was so fearless walking after him.",
      "\u201cOh it was a real gun,\u201d Relli testified under prosecution questioning, saying he knew because of his scraped hand.",
      "Since the shooting, and his decision to go to police and testify, he has gotten death threats and has been shunned as a snitch, he said, and the modest music management career he built fell apart.",
      "\u201cIt's been a living hell,\u201d Relli said.",
      "About an hour after the shooting, Relli returned to the scene and said he photographed and recovered two shell casings. Earlier, while responding to a report of a shooting, police did not find any.",
      "He sent a text to Rocky that was shown in court saying \u201cU try killing me.\u201d",
      "Rocky denied it in his reply.",
      "\u201cBro wtf is u talkin bout why u tell ppl I shot at u.\u201d",
      "He sent Rocky photos of the shell casings and his grazed hand.",
      "Rocky said he was making stuff up and speaking \u201call type of nonsense\u201d and was trying to \u201cextort\u201d him.",
      "Rocky and Rihanna, both 36, have two sons together: 2-year-old RZA Athelston Mayers and 1-year-old Riot Rose Mayers. Rihanna revealed she was pregnant with the younger boy after headlining the Super Bowl halftime show in 2023 with a visible baby bump.",
      "The singer and the rapper, who are both fashion moguls, first became close when he provided a verse to her 2012 song \u201cCockiness (Love It)\u201d and they performed it at the MTV Video Music Awards. They became a couple in 2020."

      "PARK CITY, Utah -- Incarcerated men in the Alabama prison system risked their safety to feed shocking footage of their horrifying living conditions to a pair of documentary filmmakers. The result is \u201cThe Alabama Solution,\u201d which premiered this week at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City.",
      "Filmmakers Andrew Jarecki and Charlotte Kaufman became interested in Alabama prisons in 2019. Jarecki, the filmmaker behind \u201cThe Jinx\u201d and \u201cCapturing the Friedmans,\u201d and Kaufman first gained access to the restricted grounds through a visit with a chaplain during a revival meeting held in the prison yards. There men pulled them aside and whispered shocking stories about the reality of life inside: forced labor, drugs, violence, intimidation, retaliation and the undisclosed truths behind many prisoner deaths.",
      "The Associated Press has written extensively about the problems in the state\u2019s prison system, including high rates of violence, low staffing, a plummeting parole rate and the use of pandemic funds to build a new supersized prison.",
      "This process eventually led them to incarcerated activists Melvin Ray and Robert Earl Council (also known as \u201cKinetik Justice\u201d) who had for years been trying to expose the horrifying conditions and deep- seated corruption across the system. They helped feed dispatches to the filmmakers with contraband cellphones.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re deeply concerned for their safety, and we have been since the first time we met them,\u201d said Kaufman. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing this work for decades and as you see in the film, they\u2019ve been retaliated against in very extreme ways. But there are lawyers who are ready to do wellness checks and visit them and respond to any sort of retaliation that may come.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday at the first showing of the film, she had Council on the phone listening in. They put the microphone up to the cellphone so that Council could speak.",
      "\u201cWe thank you all for listening, for being interested,\u201d Council said. \u201cOn behalf of the brothers of Alabama, I thank you all.\u201d",
      "Several family members of their incarcerated subjects were also in the audience, including Sandy Ray, the mother of Steven Davis, who died in 2019 at William E. Donaldson Correctional Facility, his face beaten beyond recognition. Prison officials said Davis was killed in self-defense because he didn\u2019t put down his weapons. The prisoners tell a vastly different story.",
      "Alelur \u201cAlex\u201d Duran, who spent 12 years in prison in New York, also helped produce the film. Jarecki said they wouldn't have taken on the subject without the expertise of someone who had been incarcerated.",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing in this film is going on all over the nation,\u201d Duran said.",
      "Also embedded in the story is Alabama\u2019s long history of contracting prisoners to do work at private companies from Burger King to Best Western, an issue that the AP investigated for over two years. The cheap, reliable labor force has generated more than $250 million for the state since 2000 \u2014 money garnished from prisoners\u2019 paychecks, the AP wrote in December. Parole numbers have also plummeted in recent years.",
      "\u201cWe want to show viewers the truth about a system that has been cloaked in secrecy,\u201d Jarecki said. \u201cWe hope the film sparks an effort to allow access for journalists and others so the public can have transparency into how incarcerated citizens are treated and how our tax dollars are being spent. We hope to inspire Alabama\u2019s leadership to acknowledge the crisis and to overhaul its prison system and its use of forced labor.\u201d",
      "The film will have a theatrical release before it debuts on HBO sometime this year, but the specific dates and details are still being worked out. And while it is in its early days, the impact, Jarecki said, has already been seen, including in a class action labor lawsuit.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 16:02:29 -0500",
    "summary": "William E",
    "story": [
      "William E",
      "NEW YORK -- William E. Leuchtenburg, a prize-winning historian widely admired for his authoritative writings on the U.S. presidency and as the reigning scholar on Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal, has died at 102.",
      "Leuchtenburg died Tuesday at his home in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, according to his son, Joshua A. Leuchtenburg, who cited no specific cause of death.",
      "A professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina and a published author for more than 70 years, William E. Leuchtenburg was praised for his encyclopedic knowledge and rigorous, but accessible style. He received some of the top awards given to historians, including the Parkman and Bancroft prizes, was a political analyst for CBS and NBC and consulted on several of Ken Burns' PBS documentaries. In 2008, he was given the Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. Award for \"Distinguished Writing\" of American history.",
      "Leuchtenburg's notable books include \"Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal\" and \"The Perils of Prosperity,\" a history of the U.S. from World War I to the peak of the Great Depression. Although politically liberal, his expertise called upon by aides to Lyndon Johnson and other Democratic politicians, he was as willing to point out the New Deal\u2019s disappointments as its successes: His scholarship was closely studied by younger FDR historians, from Jonathan Alter to Burns collaborator Geoffrey Ward, who dedicated the 2014 book \u201cThe Roosevelts\u201d to Leuchtenburg. And he was otherwise known for his generosity with Ward and others who sought his expertise.",
      "His most influential work was likely the Bancroft-winning \u201cFranklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal,\u201d published in 1963. Leuchtenburg found that the impact of FDR's vast and unprecedented response to the Depression was limited by political calculation, especially the president's reluctance to challenge racial segregation in the South, and that \u201cIt never demonstrated that it could achieve prosperity\" until the U.S. entered World War II. But he also credited the New Deal with transforming the role of federal government and Roosevelt with reinventing the presidency, using the young medium of radio to convince millions that he knew them personally.",
      "\u201cNothing is glossed over at all,\u201d The New York Times\u2019 Charles Poore wrote upon the book\u2019s release. \u201cYou live here through years of tumult and disaster, triumph and ineptitude and daring.\u201d",
      "Leuchtenburg's books on Roosevelt covered his presidency and beyond. \"In the Shadow of FDR,\" published in 1983 and periodically updated, demonstrated how presidents from Truman to George W. Bush attempted to shun and/or embrace Roosevelt's legacy. Leuchtenburg wrote of Roosevelt's immediate successor, Harry Truman, gesturing in the White House to a portrait of FDR and admitting, \"I'm trying to do what he would like.\" He noted the frustration of Republican Dwight Eisenhower and Democrat John F. Kennedy in being compared, unfavorably, to Roosevelt, and how Jimmy Carter began his 1976 presidential run with a speech in Warm Springs, Georgia, where FDR often stayed. At the time of his death, Leuchtenburg was working on an edition that would have included the administration of Joe Biden, who kept a portrait of Roosevelt in the Oval Office.",
      "The 2005 book \"The White House Looks South\" featured sections on Roosevelt, Truman and Lyndon Johnson and told of how each embraced or distanced themselves from the South. Roosevelt, a native of New York, spent so much time in Warm Springs that the state's governor referred to him as our \"fellow-Georgian.\" Johnson, a Texan, alternately identified himself as a Southerner or a Westerner, depending on the intended audience.",
      "In the prologue, Leuchtenburg fondly noted his own journey, remembering visits to baseball spring training camps in Florida, marching with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in Montgomery, Alabama, and never failing on New Year's Day to partake of black-eyed peas and collard greens, \"even if they are eaten with a grimace.\"",
      "\"In sum, I am in, but not of, the South,\" he concluded.",
      "He was a popular and rigorous educator \u2014 sometimes referred to as \u201cThe Big L\u201d \u2014 who taught at Smith College, Harvard University and Columbia University before settling at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the early 1980s. A former president of the American Historical Association and the Organization of American Historians, he held such stature that he contributed to later editions of \"The Growth of the American Republic,\" a standard college textbook originally written by Henry Steele Commager and Samuel Eliot Morison. Historians studying under him ranged from Allan Brandt to Howard Zinn.",
      "Leuchtenburg was married twice, most recently to Jean Anne Leuchtenburg, and had three children.",
      "A postal clerk's son born in New York City in 1922, William Edward Leuchtenburg was so fascinated by politics that at age 12, he raised money tutoring neighborhood kids to fund a nine-hour bus ride to Washington, where he would recall his \"wide-eyed\" tour of the White House and the \"brand-new marble palace of the U.S. Supreme Court.\"",
      "His affinity for Roosevelt was lifelong and personal. When he was 10, he sat by the radio and counted delegates as FDR was elected to his first term as president. He was able to afford college with help from a job found through a New Deal program, the National Youth Administration.",
      "Leuchtenburg graduated from Cornell University, received a master's degree and a doctorate from Columbia and worked for a civil rights lobby and other political organizations before deciding to focus on history. His first book, \u201cFlood Control Politics,\u201d came out in 1953, followed five years later by \u201cThe Perils of Prosperity.\u201d",
      "In recent years, Leuchtenburg wrote a short, critical biography of FDR\u2019s predecessor, Herbert Hoover, and the 900-page \u201cThe American President: From Teddy Roosevelt to Bill Clinton.\u201d He continued to work every morning and, at age 101, completed \u201cPatriot Presidents,\u201d the first of a planned multi-volume history that he acknowledged in the book's preface \u201cmay be too ambitious.\u201d"

      "Superstar singer Rihanna has made her first appearance at the trial of her partner, rapper A$AP Rocky",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Rihanna appeared for the first time at the trial of her longtime partner A$AP Rocky, on the day of its most important testimony \u2014 the description by a former friend of the moment Rocky allegedly fired a gun at him.",
      "The singer superstar, who has two toddler sons with the rapper Rocky, sat out of view of the courtroom\u2019s cameras, between Rocky\u2019s mother and sister, in the downtown Los Angeles criminal courthouse. Security brought her in surreptitiously to avoid crowds Wednesday morning.",
      "Rocky, whose legal name is Rakim Athelston Mayers, has been standing trial on two felony charges that he fired a handgun at the former friend, who is known by the name A$AP Relli and was born Terell Ephron. If convicted, Rocky could get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "Rihanna watched Wednesday as Relli testified about the moment Rocky allegedly fired a gun at him on a Hollywood street in 2021.",
      "He had been shouting angrily at Rocky, who was walking away after an initial confrontation and scuffle, when Rocky pulled a gun from his waistband and held it in the air, Relli testified.",
      "\u201cHe turned around and then it was like BOOM!\u201d he told the jury. \u201cThe whole thing was like a movie, he kind of like pointed down and he shot the first shot.\"",
      "He said \u201cI felt my hand hot\u201d and later added, \u201cI was hit. Or I was grazed. I didn\u2019t have a hole or nothing.\u201d",
      "The trial's key witness said he grabbed one of their mutual friends who were with Rocky after the first shot was fired and stood behind him for protection. He said he did not see Rocky fire the second shot, and Rocky ran away moments later.",
      "When jurors were being selected, prosecutors asked them whether Rihanna\u2019s connection to the case, especially if she appeared in court, would affect their ability to deliver a guilty verdict.",
      "Nearly all those questioned had heard of her \u2014 far more than had heard of Rocky \u2014 and some described themselves as fans, but all said they felt it would not affect their decisions.",
      "It was not clear whether they could see Rihanna or were aware of her presence as they watched the testimony. She wore a long black dress with buttons on the front that resembled a winter overcoat, and had a pair of glasses on her head that she put on during the prosecution's questioning.",
      "Earlier in the trial, which began on Jan. 21, Relli said he and Rocky, members of A$AP, a crew of creators at a New York high school, had been close but their relationship eroded after Rocky became famous.",
      "He said their relationship had been strained for years and was getting worse in the days leading up to the incident, but he was still \u201cfurious\u201d when Rocky pulled a gun on him after a scuffle that began the moment the two met up near the W Hotel. He dared him to use it.",
      "When Rocky walked away, he testified that he followed and shouted after him, until the shots were fired.",
      "Rocky\u2019s lawyer says the shots he fired were not even from a real gun \u2014 they were blanks from a starter pistol that he carried as a prop. The lawyer said Relli knew this, and that was why he was so fearless walking after him.",
      "\u201cOh it was a real gun,\u201d Relli testified Wednesday, saying he knew because of his scraped hand.",
      "He said he felt free to follow and shout at Rocky because \u201cI felt like because he put it away and we\u2019re on a busy street in Hollywood. He\u2019s definitely not gonna shoot it.\u201d",
      "Since the shooting, and his decision to go to police and testify, he has gotten death threats and has been shunned as a snitch, he said, and the modest music management career he built fell apart.",
      "\u201cIt's been a living hell,\u201d Relli said.",
      "About an hour after the shooting, Relli returned to the scene and said he photographed and recovered two shell casings. Earlier, while responding to a report of a shooting, police did not find any.",
      "He sent a text to Rocky that was shown in court saying \"U try killing me.\"",
      "Rocky denied it in his reply.",
      "\u201cBro wtf is u talkin bout why u tell ppl I shot at u.\u201d",
      "He sent Rocky photos of the shell casings and his grazed hand.",
      "Rocky said he was making stuff up and speaking \u201call type of nonsense\u201d and was trying to \u201cextort\u201d him.",
      "The court day ended after just a few hours of testimony because of scheduling issues. Rihanna was shuffled out through a restricted exit by deputies, and Rocky left separately through the main courthouse doors.",
      "The defense will begin their cross-examination of Relli on Thursday.",
      "Raised in Harlem, Rocky\u2019s rap songs became a phenomenon in New York in 2011. He had his mainstream breakthrough when his first studio album went to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in 2013. The second one, in 2015, did the same.",
      "He\u2019s set to have his biggest career year as a multimedia star. This Sunday, he\u2019s nominated for a Grammy Award for best music video for his song \u201cTailor Swif,\u201d at the ceremony at Crypto.com Arena just two miles (3 kilometers) from the Los Angeles courthouse where his trial\u2019s being held.",
      "He\u2019s also set to headline the Rolling Loud Music Festival, to star opposite Denzel Washington in a film directed by Spike Lee, and to co-chair the Met Gala in May.",
      "But the prospect of a conviction and the possibility of a lengthy prison sentence casts a shadow over all of it.",
      "Rocky and Rihanna, both 36, have two sons together: 2-year-old RZA Athelston Mayers and 1-year-old Riot Rose Mayers. She revealed she was pregnant with the younger boy after headlining the Super Bowl halftime show in 2023 with a visible baby bump.",
      "The singer and the rapper, who are both fashion moguls, first became close when he provided a verse to her 2012 song \u201cCockiness (Love It)\u201d and they performed it at the MTV Video Music Awards. They became a couple in 2020.",

      "PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron announced Tuesday that the \u201cMona Lisa\u201d will get its own dedicated room inside the Louvre museum under a major renovation and expansion of the Paris landmark that will take up to 10 years.",
      "The renovation project, branded \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d will include a new entrance near the River Seine, to be opened by 2031, and the creation of underground rooms, Macron said in a speech from the Louvre room where Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece is displayed.",

That will make the visit simpler for those who want to see the painting and ease the life of other visitors in the rest of the museum, he said.",

That makes some other paintings in the room by the greatest Venetian painters like Titian and Veronese go unnoticed by many.",
      "The museum\u2019s latest big renovation in the 1980s was designed to receive 4 million annual visitors.",
      "Last year, the Louvre received 8.7 million visitors, over three-quarters being foreigners mostly from the United States, China and neighboring countries Italy, the UK, Germany and Spain.",
      "Macron said a new entrance for the Louvre will be created near the River Seine by 2031, to be financed by ticket sales, patronage and licensing money from the museum's Abu Dhabi branch.",
      "A design competition is to be staged in the coming months, he said. In addition, some new underground rooms will be created to expand the museum.",
      "A French top official said the cost of the renovation is estimated at 700 to 800 million euros ($730 to 834 million) over the next ten years, including half for the creation of the new entrance. The official could not be named in line with the French presidency\u2019s customary practices.",
      "Macron said ticket prices will be raised for foreign visitors from outside the European Union, up from 22 euros ($23) now. He promised the museum will be safer and more comfortable for both the public and the staff.",
      "Half the Louvre's budget is currently being financed by the French state, including the wages of the 2,200 employees.",
      "The other half is provided by private funds including ticket sales, earnings from restaurants, shops and bookings for special events, as well as patrons and other partners.",
      "The renovation announcement comes after Louvre Director Laurence des Cars expressed her concerns in a note to Culture Minister Rachida Dati earlier this month saying the museum is threatened by \u201cobsolescence.\u201d",
      "According to the document first released by French newspaper Le Parisien, she warned about the gradual degradation of the building due to water leaks, temperature variations and other issues \u201cendangering the preservation of artworks.\u201d",
      "The pyramid that serves at the museum\u2019s entrance, unveiled in 1989 as part of late President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand\u2019s project, now appears outdated. The place is not properly insulated from the cold and the heat and tends to amplify noise, making the space uncomfortable for both the public and the staff, des Cars stressed.",

      "The Grammys will look a little bit different this year",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 The Grammy Awards will look a little bit different this week.",
      "Each year, the Recording Academy hosts a multitude of events to welcome the music industry during Grammy week and record labels do the same. However, many institutions have canceled their plans \u2014 Universal Music Group, Sony, Spotify, BMG and Warner Music Group among them \u2014 and instead are allocating resources to help those affected by the devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires.",
      "The Grammys will still take place on Sunday at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles but now will focus its attention on helping wildfire victims.",
      "Within days of fires ravaging the Pacific Palisades and Altadena neighborhoods, the Recording Academy and its affiliated MusiCares charity launched the Los Angeles Fire Relief Effort with a $1 million dollar donation. According to a letter sent to members on Jan. 13, thanks to additional contributions, they\u2019ve already distributed $2 million in emergency aid.",
      "Once the fund was set up, Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason jr. said they began focusing on reformatting what Grammy week would look like \u2014 many conversations conducted \u201con the road, mobile-y, virtually\u201d as staffers had evacuated their homes.",
      "\u201cThat process has really consisted of reaching out to just listen and learn from a lot of people \u2014 state officials, local officials, the governor\u2019s office, the mayor\u2019s office, the fire department. We talked to hotel managers, just really trying to get a grasp on what was happening currently. What did they project was going to happen in the next week to 10 days? Would be safe to have a show?\"",
      "Ultimately, the Recording Academy decided to condense its pre-Grammy week plans to just four events, each featuring a fundraising element.",
      "On Friday, MusiCares, an organization that helps music professionals who need financial, personal or medical assistance, will hold its annual Persons of the Year benefit gala\u2009celebrating the Grateful Dead.",
      "On Saturday, the Special Merit Awards Ceremony and Grammy nominees' reception will still take place, followed by Clive Davis' pre-Grammy fundraising event.",
      "Then the Grammys take the stage on Sunday.",
      "Events like the annual pre-Grammy Black Music Collective event, Grammy advocacy brunch, and others scheduled to take place at the immersive pop-up Grammy house have been canceled.",
      "\u201cWe thought consolidating the events would allow us to have more impact,\u201d Mason explains. \u201cAnd we just don\u2019t feel it was the right time to have social gatherings or places to party or schmooze and just hang out. We wanted to have our events be places that could be purposeful and impactful. Some of the party settings, we decided to fold down into our fundraising efforts.\u201d",
      "\u201cObviously, we can\u2019t have a normal show in the midst of people\u2019s belongings being burned or loss of life or other things like that. At the same time, canceling would not have helped,\u201d Mason says.",
      "\u201cWe needed to raise money. We needed to show unity and come together around music. We need to support the city of L.A. (Over) 6,500 people work on our shows and ancillary gatherings. So, once we decided to move forward, it was really a conversation with (Grammy producers) Ben Winston, Raj Kapoor and Jesse Collins and myself. And we started to think about, \u2018How do we make the show have the greatest impact?\u2019\u201d",
      "They decided the path forward was to still give out awards and host performances to give viewers and attendees a bespoke concert experience. But most importantly, the show could raise awareness, drive donations and resources to funds that benefit people in need.",
      "And the conversations are ongoing. \u201cWe have some great things in the show that will definitely help to raise funds,\" he assures. \"It will honor some of the heroes that have been protecting our lives and our homes. It will hopefully shine a light on some people that need more help and more services.\u201d",
      "Don't expect a traditional telethon, but he says the show will feature announcements and activations in the arena.",
      "\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll be talking about things that have been pledged from the sponsors or from the community,\u201d he adds.",
      "\u201cWe know right off the bat that we\u2019ve got almost 3,000 requests for help from our members or people in the music community,\u201d Mason says. \u201cSo that was just in the first few days.\u201d",
      "The immediate needs have been \u201cthe basics,\u201d as he explains. \u201cFood, water, shelter, the bare necessities to live.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe next phase will involve, you know, where they\u2019re going to live, how are they going to replace maybe damaged or destroyed instruments, studios. How will they make a living? I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be some mental health component that people may need assistance with. But it\u2019s really across the board. But the early, immediate relief is around just the bare necessities.\u201d",
      "There's no shortage of natural disasters, and they affect the music community too. Mason brings up the COVID-19 pandemic as a recent example. With MusiCares, they were able to contribute \u201cover $40 million to people who needed help.\u201d They have the infrastructure to provide assistance quickly.",
      "However, he notes, the Grammys are the first major award show taking place after the wildfires, which means \u201cthere's no playbook for this.\"",
      "\u201cBut I\u2019ve always said it all changes if the fires were to continue, or possibly got worse, or the winds changed. So, I always want to reserve that right. We\u2019re not going to go blindly forward if things are unsafe or if it feels inappropriate,\" he says.",
      "But consider the fundraising, the economic and financial impacts, and the possibility of unity, \u201cIt all makes sense for us to move forward.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has set a March 2026 trial date for actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni to resolve their claims stemming from their work on the movie \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- A New York judge set a March 2026 trial date on Monday and moved an initial conference from mid-February to next week as the public feud between Blake Lively and her \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d costar and director Justin Baldoni continued to grow and accelerate.",
      "And in a new and separate front in the series of legal battles surrounding the film that became a surprise hit last summer, Lively in a Texas court filed a request for a deposition of a man she says was central to turning online sentiment against her during its release and promotion.",
      "The New York federal judge, Lewis J. Liman, told both sides in an order late Monday to prepare for a March 9, 2026, trial.",
      "He also moved an initial conference from mid-February to next week and told lawyers to be prepared to address complaints about pretrial publicity and attorney conduct.",
      "Liman took the actions after Lively\u2019s lawyers claimed in a filing on Monday that an attorney for Baldoni was trying to taint potential jurors over lawsuits the actors have filed against each other.",
      "The lawyers said Baldoni\u2019s attorney was trying to wreck Lively\u2019s career and turn potential New York jurors against her by creating a website to release selected documents and communications between Lively and Baldoni.",
      "The lawyers said attorney Bryan Freedman, representing Baldoni, was \u201cengaging in this extrajudicial campaign to influence these proceedings and the public perception of legal filings to this Court, and there already is a serious risk that his misconduct is tainting the jury pool.\u201d",
      "They added: \u201cThe endless stream of defamatory and extrajudicial media statements must end.\u201d",
      "Freedman said in a statement in response to Monday's assertions that the \u201cirony is not lost on anyone that Ms. Lively is so petrified of the truth that she has moved to gag it.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will always respect the court; however, we will never be bullied by those suggesting we cannot defend our clients with pure, unedited facts,\u201d the lawyer said. \u201cAll we want is for people to see the actual text messages that directly contradict her allegations, video footage that clearly shows there was no sexual harassment and all the other powerful evidence that directly contradicts any false allegations.\u201d",
      "In a letter to the judge on Thursday, Baldoni attorney Kevin Fritz accused Lively of a publicity campaign that left Baldoni and other defendants the \u201cobjects of public scorn and contempt.\u201d",
      "He said the actions had damaged those she sued so that they were \u201cexiled from polite society and suffered damages totaling hundreds of millions of dollars due to Ms. Lively\u2019s scorched-earth media campaign.\u201d",
      "In the separate filing in Hays County, Texas, a precursor to another potential lawsuit, Lively asks for an order for a deposition from Jed Wallace, a crisis management specialist she alleges was behind much of the social media manipulation surrounding the film that turned public sentiment against her through posts on Reddit and TikTok.",
      "Wallace and his Texas-based firm Street Relations were brought on as subcontractors by publicists working with Baldoni and his production company, the filing said.",
      "\u201cHe weaponized a digital army around the country, including in New York and Los Angeles, to create, seed, manipulate, and advance disparaging content that appeared to be authentic on social media platforms and internet chat forums,\u201d the filing alleges.",
      "Wallace is identified in Lively's federal lawsuit, but he is not a defendant.",
      "Freedman, who the filing says is Wallace's lawyer, did not respond to a request for comment on the issue.",
      "Lively sued Baldoni, his production company and others in New York in late December for sexual harassment and attacks on her reputation and asked for unspecified damages. Baldoni sued earlier this month, accusing Lively and her husband, \u201cDeadpool\u201d actor Ryan Reynolds, of defamation and extortion and seeking at least $400 million in damages.",
      "The judge said Monday that he'll likely combine the lawsuits for trial.",
      "\u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d an adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s bestselling 2016 novel that begins as a romance but takes a dark turn into domestic violence, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a $50 million debut. But the movie\u2019s release was shrouded by speculation over discord between Lively and Baldoni.",
      "Lively came to fame through the 2005 film \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\u201d and bolstered her stardom on the TV series \u201cGossip Girl\u201d from 2007 to 2012. She has since starred in films including \u201cThe Town\u201d and \u201cThe Shallows.\u201d",
      "Baldoni starred in the TV comedy \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d directed the 2019 film \u201cFive Feet Apart\u201d and wrote \u201cMan Enough,\u201d a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity.",

      "Taylor Swift is likely headed to her second straight Super Bowl",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- You could say that Taylor Swift's championship era is in its second consecutive season.",
      "The 14-time Grammy Award-winning superstar returned to Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday and watched her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and the rest of the Kansas City Chiefs beat the Buffalo Bills 32-29 for a spot in their third consecutive Super Bowl.",
      "Swift walked down the tunnel to her usual suite about 90 minutes before kickoff. And while she was decked out in Chanel for the divisional round against Houston, she opted for a sleek black-and-gold Louis Vuitton look for the AFC title game, including a jacquard knit jacket that retails for $5,000 and a stocking cap with a list price of $830.",
      "Modest fare compared to what suite prices for the Super Bowl will probably run.",
      "Swift will almost certainly be in New Orleans with her celebrity friends when the Chiefs go for an unprecedented third straight Lombardi Trophy against the Philadelphia Eagles on Feb. 9. They got a big game from Patrick Mahomes \u2014 no surprise there \u2014 and some key stops from their defense to get past the Bills.",
      "Swift began her high-profile romance with Kelce last season, when he invited the \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d singer to watch him in a September matchup with the Bears. And their relationship only seemed to blossom into the new year, with Swift eventually celebrating on the field with Kelce after the Chiefs had beaten the Ravens in Baltimore for the AFC championship.",
      "Then came the Super Bowl, and Swift's much-watched dash from a concert in Tokyo for kickoff of the big game in Las Vegas.",
      "She made it with plenty of time to spare, of course. And Swift became the focus of attention in her own right, winning what appeared to be a beer-chugging contest, partying with celebrity suite mates such as Blake Lively, Ice Spice and Lana Del Rey, and standing next to Kelce's mother, Donna, while he held aloft the Lombardi Trophy following the 25-22 win over the 49ers.",
      "The couple eventually locked lips again on the field at Allegiant Stadium.",
      "As confetti flew on the field, they kissed again in celebration at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday night. Swift gave Chiefs coach Andy Reid a big hug, and she celebrated with Donna Kelce and the rest of some 80,000 fans.",

      "On a quiet weekend, even for the typically frigid movie-going month of January, the top spot went to the Lionsgate thriller starring Mark Wahlberg as a pilot flying an Air Marshal (Michelle Dockery) and fugitive (Topher Grace) across Alaska. But it wasn\u2019t a particularly triumphant result for Gibson\u2019s directorial follow-up to 2016\u2019s \u201cHacksaw Ridge.\u201d Reviews (21% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores (a \u201cC\u201d CinemaScore) were terrible.",

      "The weekend was also a small test as to whether the once more common Oscar \u201cbump\u201d that can sometimes follow nominations still exists. Most contenders have by now completed the bulk of their theatrical runs and are more likely to see an uptick on VOD or streaming.",
      "But the weekend\u2019s most daring gambit was A24 pushing Brady Corbet\u2019s \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d a three\u2013and-a-half-hour epic nominated for 10 Academy Awards, into wide release. Though some executives initially greeted \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d which is running with an intermission, as \u201cun-distributable,\u201d Corbet has said, A24 acquired the film out of the Venice Film Festival and it\u2019s managed solid business, collecting $6 million in limited release.",

      "Coming off one of the lowest Martin Luther King Jr. weekends in years, no new releases made a major impact.",
      "Steven Soderbergh\u2019s \u201cPresence,\u201d a well-reviewed horror film shot from the perspective of a ghost inside a suburban home, debuted with $3.4 million in 1,750 locations. The film, released by Neon and acquired out of last year\u2019s Sundance, was made for just $2 million.",
      "The top spots otherwise went to holdovers. The Walt Disney Co.\u2019s \u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d in its sixth weekend of release, scored $8.7 million to hold second place. After starting slow, the Barry Jenkins-directed film has amassed $626.7 million globally.",

      "Hermes illuminated a gloomy Paris afternoon with its fall 2025 men\u2019s collection, as Veronique Nichanian turned to the racetrack for inspiration",
      "PARIS -- Hermes illuminated a gloomy Paris afternoon with its fall men\u2019s collection Saturday, as Veronique Nichanian turned to the racetrack for inspiration. Jockeys\u2019 vibrant racing silks became her muse, a dynamic counterpoint to the French maison\u2019s storied equestrian roots. \u201cI wanted this collection to be strong and energetic,\u201d Nichanian explained, her palette pivoting from deep browns and dark teals to flashes of tomato red and lemon yellow.",
      "The collection radiated warmth, both in spirit and texture. Fuzzy mohair coats, velvet varsity jackets and plush sheepskin outerwear wrapped models in an embrace that seemed designed to counter winter\u2019s chill. Layering was less pronounced this season, a deliberate move to retain sleek, streamlined silhouettes. Even gray pinstripe suits \u2014 pared back to essentials \u2014 eschewed bulk, echoing Nichanian\u2019s vision of men unencumbered as they race through life.",
      "Sweaters emerged as the collection\u2019s unsung heroes. Their bold chevrons and geometric patterns were lifted directly from the vibrant stripes of racing silks, a playful nod to Palais d\u2019I\u00e9na\u2019s soaring, angular architecture. A standout turtleneck, with its patchwork of triangles, rectangles, and squares in canary yellow, seemed to channel a nostalgic love for trigonometry. Elsewhere, a jacket with a shawl collar mirrored the same graphical bravado, rendered in cool tones of blue, black and white.",
      "Though grounded in classic tailoring, the collection celebrated irreverence. Nichanian\u2019s juxtaposition of tradition and innovation captured Herm\u00e8s\u2019 ethos with a quiet confidence. Here, functionality was imbued with a touch of whimsy, proving once again that the maison\u2019s refinement can still surprise and delight. In a season steeped in nostalgia and geometry, Herm\u00e8s delivered a collection that was, quite literally, off to the races."

      "PARK CITY, Utah -- PARK CITY, Utah (AP) \u2014 Rose Byrne plays a mother in the midst of a breakdown in the experiential psychological thriller \u201cIf I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You.\u201d",
      "Anticipation was high for the A24 film, which will be released sometime this year. Its premiere Friday at the Sundance Film Festival was easily the hottest ticket in town, with even ticketholders unable to get in. Those who did make it into the Library theater were treated to an intense, visceral, inventive story from filmmaker Mary Bronstein that has quickly become one of the festival\u2019s must-sees.",
      "Byrne plays Linda, who is barely hanging on while managing her daughter\u2019s mysterious illness. She\u2019s faced with crisis after crisis, big and small \u2014 from the massive, gaping hole in their apartment ceiling that forces them to move to a dingy motel, to an escalating showdown with a parking attendant at a care center. The cracks in her psychological, emotional and physical wellbeing are become too much to bear.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d never seen a movie before where a mother is going through a crisis with a child but our energy is not with the child\u2019s struggle, it\u2019s with the mother\u2019s,\u201d Bronstein said at the premiere. \u201cIf you\u2019re a caretaker, you shouldn\u2019t be bothering with yourself at all. It should all be about the person you\u2019re taking care of, right? And that is a particular kind of emotional burnout state that I was really interested in exploring.\u201d",
      "Byrne and Bronstein went deep in the preparation phase, having long discussions about Linda with the goal of making her as real as possible before the quick, 27-day shoot. Byrne said she was obsessed with figuring out who Linda was before the crisis. The film was in part inspired by Bronstein\u2019s experience with her own daughter, but she didn\u2019t want to elaborate on the specifics.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s her story to tell,\u201d Bronstein said.",
      "Part of Linda\u2019s story involves her therapist, played by Conan O\u2019Brien, who joked that he didn\u2019t realize he was in a movie.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not looking out for movie scripts or anything. But when I got a call from A24 that they wanted me to read something, I\u2019m not stupid,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI showed it to my wife, who is one of the smartest people I know, and she read through it and she said, \u2018I didn\u2019t know they made movies like this anymore.\u2019\u201d",
      "He was particularly in awe of his director and co-star, saying he felt like a fraud standing beside them.",
      "\u201cIt was an amazing experience, one of the best experiences of my life, just to be with them and watch them work,\u201d O'Brien said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how (Byrne) did that and not check into a hospital afterwards, because I haven\u2019t seen any actor, man or woman, sustain that level for an entire movie.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like I have to go to a hospital now, because this was the first time I watched it,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m a mess.\u201d",
      "A$AP Rocky also co-stars, as a man Linda meets at the motel, but was not in Park City for the premiere. He is currently on trial, charged with firing a gun at a former friend.",
      "The film is full of ambiguity, metaphor and just plain artistic expression that Bronstein hesitated to explain, from the name itself to the hole in the ceiling, which takes on a somewhat supernatural quality.",
      "\u201cWhen we have nothing left to give, we have an emptiness inside of us,\u201d Bronstein said. \u201cAnd that emptiness is actually not empty: It\u2019s filled with all the darkness and self-hate and doubt and fear and dread and regret and everything. \u2026 That to me is what the hole is.\u201d",
      "Some of it, she said, she doesn\u2019t even fully understand. The point is the experience, and critics and Sundance audiences are already fully on board.",
      "Bronstein, a bit of a cult figure in the film world, made her directorial debut in 2008 at the SXSW festival with \u201cYeast,\u201d which featured a pre-fame Greta Gerwig and was hailed by by New Yorker critic Richard Brody as a \u201cmumblecore classic.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf I Had Legs I\u2019d Kick You\u201d is only her second feature.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time that anybody else has paid for me to make art,\u201d Bronstein said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to say that this is the film that came directly from my head to the screen.\u201d",

      "\u201cEverybody I know has been affected,\u201d O'Brien told The Associated Press Friday. \"I\u2019m out of my house. Fortunately, my house, ... the fire got very close but my house survived.

      "PARK CITY, Utah -- The Sundance Film Festival welcomed back three Oscar-winning documentary filmmakers to help kick off the annual independent film showcase in Park City, Utah.",
      "On Thursday night at The Ray Theater, \u201c20 Days in Mariupol\u201d filmmaker Mstyslav Chernov, who won the Oscar last year, debuted his latest dispatch from Ukraine, \u201c2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d a harrowing journey to the front lines of a 2023 counteroffensive. A few hours later, at the Eccles, Ahmir \u201cQuestlove\u201d Thompson, who won an Oscar for \u201cSummer of Soul\u201d in 2022, unveiled his Sly Stone portrait, \u201cSLY LIVES! (aka The Burden of Black Genuis).\u201d Earlier, \u201cOne Day in September\u201d filmmaker Kevin MacDonald also showcased his film \u201cOne to One: John & Yoko,\u201d which debuted last year at the Venice Film Festival and will get an IMAX release on April 11 before hitting Max later this year.",
      "Some critics reflected that \u201c2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d a joint production between The Associated Press and PBS Frontline, was even more powerful than \u201c20 Days in Mariupol.\u201d \u201cSLY LIVES!\u201d (on Hulu Feb. 13) was called \u201csublime\u201d and \u201cilluminating\u201d in its examination of an underappreciated, shapeshifting genius.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been coming here since 2000 and I thought the coolest thing you could do would be to DJ an after party,\u201d Thompson said before the screening. \u201cI never dreamt this for my future, so this is really humbling.\u201d",
      "It was a full-circle end to a day that began with a slate of documentary Oscar nominations all connected to the Sundance Institute in some way. Some were supported by the Institute, some debuted at the festival as recently as last year.",
      "\u201cBlack Box Diaries,\u201d in which a Japanese filmmaker investigates her own sexual assault, had its premiere in Park City last year and was supported by the Institute\u2019s doc film program. \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d made by a Palestinian-Israeli collective, was also supported by the film fund. \u201cPorcelain War,\u201d about Ukrainian artists in wartime, debuted at the festival in 2024, where it won the grand jury prize. \u201cSoundtrack to a Coup d\u2019Etat,\u201d about the assassination of Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba in 1961, also launched last year and won a special jury prize. And, finally, \u201cSugarcane,\u201d a 2024 festival premiere investing abuse and missing children at an Indian residential school, was supported by a Sundance grant.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really special,\u201d said Basil Tsiokos, a Sundance senior programmer. \u201cIt does speak to what Sundance brings to the artistic community and to the support that we show to artists out there.\u201d",
      "On Friday night, \u201cSugarcane\u201d filmmakers Julian Brave NoiseCat and Emily Kassie are also being given an award at the Institute\u2019s fundraising gala. Newly anointed Oscar nominees James Mangold and Cynthia Erivo are also being honored.",
      "It\u2019s not lost on those who program for the festival and run the artists programs how crucial that initial support can be for someone trying to make a documentary.",
      "\u201cThe funding landscape is challenging, particularly in the nonfiction space,\u201d Tsiokos said. \u201cGetting early support from the artists programs, from the documentary feature programs is sort of a stamp of approval, of encouragement that helps other funders come in later on to take a seed of an idea and bring it into fruition.\u201d",
      "The Oscars and Sundance have long been connected, especially in the documentary space. For the past 25 years, there has been at least one Sundance movie every year that goes on to get an Oscar nomination. Some that have won the statuette include \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth,\u201d \u201cMan on Wire,\u201d \u201cSearching for Sugar Man,\u201d \u201c20 Feet From Stardom,\u201d \u201cIcarus,\u201d \u201cAmerican Factory\u201d and \u201cNavalny.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe just provide a space for the films,\u201d Tsiokos said. \u201cThe films are from the artists. They\u2019re the ones with the vision to make these films possible. We provide them a platform to be able to meet their audiences. That\u2019s quite an important role that we take very seriously.\u201d",
      "This year, the festival has about 40 feature documentaries premiering across sections on everything from Marlee Matlin and Selena Quintanilla, to one about Nairobi women transforming a formerly whites-only library into a cultural hub, to another on Florida\u2019s stand-your-ground laws. While it\u2019s difficult to project what might be in the Oscar race next year, Tsiokos has observed one trend that might help audiences pick and choose.",
      "\u201cThe influence of the international voters is growing. In the last couple of years especially, most of the nominees for the Oscar race tend to be international titles,\u201d Tsiokos said. \u201cI would tell people to make sure to check out the World Cinema Documentary Competition. There are some real gems.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Prosecutors say they won\u2019t charge rocker Marilyn Manson after a years-long investigation into sexual assault and domestic violence allegations",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Prosecutors said Friday that they will not file charges against Marilyn Manson after a years-long investigation of allegations of sexual assault and domestic violence.",
      "Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said the allegations are too old under the law and the evidence is not sufficient to charge the 56-year-old shock rocker whose legal name is Brian Warner.",
      "\u201cWe have determined that allegations of domestic violence fall outside of the statute of limitations, and we cannot prove charges of sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d Hochman said. \u201cWe recognize and applaud the courage and resilience of the women who came forward to make reports and share their experiences, and we thank them for their cooperation and patience with the investigation.\u201d",
      "Nearly four years after the investigation began, then-District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n said on Oct. 9 that his office was pursuing new leads that added to the \u201calready extensive\u201d file that authorities had amassed.",
      "LA County sheriff\u2019s detectives said early in 2021 that they were investigating Manson for incidents between 2009 and 2011 in West Hollywood, where Manson lived at the time. The probe included a search warrant that was served on his West Hollywood home. The case was initially turned over to prosecutors in September 2021, but the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office requested more evidence-gathering and the investigation resumed.",
      "\u201cWe are very pleased that, after a thorough and incredibly lengthy review of all of the actual evidence, the District Attorney has concluded what we knew and expressed from the start \u2014 Brian Warner is innocent,\u201d his attorney, Howard King, said in a statement.",
      "The identities of the women police and prosecutors spoke to were not revealed, but \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor Esm\u00e9 Bianco \u2014 who sued Manson in a case that has been settled \u2014 said she was part of the criminal investigation. Before the decision not to prosecute, she criticized how long the process was taking at a rally for Hochman, who was elected soon after.",
      "\u201cAlmost four years ago, I did what victims of rape are supposed to do: I went to the police,\u201d she said on Oct. 10. \u201cI described to them in agonizing detail how the rock musician Brian Warner \u2014 better known by his stage name Marilyn Manson \u2014 had raped and abused me over the course of our relationship.\u201d",
      "Bianco said she gave investigators \u201chundreds of pieces of evidence, including photos of my body covered in bites, bruises and knife wounds, emails and text messages, threats to my immigration status.\u201d",
      "In her lawsuit, Bianco alleged sexual, physical and emotional abuse, and said that Manson violated human trafficking law by bringing her to California from England for non-existent roles in music videos and movies.",
      "\u201cWhilst I am deeply disappointed by the decision of the District Attorney to not bring charges in the case against Brian Warner, I am sadly not surprised,\u201d Bianco said in a statement released by her lawyer. \u201cOnce again, our justice system has failed survivors. Not the individual prosecutors and detectives who worked for years on this case, but the system that made them do so with one hand tied behind their collective backs.\u201d",
      "In 2021 Manson's former fianc\u00e9e, \u201cWestworld\u201d actor Evan Rachel Wood, named him as her abuser for the first time in an Instagram post.",
      "Wood and Manson\u2019s relationship became public in 2007 when he was 38 and she was 19, and they were briefly engaged in 2010 before breaking up.",
      "\u201cHe started grooming me when I was a teenager and horrifically abused me for years,\u201d Wood said.",
      "Manson replied on Instagram that these were \u201chorrible distortions of reality.\u201d He sued Wood, saying she and another woman fabricated accusations against him and convinced others to do the same. A judge threw out significant sections of the suit, then in November, Manson agreed to drop it and pay Wood's attorney fees.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they\u2019ve been sexually abused, unless they come forward publicly as Bianco and Wood have done.",
      "Other women sued Manson in the months after Wood came forward. Wood's representative did not immedately return a message Friday.",
      "Manson emerged as a musical star in the mid-1990s, known as much for courting public controversy as for hit songs like \u201cThe Beautiful People\u201d and hit album\u2019s like 1996\u2019s \u201cAntichrist Superstar\u201d and 1998\u2019s \u201cMechanical Animals.\u201d"

      "Junya Watanabe has opened his latest menswear show at Paris Fashion Week with beige hunting jackets paired with discreet shirts and ties",
      "PARIS -- Beige hunting jackets with oversized pockets, paired with discreet shirts and ties, opened Junya Watanabe\u2019s latest menswear show at Paris Fashion Week Friday.",
      "It was a deceptively classic start for the avant-garde Japanese designer, whose signature knack for subversive tailoring and patchwork soon disrupted conventions.",
      "What looked like classic Americana \u2014 thick denim jeans, caps, and check shirts \u2014 quickly morphed into something far less predictable. Exaggerated blown-up check pants in red with dramatic turn-ups injected a sense of whimsy, as did splashes of vivid color. A pale yellow jacket and a tactile padded coat in soft pastels softened the masculinity, reworking the rugged aesthetic into something gender-fluid.",
      "Flashes of bold hues, from vibrant red to bright blue checks, became a defining motif. The palette danced across reimagined hunting jackets and distinctly masculine silhouettes, which were disrupted by the designer\u2019s famed use of patchwork. Here, it wasn\u2019t just a technique but a conceptual statement \u2014 ideas and styles stitched together, creating contradictions.",
      "Hunting jackets might evoke tradition, but here they felt fresh, even irreverent, with their clever layering of fabrics and unexpected details. The collection demonstrated Watanabe\u2019s mastery in blending the familiar with the avant-garde, offering a \u201cbro\u201d aesthetic turned on its head by bursts of feminine color.",
      "The recurring themes of denim and disruptive tailoring felt polished yet safe, lacking the urgency or political edge that defined his earlier work."

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s famous name, populist stances and loyal following have earned him President Donald Trump's support, but will that get him the votes he needs from the Republican-controlled Senate to become the nation's top health official?",
      "If approved, Kennedy will control a $1.7 trillion agency that oversees food and hospital inspections, hundreds of health clinics, vaccine recommendations and health insurance for roughly half the country.",
      "His confirmation hearings are set before the Senate finance committee on Wednesday and the Health, Education, Labor and Pension committee on Thursday.",
      "Here's what to watch during his confirmation hearings:",
      "Over many years, Kennedy has been clear about his beliefs on vaccines in dozens of interviews, podcasts and social media posts.",
      "He's headed up a nonprofit that has sued the government over its authorizations of vaccines. He's said there is \u201c no vaccine that is safe and effective,\" and repeatedly called for further study of routine childhood vaccinations, despite decades of research and real-world use that proves they've safely prevented disease.",
      "But more recently, Kennedy has tried to downplay his past remarks and work, saying he's not anti-vaccine and promising not to \u201ctake away\u201d the shots.",
      "The health committee chairman, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., also has expressed concerns about Kennedy's anti-vaccine work. A physician, Cassidy said earlier this month he \u201chad a frank conversation\u201d and \u201cspoke about vaccines at length\u201d with Kennedy. On Tuesday, Cassidy told reporters that he is still unsure if he is backing Trump\u2019s nominee.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still working through it,\u201d Cassidy said during a press availability with Louisiana reporters on Tuesday. \u201cI look forward to the hearings and I will allow that to guide my decision.\u201d",
      "The intensity of the questioning on vaccines over the next two days could provide clues for how other Republicans \u2014 like Sen. Mitch McConnell, a polio survivor who represents Kentucky \u2014 might consider Kennedy\u2019s nomination.",
      "Some of the country's most conservative lawmakers have been worried about how Kennedy will handle abortion as health secretary.",
      "Republican Sen. James Lankford, who sits on the finance committee, is expected to grill Kennedy, a longtime Democrat, on the issue during Wednesday's hearing. Lankford is seen as a possible \u201cno\u201d vote over Kennedy's past comments supporting abortion. Last month, the Oklahoma senator said he had a \u201cgood conversation\u201d with Kennedy but stopped short of endorsing.",
      "HHS can influence abortion and reproductive health access in a number of ways, including with millions of dollars in grants it sends to Planned Parenthood and regulations around abortion pills. Under the Biden administration, the agency also said hospitals were required to provide emergency abortions for pregnant women in medical distress.",
      "On Monday, acting HHS Secretary Dorothy Fink signaled the agency is prepared to adopt a tougher stance on abortion under Kennedy. She ordered the agency to investigate all of its programs to make sure no taxpayer money is going toward elective abortions.",
      "Kennedy needs to earn support from nearly all Senate Republicans, but he may also try to pick up a vote or two from the Democratic Party. His closest supporters and advisers have urged followers to call the offices of Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada.",
      "Another Democratic senator may also be in play: John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who met with Kennedy and has said he's open to supporting Trump's nominees.",
      "An area where Kennedy is trying to find common ground with Democratic senators: food regulations and access to healthier foods. Kennedy has said he supports Medicare and Medicaid helping people pay for healthier foods and gym memberships, an idea Democrats have lobbied for as well. He's also called for a ban on some of the ingredients used in foods, like dyes and additives.",
      "In a letter sent to U.S. senators on Tuesday, Caroline Kennedy shared shocking personal details about her cousin, saying he is not qualified for the health secretary job.",
      "Caroline Kennedy said RFK Jr.'s views on vaccines are a problem, but she also brought up her experiences growing up with him.",
      "A copy obtained by The Associated Press notes that while she admired him for overcoming a drug addiction, she said he has gone on to \u201cmisrepresent, lie, and cheat his way through life.\u201d In an extreme anecdote, she accused him of hosting drug-fueled gatherings in his basement, dorm and garage where he \u201cenjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the blender to feed his hawks.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, another cousin, former Rhode Island congressman and Democrat Patrick J. Kennedy, threw his support behind the health secretary nominee in an opinion piece for The Washington Post on Tuesday. RFK Jr. helped pull him out of addiction, Patrick J. Kennedy said.",
      "\u201cBobby was the first family member to call and offer his personal and public support, even at a time when some in my family criticized me for breaking the so-called family code of silence,\u201d he wrote.",

      "Around 70 people were killed in an attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in Sudan",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Around 70 people were killed in an attack on the only functional hospital in the besieged city of El Fasher in Sudan, the chief of the World Health Organization said Sunday, part of a series of attacks coming as the African nation's civil war escalated in recent days.",
      "The attack on the Saudi Teaching Maternal Hospital, which local officials blamed on the rebel Rapid Support Forces, came as the group was experiencing apparent battlefield losses to the Sudanese military and allied forces under the command of army chief Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan. That includes Burhan appearing near a burning oil refinery north of Khartoum on Saturday that his forces said they seized from the RSF.",
      "Saudi Arabia\u2019s Foreign Ministry denounced the attack as \u201ca violation of international law.\u201d",
      "International mediation attempts and pressure tactics, including a U.S. assessment that the RSF and its proxies are committing genocide, and sanctions targeting Burhan, haven't halted the fighting.",
      "WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted the death toll in the hospital attack in El Fasher on the social platform X.",
      "Officials and others in the capital of North Darfur province had cited a similar figure Saturday, but Tedros is the first international source to provide a casualty number. Reporting on Sudan is incredibly difficult given communication challenges, the indiscriminate violence faced by civilians and exaggerations by both the RSF and the Sudanese military. Sudan's Foreign Ministry accused the RSF of launching a drone attack targeting the hospital's emergency ward, describing the assault as a \u201cmassacre.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe appalling attack on Saudi Hospital in El Fasher, Sudan, led to 19 injuries and 70 deaths among patients and companions,\u201d Tedros wrote. \u201cAt the time of the attack, the hospital was packed with patients receiving care.\u201d",
      "Another health facility in Al Malha also was attacked Saturday, he added.",
      "\u201cWe continue to call for a cessation of all attacks on health care in Sudan, and to allow full access for the swift restoration of the facilities that have been damaged,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cAbove all, Sudan\u2019s people need peace. The best medicine is peace.\u201d",
      "Tedros didn't identify who launched the attack, though local officials had blamed the RSF for the assault. U.N. official Clementine Nkweta-Salami, who coordinates humanitarian efforts for the world body in Sudan, warned Thursday that the RSF earlier had given \u201ca 48-hour ultimatum to forces allied to the Sudanese Armed Forces to vacate the city and indicated a forthcoming offensive.\u201d",
      "\u201cSince May 2024, El Fasher has been under RSF siege,\u201d she said. \u201cCivilians in El Fasher have already endured months of suffering, violence and gross human rights abuses under the prolonged siege. Their lives now hang in the balance due to an increasingly precarious situation.\u201d",
      "The RSF didn't immediately acknowledge the attack in El Fasher, which is more than 800 kilometers (500 miles) southwest of Khartoum. The city is now estimated to be home to more than 1 million people, many of whom have been displaced by the war.",
      "The U.N. said in December that the RSF siege had killed 782 civilians and wounded more than 1,140 others, warning that the figures likely were higher.",
      "The Saudi hospital, just north of El Fasher's airport, sits near the front lines of the war and has been repeatedly hit by shelling. Still, its doctors continue surgeries, sometimes by the light of cellphones while the hospital is hit.",
      "However, the RSF appeared in recent days to have lost control of the Khartoum refinery, the biggest in Sudan and crucial to both its economy and that of South Sudan. Burhan's forces also say they broke another RSF besiegement of the Signal Corps headquarters in northern Khartoum. The rebels claimed they were \u201ctightening the noose\u201d around that base.",
      "Sudan has been unstable since a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime dictator Omar al-Bashir in 2019. A short-lived transition to democracy was derailed when Burhan and Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo of the RSF joined forces to lead a military coup in October 2021.",
      "Al-Bashir faces charges at the International Criminal Court over carrying out a genocidal campaign in the early 2000s in the western Darfur region with the Janjaweed, the precursor to the RSF. Rights groups and the U.N. say the RSF and allied Arab militias are again attacking ethnic African groups in this war.",
      "The RSF and Sudan\u2019s military began fighting each other in April 2023. Their conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine sweeps parts of the country.",
      "Other estimates suggest a far higher death toll in the civil war.",
      "On Sunday, Burhan traveled to the military's General Command headquarters in Khartoum, a building he hadn't been to since the fighting broke out in 2023. The headquarters is near Khartoum International Airport, which has seen fierce fighting during the war.",
      "\u201cThe armed forces are in their best condition and we will move forward with the determination of our people to eliminate the rebellion in all of Sudan,\u201d Burhan said, according to the state-run SUNA news agency.",

      "Weeks after the worst of the deadly fires tore through Los Angeles suburbs, families are grappling with the reality that toxic ash from burned cars and homes could be a health issue for awhile, especially for children",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Kelli Ferrone wiped blinds and window sills inside her daughters\u2019 elementary school, just a half mile from the devastating Palisades Fire that scorched the coastal enclave in Los Angeles. The cotton swabs and wipes came up black.",
      "There is scattered ash and soot at her feet. Outside, it's on the ground next to a playground.",
      "Ferrone, who recorded videos and shared them with The Associated Press, wanted to see for herself this week if Canyon Charter Elementary School had been adequately cleaned before the school reopens. She wasn't impressed.",
      "Weeks after the most intense days of fire across the Los Angeles area, parents are grappling with the reality that toxic ash from burned homes and cars could be harmful to their children. It's a risk that is becoming more common as wildfires burn in cities.",
      "In the Pacific Palisades, Canyon Charter could reopen as soon as Monday. School officials say staff are working hard to make sure schools are clean and safe and they're confident in their decision. But some parents feel the school is rushing to open. They're urging officials to temporarily relocate, while others try to transfer their students elsewhere.",
      "\u201cThe (Los Angeles Unified School District) has never experienced a disaster like this in their history,\" said Ferrone, who has two daughters at the school, one with asthma. \"And I do think people are trying really hard, but our school needs a new temporary home with classrooms and teachers teaching in-person. That is the only thing that is going to make people feel comfortable.\u201d",
      "In a statement, LAUSD said staff \u201chas worked diligently to prepare schools for a return to in-person instruction.\u201d That includes inspecting ventilation systems, replacing filters and installing air purifiers in classrooms and offices, and cleaning inside and outdoors. An environmental consultant is inspecting campuses. Staff monitors air quality. The district has an Office of Environmental Health and Safety and is following its protocols.",
      "Some schools are within a \u201cdo not drink water\u201d advisory, including Canyon Charter. That means fountains are turned off and bottled water is provided, the district said.",
      "Dr. Lisa Patel, a pediatrician and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, said the school is taking all the right steps. Yet, she said, \u201cthere\u2019s no zero risk.\"",
      "The ash is a toxic soup of incinerated cars, electronics, batteries, building materials, paints, furniture and every other kind of personal belonging. It contains pesticides, asbestos, plastics and lead, all of which children are more vulnerable to.",
      "\u201cChildren often have more hand-to-mouth behavior and their bodies are rapidly growing in these first few years, and so they can be more sensitive to this type of pollution,\" said Patel. \"There will be a risk for a while to come in terms of exposure.\u201d",
      "Some materials form reactive chemical compounds when they burn.",
      "Scientists still don't know the long-term health impacts of exposure to massive urban fire like this year's in California or the one in Maui, Hawaii in 2023. Three schools in Lahaina didn't reopen for two months after that. But some chemicals have been linked to heart disease and lung issues, while exposure to minerals like magnetite, which can form when fire burns iron, has been associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",
      "In Pasadena, Emily Stough is trying to minimize the risks for her 11- and 14-year-old who returned to Blair High School, which includes a middle school, this week. She made sure they took masks. In an email to parents last week, the Pasadena Unified School District said some 38 tons of outdoor debris have been hauled away from campuses, and they will only open \u201cafter rigorous cleaning and sanitizing and environmental tests.\"",
      "Stough said she trusts the district to do its due diligence, but she wants more information.",
      "\u201cDid they test air quality? Did they test ash samples? Were the ash samples from inside the school, in the hallways, from outside the schools?,\" she wonders. \"Air quality both inside and outside the schools? I\u2019d like to see that. I\u2019d like to know what cleaning was done.\u201d",
      "The PUSD did not respond to questions from the AP.",
      "It\u2019s hard to know how long these fire toxins will stay in the environment, said Patel, but it could be a few months. Strong winds like the Santa Anas could also blow them distances where they could enter soil and groundwater.",
      "Plastics in particular could last a long time, said Dr. Ilan Shapiro, medical affairs officer for AltaMed and a fellow with the American Academy of Pediatrics. \u201cAnd we need to remember that the fires are still going. That we still have burn materials coming out.\" As communities recover and clean up, that ash will be moved again, he said.",
      "Longfellow Elementary School in Pasadena is set to reopen next week, but Tanya Reyes doesn\u2019t plan to send her kids back just yet. The school is about two miles from where the Eaton Fire burned down the home they rented. Even with the school's safety measures, \u201cmy gut is saying \u2018no,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be around that area. It\u2019s too soon.\u201d",
      "Her family is staying in West Hollywood, and she\u2019s looking for schools there, somewhere the kids can attend for a little while. She's considering home schooling, too, but still figuring it all out.",
      "It's hard for parents because they understand all the ways kids need school.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been through this in so many different ways, whether it\u2019s been wildfire smoke or the pandemic,\u201d Patel said. \u201cWhen kids miss school, that is also a detriment to their health. It impacts their learning, it impacts their socioemotional development, their sense of connection and community during a time of crisis.\"",

      "President Trump\u2019s first week in office included a flurry of executive orders with implications for Earth\u2019s climate and environment",
      "President Trump's first week in office included a flurry of executive orders with implications for Earth's climate and environment.",
      "While former President Joe Biden made climate change a hallmark of his administration and some of his policies remain, at least for now, Trump is quickly unraveling that.",
      "Experts say Trump's moves to step away from global climate action, ramp up domestic oil and gas production and remove incentives for electric vehicles are worrisome as the planet continues to heat up. 2024 was Earth's hottest year on record, and climate scientists say the rising heat is contributing to extreme weather affecting millions.",
      "\u201cThese orders will make our air dirtier, make people sicker, make energy more expensive, and make our communities less prepared for extreme weather,\" wrote Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, a marine biologist, policy expert and author who co-founded the non-profit think tank Urban Ocean Lab.",
      "Here are some of Trump's most notable moves affecting climate and environmental issues in his first week:",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday directing the United States to again withdraw from the landmark Paris climate agreement aimed at global cooperation on climate change.",
      "The agreement requires participating countries to come up with nationally determined contributions to the effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions that are heating the planet. Trump's move means the federal government won't be trying to meet emissions reductions goals, nor any financial commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.",
      "\u201cWalking away from the Paris Agreement won\u2019t protect Americans from climate impacts, but it will hand China and the European Union a competitive edge in the booming clean energy economy and lead to fewer opportunities for American workers,\u201d said Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of the World Resources Institute.",
      "Trump declared an energy emergency via executive order earlier this week amid a promise to \u201cdrill, baby, drill.\u201d",
      "The order urges oil and gas expansion including through federal use of eminent domain and the Defense Production Act, which allow the government to use private land and resources to produce goods deemed to be a national necessity.",
      "Experts dispute his description of an \u201cinadequate energy supply\u201d as part of the basis for the order.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that the United States is well-supplied with energy in all of its forms,\u201d said Gary Dirks, senior director of the Global Futures Laboratory at Arizona State University. Dirks said he thinks the move is actually more targeted at bringing down prices at the pump.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that the United States right now is the largest producer of oil of any nation in history. And we got to that point under the Biden administration, not because of the Biden administration\u2019s policies necessarily, but because of policies that have been ongoing for four decades,\u201d he said.",
      "One section of the order declaring an energy emergency states that the Endangered Species Act cannot be an obstacle to energy development.",
      "The Endangered Species Act has been a hurdle for the development of fossil fuels in the U.S. for decades, and weakening it would accelerate the decline and potential extinction of numerous endangered species, including whales and sea turtles, said Gib Brogan, a campaign director with conservation group Oceana.",
      "Trump also opened up areas in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling. Biden had previously both restricted and approved drilling in other parts of the Arctic, part of a long process mired in litigation and complicated by political battles.",
      "\u201cI would begin by pointing out that there was an attempt to lease for oil drilling recently and nobody bid,\u201d Dirks said. \u201cI don\u2019t actually think that the Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge is an exciting place for oil and gas exploration.\u201d",
      "But he expressed concern about preserving biodiversity, something other scientists and environmental groups have highlighted.",
      "\u201cThe Arctic is a very fragile system,\u201d said Peter Schlosser, vice president and vice provost of global futures at Arizona State. Schlosser added that drilling there would disrupt the land and sea, and that potential contamination or oil spills are more difficult to clean up there due to low temperatures.",
      "Trump promised to eliminate what he incorrectly calls Biden's \u201celectric vehicle mandate.\"",
      "What that means in practice is that the order will revoke a non-binding goal set by Biden to have EVs make up half of new cars sold by 2030. He will also likely seek repeal of a $7,500 tax credit for new EV purchases approved by Congress as part of Biden\u2019s landmark 2022 climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "All of that is likely frustrating for automakers, who have to make long-term decisions, said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at auto-buying research firm Edmunds. As the rest of the world moves to electric cars, automakers have to decide how to factor in the global direction the industry is headed alongside the sudden lack of federal support.",
      "\u201cWe do think that the long-term end goal here is going to be electrification. It\u2019s just the timeline it seems is uncertain right now,\u201d she said.",
      "When the government reviews new facilities that emit pollution, officials are no longer likely to consider a concept known as environmental justice, or how that new pollution will add to the emissions that have tended to fall more heavily on poor and minority communities.",
      "Those are sweeping moves that Rena Payan, chief program officer at nonprofit Justice Outside, called \u201crolling back decades of progress in addressing environmental discrimination.\u201d",
      "That means more of a burden for state and local groups to fight to protect those communities. Trump\u2019s decision to cut off support will hurt, but many of these organizations are used to operating without federal support \u2014 they have done so for years, according to Peggy Shepard, co-founder and executive director of WE ACT for Environmental Justice.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m grappling right now with is both the grief of these losses, and the fact that we were on an upward swing, if you will, just weeks ago,\u201d said Jade Begay, an Indigenous rights and climate organizer.",

      "Vaccination bills are popping up in more than 15 states as lawmakers aim to potentially resurrect or create new religious exemptions from immunization mandates, establish state-level vaccine injury databases or dictate what providers must tell patients...",
      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) \u2014 Vaccination bills are popping up in more than 15 states as lawmakers aim to potentially resurrect or create new religious exemptions from immunization mandates, establish state-level vaccine injury databases or dictate what providers must tell patients about the shots.",
      "Many see a political opportunity to rewrite policies in their states after President Donald Trump's return to the White House and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 's nomination as the next secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The agency oversees virtually every aspect of vaccination efforts in the U.S., from funding their development to establishing recommendations for medical providers to distributing vaccines and covering them through federal programs.",
      "Childhood vaccination rates against dangerous infections like measles and polio continue to fall nationwide, and the number of parents claiming non-medical exemptions so their kids don't get required shots is rising.",
      "In 2024, whooping cough cases reached a decade-high and 16 measles outbreaks, the largest among them in Chicago and Minnesota, put health officials on edge. Most states are below the 95% vaccination threshold for kindergartners \u2014 the level needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.",
      "About half of Americans are \u201cvery\u201d or \u201cextremely\u201d concerned that those declining childhood vaccination rates will lead to more outbreaks, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Yet only about 4 in 10 Americans oppose reconsidering the government\u2019s recommendations for widely used vaccines, while roughly 3 in 10 are in favor. The rest \u2014 about 3 in 10 \u2014 are neutral.",
      "Scott Burris, director of Temple University\u2019s Center for Public Health Law Research, has tracked public health legislation for years, and watched backlash against COVID-19 vaccines grow to include more routine vaccines as anti-vaccine activists take hold of powerful political pulpits.",
      "\u201cI think COVID and the politics gave standard vaccine denialists a lot of wind in their sails,\" he said.",
      "It's hard to predict what will pass into law in the states, Burris said, considering the vast majority of proposed bills in any state go nowhere. But the proposed legislation offers a glimpse into lawmakers\u2019 thoughts, and what else might follow.",
      "Religious exemptions for school vaccine requirements are among the most popular proposals so far. Lawmakers in New York, Virginia, Connecticut and Mississippi have introduced bills that would allow more people to waive routine shots. Indiana lawmakers will weigh religious exemptions for medical students.",
      "Earlier this month, West Virginia Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order on his first day in office that enabled families to receive religious exemptions from required school vaccinations.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a huge step,\" said Brian Festa, co-founder of the law firm We The Patriots USA, which works on vaccination-related cases throughout the country. \"That\u2019s a state that never had a religious exemption.\u201d",
      "Now, only four states allow just a medical exemption from childcare and K-12 immunization requirements: Connecticut, California, New York and Maine.",
      "Festa credited West Virginia's new religious exemption to Trump's nomination of Kennedy, as well as a 2023 federal court ruling that required Mississippi to allow residents to cite religious beliefs when seeking exemptions from state-mandated vaccinations for children.",
      "\u201cI think the writing\u2019s on the wall and they did feel the pressure,\u201d Festa said of West Virginia.",
      "In Connecticut, at least four Republican bills will try to revive the state's religious exemption for schools, colleges and daycares \u2014 something a contentious 2021 state law eliminated for students without an existing exemption.",
      "Connecticut health experts said at the time there was a slow but steady increase in the number of religious exemptions and declining vaccination rates in some schools. The state has historically maintained some of the highest childhood vaccination rates in the county, and in the 2023-2024 school year, more than 97% of kindergarteners protected against chickenpox, measles, tetanus, diphtheria, polio and more.",
      "Given that the U.S. Supreme Court last year rejected a challenge to the Connecticut law and the statehouse is controlled by Democrats, GOP state Sen. Eric Berthel said he\u2019s not optimistic legislative leaders will allow debate on his exemption bill, but does believe the broader cultural shift means \u201cmaybe there is a bit of an appetite to look at things like this again.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that we\u2019re not being fair to families who have a true faith-based reason to not vaccinate their child,\u201d he said.",
      "There's one outlier so far among statehouse trends on exemptions. Hawaii, where legislators are looking to move in the opposite direction with a bill to eliminate all non-medical waivers after struggling for years with high exemption rates.",
      "Other vaccine-related bills touch on some of the opposition that's been growing since the pandemic.",
      "Oklahoma and Alabama have proposals that would require parental consent for any vaccine given to minors. Bills in Wyoming, Oregon and Oklahoma would prohibit \u201cdiscrimination\u201d against people who aren\u2019t vaccinated against COVID-19 or other diseases.",
      "New York and Oklahoma have bills that would require providers to give people getting shots a full ingredient list, and Florida legislation would ban edible vaccines, though none are approved for use in the U.S. and research is still in early stages.",
      "Vaccine injury is also a popular topic, and bills in Indiana and North Dakota propose creating state versions of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System \u2014 a federal database that drew the attention of vaccine skeptics during the pandemic. Anyone can file a report about a potential issue after a vaccine, though the CDC\u2019s website notes a report doesn\u2019t prove the shot caused a health issue.",
      "North Dakota Republican state Sen. Dick Anderson said he's not against people getting vaccines \u2014 he got one COVID-19 shot himself \u2014 but proposed the bill because many people don't trust the CDC.",
      "\u201cWe have to do something to restore trust in the system,\" Anderson said.",
      "But experts note state databases are unnecessarily duplicative.",
      "\u201cA lot of these proposals, they're trying to fix something that's not broken and really working to counter the goal of preventing the spread of communicable disease,\u201d said Andy Baker-White, senior director of state health policy for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.",
      "Policy should be focused on getting rid of barriers to vaccination, not adding to them, said Dr. Susan Kressly, a pediatrician and president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Many families miss vaccinations not because of ideology, she said, but because of lack of transportation or not having primary care doctors or clinics nearby, among other things.",
      "But because most Americans are vaccinated, they haven't seen the effects of dangerous infections like bacterial meningitis that Kressly fielded calls about from fearful parents early in her career.",

      "\"What [RECOVER] lacks, really, is clarity of vision and clarity of purpose,\" said Al-Aly, saying he agrees that the NIH has had enough time and money to produce more meaningful progress.",
      "",
      "Now the NIH is starting to determine how to allocate an additional $662 million of funding for long COVID research, $300 million of which is earmarked for clinical trials. These funds will be allocated over the next 4 years. At the end of October, RECOVER issued a request for clinical trial ideas that look at potential therapies, including medications, saying its goal is \"to work rapidly, collaboratively, and transparently to advance treatments for long COVID.\"",
      "",
      "This turn suggests the NIH has begun to respond to patients. This has stirred cautious optimism among those who say that the agency's approach to long COVID has lacked urgency in the search for effective treatments. Stone calls this $300 million a down payment. She warns it's going to take a lot more money to help people like Hayes regain some degree of health. \"There really is a burden to make up this lost time now,\" Stone said.",
      "",
      "The NIH told KFF Health News and NPR via email that it recognizes the urgency in finding treatments. But to do that, there needs to be an understanding of the biological mechanisms that are making people sick, which is difficult to do with post-infectious conditions.",
      "",
      "That's why it has funded research into how long COVID affects lung function, or trying to understand why only some people are afflicted with the condition.",
      "",
      "Good Science Takes Time",
      "",
      "In December 2020, Congress appropriated $1.15 billion for the NIH to launch RECOVER, raising hopes in the long COVID patient community.",
      "",
      "Then-NIH Director Francis Collins, MD, PhD, explained that RECOVER's goal was to better understand long COVID as a disease and that clinical trials of potential treatments would come later.",
      "",
      "According to RECOVER's website, it has funded eight clinical trials to test the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment or intervention. Just one of those trials has published results.",
      "",
      "On the other hand, RECOVER has supported more than 200 observational studies, such as research on how long COVID affects pulmonary function and on which symptoms are most common. And the initiative has funded more than 40 pathobiology studies, which focus on the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms of long COVID.",
      "",
      "RECOVER's website says this research has led to crucial insights on the risk factors for developing long COVID and on understanding how the disease interacts with preexisting conditions.",
      "",
      "It notes that observational studies are important in helping scientists to design and launch evidence-based clinical trials.",
      "",
      "Good science takes time, said Leora Horwitz, MD, the co-principal investigator for the RECOVER-Adult Observational Cohort at New York University (NYU). And long COVID is an \"exceedingly complicated\" illness that appears to affect nearly every organ system, she said.",
      "",
      "This makes it more difficult to study than many other diseases. Because long COVID harms the body in so many ways, with widely variable symptoms, it's harder to identify precise targets for treatment.",
      "",
      "\"I also will remind you that we're only 3, 4 years into this pandemic for most people,\" Horwitz said. \"We've been spending much more money than this, yearly, for 30, 40 years on other conditions.\"",
      "",
      "NYU received nearly $470 million of RECOVER funds in 2021, which the institution is using to spearhead the collection of data and biospecimens from up to 40,000 patients. Horwitz said nearly 30,000 are enrolled so far.",
      "",
      "This vast repository, Horwitz said, supports ongoing observational research, allowing scientists to understand what is happening biologically to people who don't recover after an initial infection  --  and that will help determine which clinical trials for treatments are worth undertaking.",
      "",
      "\"Simply trying treatments because they are available without any evidence about whether or why they may be effective reduces the likelihood of successful trials and may put patients at risk of harm,\" she said.",
      "",
      "Delayed Hopes or Incremental Progress?",
      "",
      "The NIH told KFF Health News and NPR that patients and caregivers have been central to RECOVER from the beginning, \"playing critical roles in designing studies and clinical trials, responding to surveys, serving on governance and publication groups, and guiding the initiative.\" But the consensus from patient advocacy groups is that RECOVER should have done more to prioritize clinical trials from the outset. Patients also say RECOVER leadership ignored their priorities and experiences when determining which studies to fund.",
      "",
      "RECOVER has scored some gains, said JD Davids, co-director of Long COVID Justice. This includes findings on differences in long COVID between adults and kids. But Davids said the NIH shouldn't have named the initiative \"RECOVER,\" since it wasn't designed as a streamlined effort to develop treatments.",
      "",
      "\"The name's a little cruel and misleading,\" he said.",
      "",
      "RECOVER's initial allocation of $1.15 billion probably wasn't enough to develop a new medication to treat long COVID, said Ezekiel J. Emanuel, MD, PhD, co-director of the University of Pennsylvania's Healthcare Transformation Institute.",
      "",
      "But, he said, the results of preliminary clinical trials could have spurred pharmaceutical companies to fund more studies on drug development and test how existing drugs influence a patient's immune response.",
      "",
      "Emanuel is one of the authors of a March 2022 COVID roadmap report. He notes that RECOVER's lack of focus on new treatments was a problem. \"Only 15% of the budget is for clinical studies. That is a failure in itself  --  a failure of having the right priorities,\" he told KFF Health News and NPR via email.",
      "",
      "And though the NYU biobank has been impactful, Emanuel said there needs to be more focus on how existing drugs influence immune response.",
      "",
      "He said some clinical trials that RECOVER has funded are \"ridiculous,\" because they've focused on symptom amelioration, for example to study the benefits of over-the-counter medication to improve sleep. Other studies looked at non-pharmacological interventions, such as exercise and \"brain training\" to help with cognitive fog.",
      "",
      "People with long COVID say this type of clinical research contributes to what many describe as the \"gaslighting\" they experience from doctors, who sometimes blame a patient's symptoms on anxiety or depression, rather than acknowledging long COVID as a real illness with a physiological basis.",

      "",
      "Insurance Battles Over Experimental Treatments",
      "",
      "Since there are still no long COVID treatments approved by the FDA, anything a physician prescribes is classified as either experimental  --  for unproven treatments  --  or an off-label use of a drug approved for other conditions. This means patients can struggle to get insurance to cover prescriptions.",
      "",
      "Michael Brode, MD, medical director for UT Health Austin's Post-COVID-19 Program  --  said he writes many appeal letters. And some people pay for their own treatment.",

      "For example, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, low-dose naltrexone, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy are all promising treatments, he said.",
      "",
      "For hyperbaric oxygen, two small, randomized controlled studies show improvements for the chronic fatigue and brain fog that often plague long COVID patients. The theory is that higher oxygen concentration and increased air pressure can help heal tissues that were damaged during a COVID infection.",
      "",
      "However, the out-of-pocket cost for a series of sessions in a hyperbaric chamber can run as much as $8,000, Brode said.",
      "",
      "\"Am I going to look a patient in the eye and say, 'You need to spend that money for an unproven treatment'?\" he said. \"I don't want to hype up a treatment that is still experimental. But I also don't want to hide it.\"",
      "",
      "There's a host of pharmaceuticals that have promising off-label uses for long COVID, said microbiologist Amy Proal, PhD, president and chief scientific officer at the Massachusetts-based PolyBio Research Foundation. For instance, she's collaborating on a clinical study that repurposes two HIV drugs to treat long COVID.",
      "",
      "Proal said research on treatments can move forward based on what's already understood about the disease. For instance, she said that scientists have evidence  --  partly due to RECOVER research  --  that some patients continue to harbor small amounts of viral material after a COVID infection. She has not received RECOVER funds but is researching antivirals.",

      "But to vet a range of possible treatments for the millions suffering now  --  and to develop new drugs specifically targeting long COVID  --  clinical trials are needed. And that requires money.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s impossible, I can\u2019t negotiate,\u201d Mulino said when asked about returning the canal to U.S. control. \u201cThat is done. The canal belongs to Panama.\u201d",
      "The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that I want is to clear all the garbage from the path, clean the table and be able to speak with the United States and very frankly\u201d about issues including immigration, security and the fight against drug trafficking, Mulino said.",

But an uproar ensued after Williamson said in a television interview that aired on Swiss television just before the pope's decree was made public that he didn't believe Jews were killed in gas chambers during World War II.",
      "The scandal was an acute embarrassment for the German-born pope, who later acknowledged mistakes in the Williamson affair and said that a simple internet search would have turned up Williamson\u2019s views.",
      "Williamson later ran afoul of the society itself, which expelled him in 2012 for insubordination. He had ignored a deadline to \u201cdeclare his submission\u201d to its authority and had called for the society\u2019s superior to resign, the group said at the time.",
      "The following year, a German court fined him for having denied the Holocaust in the 2009 television interview. Holocaust denial is a crime in Germany.",
      "In announcing Williamson\u2019s death, the society said that Williamson had been ordained a priest by Lefebvre in 1976 and had taught in the society\u2019s seminaries in Europe, the U.S. and Argentina. He had also served in a leadership position as second assistant general from 1988-1994.",

      "PRAYAGRAJ, India -- Grieving families cremated their loved ones while others cared for their injured relatives in hospitals on Thursday, a day after a stampede killed at least 30 people and injured 60 others on a riverbank at the Maha Kumbh festival in northern India.",
      "The Uttar Pradesh state government ordered a retired judge to investigate the stampede and submit his findings within a month as millions of Hindus continued the bathing ritual without a break as part of the festival in Prayagraj.",

      "Witnesses said that religious chants turned to screams and cries for help as thousands of pilgrims rushing to a sacred river confluence jumped barricades erected for a procession of holy men in Prayagraj, trampling those waiting for their turn to bathe in the river.",
      "Wednesday was a sacred day in the six-week Hindu festival, and authorities expected a record 100 million devotees to engage in a ritual bath at the confluence of the Ganges, the Yamuna and the Saraswati rivers. Hindus believe that a dip at the holy site can cleanse them of past sins and end the process of reincarnation.",
      "Nearly 400 million people are expected in Prayagraj for the festival over 45 days, making it the world\u2019s largest religious gathering. The number of people is more than the population of the United States and around 200 times the 2 million pilgrims who were in Saudi Arabia for the annual Hajj pilgrimage last year. The festival started on Jan. 13.",

      "A Ugandan health official says a nurse in the capital, Kampala, has died of Ebola, in the first recorded fatality since the last outbreak ended in 2023",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- A nurse in Uganda has died of Ebola, a health official said Thursday, in the first recorded fatality since the last outbreak ended in 2023.",
      "The 32-year-old male nurse was an employee of Mulago Hospital, the main referral facility in the capital, Kampala, Diana Atwine, permanent secretary of the health ministry, told reporters Thursday.",

      "Confirmation of Ebola in Uganda is the latest in a trend of outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers in the east African region. Tanzania declared an outbreak of the Ebola-like Marburg disease earlier this month, and in December Rwanda announced that its own outbreak of Marburg was over. The ongoing Marburg outbreak in northern Tanzania 's Kagera region has killed at least two people, according to local health authorities.",
      "Ebola, which is spread by contact with bodily fluids of an infected person or contaminated materials, manifests as a deadly hemorrhagic fever. Symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain and at times internal and external bleeding.",

      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- The European Central Bank cut its key interest rate on Thursday to boost an economy that\u2019s struggling to grow as consumers burned by inflation warily eye price tags and businesses try to navigate political turmoil in leading economies France and Germany.",
      "The cut comes a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve held off on reducing rates, underlining the contrast between more robust growth in the U.S. economy and stagnation in Europe, which recorded zero growth at the end of last year.",
      "The ECB\u2019s governing council lowered its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.75% at a meeting at its skyscraper headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany.",
      "ECB President Christine Lagarde said that \u201cthe disinflation process is well on track\u201d and that inflaton would fall to the bank's 2% target \u201cin the course of this year.\u201d",

Thursday's was the fourth rate cut in a row, and the fifth from the record benchmark high of 4%.",
      "Worries about growth have overtaken overtaking anxiety about inflation. Inflation is down from its peak of 10.6% in October 2022, although it is still somewhat above target at 2.4% in December on higher energy prices.",
      "Europe\u2019s economy stagnated at the end of last year as its former growth engine, Germany, finished a second straight year of shrinking output. Gross domestic product in the 20-country eurozone showed a zero increase in the final quarter of 2024, the EU statistics agency Eurostat said.",
      "The economy slowed from 0.4% growth in the third quarter as businesses were unsettled by possible trade disruptions under the new administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Consumers remained cautious about spending after being stung by inflation, even though inflation has come down from its peak of 10.6% in October 2022.",
      "Germany is laboring under multiple headwinds including the loss of cheap energy from Russia, choking bureaucracy and political paralysis in Berlin. Its economy contracted 0.2% in the fourth quarter.",
      "The German economy, Europe's largest, also contracted 0.2% for all of 2024, the second straight year of declining output. And the outlook for this year isn't much better. The government slashed its 2025 forecast on Wednesday to 0.3% from 1.1%.",
      "Leading European economies Germany and France are both unsettled by political turmoil that has left businesses and consumers uncertain about what the future holds in terms of government spending, regulation and taxes. Germany\u2019s political confusion could clear up after a national election on Feb. 23 following the collapse of Social Democratic Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019 governing coalition, which had been mired in months of bickering over what to do about the economy.",
      "France may take longer to emerge from paralysis, since the parliament is deeply divided and a new election can't be held until July at the earliest. Political forces are at odds over how to address the country\u2019s large budget deficit.",
      "Business prospects have been unsettled by the election of Trump, whose advocacy of new and higher import tariffs could hurt Europe's export-oriented economy. Slowing uptake of electric vehicles and Germany's cancellation of purchase subsidies for EVs has hurt demand for parts suppliers.",
      "Measures of consumer optimism such as the economic sentiment index compiled by the EU's executive commission indicate consumer are fretting over prices. It\u2019s unclear if they expect higher prices in the future, possibly due to the threat of tariffs from the new Trump administration, or if they are responding to recent price increases."

Residents near the hole have taken shelter at a local school, and there were worries Thursday about flooding and leaking sewage water. There's also been a renewed debate about Japan\u2019s aging infrastructure.",
      "Just after the sinkhole appeared in Yashio City, just northeast of Tokyo, on Tuesday morning a 3-ton truck fell into it. At first the sinkhole was roughly 10 meters (33 feet) wide and 5-meters (16-feet) deep, but it has since grown to twice that size.",

      "Saitama prefectural sewer system official Jun Uehara said corrosion, possibly because of strong acid constantly passing through the system, might have created a hole in the pipe, causing soil above to fall in and create a large hollow space between it and the road.",
      "No problem was found with the pipe during its last visual inspection, which is required every five years. The sewage water leaking out of the damaged pipe may also cause flooding.",
      "The unsteady ground, with a hollow space below it, is hampering the rescue. Television footage captured the asphalt road cracking and collapsing into the sinkhole, knocking down billboards. Authorities have tried to save the driver by lifting his truck with cranes, but they could only recover the loading platform, leaving behind the cabin where the driver is believed to be trapped. Officials have also tried without success to remove sediment and dig out the driver. They also flew a drone into the hole to see if rescue workers can climb down, but no progress has been made.",
      "Neighbors are being asked to cut back on water use. Parts of the road are closed. There's also uncertainty about how long the operations will last.",
      "About 20 residents within a 200-meter (656-feet) radius of the sinkhole have taken shelter at a local junior high school Thursday, according to the city.",
      "Over one million residents across the Saitama prefecture, especially in areas where sewage goes to the pipe, have been asked to cut back on laundry and bathing to prevent it from overflowing into the sinkhole. Prefectural officials have also started diverting sewage from an upstream pumping station and release it into a nearby river after treatment, Uehara said.",
      "When the driver is taken out, experts will enter the sinkhole and inspect the sewage system.",
      "The Land, Infrastructure and Transport Ministry has ordered a nationwide inspection of sewer systems. In one of the world\u2019s most disaster-prone countries, the sinkhole has raised worries about aging infrastructure.",
      "Most of Japan\u2019s main public infrastructure was built during the rapid economic growth of the 1960s and 1970s. The sewage pipe in Yashiro is about 40 years old."

      "GOMA, Congo -- Congo\u2019s leader called on young people to massively enlist in the army to help fight Rwanda-backed rebels who were attempting to seize more territory in the country's east as a crucial meeting of neighbors asked the Congolese government to talk with the rebels. Rwanda's leader also threatened to \u201cdeal\u201d with any confrontation from South Africa regarding the conflict.",
      "In his first public remarks since the M23 rebels advanced into eastern Congo\u2019s largest city, Goma, on Monday, President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi late Wednesday vowed \u201ca vigorous and coordinated response\u201d to push back the rebels while reaffirming his commitment to a peaceful resolution. \u201cEnlist massively in the army because you are the spearhead of our country,\u201d he urged young people.",
      "The M23 rebels in eastern Congo are backed by some 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, far more than in 2012 when they first captured Goma. They are one of more than 100 armed groups vying for control in Congo\u2019s mineral-rich east, which holds vast deposits estimated to be worth $24 trillion and critical to much of the world\u2019s technology.",
      "After capturing much of Goma, a humanitarian hub critical for the more than 6 million people displaced by the conflict in eastern Congo, witnesses said Thursday morning that the rebels were advancing towards South Kivu\u2019s provincial capital Bukavu, causing fear and panic among residents.",

Tshisekedi was conspicuously absent from the virtual summit attended by Rwanda, also a member.",
      "While African countries as well as the U.N. and U.S. have called for an immediate ceasefire, the risk of a regional war has increased, analysts say, exacerbated by the rebels' advance into South Kivu and diatribes between Rwandan and South African officials. Congo is a member of the southern Africa regional bloc and also that of east Africa, whose peacekeeping force it kicked out last year after deeming it ineffective.",
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa blamed the \u201cRwanda Defense Force militia\u201d for the fighting that has resulted in the death of 13 South African peacekeepers in eastern Congo. He also said his government will ensure the peacekeepers are \u201csufficiently supported during this critical mission.\u201d",
      "His comment drew an angry response from Rwandan President Paul Kagame who called the South African peacekeepers a \u201cbelligerent force\u201d working alongside armed groups that target Rwanda. \u201cIf South Africa prefers confrontation, Rwanda will deal with the matter in that context any day,\u201d the Rwandan leader said on X.",
      "Analysts say the real fight in eastern Congo is for control over the Congo\u2019s vast mineral deposits. M23 rebels appear to be preparing to occupy eastern Congo for good, and have told The AP of their plans to set up an administration and return displaced people to their homes.",
      "The chaotic situation with the M23 has its roots in ethnic conflict, stretching back decades to the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, when 800,000 Tutsis and others were killed by Hutus and former militias.

      "The Shahed drone blew out a wall and surrounding windows in the building in Sumy, a major city, just after 1 a.m., the Sumy regional administration said. Four people were rescued from the rubble, and a child was among the wounded, it said, adding that 120 people were evacuated.",

      "Civilians have also endured hardship caused by Russian attacks on the power grid that have denied them heating and running water. Many have been evacuated from areas along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line where Ukrainian defenses are straining to hold the bigger Russian army at bay.",
      "Russian forces have started using Shahed drones with an increased payload of 90 kilograms (200 pounds) of explosives and metal shrapnel to \u201cincrease the number of casualties,\u201d the head of Ukraine\u2019s Presidential Office, Andrii Yermak, said on Telegram.",

The epicenter was about 250 kilometers (155 miles) south of the capital, Taipei, where buildings swayed slightly.",

      "No injuries were reported from Thursday's quake, although crews were dispatched to clear away tiles and signage that had been shaken off buildings.

      "A mountain in New Zealand considered an ancestor by Indigenous people has been recognized as a legal person after a new law granted it all the rights and responsibilities of a human being",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A mountain in New Zealand considered an ancestor by Indigenous people was recognized as a legal person on Thursday after a new law granted it all the rights and responsibilities of a human being.",
      "Mount Taranaki \u2014 now known as Taranaki Maunga, its M\u0101ori name \u2014 is the latest natural feature to be granted personhood in New Zealand, which has ruled that a river and a stretch of sacred land are people before. The pristine, snow-capped dormant volcano is the second highest on New Zealand's North Island at 2,518 meters (8,261 feet) and a popular spot for tourism, hiking and snow sports.",
      "The legal recognition acknowledges the mountain\u2019s theft from the M\u0101ori of the Taranaki region after New Zealand was colonized. It fulfills an agreement of redress from the country's government to Indigenous people for harms perpetrated against the land since.",
      "The law passed Thursday gives Taranaki Maunga all the rights, powers, duties, responsibilities and liabilities of a person. Its legal personality has a name: Te K\u0101hui Tupua, which the law views as \u201ca living and indivisible whole.\" It includes Taranaki and its surrounding peaks and land, \u201cincorporating all their physical and metaphysical elements.\u201d",
      "A newly created entity will be \u201cthe face and voice\u201d of the mountain, the law says, with four members from local M\u0101ori iwi, or tribes, and four members appointed by the country's Conservation Minister.",
      "\u201cThe mountain has long been an honored ancestor, a source of physical, cultural and spiritual sustenance and a final resting place,\" Paul Goldsmith, the lawmaker responsible for the settlements between the government and M\u0101ori tribes, told Parliament in a speech on Thursday.",
      "But colonizers of New Zealand in the 18th and 19th centuries took first the name of Taranaki and then the mountain itself. In 1770, the British explorer Captain James Cook spotted the peak from his ship and named it Mount Egmont.",
      "In 1840, M\u0101ori tribes and representatives of the British crown signed the Treaty of Waitangi \u2014 New Zealand's founding document \u2014 in which the Crown promised M\u0101ori would retain rights to their land and resources. But the M\u0101ori and English versions of the treaty differed \u2014 and Crown breaches of both began immediately.",
      "In 1865, a vast swathe of Taranaki land, including the mountain, was confiscated to punish M\u0101ori for rebeling against the Crown. Over the next century hunting and sports groups had a say in the mountain's management \u2014 but M\u0101ori did not.",
      "\u201cTraditional M\u0101ori practices associated with the mountain were banned while tourism was promoted,\u201d Goldsmith said. But a M\u0101ori protest movement of the 1970s and '80s has led to a surge of recognition for the M\u0101ori language, culture and rights in New Zealand law.",
      "Redress has included billions of dollars in Treaty of Waitangi settlements \u2014 such as the agreement with the eight tribes of Taranaki, signed in 2023.",
      "\u201cToday, Taranaki, our maunga, our maunga tupuna, is released from the shackles, the shackles of injustice, of ignorance, of hate,\" said Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, a co-leader of the political party Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori and a descendant of the Taranaki tribes, using a phrase that means ancestral mountain.",
      "\u201cWe grew up knowing there was nothing anyone could do to make us any less connected,\u201d she added.",
      "The mountain's legal rights are intended to uphold its health and wellbeing. They will be employed to stop forced sales, restore its traditional uses and allow conservation work to protect the native wildlife that flourishes there. Public access will remain.",
      "New Zealand was the first country in the world to recognize natural features as people when a law passed in 2014 granted personhood to Te Urewera, a vast native forest on the North Island. Government ownership ceased and the tribe T\u016bhoe became its guardian.",
      "\u201cTe Urewera is ancient and enduring, a fortress of nature, alive with history; its scenery is abundant with mystery, adventure, and remote beauty,\u201d the law begins, before describing its spiritual significance to M\u0101ori. In 2017, New Zealand recognized the Whanganui River as human, as part of a settlement with its local iwi.",
      "The bill recognizing the mountain's personhood was affirmed unanimously by Parliament's 123 lawmakers. The vote was greeted by a ringing waiata \u2014 a M\u0101ori song \u2014 from the public gallery, packed with dozens who had traveled to the capital, Wellington, from Taranaki.",
      "The unity provided brief respite in a tense period for race relations in New Zealand. In November, tens of thousands of people marched to Parliament to protest a law that would reshape the Treaty of Waitangi by setting rigid legal definitions for each clause. Detractors say the law \u2014 which is not expected to pass \u2014 would strip M\u0101ori of legal rights and dramatically reverse progress from the past five decades."

      "The truce is aimed at winding down the deadliest and most destructive war ever fought between Israel and Hamas, whose Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel sparked the fighting. It has held despite a dispute earlier this week over the sequence in which the hostages were released.",
      "The Israelis set to be released are Arbel Yehoud, 29, Agam Berger, 20 \u2014 who was abducted along with four other female soldiers who were freed Saturday \u2014 and Gadi Moses, an 80-year-old man. The identities of the Thai nationals who will be released were not immediately known.",
      "A number of foreign workers were taken captive along with dozens of Israeli civilians and soldiers during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack that set off the war. Twenty-three Thais were among more than 100 hostages released during a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. Israel says eight remain.",
      "Of the people set to be released from prisons in Israel, 30 are serving life sentences after being convicted of deadly attacks against Israelis.

      "The United States, Egypt and Qatar, which brokered the ceasefire after a year of tough negotiations, resolved the dispute with an agreement that Yehoud and two other hostages would be released Thursday. Another three hostages, all men, are set to be freed Saturday along with dozens more Palestinian prisoners.",
      "On Monday, Israel began allowing Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, the most heavily destroyed part of the territory, and hundreds of thousands streamed back. Many found only mounds of rubble where their homes had been.",
      "In the first phase of the ceasefire, Hamas is set to release a total of 33 hostages, including women, children, older adults and sick or wounded men, in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israel says Hamas has confirmed that eight of the hostages to be released in this phase are dead.",

      "The deal calls for Israel and Hamas to negotiate a second phase in which Hamas would release the remaining hostages and the ceasefire would continue indefinitely. The war could resume in early March if an agreement is not reached.",
      "Israel says it is still committed to destroying Hamas, even after the militant group reasserted its rule over Gaza within hours of the truce. A key far-right partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s coalition is already calling for the war to resume after the ceasefire\u2019s first phase.",

      "The Israeli military says it killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence, and that it went to great lengths to try to spare civilians.

    "story": [
      "A young Italian couple is going to court in the Vatican tribunal to challenge a new ban on workplace marriages imposed by the Vatican bank",
      "ROME -- Pope Francis has long urged couples to marry and have babies rather than dogs. He also has long championed the rights of workers and held up labor itself as the foundation of human dignity.",
      "So it has come as something of a surprise to many in the Holy See that the Vatican bank fired a young newlywed couple, with three young children between them, after a new internal bank regulation went into effect barring workplace marriages.",
      "The apparent contradiction between what the pope preaches and what his Vatican practices isn\u2019t lost on Silvia Carlucci and Domenico Fabiani, who on Thursday are challenging the ban in a wrongful termination lawsuit before the Vatican tribunal.",
      "Ahead of the hearing, they told The Associated Press this week that they never once considered calling off their Aug. 31, 2024, nuptials after learning of the new regulation. They said they couldn\u2019t contemplate the bank\u2019s suggestion that one of them quit to avoid running afoul of the new rule, because of financial obligations to their children, former spouses and new mortgage.",
      "\u201cI thought for sure there might have been an intervention by the Holy Father, who rightly gives so much emphasis and value to the role of the family,\u201d Fabiani said in the office of his lawyer, with Carlucci by his side. \u201cAnd yet here we find a family that works there and now finds itself on the street.\u201d",
      "Grasping for her husband\u2019s hand, Carlucci was more blunt: \u201cThere\u2019s a great contrast between what truly happens (in the Vatican) and what is promoted.\u201d",
      "The plight of the 41-year-olds, who between them worked for 25 years at the Institute for Religious Works, as the bank is known, has captured the attention of many in the Vatican, where employment has long been a coveted mark of status in overwhelmingly Catholic Italy. Also, a Vatican job comes with real benefits: tax-free income, access to a duty-free gas station, supermarket, pharmacy and department store and if lucky, access to below-market rents in some of the Holy See\u2019s palazzi in Rome.",
      "But for the past several years, amid a financial crisis that has resulted in hiring freezes, cuts to overtime, seniority bonuses and other benefits, employee discontent seems to be on the rise, with the Carlucci-Fabiani case something of a tipping point in a system where truly independent legal recourse doesn't exist.",
      "The Association of Lay Vatican Employees, the closest thing the Vatican has to a labor union, has taken up the couple\u2019s cause, issuing an online solidarity appeal on their behalf. It has asserted that the new rule violates basic human rights as well as the Vatican\u2019s fundamental laws and the church\u2019s canon law, which in the Vatican take legal precedence over internal regulations.",
      "\u201cWhile we are confident that God will provide for them and their children, we cannot silence the voice of our conscience that recognizes the traits of injustice and lack of charity in the measure that affected these two former colleagues,\u201d the online appeal reads. \u201cThe application of a regulation, while necessary in the governance of any institution, cannot fail to take into account the fact that any institution is made up of people and stands by virtue of the activity and professionalism of these same people.\u201d",
      "The Institute for Religious Works, or IOR as it is known, is a peculiar institution, created in 1942 to help the church carry out its charitable mission while enabling Vatican embassies and religious orders in far-flung parts of the world to send and receive money when commercial banking might be problematic.",
      "Located in a tower just steps inside Vatican City, the bank was long mired in scandal but spent over a decade cleaning up its books and ridding itself of its reputation as an offshore tax haven. The reforms slimmed down its client base to around 12,300 customers among Vatican offices, employees, religious orders and embassies, who are served by a staff of around 100 at its lone Vatican branch.",
      "According to the couple, the bank management announced a new personnel policy on May 2, laying out criteria for employment that said marriage between an IOR employee and another bank employee, or anyone else who works in the Vatican City State, was cause for termination.",
      "The change shocked them: Three months earlier, they had told bank management of their plans to wed after securing the Catholic decrees of nullity for their previous marriages. Carlucci got an advance on her yearly bonus to help secure their mortgage. They had formally publicized their pending nuptials in Rome city hall and their respective parishes.",
      "\u201cThey congratulated us, \u2018A wedding, how wonderful this marriage. Great job, you made it,\u2019\u201d Carlucci recalls her superiors telling her.",
      "The bank has strongly defended its policy as being consistent with best bank practices to promote transparency and impartiality and avoid conflicts of interest.",
      "It says it actually delayed implementing the policy until the last of five married couples in its workforce had retired in March. With such a small staff and one branch, \u201cthis rule is in fact essential to prevent both inevitable professional conflicts of interest between the aspiring spouses concerned, as well as the emergence of possible familistic management doubts among its customers or the general public,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "And yet the couple, and anyone familiar with the Vatican, knows plenty of married partners who work in the city state, not necessarily in the same department but among the 4,500 people who work in the Holy See.",
      "While expressing \u201cdeep regret,\u201d the bank said it had \u201creached the difficult decision\u201d to terminate the couple\u2019s employment on Oct. 1, a month after their church wedding. It is unclear why the bank didn\u2019t just terminate one of the two. A transfer to an unrelated Vatican office wasn't possible under the terms of the new regulation.",
      "The couple wrote to Francis personally, hoping he might intervene, but received no reply.",
      "Francis though seems keenly aware that employee morale is low and that times are tough for families. He recently approved the opening of the Vatican's first day-care center, as well as a \u201cbaby bonus\u201d of an extra 300 euros a month for Vatican employees with three or more children.",
      "During his annual Christmas greetings to Vatican personnel last month, dedicated to the theme of family and work, Francis urged employees to talk to their managers if they have problems.",
      "\u201cIf anyone has any special difficulties, please speak up, tell the people in charge, because we want to solve all difficulties,\u201d Francis told the Dec. 21 audience, attended by far fewer people than in past years. \u201cAnd this is done by dialogue and not by shouting or being silent.\u201d",
      "Carlucci would like her job back, but says her new marriage and blended family matter more.",
      "\u201cFor us, family is at the basis of our entire lives, so no matter what happens and despite everything, we have won,\u201d she said.",

      "SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador -- El Salvador\u2019s Congress ratified a constitutional reform Wednesday that will make it easier and faster to make constitutional changes in the future, a change critics say will allow President Nayib Bukele and his party to further consolidate power.",

    "story": [
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed 15 months ago that Israel would achieve \u201ctotal victory\u201d in the war in Gaza \u2014 by eradicating Hamas and freeing all the hostages",
      "TEL AVIV, Israel -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed 15 months ago that Israel would achieve \u201ctotal victory\u201d in the war in Gaza \u2014 by eradicating Hamas and freeing all the hostages. One week into a ceasefire with the militant group, many Israelis are dubious.",
      "Not only is Hamas still intact, there\u2019s also no guarantee all of the hostages will be released. But what\u2019s really raised doubts about Netanyahu\u2019s ability to deliver on his promise is this week's return of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to their homes in northern Gaza. That makes it difficult for Israel to relaunch its war against Hamas should the two sides fail to extend the ceasefire beyond its initial six-week phase.",
      "\u201cThere is no war to resume,\u201d said Ofer Shelah, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies, a Tel Aviv think tank. \u201cWhat will we do now? Move the population south again?\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no total victory in this war,\u201d he said.",
      "Israel launched its war against Hamas after the militant group\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, in which some 1,200 people were killed and roughly 250 were taken hostage. Within hours, Israel began a devastating air assault on Gaza, and weeks later it launched a ground invasion.",
      "Israel has inflicted heavy losses on Hamas. It has killed most of its top leadership, and claims to have killed thousands of fighters while dismantling tunnels and weapons factories. Months of bombardment and urban warfare have left Gaza in ruins, and more than 47,000 Palestinians are dead, according to local health authorities who don\u2019t distinguish between militants and civilians in their count.",
      "But the \u201ctotal victory\u201d envisioned by Netanyahu remains elusive.",
      "In the first phase of the ceasefire, 33 hostages in Gaza will be freed, nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israel will be released, and humanitarian aid to Gaza will be vastly increased. Israel is also redeploying troops to enable over 1 million Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza.",
      "In the second phase of the ceasefire, which the two sides are expected to begin negotiating next week, more hostages would be released and the stage would be set for a more lasting truce.",
      "But if Israel and Hamas do not agree to advance to the next phase, more than half of the roughly 90 remaining hostages will still be in Gaza; at least a third of them are believed to be dead.",
      "Despite heavy international and domestic pressure to develop a postwar vision for who should rule Gaza, Netanyahu has yet to secure an alternative to the militant group. That has left Hamas in command.",
      "Hamas sought to solidify that impression as soon as the ceasefire began. It quickly deployed uniformed police to patrol the streets and staged elaborate events for the hostages\u2019 release, replete with masked gunmen, large crowds and ceremonies. Masked militants have also been seen along Gaza's main thoroughfares, waving to and welcoming Palestinians as they head back home.",
      "Despite the scale of death and destruction in Gaza \u2014 and the hit to its own ranks \u2014 Hamas will likely claim victory.",
      "Hamas will say, \u201cIsrael didn\u2019t achieve its goals and didn\u2019t defeat us, so we won,\u201d said Michael Milshtein, an Israeli expert on Palestinian affairs.",
      "The return of displaced Palestinians to northern Gaza is an important achievement for Hamas, Milshtein said. The group long insisted on a withdrawal of Israeli troops and an end to war as part of any deal \u2014 two conditions that have effectively begun to be realized.",
      "And Hamas can now reassert itself in a swath of the territory that Israel battled over yet struggled to entirely control.",
      "To enable Palestinians to return to northern Gaza, Israel opened the Netzarim corridor, a roughly 4-mile (6-kilometer) military zone bisecting the territory. That gives Hamas more freedom to operate, while taking away leverage that would be difficult for Israel regain even if it restarted the war, said Giora Eiland, a former Israeli general who had proposed a surrender-or-starve strategy for northern Gaza.",
      "\u201cWe are at the mercy of Hamas,\u201d he said in an interview with Israeli Army Radio. \u201cThe war has ended very badly\u201d for Israel, he said, whereas Hamas \u201chas largely achieved everything it wanted.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump could play an important role in determining the remaining course of the war.",
      "He has strongly hinted that he wants the sides to continue to the second phase of negotiations and shown little enthusiasm for resuming the war. A visit by his Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, to Israel this week and a visit to the White House next week by Netanyahu will likely give stronger indications of where things are headed.",
      "In announcing the ceasefire, Netanyahu said Israel was still intent on achieving all the war's goals. He said Israel was \u201csafeguarding the ability to return and fight as needed.\u201d",
      "While military experts say Israel could in practice relaunch the war, doing so will be complicated.",
      "Beyond the return of displaced Palestinians, the international legitimacy to wage war that it had right after Hamas\u2019 attack has vanished. And with joyful scenes of freed hostages reuniting with their families, the Israeli public's appetite for a resumption of fighting is also on the decline, even if many are disappointed that Hamas, a group that committed the deadliest attack against Israelis in the country\u2019s history, is still standing.",
      "An end to the war complicates Netanyahu\u2019s political horizon. The Israeli leader is under intense pressure to resume the war from his far-right political allies, who want to see Hamas crushed. They envision new Jewish settlements in Gaza and long-term Israeli rule there.",
      "One of Netanyahu's coalition partners already resigned in protest at the ceasefire deal and a second key ally has threatened to topple the government if the war doesn\u2019t resume after the first phase. That would destabilize the government and could trigger early elections.",
      "\u201cWhere is the total victory that this government promised?\u201d Itamar Ben-Gvir, the former Cabinet minister who quit the government over the ceasefire said Monday.",
      "Israel Ziv, a retired general, said restarting the war would require a new set of goals and that its motivations would be tainted.",
      "\u201cThe war we entered into is over,\u201d he told Israeli Army Radio. \u201cOther than political reasons, I don\u2019t see any reason to resume the war.\u201d"

      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is planning to unveil proposals to put limits on lawsuits",
      "ATLANTA -- The pitch from Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp is simple: Putting limits on lawsuits will halt rising insurance costs.",
      "The reality, though, is more complicated.",
      "Changes could reduce liability insurance costs for businesses and commercial property owners. The evidence is mixed on whether it would drive large premium reductions for car and other types of insurance. And some researchers say efforts limiting lawsuits, often called tort reform, fattens insurers' profits more than it cuts the price of policies.",
      "\u201cThe net impact is that it really improves insurer profitability,\u201d said Tyler Leverty, a business professor who studies risk and insurance at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.",
      "When Kemp unveils his proposals Thursday, the Republican governor is likely to keep leaning on his argument that everyone's insurance rates are increasing because unfair lawsuits are on the rise and juries are awarding excessive damages.",
      "The issue is Kemp\u2019s top priority this year after promising the Georgia Chamber of Commerce he would take action and instead pushed a law to have Georgia Insurance Commissioner John King gather data in 2024.",
      "King said that lawsuits are driving insurance companies to reduce coverage for retail businesses, apartment owners, drivers and others. He said business owners in areas that insurers label as high crime are among those struggling the most. Companies that offer low-income housing have also complained.",
      "\u201cGo down to southeast Atlanta and talk to the small convenience owners having to close because they can\u2019t find insurance,\u201d King said.",

      "\u201cWhenever they want an excuse to raise rates or limit coverage they will always point to a verdict here and there and make all kinds of claims about how it\u2019s affecting their bottom line,\u201d said Joanne Doroshow, executive director of the Center for Justice & Democracy at New York Law School.",
      "Studying how tort reform impacts premiums in other states is difficult because other factors are in play and there are different combinations of reform. Some saw benefits, but the research varies.",
      "Other factors that influence insurance rates include inflation, extreme weather, and the costs of labor and materials. It is normal for insurance markets to cycle through tough years where less coverage is offered as rates rise.",
      "In many lines of coverage, including those not heavily impacted by lawsuits, insurers in 2022 were less profitable in Georgia than in several other states, according to data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. A spokesperson said over a longer period, though, nothing is abnormal about Georgia's fluctuations.",
      "King\u2019s report, using mostly auto insurance data, says the number of claims and the size of resulting payments have risen over the years, especially those involving lawsuits. Some numbers dropped in 2022 and 2023, but he said that was because the data is incomplete.",
      "King also found that a greater percentage of legal claims are resulting in payments that hit the maximum dollar amount a policy covers.",
      "The Georgia Trial Lawyers Association, which lobbies against tort reform, disputes King's conclusions.",
      "Risk consultant David Stegall said the number of claims is in line with Georgia\u2019s high number of car accidents. Both claims and payouts have mostly been stable or falling, especially when adjusted for population growth and inflation, he said.",
      "He also found that while Georgia residents pay between 11% and 68% more for car insurance than residents of other states, they are more than 200% more likely to be in an accident.",
      "Adam Willis, president of trucking firm F&W Transportation, said his company\u2019s premiums have doubled over the last 10 years while fewer insurers offer full coverage. His company also has been sued more often, he said.",
      "Defenders of the current system say the trade-offs of lawsuit limits are a bad deal.",
      "\u201cThe governor says that limiting your right as a consumer will lower your insurance costs, but that is not only a bad idea for everyday citizens, it\u2019s just not correct,\u201d said state Rep. Tanya Miller, an Atlanta Democrat.",

      "An upstate New York food bank was offered more than 40,000 pounds of coho salmon \u2014 a bountiful feast",
      "AUBURN, N.Y. -- A New York food bank was offered a huge donation of fresh fish this month \u2014 but it came with a catch.",
      "LocalCoho, a soon-to-close salmon farm in the small upstate city of Auburn, wanted to give 40,000 pounds (18,100 kilograms) of coho salmon to the Food Bank of Central New York, a mother lode of high-quality protein that could feed thousands of families.",
      "But the fish were still alive and swimming in the farm\u2019s giant indoor tanks. The organizations would need to figure out how to get some 13,000 salmon from the water and then have them processed into frozen fillets for distribution to regional food pantries.",
      "And they\u2019d need to do it fast, before the business closed for good. LocalCoho is ceasing operations this Friday.",
      "Thanks to dozens of food pantry volunteers willing to help staffers scoop up the salmon, the team was able to empty the tanks in a matter of weeks and cold pack tons of fish for shipment to a processor.",
      "\u201cThe fact that we only had weeks to execute this really ratcheted up the intensity and the anxiety a little bit,\u201d said Brian McManus, the food bank\u2019s chief operations officer. \u201cI knew that we had the will. I knew we had the expertise.\u201d",
      "Tackling food waste has been a daunting challenge for years both in the U.S. and around the world. More than one-third of the food produced in the U.S. is never eaten and much of it ends up in landfills.",
      "On a recent day, workers waded through knee-deep water teeming with salmon to fill their nets. Christina Hudson Kohler was among the volunteers who donned waterproof overalls and gloves to grab the fish-laden nets and empty their contents into cold storage containers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit different,\u201d Kohler said during a break. \u201cIn the past, my volunteer work with the food bank has been sorting carrots or peppers, or gleaning out in the field.\u201d",
      "LocalCoho is a startup that had been piloting a sustainable salmon farming system employing recirculated water. Its facility west of Syracuse had been supplying coho salmon to wholesalers and retailers, including high-end Manhattan sushi restaurants, with the goal of building regional farms across the country.",
      "But company officials said they could not raise enough capital to expand and become profitable. Thus, they decided to wrap things up at the end of January.",
      "With a shutdown looming, farm manager Adam Kramarsyck said they didn\u2019t want the fish to go to waste or end up as biofuel. That's when they reached out to see if the fish could be donated as food.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018lemonade out of lemons,\u2019 I guess is the phrase,\u201d Kramarsyck said.",
      "LocalCoho can process about 600 fish a week by hand. But there was less than a month to clear the tanks of many times that number of fish.",
      "Enter the food bank.",
      "McManus was excited by the offer to land so many fish \u2014 and nervous about the challenge. But while the Syracuse-based operation knew how to distribute canned or frozen seafood, they\u2019re not set up to handle fresh fish. How could they turn thousands of fish into frozen fillets in a tight time frame?",
      "Kramarsyck said it took \u201ctons and tons of logistics.\u201d",
      "The food bank enlisted 42 volunteers to help out. A local business with refrigerated trucks, Brown Carbonic, offered to ship the fish for free to a processor an hour away in Rochester. And LocalCoho staff pitched in to get the job done in time.",
      "\u201cA lot of companies going out of business would just be like, \u2018Take what you can get, we\u2019ll do the best we can.\u2019 I mean, they\u2019re working extra hard,\u201d said Andrew Katzer, the food bank\u2019s director of procurement.",
      "The salmon was being processed and quick-frozen. It will be distributed soon among 243 food pantries, as well as soup kitchens, shelters and other institutions in the food bank\u2019s network.",
      "All told, the catch is expected to yield more than 26,000 servings of hard-to-source protein for the hungry.",
      "\u201cProtein, animal protein is very, very desirable. We know that people need it for nourishment and it\u2019s difficult to get. And so this is going to make a very large impact,\" said McManus.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t anticipate this being here very long,'' he added. \"We\u2019ve had salmon before, but not like this.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Utah leaders, locals and longtime attendees of the Sundance Film Festival are making their final push to keep the world-renowned independent film festival in the state as its directors consider uprooting it",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- With the 2025 Sundance Film Festival underway, Utah leaders, locals and longtime attendees are making a final push \u2014 that could include paying millions of dollars \u2014 to keep the world-renowned film festival as its directors consider uprooting.",
      "Thousands of festivalgoers affixed bright yellow stickers to their winter coats that read \u201cKeep Sundance in Utah\" in a last-ditch effort to convince festival leadership and state officials to keep it in Park City, its home of 41 years.",
      "Gov. Spencer Cox said previously that Utah would not throw as much money at the festival as other states hoping to lure it away. Now his office is urging the Legislature to carve out $3 million for Sundance in the state budget, weeks before the independent film festival is expected to pick a home for the next decade.",
      "It could retain a small presence in picturesque Park City and center itself in nearby Salt Lake City, or move to another finalist \u2014 Cincinnati, Ohio, or Boulder, Colorado \u2014 beginning in 2027.",
      "\u201cSundance is Utah, and Utah is Sundance. You can\u2019t really separate those two,\" Cox said. \u201cThis is your home, and we desperately hope it will be your home forever.\"",
      "Festival Director Eugene Hernandez told reporters last week that they had not made a final decision. An announcement is expected this year by early spring.",
      "Colorado is trying to further sweeten its offer. The state is considering legislation giving up to $34 million in tax incentives to film festivals like Sundance through 2036 \u2014 on top of the $1.5 million in funds already approved to lure the Utah festival to its neighboring state.",
      "Cincinnati approved a resolution allocating $2.5 million to Sundance if festival leaders relocate to southwest Ohio. Yet money may not be the ultimate draw.",
      "Sundance leaders say the festival has outgrown the ski town it helped put on the map decades ago, and they worry it has developed an air of exclusivity that takes the focus away from the films. An ideal home would make Sundance more centralized, affordable and accessible to all who appreciate independent film.",
      "Some festivalgoers and industry leaders worry Sundance would lose its identity outside its idyllic mountain hometown.",
      "Roger and Carin Ehrenberg, major donors to the festival, said they would stop attending regularly if the festival was outside Utah. Sundance is a \u201cmagical experience\u201d for the New York City philanthropists, they said, due in large part to the atmosphere in Park City.",
      "\u201cIf it goes to Cincinnati, maybe once in a blue moon we would go, but it wouldn't be a regular thing,\" Carin Ehrenberg said. \u201cFor us, it\u2019ll lose its appeal.\u201d",
      "The couple said they would likely continue to donate even if they did not attend.",
      "Nineteen years of fond memories at Sundance helped inspire Dr. Rhonda Taubin to relocate her family from Atlanta to Heber City \u2014 Park City's neighboring town. She has no ties to the film industry but has become a fervent advocate for keeping the festival in her new home state.",
      "This year, she and her friends distributed thousands of \u201cKeep Sundance in Utah\u201d stickers \u2014 and another that read \u201cNOhio for Sundance\u201d \u2014 to show the festival how much it means to the local community.",
      "\u201cI really am not a movie buff, but my other girlfriends are, and being able to share all that we've been through as women, as mothers, as wives, as daughters, I don't want it to end,\u201d Taubin said. \u201cWe watch provocative movies that make us talk and think about things that maybe we've never thought about before. Utah would be at a huge loss without those conversations.\u201d",
      "If Sundance stays in Utah, the festival\u2019s former director John Cooper said major adjustments are needed to improve transportation between Salt Lake City and Park City and make lodging for filmmakers more affordable.",
      "Cooper, who led the festival from 2009 to 2020, said he would be sad to see Sundance shift away from actor and filmmaker Robert Redford's original vision. Its very name comes from Redford's character in the 1969 film \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt like my role was to be a keeper of the flame for Robert Redford and his legacy,\" Cooper told The Associated Press. \u201cThe mountains of Utah, this was his vision. It\u2019s weird to say \u2018Sundance in Ohio.\u2019 But I think it could go anywhere. What it does for a community is so strong.\u201d",
      "On the red carpet this week, many were split on whether Sundance should stay or go.",
      "Actor Elijah Wood urged the festival to remain in Park City, saying the location is part of its DNA.",
      "Others were open to it relocating. Actor Tessa Thompson, who serves on the Sundance Institute's board of trustees, said the festival could maintain its identity in a new city.",
      "\u201cI think that Sundance has more to do with the spirit and community, and I think that's evergreen,\" Thompson said. \"Regardless of where Sundance is, Sundance will always be.\u201d"

      "The company has said the engine it's developing for the Overture will have 35,000 pounds of thrust and is designed to run on sustainable aviation fuel.",
      "American Airlines and United Airlines have pledged to buy jets from Boom Supersonic. Boom said last year it has orders for 130 aircraft, which include orders and pre-orders.",
      "Those commercial flights could be limited to ocean crossings or would have to slow down over land to limit damage from forceful sonic booms, which can rattle buildings on land.",

      "A deadly crash more than two decades ago hastened the jet's demise. On July 25, 2000, an Air France Concorde crashed into a hotel and exploded shortly after takeoff in Paris, killing all 109 people on board and four on the ground. Investigators determined that the plane ran over a metal strip, damaging a tire that crashed into the underside of the wing, rupturing a fuel tank."

      "Consumer spending remained strong across most goods and services in 2024. Air transportation was among the stronger categories, with spending increasing each month through November, according to the data on personal consumption expenditures.",
      "Airlines were among 2024's biggest gainers on Wall Street, with Delta's stock rising 50% and United Airlines more than doubling. Most airline stocks have continued gaining ground into 2025, along with expectations for profit growth.",
      "Still, the industry faces supply chain problems that have crimped capacity.",
      "\u201cThe capacity challenges of 2024 will continue into 2025 and indeed through to 2026 as airlines struggle with the fallout from maintenance, repair, and overhaul issues and production delays from major aircraft manufacturers,\u201d said John Grant, chief analyst at travel data company OAG.",
      "Airlines and airplane makers face broad supply chain delays for parts. Boeing remains one of the biggest drags for the sector. The beleaguered airplane maker continues to face production issues and said it incurred nearly $3 billion worth of charges in the fourth quarter of 2024. It faced a strike by the machinists that halted production at several facilities.",
      "Those supply issues kept capacity growth in check in 2024 and will continue to do so in 2025, according to the International Air Transport Association, or IATA. The organization expects global passenger capacity to growth 7.5% in 2025, with 2.8% growth in North America. That would mark a continued slowdown from 2024.",
      "\u201cThis is limiting growth opportunities and driving up several cost areas, including aircraft leasing and maintenance,\u201d the IATA said in a forecast for 2025.",
      "Crimped capacity growth has weighed down passenger traffic growth. The IATA expects global growth of 8% in 2025, with 3% growth in North America.",
      "Still, that's enough growth to help fuel forecasts for major airlines. Wall Street expects profit growth of 23% for Delta in 2025. Analysts expect United Airlines' profit to grow about 24% and American Airlines profit to rise 23%.",
      "The industry in the U.S. also faces the potential for a friendlier regulatory climate under President Donald Trump. That could include an easing of oversight on airfare fee disclosures and penalties for flight delays."

      "Tesla\u2019s fourth-quarter adjusted profits rose slightly amid a big push to sell its electric vehicles with offers of zero financing and other incentives, but the results still fell short of Wall Street forecasts.",
      "The electric vehicle, battery and robotics company run by Elon Musk said Wednesday that quarterly net income adjusted for one-time items rose 3% to $2.6 billion, or 73 cents a share \u2014 less than analysts' estimate of 77 cents.",
      "Tesla stock initially fell after trading closed Wednesday, then reversed course to rise more than 4% after Musk told analysts on a conference call that the company was on track to offer unsupervised \u201cfull self-driving\u201d technology to its customers as a paid service starting in Austin in June.",
      "\u201cIt went from a theoretical, \u2018We hope to launch something in 2025,\u2019 to a set timeline,\u201d said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. \u201cThat's a big step forward.\u201d",
      "Tesla has been losing market share in several countries as traditional car makers and other EV companies, such as China's BYD, offer customers alternatives. Its stock has surged nonetheless, rising by more than 50% since President Donald Trump was elected, on investor optimism that Musk\u2019s advisory role in the new administration will help the company.",
      "In its letter to shareholders and on the analyst call, Tesla it was hoping to lift sales by driving the cost of its vehicles down, highlighting that one cost measure fell below $35,000, the lowest in its history. It said production of \u201cmore affordable\u201d models are expected to start in the first half of the year, with Musk emphasizing that \u201cmaximizing volume\u201d was priority.",
      "But then he quickly pivoted in the conference call to other goals and parts of the business, and the stock started climbing.",
      "\u201cAI and robotics - that will bear immense fruit,\u201d he said, adding \u201cI see a path, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s an easy path, but I see a path for Tesla being the most valuable company in the world \u2014 by far, not even close,\" leapfrogging the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia. Tesla is currently the seventh-most valuable company in the S&P 500 with a market value of $1.25 trillion.",
      "Tesla's unadjusted profits for October through December period were down dramatically, though the year-earlier period was a poor comparison because the results included a large one-time tax benefit. The company said it made $2.31 billion last quarter, down 71% from the $7.93 billion profit in the same period in 2023.",
      "Revenue rose 2% to $25.7 billion, less than Wall Street\u2019s forecast of $27.1 billion, according to FactSet. Tesla offered a series of incentives during the quarter to drum up demand for its electric vehicles including low-interest loans and lower prices. Tesla\u2019s gross profit margin fell to 16.3% for the quarter, down 1.3 percentage points from a year earlier.",
      "Earlier this month, Tesla said it sold 1.79 million vehicles in 2024, the first drop in more than a dozen years despite offers of 0% financing, free charging and low-priced leases. The fourth quarter showed signs of a rebound, though, with a record 495,570 vehicles sold.",
      "\u201cThe bulls got what they wanted, and the bears got data to support them as well,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, a big fan of the stock. \u201cBut ultimately what will drive the stock is autonomous driving, and this is the bullish I've ever heard Musk.\u201d",
      "For the full year, Tesla posted profits before one-time items of $8.42 billion, down 23% from the year earlier.",
      "Investors are expecting that Musk's close relationship with Trump will translate into lighter regulation on the car company, fewer investigations and help in speeding the development of autonomous driving.",
      "But the Trump administration has also vowed to cut government incentives to customers to buy EVs and says it will loosen emission standards. The latter especially could hurt Tesla because it has a big business in selling \u201cregulatory credits\u201d to other automakers that fall short of the standards.",
      "The latest financial report showed that in the fourth quarter Tesla sold $692 million in these credits, a spigot of cash that could be turned off if Trump follows through on his vow."

      "Norfolk Southern's solid fourth quarter \u2014 combined with the optimism the railroad is hearing from their customers and support they're getting from Washington D.C. \u2014 has the CEO feeling optimistic about 2025.",
      "The railroad, based in Atlanta, earned $733 million, or $3.23 per share, in the fourth quarter. That's up from $527 million, or $2.32 per share, the prior year, helped by a couple of one-time items whereas the same quarter last year was weighed down by hefty derailment cleanup costs. The insurance payments Norfolk Southern is collecting during the fourth quarter related to the disastrous East Palestine, Ohio, derailment in 2023 and ensuing cleanup provided a $32 million boost, and some sales of rail lines added another $40 million to the bottom line.",
      "Without those unusual items, the railroad would have earned $688 million, or $3.04 per share. That easily exceeded the $2.94 that the analysts surveyed by FactSet Research were predicting.",
      "CEO Mark George said regulators from the Federal Railroad Administration, Surface Transportation Board and National Transportation Safety Board and members of Congress were all positive in recent meetings last week.",
      "It appears that the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress could ease restrictions on the industry instead of continuing to push for the changes President Joe Biden's Transportation Department had recommended after the 2023 derailment near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border.",
      "\u201cEveryone recognizes that we move the American economy. So we\u2019re an integral, vital part of moving the American economy,\u201d George said. \u201cSo they want to be supportive. So those are the messages we were receiving. It feels good and it\u2019s different.\u201d",
      "All the major railroads that have reported earnings this month have said they expect the FRA to now be more likely to approve waivers from regulations the industry has been seeking for years to use automated inspection technology to replace some human inspections. Rail unions have opposed those changes and argued that the new technology should supplement \u2014 not replace \u2014 human inspections.",
      "Democratic U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio, who represents the area of western Pennsylvania just over the border from where the East Palestine derailment happened, said he hopes the Trump administration won't roll back regulations on railroads and undo things like the two-person crew requirement rule the Biden administration finalized last year. Instead, Deluzio said he hopes Vice President JD Vance will help put pressure on Republican leaders in Congress to pass a rail safety bill similar to the one he proposed after the derailment while he was still an Ohio senator.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think this should be the moment to give the industry handouts when in fact, we should be putting stricter requirements on them on how they operate their trains through our communities,\u201d Deluzio said Wednesday at a news conference in western Pennsylvania where he announced plans to reintroduce a rail safety bill similar to the one that stalled after the derailment.",
      "It's hard to tell how any tariffs Trump might impose will affect the shipments railroads deliver. Last week, Union Pacific' s CEO warned that imports could be hurt significantly by tariffs, but NS' George seemed less concerned because he said any drop in imports might be replaced with increases in domestic production.",
      "\u201cThings will play out over time, but we move the U.S. economy, we move GDP. And whether that GDP is coming across the border as an import or whether it\u2019s now being produced domestically due to some onshoring, we\u2019re going to be there to move it,\u201d George said. \u201cSo I kind of think it\u2019s going to be a net wash in terms of volume.\u201d",
      "Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said companies in all sectors are trying to get a handle on what tariffs will mean, and it's hard to know exactly how many of these trade sanctions will actually be imposed and how targeted they might be.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very common question being asked on this earnings season so far. And really at this point, it\u2019s very difficult to answer,\u201d Windau said.",
      "Norfolk Southern said the East Palestine derailment is now expected to cost nearly $2.2 billion total with about half of that related to legal costs and settlements like the $600 million class-action one. Insurance is expected to cover at least $751 million of that \u2014 leaving only a $1.4 billion impact on the railroad's finances. But only about half of that has been paid out so far.",
      "Norfolk Southern started off the fourth quarter by recovering from Hurricanes Helene and Milton in the Southeast. That hurt some of the railroad's service metrics during the quarter, but George said he's proud of the way the railroad responded to the storms and confident that Norfolk Southern is getting more efficient.",
      "Even with that disruption the railroad hauled 3% more freight in the fourth quarter. But its revenue slipped 2% to $3.02 billion as the lower fuel prices reduced its surcharge revenue. The mix of shipments the railroad hauled also shifted to a less-profitable mix with more deliveries of shipping containers filled with assorted goods, and coal revenue dropped 9% as that line of business continued its long-term decline. That was still slightly ahead of the $3.015 billion that Wall Street predicted.",
      "The railroad predicts its revenue will grow 3% in 2025 and its profit margin will improve as it records another $150 million of productivity savings on top of a nearly $300 million improvement last year.",
      "Norfolk Southern is one of the nation's largest railroads with tracks crossing 22 states in the Eastern United States."

    "story": [
      "U.K. Treasury chief Rachel Reeves says that the new Labour government is backing the construction of third runway at London\u2019s Heathrow Airport",
      "LONDON -- The U.K. government is backing the construction of a third runway at London\u2019s Heathrow Airport, Treasury chief Rachel Reeves said Wednesday.",
      "Another runway at the U.K.\u2019s main airport will bolster the country\u2019s long-term economic growth potential, Reeves said in a speech.",
      "\u201cWe cannot duck the decision any longer,\" she said. \u201cThe case is stronger than ever.\u201d",
      "Reeves said the government was inviting proposals over its construction by the summer and that it would then make a full assessment.",
      "\u201cThis will ensure that the project is value for money and our clear expectation is that any associated service transport costs will be financed through private funding,\u201d she said.",
      "For decades, campaigners, including from within her Labour Party, have opposed a third runway on environmental concerns. London Mayor Sadiq Khan, and John McDonnell, the lawmaker whose constituency contains Heathrow, have both voiced their opposition to the third runway.",
      "Reeves insisted the runway will be \u201cdelivered in line with our legal, environmental and climate objectives.\"",
      "Heathrow\u2019s plan to build a third runway received parliamentary approval in June 2018, but has been delayed by legal challenges and the coronavirus pandemic. Heathrow's chief executive, Thomas Woldbye, has said that he wouldn't continue developing the project without the government confirming that it wants expansion.",
      "Reeves' support for a third runway came in a wide-ranging speech on boosting U.K. growth rates, which have been historically low since the 2008 global financial crisis for a variety of reasons.",
      "The Labour government badly needs growth rates to increase over the coming years, so it can lift living standards following the cost-of-living crisis and to get money into ailing public services.",
      "Since taking office in July, Reeves and Prime Minister Keir Starmer have been criticized for talking down the economy and for increasing taxes on business, a combination that critics argue have led to a growth downturn in the past few months and the sharp downturn in the government's ratings in opinion polls.",
      "Though a third runway won't do much to bolster economic growth in the near-term as it would take up to a decade to build, Reeves hopes that the announcement itself will provide investors with a signal that the government is serious about turning the economy around.",
      "\u201cWe are not waiting for years into the future,\" she said. \u201cWe want to do things now, to turn around the performance, and we want to give businesses and investors confidence that this is a country to start doing things, to start making things in again.\u201d",
      "The construction of a third runway would require more than 700 houses to be demolished and sections of the M25 motorway, which encircles London, to be moved into a tunnel.",

      "GOMA, Congo -- Rebels backed by Rwanda captured more towns in eastern Congo on Wednesday as they moved beyond the key city of Goma in an apparent attempt to expand their control in the conflict-battered region.",
      "The rebels advanced toward the center of South Kivu province after taking several towns, including Kalungu, Kanyezire and Mukwinja, according to a local civil society leader and an aid worker in the area. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.",
      "U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the developments were concerning, and that the United Nations was taking measures to protect civilians and U.N. staff. The advance also raised fears of a prolonged occupation by the rebels, who have said they plan to set up a new administration in Goma, a city of 2 million people.",
      "\u201cLeft unchecked, the fighting could spread ... recalling the horrors of the late 1990s and early 2000s, when millions died,\u201d the Crisis Group said, citing the last, multi-country war there.",
      "Unlike now, the rebels captured Goma only briefly during their first rebellion in 2012, withdrawing after a few days under international pressure on Rwanda.",
      "Meanwhile, Congolese President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi was conspicuously absent from a summit of a regional East African bloc that began late Wednesday",
      "Faced with the rebel offensive, soldiers fighting for Congo \u2014 many of them mercenaries from other nations \u2014 were laying down their weapons at the border with Rwanda. Congo\u2019s army seemed to be in disarray, and those at the border appeared disorganized and ill-equipped for any major fighting.",

      "Armed groups have long vied for control of eastern Congo, which is rich in minerals critical to much of the world\u2019s technology, and has been the scene of proxy battles between Congo and neighboring Rwanda, as well as other powers. Fighting reignited this week, and the rebels backed by Rwanda, known as M23, announced Monday that they had captured much of the provincial capital of Goma.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of Goma residents were trying to get away from the fighting, with some retreating into Congo\u2019s interior to seek protection, and others crossing into nearby Rwanda. Rwandan border patrol agents thoroughly searched the belongings of the men, women and children crossing the border in waves, with suitcases and children in tow. The displaced people, looking exhausted but relieved, were then taken care of by the Rwandan Red Cross.",
      "Meanwhile, rebels took control of Goma's airport, said U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric, warning of risks of a breakdown of law and order in the city of 2 million people \"given the proliferation of weapons.\u201d Clashes with rebels continued in some parts of the city on Wednesday afternoon, including at the center of Goma in the neighborhoods of Katoyi and Kahembe. Other parts of the city were calm, with less fighting after a day during which thousands of fleeing people hunkered down by roadsides as missiles flew overhead, and injured people streamed to overwhelmed hospitals.",
      "Congolese President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, expected to address the country later on Wednesday in his first public remarks since the incursion.",
      "The chaotic situation has its roots in ethnic conflict: M23 says it is defending ethnic Tutsis in Congo. Rwanda has claimed the Tutsis are being persecuted by Hutus and former militias responsible for the 1994 genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and others in Rwanda. Many Hutus fled into Congo after the genocide.",
      "Analysts say the real fight is for control over the Congo\u2019s vast mineral deposits, estimated to be worth $24 trillion, and critical to much of the world\u2019s technology. M23 appears to be preparing to stay in Congo for good, telling the AP of their plans to set up an administration and return displaced people to their homes.",
      "Analysts have warned that securing a rebel withdrawal could be more difficult than in 2012, when M23 first captured Goma but withdrew after days. Murithi Mutiga, program director for Africa at the Crisis Group, said that the group has become more emboldened by Rwanda, which feels Congo is ignoring its interests in the region and failed to meet demands of previous peace agreements.",
      "While Rwandan leaders, mostly Tutsis, have denied backing the rebels, U.N. sources say some 4,000 Rwandan troops are in the Congo.",
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, whose troops are among the foreign peacekeepers in Congo, blamed the \u201cRwanda Defence Force (RDF) militia\u201d for the fighting and called for the withdrawal of the rebels.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 02:10:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Climate change and recent troubles with counterfeit seeds have challenged Kenya's agriculture efforts to improve food security",
    "story": [
      "Climate change and recent troubles with counterfeit seeds have challenged Kenya's agriculture efforts to improve food security",
      "KIKUYU, Kenya -- Tucked away in a lush, forested area of central Kenya's Kikuyu town, the National Seed Bank stands as a crucial safeguard for the future of the country's agriculture. Inside two chilly rooms of a government building, more than 50,000 seed varieties are cataloged and stored.",
      "The bank was established in 1988 after the realization that some traditional varieties of seeds were being lost, an occurrence that is becoming more common with climate change. It aims to conserve seeds for research and reintroduction to farms.",
      "\u201cWe realize that some of the traditional varieties that we had abandoned then are actually more resilient to climate change, so when you introduce them especially in marginal areas, those varieties outperform the improved varieties,\u201d said the director of the Genetic Resources Research Institute that operates the bank, Desterio Nyamongo, referring to hybrid seeds that must be bought every planting season.",
      "He said the some of bank\u2019s seeds also were found to be more resistant to diseases and pests and were high-yielding.",
      "This gives hope to a country that relies heavily on rain-fed agriculture instead of irrigation, leaving it more vulnerable to climate shocks like drought. The sector contributes a third of Kenya's GDP.",
      "Kenya is not alone facing food security pressures. According to a U.N Food and Agriculture and Organization report in 2023, over a billion people across the African continent are unable to afford healthy diets, and the number of hungry people is increasing.",
      "But in Kenya, another complication has emerged. Farmers in recent months suffered losses in the millions of shillings (tens of thousands of dollars) after planting counterfeit seeds bought from private sellers.",
      "Kenyan officials have acknowledged that the seed sector is critical.",
      "During the country\u2019s first international seed quality conference in August, the agriculture ministry\u2019s permanent secretary, Paul Rono, said Africa has limited capacity to produce high-quality certified seeds that are subjected to quality standards.",
      "The head of the Eastern Africa Farmers Federation, Stephen Muchiri, said the vigor of crops in Kenya has become low, and he believes that the main reason is a flawed seed breeding and propagation program.",
      "But some farmers say efforts to improve the seed system in Kenya have been limited by a 2012 law banning seed sharing, which is what millions of farmers did every planting season to cut their production cost.",
      "The government has said the law is meant to prevent the circulation of uncertified seeds and protects farmers, but it faces a court challenge from more than a dozen farmers across Kenya who say it's expensive having to buy new seeds every planting season. The next hearing in the case is in March.",
      "Francis Ngiri is one of the farmers who filed the case. He runs an indigenous seed bank for the local community on his five-acre farm in the semi-arid Gilgil area located 120 kilometers (74 miles) from the capital, Nairobi.",
      "His work has become a learning ground for farmers who have experienced disappointing yields from hybrid seeds.",
      "\u201cWe have seen that indigenous seeds are more resilient and perform better in our area even when there is reduced rainfall,\u201d he told The Associated Press.",
      "He passionately shares his knowledge on conserving the seeds using traditional methods such as covering them with wood ash \u2014 believed to repel weevils \u2014 or keeping them in earthen pots. He emphasized the use of locally available materials at no cost.",
      "Farmer Maximilla Onyura, who farms sorghum in the western county of Busia, said indigenous crops offer a food security solution. She isn't part of the legal challenge but collaborates with Ngiri through a Kenyan organization called the Seed Savers Network.",
      "However, \u201cinstead of our government encouraging those offering solutions through indigenous crops, they are now cracking down on those sharing seeds at community level,\u201d she said.",
      "Seed sharing in Kenya can bring two years in prison, a fine of up to 1 million Kenyan shillings ($7,700), or both. No farmer has been charged.",
      "The National Seed Bank occasionally distributes some of its collection to farmers at no cost in the hope that the varieties that had long adopted to local conditions will be more resilient.",
      "The director, Nyamongo, said farmers who cannot afford farm inputs like fertilizers required for hybrid seeds are better off planting the traditional varieties.",
      "\u201cIt would be wrong for farmers, especially farmers in marginal areas, to start thinking that using the indigenous seed is backwardness,\u201d he said. \u201cFar from it, because some of the indigenous varieties have adopted over time to the local conditions and therefore, they are more resilient.\u201d",
      "Nyamongo did not comment on the farmers' court challenge to the seed-sharing ban.",
      "The president of the Dutch-based climate change adaptation nonprofit Global Center on Adaptation, Patrick V. Verkooijen, said governments can invest in community-based seed programs to preserve a diversity of indigenous varieties.",
      "\u201cIndigenous crop varieties offer many benefits, particularly their genetic diversity, which helps farmers adapt to climate change, combat pests and diseases and manage poor soil fertility. However, they also come with challenges, such as potentially lower yields or susceptibility to new pests and diseases,\u201d he said.",
      "Kenyan proponents of indigenous seeds like Ngiri said lower yields and susceptibility to new pests and diseases only happen when a seed variety is taken from its native location.",
      "\u201cThe reason why they are indigenous is because they have adapted to the climatic conditions and the diseases found in the area they originally came from,\u201d Ngiri said.",

      "\u201cUsman Khawaja was patient and waited for the loose balls and swept so well,\" Vandersay said. \"Josh Inglis showed lot of intent as well and it's tough to contain when they are stepping out of the crease and putting us under pressure.\u201d",
      "Inglis wasted no time asserting himself, taking on the bowlers and racing to his century off just 90 deliveries, the second fastest for a men's debut. India's Shikhar Dhawan took 85 balls in 2013 against Australia. Inglis' attacking approach, combined with Khawaja\u2019s measured brilliance, combined for 146 runs for the fourth wicket, cementing Australia's dominance.",
      "Inglis made 102 off 94 balls, also edging Jayasuriya behind.",
      "\u201cI tried to be proactive and put bowlers under pressure,\u201d Inglis said. \u201cIf you are stuck for three to four balls, the next ball will probably have your name in it.\u201d",
      "The England-born Inglis has played for Australia in one-day internationals and Twenty20s since 2022, and said he owed his parents a lot for moving from Yorkshire to Perth in 2010.",
      "\u201cWhenever we play England, everyone in the dressing room is asking what anthem I am going to sing. It's a good one,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can't choose where you were born. It's part of my story.\u201d",
      "While Australia made merry on a placid surface, signs of turn emerged late on day two, offering a glimmer of hope for the spinners. The pitch is expected to deteriorate further, making survival increasingly difficult \u2013 especially with Australia boasting three specialist spinners.",

      "Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs keep finding themselves on one side of a Super Bowl rematch",
      "Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs keep finding themselves on one side of a Super Bowl rematch.",
      "A year after beating the San Francisco 49ers for the second time in five seasons in the NFL's championship game, Mahomes and the Chiefs will square off against the Philadelphia Eagles for the second Super Bowl in the past three seasons.",
      "Kansas City won the first meeting 38-35 in Glendale, Arizona, and will try to pull off another Super Bowl sweep on Feb. 9 in New Orleans.",
      "\u201cThis is a great football team (that) we\u2019re playing,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cThey\u2019re great on offense, they\u2019re great on defense and special teams. We played them in a close Super Bowl a couple years ago, but they\u2019ve added players and got even better, so it\u2019ll take our best football to win.\u201d",
      "More than 40 players who participated in that nail-biter two years ago are projected to be on the field next week including stars like Mahomes, Travis Kelce and Chris Jones for Kansas City and Jalen Hurts, Lane Johnson and A.J. Brown for Philadelphia.",
      "Many played big roles in the last Super Bowl meeting. Hurts rushed for three TDs and threw a 45-yard scoring strike to Brown, while Mahomes threw three TD passes, including one to Kelce, Nick Bolton returned a fumble for a touchdown and Harrison Butker kicked the game-winning field goal with 8 seconds left.",
      "There have only been nine Super Bowl rematches in the previous 58 games, with just four happening in a five-year span before this rematch. The winners of those three rematches were the teams that won the first meeting.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the other times there was a Super Bowl rematch within five seasons of the first meeting:",
      "Mahomes rallied Kansas City from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter for a 31-20 win in Super Bowl 54, with his biggest play being a 44-yard pass on third-and-15 to Tyreek Hill that sparked the comeback.",
      "The 49ers kept it even closer last season in a back-and-forth game that featured three go-ahead scoring drives led by Brock Purdy in the fourth quarter or overtime. But it wasn't enough to topple Mahomes.",
      "Mahomes engineered two late game-tying field goal drives in regulation. He then took advantage of San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan's decision to start overtime with the ball by responding to a field goal by the Niners with a walk-off 3-yard TD pass to Mecole Hardman for Kansas City's third title in this current run.",
      "Eli Manning and the Giants spoiled New England\u2019s bid for a perfect season in 2007 and then pulled off the upset again four years later.",
      "The Patriots came into Super Bowl 42 with an 18-0 record and were on the brink of matching the perfect season of the 1972 Dolphins when Tom Brady threw a 6-yard TD pass to Randy Moss to make it 14-10 with 2:42 to go.",
      "But Manning drove New York down the field \u2014 with help from David Tyree\u2019s helmet catch \u2014 and threw a game-winning TD to Plaxico Burress to stun New England.",
      "Manning did it again in the 2011 season, driving to a game-winning touchdown with 57 seconds left for a 21-17 win.",
      "Dallas and Buffalo had the only Super Bowl rematch in consecutive seasons, meeting at the end of the 1992 and 1993 campaigns.",
      "The Cowboys got the best of both.",
      "They used nine takeaways and four TD passes from Troy Aikman to hand the Bills a 52-17 loss in Super Bowl 27.",
      "The rematch was closer but had the same result. James Washington returned a fumble for a TD early in the third quarter to tie the game and Emmitt Smith ran for two TDs in the second half for a 30-13 win.",
      "The Cowboys were on the wrong end of a Super Bowl rematch in the 1970s, losing to the Steelers following the 1975 and 1978 seasons.",
      "Dallas became the first wild-card team to reach the title game in Super Bowl 10 thanks to a desperation pass to beat Minnesota and a blowout against the Rams.",
      "But they fell short against the Steel Curtain in the second second-half in Super Bowl history. Pittsburgh got a safety, two field goals and a 64-yard touchdown catch by Super Bowl MVP Lynn Swann in the fourth quarter of a 21-17 win to complete back-to-back titles for the Steelers.",
      "Pittsburgh won again three years later in the first Super Bowl rematch to deny Dallas back-to-back championships.",
      "MVP Terry Bradshaw threw four TD passes and Jackie Smith dropped a potential touchdown for Dallas. Roger Staubach\u2019s late rally fell short and the Steelers won their third Super Bowl title 35-31.",

      "NEW YORK -- Two years after he won an NBA title, Nikola Jokic views the surging New York Knicks as a \u201ctop-five candidate\u201d to end their 52-year championship drought.",
      "The Knicks beat Jokic's Denver Nuggets 122-112 on Wednesday for their fifth straight victory. At 32-16, they are a game behind reigning champion Boston for second place in the Eastern Conference.",
      "After ringing up 143 points in each of their two previous games, their total Wednesday gave the Knicks 408 over their last three games, a franchise record.",
      "They scored their season high of 145 points in a victory in Denver in November.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re playing really well. They\u2019re well-coached, they\u2019re pushing the pace and in the halfcourt they know what they\u2019re doing. So they\u2019re a really good team,\u201d said Jokic, the three-time NBA MVP. \u201cI think they are the favorites \u2013 not the favorites, but I think top-five candidates for the title.\u201d",
      "The Knicks haven't won the title since 1973 and haven't reached the conference finals since 2000. But they loaded up for a run this summer by acquiring Karl-Anthony Towns, who with Jalen Brunson gave the Knicks two players voted as All-Star starters for the first time since 1975.",
      "Brunson had 30 points and 15 assists Wednesday, becoming just the fourth Knicks player to do that in a game.",
      "But the Knicks, who are currently the fourth choice to win the title at BetMGM behind Boston, Oklahoma City, and Cleveland, don't want to think about having a summer celebration like Jokic and the Nuggets enjoyed in 2023 when they won their franchise's first NBA title.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about the future, I want to talk about the present,\u201d Towns said. \u201cI want to talk about what we can do right now to be the best team we can be, because I have a lot of experience and if you can take care of the present, the future will take care of itself.\u201d",

    "summary": "More changes could be on the way for the PGA Tour",
    "story": [
      "More changes could be on the way for the PGA Tour",
      "PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. -- The PGA Tour is taking a hard look at whether to allow rangefinders and publicize violations as part of a comprehensive study on pace of play and other enhancements to the game that have come out of a survey of 50,000 golf fans.",
      "Tour officials were purposely short on specifics Wednesday during a meeting with reporters on the \u201cFan Forward\u201d initiative that Commissioner Jay Monahan announced a year ago. He is expected to go into greater detail at The Players Championship in March.",
      "But the preview session at Pebble Beach supported Monahan's message late last year that \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d as the PGA Tour embarks on a series of changes.",
      "\u201cI think as we roll the clock forward three, five, 10 years, we\u2019re going to look back at 2025 as an inflection point in the evolution of the tour,\u201d said Andy Weitz, the tour's chief marketing and communications officer.",
      "He said part of that was capital growth from the investment of Strategic Sports Group, which put $1.5 billion into PGA Tour Enterprise with the potential to double the amount.",
      "Fenway Sports Group, a big part of SSG, has Theo Epstein as a senior advisor. Epstein, former general manager of the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs, worked with Major League Baseball on recent changes that include a pitch clock and larger bases to encourage more stealing.",
      "The shot clock has been mentioned to help improve pace of play on tour, and the topic has gained momentum in recent weeks when the final round of threesomes has taken about 5 1/2 hours to finish.",
      "Weitz said the tour formed a study group a month ago with three players \u2014 Sam Burns, Jhonattan Vegas and Adam Schenk \u2014 who likely would pass their findings to the Players Advisory Council, a 16-member panel that has been more involved than ever.",
      "Rangefinders \u2014 or distance measuring devices \u2014 currently are allowed only at the PGA Championship. The tour is trying to find a spot in the schedule for a test run to see if it helps speed play by getting players the yardages quicker.",
      "Gary Young, the senior vice president of rules and competition, said the sample tests could be at signatures events that have smaller fields, or perhaps a tournament like the Zurich Classic that features team competition.",
      "The potential of disclosing violations would be a break from PGA Tour tradition. The tour is different from most other sports leagues in that it has never disclosed fines, disciplinary action or violations that relate to pace of play. The tour long felt that would be little more than a distraction. What it heard from fans was a need for more transparency.",
      "\u201cI think there's a real moment now for that all to be looked at,\u201d PGA Tour President Tyler Dennis said.",
      "Weitz said the discussion has met with little resistance from players. He had breakfast Wednesday morning with Max Homa and said Homa told him, \u201cWe want to hold each other accountable, and we want to play in a way that is the best version of the fan experience.\u201d",
      "Another example to help speed play was the use of a video review center at the new PGA Tour Studios in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida.",
      "All of the changes came from the \u201cFan Forward\u201d program, which included a survey that grew out of a fan council started in 2017. An outside agency helped the tour reach 50,000 fans who were surveyed in three waves.",
      "The topics:",
      "\u2014 Broadcast enhancement, much of it geared around showing more shots, more meaningful consequences (such as the 36-hole cut) and fewer tap-ins.",
      "\u2014 Competition adjustments, which includes the tour studying another change to the format in the Tour Championship. Depending on player feedback, a proposal could go before the policy board as early as March.",
      "\u201cIf we can get alignment between one concept, then we\u2019ll do it as early as \u201925. If it is, \u2018Yes, we love this idea but,\u2019 and there needs more conversation, it\u2019ll have to be \u201926 because there will be more to work through,\u201d said Billy Schroeder, senior vice president of competitions.",
      "\u2014 Player content and profile. Weitz said for the ages 18-34 demographic, fans were most interested in personality on the course, and then off the course, and lastly competitive performance.",
      "\u2014 Fan experience on the golf course, and what golf can learn from other sports in which the entire playing field can't be seen from one spot. Formula One was an example of that.",
      "The tour already has gone through player-driven changes in recent years, such as the $20 million signature events with smaller fields and no cuts, reducing field sizes in 2026 and lowering to 100 players from 125 players in FedEx Cup who keep full cards.",
      "More changes could be on the way, some of them already being studied.",
      "\u201cIf the voice of the fans is at the center of what we do, we're on the right path,\u201d Weitz said.",

      "For her, the slalom competition Thursday in Courchevel, France, is simply the next step in getting her health back to 100%.",
      "The two-time Olympic champion is still rounding into top form after a spill in a giant slalom race on Nov. 30 in Killington, Vermont, where something punctured her in the side and caused severe trauma to her oblique muscles.",
      "Shiffrin said she wasn't even sure if she would make it back at all this season.",
      "\u201cTo be here at this point is just so incredible,\u201d Shiffrin said in a video she recorded ahead of Thursday's competition. \"It\u2019s just really hard to zoom out and look at that whole big picture and all the hype (around chasing her 100th win) that has been talked about since the start of the season.",
      "\u201cThis is a step. This is a really big step in my recovery. But it\u2019s only one step, actually. We\u2019re taking it as it comes. My biggest goal is to enjoy being back in the start gate again.\u201d",
      "The French region has long held a special place for Shiffrin. She's won seven World Cup events at Courchevel/Meribel, spanning four different disciplines. She's captured three world championship medals in this area, too. It's also where she earned her first win after losing her father. Jeff Shiffrin died at age 65 in February 2020, in an accident at the family home in Colorado.",
      "\u201cIt was very much the first race that helped me believe on any level that I might be able to return to the form that I had before my dad\u2019s accident,\u201d explained Shiffrin, who can become the first Alpine ski racer to amass 100 World Cup wins. \"It helped me realize that even though my life might never be the same, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worth it.

      "With the help of physical therapist Regan Dewhirst, she's steadily regained her strength. On Jan. 1, Shiffrin was back on skis. Two weeks later, she was executing some easy turns through slalom gates. This race, a return to competition, is just the next step along the way.",
      "\u201cWe kind of hit the ground running once I was able to sit up out of bed,\u201d the 29-year-old Shiffrin explained. \u201cThen it was like, \u2018How can we progress every single day?\u2019 It\u2019s felt like an all-out sprint.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The Philadelphia Eagles can trace their run to the Super Bowl to an epic collapse last season",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- The Eagles were indeed flying high as the best in the NFL, boasting a 10-1 record with a No. 1 seed, home-field advantage in the playoffs, and yes, a Super Bowl ring all ahead as credible goals.",
      "This season? On the way to the Super Bowl on Feb. 9 in a rematch from two years ago against Kansas City?",
      "No, try 2023, when coach Nick Sirianni and quarterback Jalen Hurts' run at a Super Bowl instead turned into one of the more epic meltdowns in Philly sports history \u2014 and there have been scores of them.",
      "The Eagles were 10-1 until they were clobbered by San Francisco at home by 23 points in an NFC championship game rematch. Dallas beat the Eagles by 20 points the next week and the losses \u2014 and finger pointing \u2014 snowballed from there. The Eagles limped to a 1-5 regular-season finish before they were put of their misery in a wild-card loss to Tampa Bay.",
      "Sirianni was on the hot seat despite three playoff appearances and a Super Bowl trip in three seasons. Changes were mandated \u2014 from the assistants to the game plan to drafting to repairing the loose connective tissue inside the locker room.",
      "The harsh lessons learned from last season fueled the Eagles on their way to a 14-win regular season and three more wins in the playoffs.",
      "Team owner Jeffrey Lurie and general manager Howie Roseman declined to move on from Sirianni and the Eagles made the moves needed to bring them back to the top of the NFL \u2014 and they are one win away from reaching the pinnacle.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been the story of the 2023 to the 2024 Eagles. As bad of a feeling we had about how last year ended, I think it makes you who you are,\u201d Sirianni said.",
      "Now, it's off to try to win just the franchise's second Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s pretty dope,\u201d Sirianni said. \u201cThat\u2019s all my focus is on.\u201d",
      "Perhaps a sign their rapport this season has turned more cohesive than taxing, Sirianni insisted Hurts was joking when the QB quipped after the NFC title game that he had been freed from the offense's \u201cstraitjacket.\"",
      "Hurts had six wins this season when he threw for less than 200 yards passing before he threw for 246 yards and accounted for four touchdowns in the NFC championship game win over Washington.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been winning a couple different ways this year. I think he was just having fun after the game,\u201d Sirianni said. \u201cI know this, and he\u2019s said this plenty of times: He doesn\u2019t care how we win. I don\u2019t care how we win, as long as we win. We do everything we can do to be able to win.\u201d",
      "The No. 1 storyline in training camp this season was just how thorny was Hurts and Sirianni's relationship last season and would any issues carry over into this one?",
      "Hurts offered a lukewarm endorsement of Sirianni in the aftermath of the playoff loss at Tampa Bay. He said days later his tepid response was only because he was caught off guard by questions about Sirianni\u2019s job status.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been through a lot together, right? A lot of wins, some down times,\u201d Sirianni said this week. \u201cThat\u2019s what kind of forges relationships.\u201d",
      "While some of the best Super Bowl winners in history have come with strained relationships between a QB and coach, Hurts has backed Sirianni publicly this season \u2014 even if it wasn't always a rousing endorsement. They are, through it all, only the first coach/QB pair in franchise history to make two Super Bowls.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s done a great job,\u201d Hurts said.",
      "One of the most distressing signs the Eagles were in free fall mode last season with no way out came when Sirianni made former Lions coach Matt Patricia the defensive play-caller and essentially stripped defensive coordinator Sean Desai of any true responsibility. Desai and Patricia were jettisoned in the offseason, as was offensive coordinator Brian Johnson. Johnson lasted only one season in Philadelphia and Hurts regressed, throwing a career-high 15 interceptions and with his passer rating dropping to 89.1 from 101.5.",
      "The new guys couldn't be better.",
      "Offensive coordinator Kellen Moore assumed play-calling responsibilities and has been one of the hottest head coaching candidates in the NFL. The Eagles jumped on hiring 66-year-old Vic Fangio to run the defense and he's made it the top-rated one in the league.",
      "The defense has allowed 10, 22 and 23 points and has 10 takeaways \u2014 including 21 points off three fumble recoveries against the Commanders \u2014 in the postseason.",
      "\u201cThe players have to play well to play great defense, so it\u2019s a combination of what Vic does and how he motivates the guys to get them to play to the highest level that they can,\u201d Sirianni said. \u201cJust got a ton of respect for him and sure glad he\u2019s here.\u201d",
      "A former backup QB who played behind Dak Prescott with Dallas in 2017 before becoming his position coach the next year, Moore directed a Philadelphia offense that featured Barkley as the ninth running back in NFL history to rush for 2,000 yards in the regular season.",
      "\u201cThere are different things that we\u2019ve been doing that have really helped us. There are some things that are similar to what we\u2019ve done in the past because we\u2019ve been good at those things,\u201d Sirianni said. \u201cAnd then there are things that are new to both what we\u2019ve done and Kellen\u2019s system as well. Kellen\u2019s done a phenomenal job of handling all those things, putting our offense in positions that we been successful in.\u201d",
      "Former Eagles running back Miles Sanders ran for a solid 1,269 yards in the 2022 Super Bowl season and Kenneth Gainwell was \u2014 and still is \u2014 a serviceable backup.",
      "Hurts was the team's leading rusher with 70 yards in the Super Bowl and the Eagles had just 115 yards rushing overall.",
      "The Eagles seem like a whole new franchise at times with Saquon Barkley.",
      "Barkley is near the top of the short list of all-time great Philadelphia sports free-agent signings. He ran for 2,005 yards, rips off 60-yard scoring runs with the ease of a Joel Embiid layup and has turned the offense into its most elite dual threat since the halcyon days of Donovan McNabb and Terrell Owens.",
      "The Eagles aren't going to have a chance at beating the Chiefs if Barkley isn't at his best \u2014 no small feat in a season that's earned him comparisons to Terrell Davis and Eric Dickerson as among the best for a running back in NFL history.",

      "It\u2019s a question Roger Goodell gets when he\u2019s in London: Would the NFL stage a Super Bowl internationally",
      "LONDON -- It\u2019s a question Roger Goodell gets when he\u2019s in London: Would the NFL stage a Super Bowl internationally?",
      "The usual answer is that America\u2019s biggest sporting event is reserved for cities that have NFL franchises. But as the commissioner noted in October, \u201c things change. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all if that happens one day.\u201d",
      "As the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles get set to square off in the Super Bowl in New Orleans on Feb. 9, here\u2019s a look at some key factors and possible venues if the league were to take its marquee event abroad in a bid to take the game to a truly global audience.",
      "It wouldn't be anytime soon. Super Bowl locations are set through 2028. And for international priorities, league officials are focused on increasing the number of regular-season games played abroad. Eight is the maximum number of league-operated games per season but they want to double that soon. This season, Brazil joined the list of countries to host a regular-season game. Spain is next. Ireland and Australia have been identified, and the league is considering the United Arab Emirates, too.",
      "Viewers \u2014 and advertisers \u2014 are accustomed to the 6:30 p.m. ET kickoff but with London five hours ahead and cities in Spain and Germany six hours ahead that would require flexibility on both sides. A game in Mexico City or Brazil would be easier from that perspective.",
      "Europe in February can be dreary weather-wise, but Real Madrid\u2019s newly renovated Santiago Bernabeu Stadium has a retractable roof. Even considering outdoor stadiums, Europe is the fastest-warming continent. The UK had its warmest February on record last year and was wetter than average, and Germany\u2019s weather service said the 2023-24 winter was the country\u2019s third-warmest and also one of the wettest.",
      "Goodell\u2019s comments in London also preceded the U.S. presidential election. President Donald Trump, who tried to buy the Buffalo Bills in 2014, has weighed in on NFL topics in the past.",
      "While U.S. cities are willing to bend to the NFL\u2019s considerable demands for Super Bowl week, their foreign counterparts may be less accommodating. In Europe, local governments are less likely to have the financial autonomy to underwrite a huge event, said Stefan Szymanski, a University of Michigan professor of sport management.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also not clear why the NFL would wish to forego the much greater level of interest here in the US,\" Szymanski added. \"I think it would have to be far more popular in Europe for this to make any sense. But maybe one day.\u201d",
      "A look at some potential hosts:",
      "Pros: Time zone, proximity to U.S., weather. Azteca has hosted five regular-season NFL games, including the first one held outside the United States. Cool history \u2014 both Pele and Maradona won a World Cup at Azteca, site of the \u201c Hand of God \u201d goal by Maradona.",
      "Cons: Altitude. It is 7,200 feet above sea level (2,000 higher than any NFL stadium) Do you want to see players gasping for air by halftime? Not to mention thousands of American fans aren\u2019t traveling for a cardio workout. An NFL game in 2018 was pulled from Azteca on short notice because of field conditions.",
      "Pros: Basically, brand new and custom built with the NFL in mind, it boasts state-of-the-art infrastructure, dedicated NFL locker rooms and field. It has hosted games since 2019 and has a long-term contract with the league. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy got the stadium built and would be a key partner for such a big event.",
      "Cons: Time zone, weather, capacity (under 63,000).",
      "Pros: Wembley is the NFL's \u201cOG\u201d in Europe. It hosted the first regular-season game played outside North America \u2014 a mudfest between the New York Giants and Miami Dolphins in 2007, and it annually hosts a Jacksonville Jaguars game. At 86,000-plus capacity, it\u2019s significantly bigger than Tottenham. Jaguars owner Shad Khan tried to buy the stadium from the English Football Association in 2018.",
      "Cons: Time zone, weather.",
      "Pros: Home of Real Madrid soccer club, Bernabeu has a retractable roof, so no weather worries. Like Tottenham, there\u2019s a retractable soccer field that makes way for an American football field underneath. In 2025, the stadium will host the NFL\u2019s first-ever regular-season game in Spain. Real Madrid said the deal is for several years. Stadium capacity is more than 78,000.",
      "Cons: Time zone.",
      "Pros: A rebuilt Camp Nou with a capacity of 104,000 would offer the NFL the chance to stage the biggest Super Bowl ever. The record attendance is 103,985 at the Rose Bowl in 1980. Like Madrid, Barcelona also brings global brand power. Mediterranean climate. The league has already spoken to Barcelona about a regular-season game.",
      "Cons: Not in the NFL rotation yet. Time zone.",
      "Pros: The NFL has been eyeing a return to Berlin for years. \u201c Olympiastadion \u201d will host its first regular-season game in 2025 as part of a multiyear deal that involves the cooperation of the Berlin Senate. Playing in the capital likely gives Olympic Stadium an advantage over other German cities. Capacity is just over 74,000.",
      "Cons: Time zone, weather.",
      "Pros: A Super Bowl week amid iconic monuments and museums in the French capital might entice even some skeptics. Capacity is 80,000.",
      "Cons: The league and the stadium operators have discussed a regular-season game, but it hasn\u2019t happened yet because of uncertainty over the lease. Time zone, weather.",
      "Pros: One of the largest stadiums in Europe with capacity over 86,000. Dublin's proven ability to handle hordes of Americans who arrive each August for college football, though those games are at the smaller Aviva Stadium.",
      "Cons: Not in the NFL rotation yet, time zone, weather.",
      "Pros: Kickoff time. Enticing for traveling fans just weeks before Carnival. Capacity is 78,000.",
      "Cons: Not in the NFL rotation \u2014 Goodell has named Rio as a likely host but hasn't specified a venue. Sao Paolo's Corinthians Arena is too small. Might be too hot? February is Rio's hottest month with the average daily maximum temperature of 86 degrees and high humidity. The highest temperature at kickoff of a Super Bowl was in 1973 when it was 84 degrees.",

      "Jalen Hurts bucked decades of history just by getting back to the Super Bowl after losing his first trip there as a starting quarterback.",
      "Now Hurts will try to become the fourth quarterback to win the NFL's ultimate prize as a starting quarterback after losing his first Super Bowl start.",
      "Hurts came close two years ago when Philadelphia lost 38-35 to Kansas City in Glendale, Arizona. With a win next week in New Orleans, Hurts will be the first quarterback since John Elway 27 years ago to win a Super Bowl as a starter after losing in his first trip.",
      "Out of the 36 starting quarterbacks who lost their Super Bowl debuts, the only ones to end up on the victory stage as a starter are Kansas City's Len Dawson, who lost Super Bowl 1 and then won it three years later, and Miami's Bob Griese, who followed a loss in Super Bowl 6 with a win the following year.",
      "Just getting back to this stage is unusual for Hurts, who ended a string of 19 straight QBs who failed to return to the Super Bowl after losing their first trip as a starter. The last to get back was Buffalo's Jim Kelly, who lost four straight trips in the 1990-93 seasons.",
      "Hurts will one again face Patrick Mahomes, who will tie Elway for the second most Super Bowl starts at quarterback with his fifth next week, trailing only Tom Brady's 10. With a win, Mahomes will join Brady (six), Terry Bradshaw (four) and Joe Montana (four) as the only QBs with four rings.",
      "Mahomes will make his fifth Super Bowl start as a small group of QBs has had a stranglehold on the AFC's Super Bowl berths. In the last 22 seasons, only six AFC QBs have started a Super Bowl with Brady leading the way with eight, Peyton Manning having four and Ben Roethlisberger three. Joe Flacco and Joe Burrow each have one since the start of the 2003 season.",
      "It has been an entirely different case in the NFC with 19 quarterbacks combining for the 22 starts, including one for Brady with Tampa Bay. Hurts joins Russell Wilson and Eli Manning as the only quarterbacks to start two Super Bowls for an NFC team since the start of the 2003 season.",
      "The Philadelphia Eagles ran their way to the Super Bowl.",
      "The Eagles tied an NFL playoff record with seven touchdown runs in the NFC title game win over Washington, matching the mark Chicago set against Washington in the 1940 NFL title game.",
      "Hurts scored on three of the TD runs with Saquon Barkley adding three more \u2014 including his record seventh touchdown run of at least 60 yards this season. The only other teammates to each run for three touchdowns in a regular season or playoff game since at least 1940 came when Priest Holmes (four) and Derrick Blaylock (three) did it for Kansas City in a 56-10 win over Atlanta on Oct. 24, 2004.",
      "The Eagles also set a record for most yards rushing in a season with 3,731 in the regular season and playoffs. The mark before this season was 3,535 by Miami in its perfect 17-0 season in 1972. Baltimore also eclipsed that mark with 3,664 yards rushing.",
      "The Eagles have a chance to break their own record for most touchdown runs in a season. They have 39 heading into the Super Bowl \u2014 three shy of the mark they set in the 2022 season.",
      "Josh Allen once again came out on the short end of a playoff matchup against Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs.",
      "Allen is the first quarterback ever to lose four postseason starts against another QB, although little of the blame should be pointed in his direction.",
      "Allen has a 100.2 passer rating with 11 combined touchdown runs and passes and just one turnover in four playoff starts against the Chiefs and has lost all of them.",
      "Allen's 101.5 career passer rating in the playoffs ranks fourth best among the 74 quarterbacks with at least six playoff starts in the Super Bowl era, trailing only Super Bowl winners Mahomes (105.6), Kurt Warner (102.8) and Matthew Stafford (102.3). Allen's seven career playoff wins as a starter are the most for any QB who hasn't made the Super Bowl.",
      "The Bills became the first team to win at least 11 games in five straight seasons without reaching a Super Bowl, topping the previoius mark of four held by San Francisco (1995-98) and Philadelphia (2000-03).",
      "The coaching carousel is nearly filled with the New Orleans Saints the only team out of the seven who fired their head coach hasn't found a replacement.",
      "The new batch features four coordinators who got promoted into their first head coaching jobs and two retreads in former Tennessee coach Mike Vrabel getting the nod in New England and Pete Carroll getting hired in Las Vegas after previous stints with the Jets, Patriots and Seahawks.",
      "Carroll joins Bill Parcells and Marty Schottenheimer as the only coaches since 1940 who have had non-interim stints with four franchises.",
      "The addition of Carroll sets up a power-packed roster of coaches in the division, led by Kansas City's Andy Reid, who has 301 career wins and his going for his fourth career Super Bowl title.",
      "Denver's Sean Payton (179 wins) and Carroll (181) have combined for 360 additional wins with both winning Super Bowl titles. Jim Harbaugh of the Chargers has a .685 winning percentage in five seasons as an NFL head coach with one Super Bowl trip and a college national championship.",
      "He will try to join Carroll, Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer as the only coaches to win a title in college and the pros.",
      "The AFC West will be the first division to start a season with every head coaching having previously been to a Super Bowl. The 1999 NFC West came close with Atlanta's Dan Reeves, Carolina's George Seifert, New Orleans' Mike Ditka and St. Louis' Dick Vermeil all having gone with San Francisco's Steve Mariucci the outlier.",
      "Only two divisions didn't have any coaching changes with the NFC West and AFC North remaining stable. That's nothing new for the AFC North, which last had a coaching change following the 2019 season when Cleveland hired Kevin Stefanski to replace Freddie Kitchens.",
      "Next season will mark the sixth straight with the same four head coaches for the four teams. That's the longest stretch ever without a coaching change, topping the four straight seasons for the NFC Central in 1978-81 and the NFC West from 2019-22.",

      "Griner announced the move in a video posted to Instagram on Tuesday night, and her agent, Lindsay Kagawa Colas, confirmed to The Associated Press that the star center would sign a one-year deal with Atlanta.",
      "\u201cFree agency has been everything I wanted it to be, honestly. I was able to find where I wanted to go,\" Griner said in the video. \u201cHonestly, what led me to that decision ultimately was the team, the players. Also my family. I'm thrilled for this chapter.\u201d",

      "Retired swingman Andre Iguodala will become just the seventh player to have his number retired by the Golden State Warriors in a ceremony next month",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- As Andre Iguodala moves around town in the Bay Area these days, he is regularly stopped by fans eager to praise him for how he carried himself while playing for the Golden State Warriors.",
      "For his grit and his drive. For doing all the little things many never saw.",
      "Some even share how his example influenced the way they raise their own kids \u2014 because that's how much he has meant to big-time basketball both on the court and off it.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m used to getting stopped a lot but now it throws me off because I don\u2019t play basketball anymore,\u201d Iguodala said. \"You can see a good fan versus a bad fan from a mile away, and so I\u2019m able to see, OK, this is a decent human being, and this is a genuine interaction. I think the folks that I\u2019m running into in the Bay are of high value and morals, and so 99% are really good interactions.",
      "\u201cYou walk away feeling a little bit better about yourself, actually, because you realize it\u2019s bigger than you.\u201d",
      "Now, Iguodala will give them more to celebrate and cheer about.",
      "The Warriors announced Tuesday that Iguodala is becoming the seventh player to have his number retired by the franchise \u2014 set to join Rick Barry (24), Wilt Chamberlain (13), Nate Thurmond (42), Al Attles (16), Chris Mullin (17) and Tom Meschery (14).",
      "Golden State will honor Iguodala and hang his No. 9 jersey following an afternoon game against Dallas on Feb. 23, meaning former teammate Klay Thompson will have the chance to be there.",
      "\u201cAndre will go down as one of the smartest, shrewdest and most unique and successful players ever to wear a Warriors uniform,\u201d owner Joe Lacob said.",
      "Iguodala retired in October 2023 after 19 NBA seasons and four championships with Golden State, including an NBA Finals MVP award in 2015. Shortly after announcing he was done playing, Iguodala became the acting executive director of the National Basketball Players Association.",
      "The 40-year-old Iguodala was the No. 9 overall pick in the 2004 NBA draft out of Arizona and played in 1,231 career games. He spent eight seasons with the Philadelphia 76ers, one in Denver, six with the Warriors, two in Miami and the last two back for Golden State. He was part of NBA champions in 2015, \u201817, \u201918 and 2022.",
      "A defensive stopper who took on a variety of roles, Iguodala not only mentored teammates at the end of his career but also provided insight to coach Steve Kerr.",
      "It was Kerr who trusted Iguodala to perform on the big stage that the coach moved him into the starting lineup trailing 2-1 to the Cavaliers in the 2015 Finals and gave him the assignment of guarding then-Cleveland star LeBron James.",
      "\u201cA lot of those things go unnoticed,\" the retired swingman said. \u201cI constantly get stopped by folks and they say, 'You know, you really helped me raise my children in terms of bringing a proper approach, to whatever it is that you do, respecting what you do, doing it at a high level, teamwork, discipline. Sacrifice is probably the biggest thing that they use in regards to me, with sometimes less is more, but knowing when to be ready for the big moments.\u201d",

There isn't a single first-year player on pace to average 15 points and appear in enough games to qualify for the league's leaderboard; the last time that happened was 2016-17. And right now, according to BetMGM Sportsbook, the favorite to win rookie of the year is someone who has started four games all season, all of them in the last week or so \u2014 Miami's Kel'el Ware.",

      "\u201cHe really has a chance to be special,\u201d Paul said of Castle, his Spurs teammate.",

      "Workers at a factory in rural Ohio were up all night churning out footballs for this year\u2019s Super Bowl",
      "As soon as this year's Super Bowl matchup was set, workers at the Wilson Sporting Goods football factory jumped into action.",

      "But this time of year it's all about the Super Bowl. The Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs will face off for the Lombardi Trophy for the second time in three years on Feb. 9 in New Orleans.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the footballs, by the numbers:",
      "The two teams will each get a shipment of 108, plus a dozen more for the kickers, all stamped with the Super Bowl logo and team names. Some of the balls will be for practices, while the best ones will be set aside by the quarterbacks. About 50 of those will be bagged and locked away for each team until it's time for kickoff.",
      "Wilson makes five different sizes for players of all levels, from the pros to youth leagues. Some have different patterns. NFL balls are notable for the lack of a stripe on the ends. They're also embedded with a chip that tracks the ball's position on the field, how far it travels and its trajectory.",
      "Normally it takes three days from start to finish. But the first batch of footballs must be sent to the Super Bowl teams Monday, within about 18 hours, so they have enough time to break them in for practices and the game. That's why the workers start production right away the night of the conference title games.",
      "It's a 20-step process, most of it by hand, from cutting out the four leather panels that are sewn together with 250 stitches to putting in the laces. For NFL footballs, the work goes to the factory's most experienced and skilled workers. \u201cCertain parts of the process require a handmade feel,\u201d said Kevin Murphy, general manager of Wilson Team Sports. \u201cIt's like making a beautiful, sculpted pair of shoes.\u201d",
      "Throughout production the balls are weighed, measured and inspected for flaws. Once finished, they're checked again. By the time they're packaged and ready for shipping, each one will have been touched by about 50 workers.",
      "It churns out roughly 500,000 footballs each year, or about 2,500 per day. NFL teams go through several hundred during a season. For the Super Bowl, Wilson will make between 10,000-20,000 commemorative balls that will be sold by retailers nationwide and at the game site. If there's high demand, the factory will keep producing the souvenir balls well after.",
      "Since 1941, Wilson has made every football used by the league. Its factory in Ada has been making the official game balls since 1955. This year the company opened a new plant in the village that allows for more production and a museum. Fans can tour the factory, too."

      "\u201cWe carry this on for him,\u201d said Satou Sabally, a forward with the WNBA's Dallas Wings who plays for the Phantom squad in Unrivaled. \u201cHe would be so proud of this league. He would be proud of \u2019Phe and Stewie. I know that he\u2019s looking down and hopefully he\u2019s smiling and is proud of us.\u201d",
      "Sabally said she still gets emotional when she thinks of that day on Jan. 26, 2020. It reminds her of her playing days at Oregon, when she, Ionescu and their Ducks teammates connected over Bryant.",
      "\u201cI think about ... how we all bonded together over Kobe and how we bonded together for the rest of our lives because he was so impactful,\u201d Sabally added. \u201cHe was really a person that saw us women as the talents who we are. He came to the games, he was so outspoken and he really was really supportive.\"",
      "The shock of the superstar's death echoed throughout the sports and entertainment worlds, with many taking to social media to post emotional tributes to Bryant while expressing their disbelief.",
      "People were glued to their phones and TV screens as news of the crash spread. NBA players were in tears ahead of games that day.",
      "\u201cI still remember exactly where I was whenever we heard the news,\" said Kate Martin of the Golden State Valkyries, playing for Laces BC at Unrivaled, \"and no one really knew if it was fake or real. I think that\u2019s just one of those things where you\u2019re just always going to remember exactly where you were when you heard that.\u201d",
      "Martin never met Bryant but said she cherishes his mentality \u2014 he had a relentless competitiveness \u2014 and the way he elevated women's sports.",
      "Bryant became heavily involved with his daughters' hoops journeys and coached Gianna's youth team. He was often at women's basketball games, especially college ones, with Gianna, who was fascinated with the UConn Huskies. Gianna was in line to further Bryant's legacy on the court. The plan was for her to attend Connecticut, and surely the WNBA was next.",
      "Bryant was passionate about women's sports despite the belief of some that he should not have been involved with the women\u2019s game at all because of a 2003 charge accusing him of sexually assaulting a 19-year-old employee at a Colorado resort.",
      "Bryant had said the two had consensual sex, and the charge was eventually dropped when the woman declined to testify at trial. The woman later filed a civil suit against Bryant that was settled out of court.",
      "There's an image that still circulates in the sports world today: Kobe and Gianna sitting courtside at a 2019 game featuring his Los Angeles Lakers. He wore a bright orange pullover with a white WNBA logo on the front. Gianna sat beaming at his side.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of people started to follow behind Kobe because he recognized our gift and our talent and how special it really is,\" said former Chicago Sky head coach Teresa Weatherspoon, the current coach of Unrivaled's Vinyl BC. \"And his daughter was right there as well.\u201d",
      "That's who Bryant had become \u2014 a face of women's sports advocacy.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s greatly missed,\u201d Martin said. \u201cBut now his legacy will live on forever.\u201d",

      "Alexander Zverev says he is feeling down and emotional after once again coming within one win of earning his first Grand Slam title",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 Alexander Zverev described himself as \u201cquite down\u201d and \u201cquite emotional\" after once again coming within one win of earning his first Grand Slam title.",
      "And unlike his first two defeats in major finals \u2014 both of which he led, and both of which went five sets \u2014 Zverev did not come close to reaching the finish line Sunday in the Australian Open final, which ended with defending champion Jannik Sinner holding the trophy after his 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 victory.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m doing everything I can. I\u2019m working as hard as I ever did. I think I\u2019m doing all the right things off-court. I think I\u2019m practicing the right things. But I lost in straight sets today. I mean, those are facts. That is a fact. I lost to Jannik in straight sets today,\u201d said Zverev, a 27-year-old from Germany who is ranked No. 2 but did not seem anywhere near No. 1 Sinner on this occasion.",
      "\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t want to end my career as the best player of all time to never win a Grand Slam, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Zverev, whose post-match speech was interrupted by someone in Rod Laver Arena calling out the names of two women who have accused him of physical abuse in the past.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll keep doing everything I can,\" Zverev said, \"to lift one of those trophies.\u201d",
      "He is the seventh man in the Open era, which dates to 1968, to start a career with an 0-3 record in title matches at one of the sport's four most important events.",
      "Five of the other six went on to win at least one major championship. The only member of the group who hasn't is Casper Ruud, who is also the only one still active.",
      "Sinner offered support to Zverev during the trophy ceremony Sunday. That came in the form of an arm around the shoulder \u2014 and with his words.",
      "\u201cKeep believing in yourself,\u201d Sinner told Zverev. \u201cKeep working hard, because we all believe that you can lift one of these very, very soon.\u201d",
      "Simone Vagnozzi, one of Sinner\u2019s coaches, said about Zverev: \u201cI really hope, sooner or later, he wins a Slam, because he deserves it.\u201d",
      "Zverev's previous trips to the brink of achieving what he very badly wants came at the 2020 U.S. Open, where he built a two-set lead and even held a match point against Dominic Thiem before faltering, and at the 2024 French Open, where he led Carlos Alcaraz two sets to one before letting that slip away.",
      "This one never got to that sort of stage, and Zverev frequently showed his frustration by cracking rackets",
      "The nearest Zverev came to really making it close was when he was two points from taking the second set. But Sinner took the next four points and that, basically, was that.",
      "\u201cThat was a massive point. I think whoever wins that set, kind of can get a little bit of momentum. Being down two sets to love, especially, then his confidence goes up, mine goes down. It\u2019s a long way back then against someone like Jannik,\u201d Zverev said. \u201cIf it\u2019s one set all, maybe I have a chance. But ... I didn\u2019t stop fighting. I didn\u2019t stop believing. Then, in the third set, I thought he outplayed me more than in the other sets.\u201d",

      "The start of Sunday's race was delayed for 15 minutes as organizers needed more time to prepare the course after overnight snowfall and rain in the hours leading up to the race.",
      "Ariane Raedler had a nasty tumble when she came off the course and lost balance over a patch of softer snow, but the Austrian got up quickly and appeared to have avoided injury.",

      "The Justice Department sued to block Hewlett Packard Enterprise's $14 billion acquisition of rival Juniper Networks on Thursday, the first attempt to stop a merger by a new Trump administration that is expected to take a softer approach to mergers.",
      "The Justice complaint alleges that Hewlett Packer Enterprise, under increased competitive pressure from the fast-rising Juniper, was forced to discount products and services and invest more in its own innovation, eventually leading the company to simply buy its rival.",

      "The Justice Department's intervention \u2014 the first of the new administration and just 10 days after Donald Trump's inauguration \u2014 comes as somewhat of a surprise. Most predicted a second Trump administration to ease up on antitrust enforcement and be more receptive to mergers and deal-making after years of hypervigilance under former President Joe Biden\u2019s watch.",
      "Hewlett Packard Enterprise announced one year ago that it was buying Juniper Networks for $40 a share in a deal expected to double HPE\u2019s networking business.",

      "The Justice Department said that Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Juniper are the U.S.'s second- and third-largest providers of wireless local area network (WLAN) products and services for businesses.",
      "\u201cThe proposed transaction between HPE and Juniper, if allowed to proceed, would further consolidate an already highly concentrated market \u2014 and leave U.S. enterprises facing two companies commanding over 70% of the market,\u201d the complaint said, adding that Cisco Systems was the industry leader.",
      "Many businesses and investors accused Biden regulatory agencies of antitrust overreach and were looking forward to a friendlier Trump administration.",
      "Under Biden, the Federal Trade Commission sued to block a $24.6 billion merger between Kroger and Albertsons that would have been the largest grocery store merger in U.S. history. Two judges agreed with the FTC\u2019s case, blocking the proposed deal in December.",
      "In 2023, the Department of Justice, through the courts, forced American and JetBlue airlines to abandon their partnership in the northeast U.S., saying it would reduce competition and eventually cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars a year. That partnership had the blessing of the Trump administration when it took effect in early 2021.",
      "U.S. regulators also proposed last year to break up Google for maintaining an \u201cabusive monopoly\u201d through its market-dominate search engine, Chrome. Court hearings on Google\u2019s punishment are scheduled to begin in April, with the judge aiming to issue a final decision before Labor Day. It\u2019s unclear where the Trump administration stands on the case.",
      "One merger that both Trump and Biden agreed shouldn\u2019t go through is Nippon Steel\u2019s proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel. Biden blocked the nearly $15 billion acquisition just before his term ended. The companies challenged that decision in a federal lawsuit early this year.",

      "Researchers have found the oldest known evidence of lead pollution dating to around 5,200 years ago in ancient Greece",
      "WASHINGTON -- Ancient Greece produced the earliest records of democracy, western philosophy \u2014 and, it turns out, lead pollution.",
      "Researchers studying sediment cores recovered from mainland Greece and the Aegean Sea have found the oldest known evidence of lead pollution in the environment dating to around 5,200 years ago.",
      "That's 1,200 years older than the previous earliest recorded lead pollution, which was found in a peatbog in Serbia.",
      "In antiquity, lead was released into the atmosphere as a byproduct of smelting ore for copper and silver. The toxic metal later condensed as dust and settled onto the soil.",
      "\u201cSilver was used for jewelry, for special objects \u2014 but it wasn't found in a pure state,\u201d but mined in ore combined with lead, said Heidelberg University archaeologist Joseph Maran, co-author of a new study published Thursday in Communications Earth and Environment.",
      "The site with the earliest signs of lead contamination is located in northeastern Greece, near the island of Thasos. Prior archaeological evidence suggests Thasos was one of the region\u2019s most significant sites for silver mining and metalwork, said Maran.",
      "\u201cLead released from smelting is the world\u2019s first form of toxic or industrial pollution,\u201d said Yale historian Joseph Manning, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The researchers found that levels of lead contamination remained fairly low and localized in ancient Greece, considered the cradle of European civilization, throughout the Bronze Age, the Classical period and the Hellenistic period. The Classical period is famous for Athenian democracy, Socrates and Plato, and the Hellenistic period saw Greek cultural influence peak across the Mediterranean region.",
      "But around 2,150 years ago, the researchers detected \u201ca very strong and abrupt increase\" in lead emissions caused by human activities across Greece, said co-author Andreas Koutsodendris at Heidelberg University.",
      "Around that time, in 146 B.C., the Roman army conquered the Greek peninsula, transforming the region\u2019s society and economy. As Roman trade, colonies and shipping expanded across the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, demand for silver coins grew rapidly, requiring smelting that released lead, said Koutsodendris.",
      "Later the Roman Empire used lead for tableware and for construction, including pipes.",
      "Previous research \u2013 including an analysis of ice cores from Greenland \u2013 had detected high levels of lead across much of the Northern Hemisphere during Roman times.",

      "It's the latest instance of a large corporation settling litigation with the president, who has threatened retribution on his critics and rivals, and comes as Meta and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, have joined other large technology companies in trying to ingratiate themselves with the new Trump administration.",
      "The people familiar with the matter spoke on the condition of anonymity Wednesday to discuss the agreement. Two of the people said terms of the agreement include $22 million going to the nonprofit that will become Trump's future presidential library. The balance will go to legal fees and other litigants, they said.",
      "The Wall Street Journal was first to report on the settlement.",
      "Zuckerberg visited Trump in November at his private Florida club to try to mend fences with the incoming president, something other technology, business and government officials have done as well. At the dinner, Trump brought up the litigation and suggested they try to resolve it, kick-starting two months of negotiations between the parties, the people said.",

      "Before Trump's inauguration, Meta announced it was dropping fact-checking on its platform \u2014 a longtime priority of Trump and his allies.",
      "Trump filed the lawsuit months after his first term ended, calling the action by the social media companies \u201cillegal, shameful censorship of the American people.\u201d",
      "Twitter, Facebook and Google are all private companies, and users must agree to their terms of service to use their products. Under Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, social media platforms are allowed to moderate their services by removing posts that, for instance, are obscene or violate the services\u2019 own standards, so long as they are acting in \u201cgood faith.\u201d The law also generally exempts internet companies from liability for the material that users post.",
      "But Trump and some other politicians have long argued that X, Facebook and other social media platforms have abused that protection and should lose their immunity \u2014 or at least have it curtailed.",
      "The Meta settlement comes after ABC News agreed last month to pay $15 million toward Trump\u2019s presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos\u2019 inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll.",

      "CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he expects 2025 to \u201cbe the year when a highly intelligent and personalized AI assistant reaches more than 1 billion people, and I expect Meta AI to be that leading AI assistant.\u201d",
      "The Menlo Park, California-based company earned $20.83 billion, or $8.02 per share, in the October-December quarter. That's up 49% from $14.02 billion, or $5.33 per share, in the same period a year earlier.",
      "Revenue grew 21% to $48.39 billion from $40.11 billion.",
      "Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of $6.76 per share on revenue of $47 billion, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "\u201cWe continue to make good progress on AI, glasses, and the future of social media,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a statement.",
      "For the current quarter, Meta said expects revenue of $39.5 billion to $41.8 billion. Analysts are expecting revenue at the high end of that range \u2014 $41.68 billion.",
      "The company also said it expects expenses in the range of $114 billion to $119 billion, driven by infrastructure costs and employee compensation. Meta had 74,067 employees as of Dec. 31, up 10% from a year earlier.",
      "\u201cMeta\u2019s Q4 performance underscores the company\u2019s resilience in a still-uncertain digital ad market. By beating both earnings and revenue estimates, they\u2019ve demonstrated that cost discipline and efficiency gains are paying dividends,\u201d said Jesse Cohen, an analyst with Investing.com. \u201cHowever, the real headline is their commitment to aggressive capital expenditures. This signals Meta is doubling down on its AI infrastructure and metaverse ambitions, even as investors grapple with the costs.\u201d",
      "Separately, Meta has agreed to pay roughly $25 million to settle a 2021 lawsuit that President Donald Trump brought against the company and Zuckerberg after Trump's accounts were suspended following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "\u201cThis is also going to be a big year for redefining our relationship with governments,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a conference call with analysts. \u201cWe now have a U.S. administration that is proud of our leading companies, prioritizes American technology winning, and that will defend our values and interests abroad. And I\u2019m optimistic about the progress and innovation this is going to unlock.\u201d",
      "Meta's stock rose $13.53, or 2%, to $690.02 in after-hours trading."

      "A new report says advanced artificial intelligence systems have the potential to create extreme new risks, such as fueling widespread job losses, enabling terrorism or running amok",
      "LONDON -- Advanced artificial intelligence systems have the potential to create extreme new risks, such as fueling widespread job losses, enabling terrorism or running amok, experts said in a first-of-its-kind international report Wednesday cataloging the range of dangers posed by the technology.",
      "The International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI is being released ahead of a major AI summit in Paris next month. The paper is backed by 30 countries including the U.S. and China, marking rare cooperation between the two countries as they battle over AI supremacy, highlighted by Chinese startup DeepSeek stunning the world this week with its budget chatbot in spite of U.S. export controls on advanced chips to the country.",
      "The report by a group of independent experts is a \u201csynthesis\u201d of existing research intended to help guide officials working on drawing up guardrails for the rapidly advancing technology, Yoshua Bengio, a prominent AI scientist who led the study, told the Associated Press in an interview.",
      "\u201cThe stakes are high,\u201d the report says, noting that while a few years ago the best AI systems could barely spit out a coherent paragraph, now they can write computer programs, generate realistic images and hold extended conversations.",
      "While some AI harms are already widely known, such as deepfakes, scams and biased results, the report said that \u201cas general-purpose AI becomes more capable, evidence of additional risks is gradually emerging\u201d and risk management techniques are only in their early stages.",
      "It comes amid warnings this week about artificial intelligence from the Vatican and the group behind the Doomsday Clock.",
      "The report focuses on general purpose AI, typified by chatbots such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT used to carry out many different kinds of tasks. The risks fall into three categories: malicious use, malfunctions and widespread \u201csystemic\u201d risks.",
      "Bengio, who with two other AI pioneers won computer science\u2019s top prize in 2019, said the 100 experts who came together on the report don\u2019t all agree on what to expect from AI in the future. Among the biggest disagreements within the AI research community is the timing of when the fast-developing technology will surpass human capabilities across a variety of tasks and what that will mean.",
      "\u201cThey disagree also about the scenarios,\u201d Bengio said. \u201cOf course, nobody has a crystal ball. Some scenarios are very beneficial. Some are terrifying. I think it\u2019s really important for policymakers and the public to take stock of that uncertainty.\u201d",
      "Researchers delved into the details surrounding possible dangers. AI makes it easier, for example, to learn how to create biological or chemical weapons because AI models can provide step by step plans. But it\u2019s \u201cunclear how well they capture the practical challenges\u201d of weaponizing and delivering the agents, it said.",
      "General purpose AI is also likely to transform a range of jobs and \u201cdisplace workers,\u201d the report says, noting that some researchers believe it could create more jobs than it takes away, while others think it will drive down wages or employment rates, though there\u2019s plenty of uncertainty over how it will play out.",
      "AI systems could also run out of control, either because they actively undermine human oversight or humans pay less attention, the report said.",
      "However, a raft of factors make it hard to manage the risks, including AI developers knowing little about how their models work, the authors said.",
      "The paper was commissioned at an inaugural global summit on AI safety hosted by Britain in November 2023, where nations agreed to work together to contain potentially \u201ccatastrophic risks.\u201d At a follow-up meeting hosted by South Korea last year, AI companies pledged to develop AI safety while world leaders backed setting up a network of public AI safety institutes.",
      "The report, also backed by the United Nations and the European Union, is meant to weather changes in governments, such as the recent presidential transition in the U.S., leaving it up to each country to choose how it responds to AI risks. President Donald Trump rescinded former President Joe Biden\u2019s AI safety policies on his first day in office, and has since directed his new administration to craft its own approach. But Trump hasn\u2019t made any move to disband the AI Safety Institute that Biden formed last year, part of a growing international network of such centers.",
      "World leaders, tech bosses and civil society are expected to convene again at the Paris AI Action Summit on Feb 10-11. French officials have said countries will sign a \u201ccommon declaration\u201d on AI development, and agree to a pledge on sustainable development of the technology.",
      "Bengio said the report's aim was not to \"propose a particular way to evaluate systems or anything.\" The authors stayed away from prioritizing particular risks or making specific policy recommendations. Instead they laid out what the scientific literature on AI says \u201cin a way that\u2019s digestible by policymakers.\"",
      "\u201cWe need to better understand the systems we\u2019re building and the risks that come with them so that we can we can take these better decisions in the future,\u201d he said.",

      "Sonic booms are heard on the ground when airplanes fly faster than the speed of sound \u2014 typically about 760 mph (1,223 kph) near sea level but varying depending on temperature, altitude and other conditions, according to the Congressional Research Service.",
      "As a supersonic plane speeds through the air, it pushes molecules aside with great force, forming a shock wave \u201cmuch like a boat creates a wake in water,\u201d according to NASA.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s flight happened in the same airspace where in 1947 Charles \u201cChuck\u201d Yeager became the first person to break the sound barrier, piloting an orange, bullet-shaped Bell X-1 rocket plane."

      "Chinese artificial intelligence startup company DeepSeek stunned markets and AI experts with its claim that it built its immensely popular chatbot at a fraction of the cost of those made by American tech titans.",
      "That immediately called into question the billions of dollars U.S. tech companies are spending on a massive expansion of energy-hungry data centers they say are needed to unlock the next wave of artificial intelligence.",
      "Could this new AI mean the world needs significantly less electricity for the technology than everyone thinks? The answer has profound implications for the overheating climate . AI uses vast amounts of energy, much of which comes from burning fossil fuels, which causes climate change. Tech companies have said their electricity use is going up, when it was supposed to be ramping down, ruining their carefully-laid plans to address climate change.",
      "\u201cThere has been a very gung ho, go ahead at all costs mentality in this space, pushing toward investment in fossil fuels,\u201d said Eric Gimon, senior fellow at Energy Innovation. \u201cThis is an opportunity to tap the brakes.\u201d",
      "Making AI more efficient could be less taxing on the environment, experts say, even if its huge electricity needs are not going away.",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s claims of building its impressive chatbot on a budget drew curiosity that helped make its AI assistant the No. 1 downloaded free app on Apple\u2019s iPhone this week, ahead of U.S.-made chatbots ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden we wake up Monday morning and we see a new player number one on the App Store, and all of a sudden it could be a potential gamechanger overnight,\" said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. \u201c It caused a bit of a panic. These were the hottest stocks in the world.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s app competes well with other leading AI models. It can compose software code, solve math problems and address other questions that take multiple steps of planning. It's attracted attention for its ability to explain its reasoning in the process of answering questions.",
      "Leading analysts have been poring through the startup's public research papers about its new model, R1, and its precursors. Among the details that stood out was DeepSeek\u2019s assertion that the cost to train the flagship v3 model behind its AI assistant was only $5.6 million, a stunningly low number compared to the multiple billions of dollars spent to build ChatGPT and other well-known systems. DeepSeek hasn\u2019t responded to requests for comment.",
      "The $5.6 million number only included actually training the chatbot, not the costs of earlier-stage research and experiments, the paper said. DeepSeek was also working under some constraints: U.S. export controls on the most powerful AI chips. It said it relied on a relatively low-performing AI chip from California chipmaker Nvidia that the U.S. hasn\u2019t banned for sale in China.",
      "Data centers consumed about 4.4% of all U.S. electricity in 2023 and that's expected to increase to 6.7% to 12% of total U.S. electricity by 2028, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.",
      "It's been axiomatic that U.S. tech giants must spend much more on building out data centers and other infrastructure to train and run their AI systems. Meta Platforms, the parent of Facebook and Instagram, says it plans to spend up to $65 billion this year, including on a massive data center complex coming to Louisiana.",
      "Microsoft said it plans to spend $80 billion this year. And Trump last week joined the CEOs of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank to announce a joint venture that hopes to invest up to $500 billion on data centers and the electricity generation needed for AI development, starting with a project already under construction in Texas.",
      "When there's an innovative technology that's useful to the general population and it's affordable, people will use it, said Vic Shao, founder of DC Grid, which delivers off-grid, direct current power to data centers and electric vehicle charging stations.",
      "That means data centers will still be built, though they may be able to operate more efficiently, said Travis Miller, an energy and utilities strategist at Morningstar Securities Research.",
      "\u201cWe think that the growth in electricity demand will end up at the lower end of most of the ranges out there,\u201d he said.",
      "If DeepSeek's claims hold true, some routine AI queries might not need a data center and could be shifted to phones, said Rahul Sandil, vice president and general manager for global marketing and communications at MediaTek, a semiconductor company. That would ease the computing need and give more time to scale up renewable energy sources for data centers.",
      "Bloom Energy is one of the AI-related stocks that took a hit Monday. KR Sridhar, founder and CEO, said it's imperative that the U.S. leads in AI because it can power data centers with clean energy, unlike other countries that still primarily rely on coal.",
      "\u201cWe can continue to make it better and we will continue to make it better,\u201d he said.",
      "Rick Villars, an analyst for market research group IDC, said the DeepSeek news could influence how AI researchers advance their models, but they\u2019ll still need plenty of data centers and electricity.",
      "\u201cWe think this actually could boost and accelerate the time frame for when AI becomes much more embedded into our lives, in the work sense, the living sense and in health care,\u201d Villars said. \u201cSo we still think the capacity is required.\u201d",

      "X is teaming up with Visa to soon offer a system for real-time payments on the social media platform",
      "NEW YORK -- X is teaming up with Visa to soon offer a system for real-time payments on the social media platform \u2014 signaling some progress in a yearslong vision from billionaire owner Elon Musk to create an \u201ceverything app.\u201d",
      "Visa is the first partner for the platform's \u201cX Money Account\" service, which is set to launch later this year, X CEO Linda Yaccarino said in a Tuesday post announcing the news. The offering, Yaccarino noted, will support an in-platform digital wallet and peer-to-peer payments connected to users' debit cards, with an option to transfer funds to a bank account.",
      "According to Visa, which also posted about the partnership on X Tuesday, these services will be powered by Visa Direct \u2014 the payment giant's instant money transferring service \u2014 and will be available to X Money Account users in the U.S.",
      "Whether X Money will become available to consumers in other countries, and perhaps through additional payment partners in the near future is still known. And an exact date for the U.S. launch has also not been announced yet.",
      "In her post Tuesday, Yaccarino called the partnership with Visa a \u201cmilestone for the Everything App\u201d and the \u201cfirst of many big announcements about X Money this year.\"",
      "The prospect of San Francisco-based X, formerly known as Twitter, becoming an \u201ceverything app\" has been floated around for some time. Before officially closing the deal to purchase the platform for $44 billion back in 2022, Musk expressed interest in creating his own version of something similar to China\u2019s WeChat \u2014 a \u201csuper app\u201d that does video chats, messaging, streaming and payments.",
      "And his fascination with such a platform began long before the Twitter deal was on the table. Musk has been toying with the idea of an \u201ceverything app\u201d since the late 1990s when he launched a startup called X.com that was later merged into what became X.com. He continued to push for PayPal to diversify but was rebuffed by company CEO Peter Thiel and other executives. PayPal was sold in 2002 to eBay for $1.5 billion \u2014 providing Musk with a windfall that he funneled into the creation of SpaceX and an investment in Tesla in its early days.",
      "The landscape is far more competitive today \u2014 with a handful of companies making similar efforts to expand their in-platform offerings. Other social media giants, such as Facebook parent Meta, have added shopping, games and even dating features.",
      "Consumers now have different platforms at their disposal for communications, payment services, entertainment and more. How X's coming \u201ceverything\u201d features will fare has yet to be seen. Since Musk's 2022 takeover, the platform has already alienated many users and advertisers over reports of rising hate speech and misinformation.",
      "X\u2019s ambitions could also thrust the company into the crosshairs of other powerful tech giants trying to fend off a perceived competitive threat. U.S. regulators have alleged that Apple, for example, has been illegally using its market power to stifle so-called super apps from making their way onto its iPhone since 2017.",
      "As part of an antitrust lawsuit filed last year, the U.S. Justice Department said it had uncovered evidence showing that Apple believed a super app would lessen consumers\u2019 usage of the iPhone\u2019s own software and services, including payment processing. The Cupertino, California, company has vehemently denied the allegations and is trying to persuade a federal judge in New Jersey to dismiss the entire case.",

      "The 40-year-old founder of China's DeepSeek, an AI startup that has startled markets with its capacity to compete with industry leaders like OpenAI, kept a low profile as he built up a hedge fund that now manages a reported $8 billion in assets",
      "BANGKOK -- The 40-year-old founder of China\u2019s DeepSeek, an AI startup that has startled markets with its capacity to compete with industry leaders like OpenAI, kept a low profile as he built up a hedge fund and then refined its quantitative models to branch into artificial intelligence.",
      "Liang Wenfeng, who founded DeepSeek in 2023, was born in southern China's Guangdong and studied in eastern China's Zhejiang province, home to e-commerce giant Alibaba and other tech firms, according to Chinese media reports.",
      "The hedge fund he set up in 2015, High-Flyer Quantitative Investment Management, developed models for computerized stock trading and began using machine-learning techniques to refine those strategies.",
      "Like many Chinese quantitative traders, High-Flyer was hit by losses when regulators cracked down on such trading in the past year. However, it reportedly manages $8 billion in assets, ample resources for funding DeepSeek\u2019s AI research.",
      "It also has abundant computing power for AI, since High-Flyer had by 2022 amassed a cluster of 10,000 of California-based Nvidia\u2019s high-performance A100 graphics processor chips that are used to build and run AI systems, according to a post that summer on Chinese social media platform WeChat. The U.S. soon after restricted sales of those chips to China.",
      "\u201cThing is, we are sure now that we want to do this, can do this, and are capable of doing this, so we\u2019re among the best-suited candidates to tackle it at this moment,\" Liang told Waves, a tech media outlet, in 2023.",
      "\u201cCurrently, neither tech giants nor startups have an unassailable lead. With OpenAI paving the way, everyone is working with published papers and open-source code,\u201d it quoted him as saying.",
      "Liang said he spends his days reading papers, writing code, and participating in group discussions, like other researchers.",
      "DeepSeek is exploring what intelligence means, he said.",
      "\u201cPeople may think there\u2019s some hidden business logic behind this, but it\u2019s mainly driven by curiosity,\u201d Liang said.",
      "When DeepSeek was asked, \u201cWho is Liang Wenfeng?\u201d its first answer was to name a different Chinese entrepreneur with the same name, at least as spelled in English letters.",
      "When asked: \u201cWhere is Liang Wenfeng from and where did he go to university?\u201d it said that as of October 2023, the most recent knowledge cutoff for DeepSeek's R1 AI model, \u201cthere is no publicly available information about Liang Wenfeng\u2019s background, including his place of origin or educational history.\"",
      "\"If you are referring to the founder of DeepSeek, details about his personal life or academic background have not been disclosed publicly. For more information about DeepSeek, you can visit its official website,\u201d it said.",
      "Liang's focused approach fits in with his determination to push AI learning forward. After decades of relying on innovation from the West, he says China should be making its own contributions.",
      "\u201cWhat we see is that Chinese AI can\u2019t be in the position of following forever. We often say that there is a gap of one or two years between Chinese AI and the United States, but the real gap is the difference between originality and imitation,\u201d he said in another Waves interview in November. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t change, China will always be only a follower \u2014 so some exploration is inescapable.\u201d",

    "summary": "NATO is deploying eyes in the sky and on the Baltic Sea to protect cables and pipelines that stitch together the nine countries with shores on Baltic waters",
    "story": [
      "NATO is deploying eyes in the sky and on the Baltic Sea to protect cables and pipelines that stitch together the nine countries with shores on Baltic waters",
      "ABOARD A FRENCH NAVY FLIGHT OVER THE BALTIC SEA -- With its powerful camera, the French Navy surveillance plane scouring the Baltic Sea zoomed in on a cargo ship plowing the waters below \u2014 closer, closer and closer still until the camera operator could make out details on the vessel's front deck and smoke pouring from its chimney.",
      "The long-range Atlantique 2 aircraft on a new mission for NATO then shifted its high-tech gaze onto another target, and another after that until, after more than five hours on patrol, the plane's array of sensors had scoped out the bulk of the Baltic \u2014 from Germany in the west to Estonia in the northeast, bordering Russia.",
      "The flight's mere presence in the skies above the strategic sea last week, combined with military ships patrolling on the waters, also sent an unmistakable message: The NATO alliance is ratcheting up its guard against suspected attempts to sabotage underwater energy and data cables and pipelines that crisscross the Baltic, prompted by a growing catalogue of incidents that have damaged them.",
      "\u201cWe will do everything in our power to make sure that we fight back, that we are able to see what is happening and then take the next steps to make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again. And our adversaries should know this,\" NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said this month in announcing a new alliance mission, dubbed \u201cBaltic Sentry,\u201d to protect the underwater infrastructure vital to the economic well-being of Baltic-region nations.",
      "Power and communications cables and gas pipelines stitch together the nine countries with shores on the Baltic, a relatively shallow and nearly landlocked sea. A few examples are the 152-kilometer (94-mile) Balticconnector pipeline that carries gas between Finland and Estonia, the high-voltage Baltic Cable connecting the power grids of Sweden and Germany, and the 1,173-kilometer (729-mile) C-Lion1 telecommunications cable between Finland and Germany.",
      "Undersea pipes and cables help power economies, keep houses warm and connect billions of people. More than 1.3 million kilometers (807,800 miles) of fiber optic cables \u2014 more than enough to stretch to the moon and back \u2014 span the world's oceans and seas, according to TeleGeography, which tracks and maps the vital communication networks. The cables are typically the width of a garden hose. But 97% of the world\u2019s communications, including trillions of dollars of financial transactions, pass through them each day.",
      "\u201cIn the last two months alone, we have seen damage to a cable connecting Lithuania and Sweden, another connecting Germany and Finland, and most recently, a number of cables linking Estonia and Finland. Investigations of all of these cases are still ongoing. But there is reason for grave concern,\" Rutte said on Jan. 14.",
      "At least 11 Baltic cables have been damaged since October 2023 \u2014 the most recent being a fiber optic cable connecting Latvia and the Swedish island of Gotland, reported to have ruptured on Sunday. Although cable operators note that subsea cable damage is commonplace, the frequency and concentration of incidents in the Baltic heightened suspicions that damage might have been deliberate.",
      "There also are fears that Russia could target cables as part of a wider campaign of so-called \u201chybrid warfare\u201d to destabilize European nations helping Ukraine defend itself against the full-scale invasion that Moscow has been pursuing since 2022.",
      "Without specifically blaming Russia, Rutte said: \u201cHybrid means sabotage. Hybrid means cyber-attacks. Hybrid means sometimes even assassination attacks, attempts, and in this case, it means hitting on our critical undersea infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Finnish police suspect that the Eagle S, an oil tanker that damaged the Estlink 2 power cable and two other communications cables linking Finland and Estonia on Dec. 25th, is part of Moscow\u2019s \u201cshadow fleet\u201d used to avoid war-related sanctions on Russian oil exports.",
      "Finnish authorities seized the tanker shortly after it left a Russian port and apparently cut the cables by dragging its anchor. Finnish investigators allege the ship left an almost 100-kilometer (62-mile) long anchor trail on the seabed.",
      "Several Western intelligence officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of their work, told The Associated Press that recent damage was most likely accidental, seemingly caused by anchors being dragged by ships that were poorly maintained and poorly crewed.",
      "One senior intelligence official told AP that ships' logs and mechanical failures with ships' anchors were among \u201cmultiple indications\u201d pointing away from Russian sabotage. The official said Russian cables were also severed. Another Western official, also speaking anonymously to discuss intelligence matters, said Russia sent an intelligence-gathering vessel to the site of one cable rupture to investigate the damage.",
      "The Washington Post first reported on the emerging consensus among U.S. and European security services that maritime accidents likely caused recent damage.",
      "The European Subsea Cables Association, representing cable owners and operators, noted in November after faults were reported on two Baltic links that, on average, a subsea cable is damaged somewhere in the world every three days. In northern European waters, the main causes of damage are commercial fishing or ship anchors, it said.",
      "In the fiber-optic cable rupture on Sunday connecting Latvia and Sweden, Swedish authorities detained a Maltese-flagged ship bound for South America with a cargo of fertilizer.",
      "Navibulgar, a Bulgarian company that owns the Vezhen, said any damage was unintentional and that the ship's crew discovered while navigating in extremely bad weather that its left anchor appeared to have dragged on the seabed.",
      "The alliance is deploying warships, maritime patrol aircraft and naval drones for the mission to provide \u201cenhanced surveillance and deterrence.\u201d",
      "Aboard the French Navy surveillance flight, the 14-member crew cross-checked ships they spotted from the air against lists of vessels they had been ordered to watch for.",
      "\u201cIf we witness some suspicious activities from ships as sea \u2013 for example, ships at very low speed or at anchorage in a position that they shouldn\u2019t be at this time \u2013 so this is something we can see,\u201d said the flight commander, Lt. Alban, whose surname was withheld by the French military for security reasons.",
      "\u201cWe can have a very close look with our sensors to see what is happening.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump says Microsoft is among the U.S. companies looking to take control of TikTok to help the popular app avert an effective ban that could kick-in in April",
      "President Donald Trump said Monday evening that Microsoft is among the U.S. companies looking to take control of TikTok to help the popular app avert an effective ban that could kick-in in April.",
      "\u201cI would say yes,\u201d Trump told reporters when asked if Microsoft was one of the companies interested in helping to bring about a new ownership of TikTok, a requirement set by Congress to keep the app functioning in the U.S.",
      "Trump added that other companies were also interested in purchasing TikTok, but wouldn\u2019t provide a list.",
      "\u201cI like bidding wars because you make your best deals,\u201d Trump said as he spoke to reporters aboard Air Force One while flying back to Washington from Miami, where Republican House members were holding a conference.",
      "Microsoft declined to comment. Representatives for TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In one of his first acts in office last week, Trump extended the deadline for TikTok to find new ownership that satisfies the government by 75 days, to April 4 from January 19.",
      "The president has said that he\u2019s looking for the ultimate purchaser to give the U.S. a 50% stake in the company, which is owned by China-based ByteDance. But the details remain murky, and its unclear whether he's proposing control of the app by the government or another U.S. entity.",
      "Last week, the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI presented a new proposal to ByteDance that would allow the U.S. government to own up to 50% of a new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok\u2019s U.S. business, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "Several other investors \u2014 including billionaire Frank McCourt and Trump's former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin \u2014 have spoken publicly about their desire to purchase TikTok's U.S. platform. Trump has also said he\u2019s spoken to \u201cmany people\u201d privately about the company.",
      "After the bipartisan law was signed by former President Joe Biden in April, ByteDance said it did not have plans to sell the platform and fought the statute in court for months. China also rebuked Washington over the divestment push, though more recently it appears to be softening its stance.",
      "In media interviews last week, Bill Ford, the chairman of the global investing firm General Atlantic and a ByteDance board member, said the company is prepared to engage with the Trump administration and Chinese officials to find a solution that keeps TikTok available. He also floated the idea that there could be a solution short of a full divesture by ByteDance.",
      "Lawmakers and officials in both parties have raised national security concerns about Chinese ownership and potential manipulation on the immensely popular platform, which is used by more than 170 million U.S. users.",
      "Trump was in favor of a TikTok ban before he reversed his position last year. He credits the platform with helping him win more young voters during the recent presidential election.",
      "Microsoft, along with Walmart, made a failed bid for TikTok during Trump\u2019s first term after Trump tried to ban the app. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella later described it as the \u201cstrangest thing I\u2019ve ever worked on.\u201d"

      "Workers at a Whole Foods Market in Pennsylvania have voted to unionize, becoming the first group of employees to pull off a labor win at the Amazon-owned grocery store chain",
      "Workers at a Whole Foods Market in Pennsylvania voted to unionize on Monday, becoming the first group of employees to pull off a labor win at the Amazon-owned grocery store chain.",
      "Employees at the Philadelphia store cast 130 votes \u2014 or about 57% of the ballots cast \u2014 in favor of joining a local chapter of The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union for the purposes of collective bargaining. According to the National Labor Relations Board, which oversaw the election, 100 workers rejected the motion.",
      "\u201cThis fight is far from over, but today\u2019s victory is an important step forward,\" said Wendell Young IV, the president of UFCW Local 1776. \"We are ready to bring Whole Foods to the bargaining table to negotiate a fair first contract that reflects the workers\u2019 needs and priorities.\u201d",
      "The results mark the first successful entry of organized labor into Amazon\u2019s grocery business, which includes Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh and the Amazon Go convenience stores. Amazon, which purchased Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion, has tried to fend off organizing efforts in its stores as well as by delivery drivers and warehouse workers.",
      "Nearly three years ago, Amazon warehouse workers in the New York City borough of Staten Island voted to be represented in labor negotiations by a fledgling union that has since affiliated with the Teamsters. But Amazon has refused to come to the bargaining table.",
      "Employees at the Whole Foods store, located in the center of Philadelphia, started organizing early last year, Young said. They teamed up with UFCW Local 1776 in the late summer, and in November petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to hold an official election.",
      "The local union said the store workers hoped a successful vote would help them secure higher wages, more affordable health care coverage, child care support, greater work-life balance and better working conditions.",
      "In a statement after the votes were counted Monday night, Whole Foods said it \u201cis proud to offer competitive compensation, great benefits, and career advancement opportunities to all Team Members.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are disappointed by the outcome of this election, but we are committed to maintaining a positive working environment in our Philly Center City store,\u201d the company added.",
      "The company said it provides store employees with a competitive average hourly wage and other benefits, such as 401(k) plans and \u201con-demand\u201d mental health support. It did not disclose its average hourly rate, but some online job postings show store employees can earn $16 per hour or higher.",
      "After the union filed the election petition, workers at the Philadelphia store were given free snacks, and the company repainted their break rooms, according to Young.",
      "Earlier this month, UFCW Local 1776 filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB against the company, accusing it of firing one worker in retaliation for union activities and alleging that supervisors told employees they would get paid more if they rejected the union bid. Whole Foods disputed the worker was fired in retaliation.",
      "The union has also accused Whole Foods of withholding region-wide wage increases from employees at the Philadelphia store because of the union activities.",
      "The company acknowledges it did not offer wage increases to workers at the store, even though it did so at a number of other stores as part of a quarterly review. Whole Foods maintains it would have been illegal to make wage adjustments in the lead-up to the union election, an argument Young disputed.",
      "The company said it was delaying the pay bumps until after the election to avoid the appearance of trying to influence the vote with raises.",
      "Seattle-based Amazon has resisted union organizing efforts by its workers. Amazon delivery drivers went on strike in a handful of U.S. cities before Christmas to exert pressure on the the company to recognize them as unionized employees or to meet demands for an inaugural labor contract.",
      "Workers at an Amazon warehouse in North Carolina are scheduled to vote next month on whether they want to be represented by an upstart union called Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment.",
      "The retail giant has challenged the structure of the National Labor Relations Board in court. Amazon accused the federal agency of tampering in the 2022 union election at the Staten Island warehouse, in part by bringing a lawsuit against the company to reinstate a fired organizer close to when voting began.",

      "'Very serious Crew'",
      "Jonathan Koziol, a retired Army chief warrant officer with more than 30 years of flight experience who now serves as Headquarters Department of the Army Aviation Directorate chief of staff, told reporters in a briefing Thursday afternoon that the Black Hawk crew was on a nighttime qualification flight with an instructor pilot evaluating an experienced pilot on the flight routes that their unit routinely flies day and night around the Potomac River.",
      "Koziol confirmed that the instructor pilot had more than 1,000 flight hours in a Black Hawk and that the pilot being evaluated had more than 500 hours in the aircraft.\u00a0The evaluated pilot was in command of the flight but if an emergency were to occur the instructor would have taken control of the helicopter, Koziol said.",
      "The maximum altitude for the route the Black Hawk was flying is 200 feet, Koziol said.",
      "\"Very serious crew, even the crew chief in the back has been in the unit for a very long time, very familiar with the area, very familiar with the routing structure,\" Koziol said.\u00a0\"So we don't see that at all as being any impact on what happened today or last night. And both pilots had flown this specific route before at night. This wasn't something new to either one of them.\"",
      "Koziol added, \u201cThese are our top pilots doing this mission in the National Capital Region.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 13:46:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Experts in the DEI field say anti-discrimination programs are intended to produce merit-based systems. President Donald Trump has implemented anti-DEI executive orders.",
    "story": [
      "Executive order slams diversity programs as \"immense public waste.\"",
      "Executive orders signed recently by President Donald Trump state that diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs prioritize diversity over merit in hiring, claiming DEI efforts are an \u201cimmense public waste and shameful discrimination.\"",
      "Some experts in the DEI field disagree, and several tell ABC News that diversity, equity and inclusion programs are aimed at creating a true merit-based system, where hiring, salaries, retention and promotions are decided without bias or discrimination toward employees.",
      "Before the anti-discrimination legislative movement of the 1960s -- including the Equal Pay Act of 1963, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 -- discrimination against certain groups was widespread, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "\"If you were from a dominant group -- generally white people, generally men, straight, cisgender, fully-abled -- you had a huge leg up in terms of getting employment recommendations, higher pay promotions,\" Erica Foldy, a professor at NYU\u2019s Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, told ABC News.",
      "She continued, \"So, Trump and his allies are harking back to this time that they say was more merit-based, but that's not at all how these organizations operated.\"",
      "DEI initiatives -- like implementing accessibility measures for people with disabilities, addressing gender pay inequity, diversifying recruitment outreach, or holding anti-discrimination trainings -- are intended to correct discriminatory organizational practices, experts say.",
      "DEI experts argue that diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives are \"on the path of creating more merit-based companies, more merit-based firms,\" Foldy said, aiming to ensure that qualified people of all backgrounds have an \"equal chance of being hired; you're going to be paid the same as employees at comparable levels.\"",
      "\"Business as usual, without attention to discrimination, is deeply, deeply inequitable,\" Foldy said.",
      "Amri Johnson, a DEI expert and author, told ABC News that the ideal of meritocracy operates under the assumption \"that opportunities are fair.\" Today, studies across industries continue to show that discrimination against a person's race, gender, disability, sexual orientation, military background, or other factors continues to permeate the job market.",
      "\"If organizations truly want the best talent, companies need to be intentional about how they source and engage with talent,\" said Johnson.",
      "Each year, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission plays a role in hundreds of legal cases concerning ongoing discrimination against protected classes in the workplace.",
      "The EEOC's 2023 performance report offers a long list of lawsuits it settled or won that year. One lawsuit noted blatant racist graffiti or comments made by fellow employees, paired with the discriminatory designation of hard physical labor solely for Black employees; others noted the failures of several employers to make reasonable accommodations for pregnant or disabled workers that led to the employee's termination or job offers rescinded.",
      "One study found that racial and ethnic discrimination in hiring continues to be a problem globally.",
      "\"Relative to white applicants, applicants of color from all backgrounds in the study had to submit about 50% more applications per callback on average,\" according to research from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that analyzed 90 studies involving 174,000 total fake job applications tweaked to include racial indicators but with otherwise similar professional credentials.",
      "\"Diversity doesn\u2019t go away because DEI goes away. It is an inevitable part of any human community (business or otherwise),\" said Johnson. \"Not learning how to deal with its tensions and complexity is leaving value on the table.\"",
      "Some DEI experts point to research from management consulting firm McKinsey & Company that found that companies with more diversity financially and socially outperform those that are less diverse.",
      "\"The most successful companies understand that DEI isn\u2019t just a '\"nice-to-have,'\" said Christie Smith, the former vice president for inclusion and diversity at Apple, in a written statement. \"It\u2019s a driver of innovation, talent attraction, and competitive advantage. The question is whether leaders will have the courage to stay the course and hold firm against political headwinds.\"",
      "On Thursday, Trump claimed, without citing evidence, that diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives for air traffic controllers at the Federal Aviation Administration were partly to blame for the tragic plane and helicopter collision in Washington on Wednesday night.",
      "The accusation comes after Trump signed sweeping orders aiming to terminate \"diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility\" programs in or sponsored by the federal government and its contractors.",
      "The White House argues that DEI programs \"deny, discredit, and undermine the traditional American values of hard work, excellence, and individual achievement in favor of an unlawful, corrosive, and pernicious identity-based spoils system.\"",
      "\"Americans deserve a government committed to serving every person with equal dignity and respect, and to expending precious taxpayer resources only on making America great,\" reads Trump's executive order.",
      "The order revokes several decades-old or years-old executive actions, including the 1965 Equal Employment Opportunity order prohibiting hiring discrimination by federal contractors and its amendments expanding professional development, data collection and retention opportunities.",
      "The order also explicitly revokes a 1994 order to develop environmental justice strategies that address disproportionately high health and environmental impacts faced by low-income or minority communities.",
      "Among the list of orders that are now revoked is a 2011 order requiring federal agencies to develop strategies \"to identify and remove barriers to equal employment opportunity.\"",
      "Those in favor of axing DEI programs argue that these initiatives could lead to lawsuits claiming discrimination following the Supreme Court's ruling on SFFA v. Harvard that disallows race to be taken into consideration in college applications.",
      "The National Center for Public Policy Research has been a strong advocate against DEI, submitting shareholder proposals to reverse the DEI policies at major companies like Costco, John Deere, and others. Ethan Peck, deputy director for the NCPPR\u2019s Free Enterprise Project, told ABC News that such companies should be \"colorblind.\"",
      "\"We're saying that companies have an obligation, a legal obligation, and an obligation to their shareholders, and an obligation to their employees to treat everybody the same, regardless of their race and sex, and we'd submit any proposal to keep that that way,\" Peck said.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 09:46:32 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump ally Kash Patel, the president's pick for FBI director, is likely to be questioned about his fitness to lead Thursday during his Senate confirmation hearing.",
    "story": [
      "The staunch Trump ally has derided the FBI as the \"Federal Bureau of Insanity.\"",
      "As Kash Patel, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the FBI, appears Thursday for his Senate confirmation hearing, some of the rhetoric he has espoused for years to defend Trump and promote Trump's reelection is sure to elicit sharp questions about whether he is fit to lead one of the nation's premiere law enforcement agencies.",
      "Patel has derided the FBI as the \"Federal Bureau of Insanity.\" He's announced \"a mission to annihilate the 'Deep State'\" -- what he calls a \"cabal of unelected tyrants\" inside government, undermining Trump. He's said the conspiracy theory QAnon, claiming a secret global plot to traffic children and take down Trump, is right in many ways and \"should get credit for all the things\" it has accomplished. And he once promised to \"come after\" and prosecute \"the conspirators not just in government, but in the media\" who \"helped Joe Biden rig the presidential election\" in 2020.",
      "On a podcast two years ago, Trump adviser Roger Stone told Patel his critics are right about one thing: \"You are a Trump loyalist.\"",
      "Patel chuckled and nodded affirmatively.",
      "But that's just what Democrats -- and even some Republicans -- on the Senate Judiciary Committee may wonder about most: If confirmed, is Patel so loyal to Trump that he would use the FBI to push Trump's political agenda and target Trump's perceived enemies?",
      "According to Patel, the FBI has already become a political weapon -- especially with its multiple investigations of Trump, including the unprecedented search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in 2022 -- and that's what he wants to change.",
      "\"The rot at the core of the FBI isn't just scandalous, it's an existential threat to our republican form of government,\" Patel wrote in his book, published two years ago, titled \"Government Gangsters.\"",
      "Trump, on social media, called Patel's book \"the roadmap to end the Deep State's reign\" when it came out.",
      "Many of Trump's allies in Congress have lauded Patel's nomination, touting him as the change agent needed at the top of an embattled agency. Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has called Patel's career \"a study in fighting for unpopular but righteous causes, exposing corruption, and putting America First.\"",
      "Democrats, however, not only point to what they see as Patel's concerning rhetoric -- but also what they've described as his relative lack of experience for such a significant position.",
      "After meeting with Patel last week, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said he has \"grave concerns\" about Patel's nomination, declaring, \"Mr. Patel has neither the experience, the temperament, nor the judgment to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\u201d",
      "Now in his mid-40s, Patel grew up on New York's Long Island, ultimately deciding to attend law school after caddying for a group of criminal defense attorneys at the Garden City County Club. By his own account, in 2005, he graduated from Pace University Law school in the bottom third of his class -- something he was \"very proud of,\" he once joked.",
      "After law school, he spent nine years as a public defender, and in late 2013 he moved to Washington, D.C., to join the Justice Department's National Security Division as a terrorism prosecutor, helping U.S. attorneys' offices around the country prosecute their cases.",
      "He was involved in Justice Department cases all over the world, including ones stemming from the 2012 attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi and the 2010 World Cup bombings in Uganda.",
      "But in his book and in media interviews, he said he grew frustrated with his time at the Justice Department, especially after a dust-up with a federal judge that made national headlines.",
      "In early 2016, while Patel was in Tajikistan for work, the judge presiding over one of his cases in Texas called for an in-person hearing back in the United States. Patel didn't have a suit or tie with him in Tajikistan, and after racing halfway around the world to make the hearing, the judge badgered him to \"dress like a lawyer\" and \"act like a lawyer,\" according to a transcript of the exchange.",
      "\"You don't add a bit of value, do you?\" the judge added.",
      "As Patel recounted in his book, his bosses at the Justice Department privately expressed support for him, but when the Washington Post wrote a story about it two weeks later, the Justice Department, in Patel's telling, refused to defend him publicly, so the newspaper \"dragged my name through the mud.\"",
      "Patel has also described how he grew upset over the Justice Department's handling of the Benghazi case following the 2012 attack by Islamic militants, believing that \"terrorists went free\" despite his disputed assertion that the Obama administration had enough evidence to charge even more people for the attack.",
      "\"I just got to my breaking point,\" Patel once recalled. So in 2017, he left the Justice Department to become a senior investigator on Capitol Hill, where he helped lead the House Republicans' probe of \"Russiagate\" -- which, as he describes it, exposed FBI wrongdoing in its 2016 investigation of alleged ties between Trump's presidential campaign and Russia.",
      "Patel's work on the Russia probe led to him joining the Trump administration in 2019, and in the final year of Trump's presidency he was appointed acting deputy director of national intelligence -- the second-in-command of the entire U.S. intelligence community -- and then chief of staff to the acting U.S. defense secretary, a position that critics claimed he was unqualified to hold even for just the 10 weeks he was there.",
      "After Trump's first administration ended, Patel regularly appeared on conservative media outlets, frequently praising Trump and criticizing the Justice Department for investigating and then prosecuting Trump for his alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving office and his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Patel has claimed -- despite the Justice Department's inspector general finding otherwise -- that the FBI played a part in pushing pro-Trump protesters to attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. And he has claimed in media interviews and court testimony that Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser and then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi deserve blame for the attack -- not Trump -- because, Patel insists, Trump days earlier had authorized up to 20,000 National Guard to secure the Capitol.",
      "The judge who listened to his court testimony in a case about Trump\u2019s eligibility to be on Colorado\u2019s ballot in the November election ruled that Patel \"was not a credible witness,\" saying his testimony was \"not only illogical\" but \"completely devoid of any evidence in the record.\"",
      "After Trump left office, Patel launched a tax-exempt charity, now known as the Kash Foundation, which made national headlines in 2023 with revelations that it provided thousands of dollars to at least two so-called \"FBI whistleblowers\" who helped House Republicans push disputed claims of corruption inside the Justice Department.",
      "Patel has said his charity helps fund defamation lawsuits, supports whistleblowers, buys meals for families in need over Christmas, supports Jan. 6 families, and more recently funds \"rescue operations\" out of Israel.",
      "But he has refused to offer specifics about who is benefiting from his charity, and, as ABC News previously reported, experts have questioned whether it was following the law. At the time, Patel declined to speak with ABC News about its reporting.",
      "After Trump announced his latest presidential campaign, Patel traveled the country to promote Trump's reelection, saying that Trump would fire \"thousands and thousands and thousands\" of government employees to root out the \"Deep State.\"",
      "Three weeks after Trump was reelected president, he named Patel as his pick to lead the FBI.",

    "title": "What does Donald Trump's anti-DEI executive order mean for private companies?",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 15:40:57 -0500",
    "summary": "What does President Donald Trump's executive order directing federal agencies to \"encourage\" private companies to abandon DEI policies mean for businesses?",
    "story": [
      "Trump directed federal agencies to \"encourage\" companies to abandon DEI actions.",
      "Amid a flurry of executive actions President Trump is taking to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives within the federal government, the Trump administration is also turning its attention to private companies and institutions.",
      "President Trump signed an executive order the day after he was sworn in to his second term that not only rescinded DEI policies in the federal government, but also \"[encourages] the private sector to end\" what the order calls \"illegal DEI discrimination and preferences,\" claiming in part that DEI policies \"violate the text and spirit of our longstanding Federal civil-rights laws.\"",
      "\"Hardworking Americans who deserve a shot at the American Dream should not be stigmatized, demeaned, or shut out of opportunities because of their race or sex,\" the order said.",
      "Several legal experts who advise companies and institutions regarding their DEI policies told ABC News that while the Trump administration doesn't have the legal authority to mandate that private businesses abandon their DEI policies, the executive order's language uses the threat of potential legal action against certain companies with DEI policies to ostensibly force them to do so.",
      "'It's a powerful threat'",
      "Part of Trump's Jan. 21 executive order directs the attorney general, \"within 120 days of this order, in consultation with the heads of relevant agencies and in coordination with the Director of [the Office of Management and Budget],\" the latter of which oversees the performance of all federal agencies, to \"submit a report \u2026 containing recommendations for enforcing Federal civil-rights laws and taking other appropriate measures to encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.\"",
      "The order instructs the federal agencies to \"identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of publicly traded corporations, large non-profit corporations or associations, foundations with assets of 500 million dollars or more, State and local bar and medical associations, and institutions of higher education with endowments over 1 billion dollars,\" as well as \"litigation that would be potentially appropriate for Federal lawsuits, intervention, or statements of interest.\"",
      "Those agencies are further directed to identify \"key sectors of concern\" and \"the most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners\" within each agency's jurisdiction, and to develop \"a plan of specific steps or measures to deter DEI programs or principles.\"",
      "The possibility of a legal battle with the federal government over DEI is already causing concern for many private businesses, experts told ABC News.",
      "\"It's a powerful threat that companies are responding to it by taking another very close look at their programs to make sure that they are comfortable with them,\" said labor attorney Jason Schwartz, a partner and co-chair of the Labor and Employment Practice at Gibson Dunn in Washington, D.C., and who leads the firm's DEI task force.",
      "\"Nobody wants to be on that Donald Trump DEI blacklist,\" Kenji Yoshino, a professor of constitutional law at NYU and the director of NYU's Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, and who also advises Fortune 500 companies on DEI matters, told ABC News. \"I worry that there's a very smart move and savvy move on the part of the executive branch to cast a fear through this kind of gesture of 'we are going to single you out,' or targeting so that a lot of companies are going to withdraw or pull back more than they needed to pull back, strictly legally.\"",
      "\"[Companies] just don't want to be one of those nine,\" Yoshino added, referring to the number of the executive order's \"potential civil compliance investigations.\"",
      "\"Until those nine are announced, it's going to cause others to be risk-averse,\" said Yoshino. \"So there's a kind of, you know, preemptive compliance, you know, or obedience going on.\"",
      "How companies are responding",
      "Schwartz told ABC News that since Trump signed his executive order, companies have been scrambling to seek legal counsel regarding their DEI policies and whether they need to be revised.",
      "\"The phone is literally ringing off the hook,\" he said, referring to the calls his firm is receiving. \"Companies are very concerned. They want to make sure, obviously, that they stay on the right side of the law.\"",
      "Yoshino said that the phones at NYU's Center for DEI likewise have been \"ringing off the hook\" with calls from companies seeking advice on how to proceed with their DEI initiatives. For now, he advises that concerned parties take a measured approach.",
      "\"The reflexive response is often to be like, 'Oh, if we shut it down, we will minimize risk,' and we regard that to be short sighted, both because there are smart ways to tweak these programs to lower the risk, or even lower to zero, eliminate the risk while still getting the same results,\" Yoshino told ABC News.",
      "\"And alternatively, if you eliminate all your DEI policies, you're then going to get sued from the other side,\" he cautioned, noting that marginalized groups could argue that rolling back DEI \"leads to a less inclusive, more discriminatory environment.\"",
      "Several large corporations \u2013 including Amazon, Meta, McDonalds, Walmart and Ford \u2013 announced before Trump was sworn in for his second term that they were ending, scaling back or otherwise reevaluating some of their DEI-related programs or initiatives.",
      "However, according to Yoshino, whose office has been tracking the impact of Trump's actions on DEI, even some companies who are stepping away from some DEI initiatives are retaining some policies or programs committed to inclusion, and that the majority of companies on the Fortune 500 list \"still have pro-DEI statements on their websites.\"",
      "Some companies also are publicly standing by their DEI commitments, with leaders at Goldman Sachs, Costco and JPMorgan Chase & Co recently speaking out in support of their diversity programs amid pressure from anti-DEI activist shareholders to roll back their policies.",
      "\"I do think that it's really important not to overreact,\" Yoshino told ABC News.",
      "What comes next?",
      "While it's unclear what might be \"litigation that would be potentially appropriate for Federal lawsuits, intervention, or statements of interest\" against private companies, as the executive order states, as well as what might be the outcome of any such actions, Yoshino and Schwartz both noted that anti-DEI litigation efforts in the U.S. have been escalating since the Supreme Court's June 2023 landmark ruling that effectively ended affirmative action in higher education.",
      "Since the Supreme Court decision, conservative legal advocacy groups have been ramping up litigation against private companies over their DEI initiatives, Schwartz said, noting that with Trump's executive order, those groups have now \"moved their operation into the White House.\"",
      "\"They now have the full force and power of the United States government where they can bring these cases,\" Schwartz added.",
      "Yoshino agreed, telling ABC News that the president is now putting the \"muscle of the executive branch behind the impact of that decision.\"",
      "Yoshino said that while the Supreme Court case addressed the higher education admissions process and was not about diversity and inclusion efforts in the private sector, \"it gave us such a clear window into how [the Supreme Court] was thinking about the issue of race discrimination.\"",
      "The Supreme Court ruled that \"in the same way that you can't discriminate against a person of color, you also can't discriminate against a white individual,\" according to Yoshino. \"That contrasts that with the previous jurisprudence that said you're allowed to use a [race] classification in narrow circumstances so long as your intent is to lift up a historically subordinated group.\"",
      "According to Schwartz, while the Trump administration is \"not creating new laws\" regarding the legality of DEI through his executive order, the Department of Justice is gearing up to bring cases against private companies by arguing that existing laws \"already prohibit many of the DEI programs that exist.\"",
      "Schwartz also pointed to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) as a federal agency that is likely to help advance the White House's anti-DEI efforts. The federal agency, which has the authority to investigate and prosecute cases of alleged employment discrimination, is now led by Trump appointee Andrea Lucas, who said in a statement upon being named EEOC acting chair Jan. 21 that her priorities are \"consistent with the President's Executive Orders,\" and include \"rooting out unlawful DEI-motivated race and sex discrimination.\"",
      "\"Our employment civil rights laws are a matter of individual rights. We must reject the twin lies of identity politics: that justice is measured by group outcomes and that civil rights exist solely to remedy harms against certain groups,\" Lucas' statement continued. \"I am committed to ensuring equal justice under the law and to focusing on equal opportunity, merit, and colorblind equality.\"",

    "summary": "A federal judge signaled he will issue a temporary restraining order barring the Trump administration from freezing federal loans and grants.",
    "story": [
      "The temporary restraining order has not yet been signed.",
      "A federal judge signaled he will issue a temporary restraining order barring the Trump administration from freezing federal loans and grants, raising concerns the White House will try to enact the same policy described in the now-rescinded memo from the Office of Management and Budget.",
      "District Judge John McConnell Jr. has not entered the temporary restraining order given the rapidly changing circumstances, but signaled he would sign an order proposed by the 22 state attorneys general who brought the case.",
      "McConnell had harsh words for the Trump administration and justified his future order -- despite the OMB's change of policy -- based on a social post by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.",
      "\"I think the breadth of the relief that plaintiffs are seeking is extraordinary,\" argued Department of Justice attorney Daniel Schwei before McConnell cut him off.",
      "\"Respectfully, so was the breadth of the OMB directive,\" McConnell said.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Donald Trump's administration sent a memo rescinding its sweeping directive that sought to pause potentially trillions in loans, grants and financial assistance, according to a memo obtained by ABC News.",
      "\"OMB memorandum M-25-13 is rescinded,\" the short memo from Matthew Vaeth, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, reads. \"If you have questions about implementing the President's Executive Orders, please contact your agency General Counsel.\"",
      "The new directive follows a tumultuous 48 hours for the White House, as states and local governments raised concerns that funding for health care, law enforcement, disaster aid and infrastructure spending could be paused or delayed during the expansive rollout of the policy.",
      "Leavitt defended the policy on social media, saying Trump still plans to implement a funding freeze without specifying what mechanism the president plans to use.",
      "\"This is NOT a rescission of the federal funding freeze,\" Leavitt posted on X. \"It is simply a rescission of the OMB memo. Why? To end any confusion created by the court's injunction. The President's EO's on federal funding remain in full force and effect and will be rigorously implemented.\"",
      "Amid the confusion, a federal judge on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., issued a stay of the policy through Monday as lawyers for the Department of Justice struggled to confirm the extent of the directive. The policy had been set to go into effect at 5 p.m. on Tuesday.",
      "\"Without this funding, Plaintiff States will be unable to provide certain essential benefits for residents, pay public employees, satisfy obligations, and carry on the important business of government,\" 22 state attorneys general had said in the lawsuit challenging the policy Tuesday.",
      "On Monday, the Office of Management and Budget ordered federal agencies to freeze any federal funding to activities that might be implicated by Trump's executive orders, causing states, local governments and nonprofits to scramble to determine if their funding would be cut off. Less than 24 hours after the policy was revealed, the White House attempted to clarify the policy in a memo, saying programs that provide direct benefits to Americans -- such as Social Security, Medicare and SNAP benefits -- would be excluded from the freeze.",
      "During the hearing Tuesday, the lawyer for the Department of Justice struggled to clarify exactly what would be affected.",
      "\"It seems like the federal government currently doesn't actually know the full scope of the programs that are going to be subject to the pause. Is that correct?\" U.S. District Judge Loren L. AliKhan asked.",
      "\"I can only speak for myself, which is just based on the limited time frame here, that I do not have a comprehensive list,\" DOJ lawyer Daniel Schwei said, adding, \"it just depends\" on the type of program and funding source.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump signed the Laken Riley Act on Wednesday as the president approves a series of initiatives meant to tackle his goal of curbing illegal immigration.",
    "story": [
      "The law allows the detention of migrants accused of crimes before conviction.",
      "Donald Trump signed the Laken Riley Act Wednesday afternoon as the president approves a series of initiatives meant to tackle his key goal of curbing illegal immigration.",
      "The bill, which symbolically is the first bill Trump signed in his second term, requires that federal authorities detain immigrants who lack legal status and are accused of crimes, including several misdemeanor offenses, with the potential for deportation -- even before they are convicted.",
      "\"Today's signing is bring us one step closer to eradicating the scourge of migrant crime in our communities once and for all,\" Trump said Wednesday.",
      "The Republican wish list item was passed with bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate and Trump campaigned heavily on curbing illegal immigration, using the death of Riley, a nursing student, as a centerpiece for immigration reform on the campaign trail.",
      "\"We will deport individuals based on the laws of this country. That's all this administration is trying to do enforce our nation's immigration laws,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on Wednesday.",
      "\"So if an individual is here illegally, if that means they cross our southern border illegally or they are overstaying their visa illegally or they've been deported before and returned to the U.S. illegally, which we found in many instances, they will be subject to deportation,\" she added.",
      "While the bill indicates that authorities should detain those who are both present in the U.S. illegally and have been charged with a crime, the White House has argued that if someone is present in the U.S. illegally, he or she has committed a crime with Leavitt saying Tuesday, \"And if you are an individual, a foreign national, who illegally enters the United States of America, you are, by definition, a criminal.\"",
      "Riley, the namesake of the bill, was killed by Jose Ibarra, an immigrant without legal status first arrested in September 2022 on charges of illegal entry, outside Atlanta in February 2024. Her death fueled the immigration debate ahead of the 2024 elections.",
      "\"With today's action, her name will also live forever in the laws of our country,\" Trump said before signing the bill. \"And this is a very important law. This is something that has brought Democrats and Republicans together. That's not easy to do.\"",
      "Ibarra had been living in the U.S. illegally and had been arrested on misdemeanor shoplifting charges but was allowed to stay in the U.S. while his immigration case was ongoing. He was found guilty in Riley's murder in late 2024 and is serving a life sentence without parole.",
      "\"This horrific atrocity should never have been allowed to happen,\" Trump added Wednesday. \"And as president, I'm fighting every single day to ensure that such a tragedy never happens again.\"",
      "After Trump spoke, Riley's mother, Allyson Phillips, thanked Trump for supporting the bill.",
      "\"Our family will forever be grateful for the prayers of the people across our nation and for helping to get this legislation into law,\" she said. \"[Trump] said he would secure our borders and that he would never forget about Laken, and he's a man of his word.\"",
      "Key in the legislation is that it will require that the Department of Homeland Security \"expeditiously take custody\" of immigrants without legal status who are charged with burglary, theft, larceny, shoplifting or assault of a law enforcement officer, but not convicted.",
      "Though several Democrats signed on to the legislation, many have argued the law is too extreme, with Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin saying the bill \"authorizes the largest expansion of mandatory detention seen in decades for anyone even suspected or accused of shoplifting.\"",
      "\"Not only is this incredibly cruel and inhumane, it is also contrary to our legal system's bedrock principle that all individuals are innocent until proven guilty, and thereby wholly un-American,\" she added in a statement, noting that the bill could lead Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers \"to prioritize indefinitely detaining people accused of petty shoplifting instead of going after suspected terrorists and violent offenders that pose a more urgent threat to the safety of our communities.\"",
      "The law also allows attorneys general to sue the federal government if they can show states are being harmed by a failure to implement immigration policies and allows states to sue DHS for harm caused to citizens allegedly due to illegal immigration.",
      "However, ICE has warned that enforcement of the bill will cost much more than the $3.2 billion initially expected -- and could reach $27 billion in its first year, according to a document obtained by ABC News.",
      "\"Full implementation would be impossible for ICE to execute within existing resources,\" the document noted, adding that ICE would need to expand its detention capacity to 151,500.",
      "And that estimate from ICE only includes the Laken Riley Act, not other initiatives that are part of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.",
      "\"We need Congress to provide full funding for the complete and total restoration of our sovereign borders, as well as financial support to remove record numbers of illegal aliens,\" Trump said.",
      "Trump also signed 10 executive orders targeted at curbing illegal immigration in his first week in office, and newly confirmed Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem joined an immigration enforcement operation in New York City that resulted in the apprehension of several migrants lacking legal status on Tuesday.",
      "\"One of my top priorities is achieving President Trump's mandate from the American people to secure our southern border and fix our broken immigration system,\" Noem said on Saturday following her confirmation. \"The Trump administration will once-again empower our brave men and women in law enforcement to do their jobs and remove criminal aliens and illegal gangs from our country.\"",
      "And Trump said Wednesday he would also sign an executive order to permit the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security to use Guantanamo Bay as a migrant facility.",
      "\"We have 30,000 beds in Guantanamo to detain the worst criminal illegal aliens threatening the American people,\" he said. \"Some of them are so bad we don't even trust the countries to hold them because we don't want them coming back. So we're going to send them out to Guantanamo. This will double our capacity immediately.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 21:30:10 -0500",
    "summary": "After the Trump administration offered two million government employees buyouts on Tuesday, DOGE head Elon Musk joked about the offer, leaving some employees dismayed.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has offered buyouts to two million federal employees.",
      "After the Trump administration offered two million federal employees buyouts on Tuesday, Elon Musk -- the world's richest man and the architect of Trump's effort to reduce the size of the government -- took to his own social media platform to boast and joke about the offer, leaving some federal employees who spoke to ABC News dismayed.",
      "By replying to an email sent out Tuesday, all full-time federal employees -- with the exception of military personnel and postal workers -- have the option to get eight months' salary if they agree to leave their jobs.",
      "\"The federal workforce should be comprised of employees who are reliable, loyal, trustworthy, and who strive for excellence in their daily work,\" the email sent to employees said, offering them what it called a \"deferred resignation\" from their positions.",
      "Commenting on X, Musk laughed at a specific aspect of the offer, writing, \"Hit 'Send,'\" accompanied by a screenshot of the letter to employees describing how to submit their resignation via email.",
      "Musk's attitude as he works to enact sweeping changes across the federal government -- potentially impacting hundreds of thousands of career employees who have spent their lives working behind the scenes -- is not lost on some workers, who told ABC News that the Trump administration and Musk's tone have been \"cruel\" and \"demoralizing.\"",
      "\"It feels like the new administration thinks we are dirt and do nothing for the country,\" said one 20-year federal employee who asked not to be identified out of fear of retribution. \"This is heartbreaking.\"",
      "According to a copy of the resignation letter posted by the Office of Personnel Management, federal employees have to acknowledge that the positions they vacate could be eliminated or consolidated, and their response to the buyout email may be used \"to assist in federal workforce reorganization efforts.\"",
      "While employees are not expected to work during their deferred resignation period, resigning workers need to commit to a \"smooth transition\" out of their roles.",
      "Bolstered by an executive order that would make it easier to fire career government employees, administration officials said they expect the reduction of the government workforce from the buyout and other executive actions to be \"significant.\"",
      "Unprecedented in its scope and nature, the buyout appears to be one part of Trump's sweeping approach to reducing the size of the government -- using an approach that mirrors tactics used by Musk in the past. When Musk took over Twitter in November 2022, he similarly sent a company-wide email that gave workers an ultimatum: work harder or leave with severance. Yesterday's email shared the same subject line -- \"A fork in the road\" -- that Musk used in his email.",
      "As federal employees were digesting the terms of the buyout Wednesday, it was unclear exactly who was eligible for it and whether there would really be severance payments, which could be delayed by litigation.",
      "Max Alonzo, national secretary-treasurer for the National Federation of Federal Employees, expressed skepticism about the terms of the resignations.",
      "\"Absolutely do not resign. There is nothing that says that the day that you resign, that they can't just let you go. They don't have to pay you -- there's nothing that says they have to pay you till September 30,\" he said. \"This is nothing that has been done before. This is not in our regulations. There's no regs about it. We're not even sure if it's actually legal. This is about trying to cut the federal workforce down, really kind of just breaking down these pillars of democracy.\"",
      "Foreign service officers within the State Department received the \"fork in the road\" email, but so far, State Department officials have been unable to provide their 16,000-person workforce a clear answer on whether they're eligible to take it, according to an official familiar with the matter. Even if staffers are deemed eligible for the buyouts, there's concern that -- if enough of them take the federal government up on its offer -- it will have an impact on national security because of the sudden, drastic downsizing.",
      "\"The implications could be really scary,\" said the official, who also asked not to be identified. \"This could really do some damage.\"",
      "The sweeping approach appears to be one of the first monumental steps to reshape the government by Musk, who supported Trump's election with $250 million in contributions and became one of Trump's closest advisers.",
      "When Trump first announced his plans to establish the \"Department of Government Efficiency\" in November, he framed it as an outside group that would advise the White House on how to make government more efficient. Two months later, when Trump actually established DOGE through an executive order, he took a different approach, giving Musk control of what used to be known as the United States Digital Service, a unit within the Executive Office of the President tasked with improving government websites.",
      "In an executive order signed the same day, Trump also tasked the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to work with DOGE and the Office of Personnel Management to \"submit a plan to reduce the size of the Federal Government's workforce through efficiency improvements and attrition.\"",
      "In addition to helming DOGE, Musk has extended his influence in the federal government by having his former employees and DOGE loyalists take on critical roles in other parts of government. Scott Kupor -- Trump's pick to lead the Office of Personnel Management. -- thanked the president for the \"opportunity to serve\" the country by helping Musk, and OMP's chief of staff Amanda Scales worked for Musk's AI company as recently as this month.",
      "To run the Office of Management and Budget, Trump tapped Project 2025 architect Russell Vought, who shares Musk's desire for historic spending cuts and workforce reductions. Vought was a central figure in Trump's attempt to categorize thousands of civil servants as political appointments, making it easier to fire employees without the protections given to civil servants. As one of his first acts in office, Trump signed an executive order to strip thousands of government workers of their employment protections.",
      "The new hirings and executive orders represent the first steps in Musk's plan for \"mass head-count reductions across the federal bureaucracy,\" as he wrote in the Wall Street Journal in November.",
      "\"DOGE intends to work with embedded appointees in agencies to identify the minimum number of employees required at an agency for it to perform its constitutionally permissible and statutorily mandated functions,\" wrote Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who recently departed DOGE to run for public office."

      "A federal judge sentenced a tearful Bob Menendez to 11 years in prison Wednesday after the former U.S. senator was convicted of abusing the power of his office in exchange for bribes in the form of gold bars, a luxury car and other items.",
      "\"You stood at the apex of our political system,\" Judge Sidney Stein said in issuing the sentence. \"Somewhere along the way, you lost your way.\"",
      "Menendez, 71, was found guilty on all 16 counts last year in his federal corruption trial, becoming the first sitting member of Congress to be convicted of acting as a foreign agent. His children, Alicia and Rob, were in court to witness the sentencing.",
      "\"The fact that he was a public office holder who held a position of great public trust has to be taken into account,\" Stein said as he explained how he calculated the sentence.",
      "Stein said Menendez \"became a corrupt politician\" as he ticked off the spoils of the corruption: the gold bars, the cash, the convertible.",
      "\"When there's wrongdoing of this magnitude there are serious consequences,\" Stein said.",
      "Ahead of the former senator's sentencing Wednesday afternoon, two New Jersey businessmen convicted of paying bribes to Menendez received lengthy prison sentences. Wael Hana was sentenced to eight years in prison and Fred Daibes to seven years.",
      "Menendez calls prosecution a 'witch hunt'",
      "Outside the court following his sentencing, a defiant Menendez called the prosecution a \"political witch hunt.\"",
      "\"Regardless of the judge's comments, today, I am innocent, and I look forward to filing appeals on a whole host of issues,\" Menendez said.",
      "Menendez referred to the Southern District of New York, which prosecuted the case, as the \"Wild West of political prosecutions\" while outlining grievances with the evidence and witnesses in the trial.",
      "\"President Trump is right -- this process is political and it's corrupted to the core,\" Menendez said. \"I hope President Trump cleans up the cesspool and restores the integrity to the system.\"",
      "Danielle Sassoon, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement that Wednesday's sentences were the result of \"an egregious abuse of power\" at the highest levels of the government's legislative branch.",
      "\"Robert Menendez was trusted to represent the United States and the State of New Jersey, but instead he used his position to help his co-conspirators and a foreign government, in exchange for bribes like cash, gold, and a luxury car,\" she said. \"The sentences imposed today send a clear message that attempts at any level of government to corrupt the nation\u2019s foreign policy and the rule of law will be met with just punishment.\u201d",
      "Menendez says he's a 'chastened man'",
      "Menendez sat at the defense table in a suit and tie with hands folded across his stomach before he stood at his seat to address the judge ahead of his sentencing.",
      "\"Your honor you have before you a chastened man,\" Menendez said as his voice began to break. \"We sat in this court room for nine weeks, but you really don't know me.\"",
      "The once-powerful Democrat introduced himself as the son of Cuban immigrants and explained his political biography, occasionally sniffling and choking up while reading from a prepared statement with hands stuffed in his pockets.",
      "\"This is who I truly am, judge. A man devoted to service,\" Menendez said, becoming emotional as he spoke of family and of constituents he helped. \"I have lost everything I have cared about. For someone who spent a life in public service, every day is a punishment.\"",
      "The judge said Menendez will not have to report to prison until June 6 so he can be available when his wife, Nadine, goes on trial on similar corruption and bribery charges on March 18.",
      "Menendez's lawyer adjusted the defense's request for leniency following the imposition of lengthy prison sentences for his co-defendants.",
      "Menendez previously sought a sentence of no more than two years in prison, citing his \"extraordinary public service,\" but earlier Wednesday the two New Jersey businessmen convicted of paying the bribes were sentenced perhaps more harshly than the defense anticipated.",
      "\"The good outweighs the bad in the arc of Bob's life,\" defense attorney Adam Fee told the judge. \"We would ask the court to sentence Bob to no more than eight years in prison.\"",
      "Prosecutor Paul Monteleoni had asked for 15 years in prison, arguing Menendez \"believed that the power he wielded belonged to him.\"",
      "\"The offense conduct reflects a truly grave breach of the trust placed in Menendez by his fellow senators, by the people of New Jersey,\" Monteleoni told the court. \"There are not many people who had power on the scale of Menendez.\"",
      "'Rare gravity' of the crimes",
      "Menendez had potentially faced decades in prison. Sentencing guidelines called for more than 24 to 30 years in prison, with the U.S. Probation Office recommending 12 years' imprisonment for Menendez, according to court filings.",
      "Federal prosecutors have said the Democrat deserves 15 years in prison for his \"naked greed\" and the \"rare gravity\" of the crimes.",
      "\"This case is the first ever in which a Senator has been convicted of a crime involving the abuse of a leadership position on a Senate committee,\" federal prosecutors wrote in a memo to the judge earlier this month. \"It is the first ever in which a Senator -- or any other person -- has been convicted of serving as a foreign agent while being a public official.\"",
      "Prosecutors asked the court to impose a substantial prison sentence \"to provide just punishment for this extraordinary abuse of power and betrayal of the public trust, and to deter others from ever engaging in similar conduct.\"",
      "Menendez's attorneys had sought leniency, urging the court to even consider whether a non-custodial sentence -- such as \"home detention and rigorous community service\" -- would suffice.",
      "\"Probation's recommended sentence of 12 years' imprisonment would be draconian -- likely a life and death sentence for someone of Bob's age and condition,\" his attorneys wrote in a memorandum to the judge earlier this month. \"Bob is deserving of mercy because of the penalties already imposed, his age, and the lack of a compelling need to impose a custodial sentence.\"",
      "The defense noted that Menendez is helping his wife battle cancer and argued he is no longer in a position to be a repeat offender, given that he was convicted of crimes that arose from his position as a U.S. senator.",
      "\"With this case, his political and professional careers have ended; his reputation is destroyed; and the latter years of his life are in shambles. He is certain never to commit future offenses,\" his attorneys wrote. \"And his current state -- stripped of office and living under a permanent shadow of disgrace and mockery -- are more than sufficient to reflect the seriousness of the offenses and to promote respect for the law.\"",
      "The former New Jersey senator, who resigned in the wake of his conviction, has maintained his innocence.",
      "\"I have never violated my oath,\" Menendez said outside the courthouse following the verdict in the nine-week trial. \"I have never been anything but a patriot of my country and for my country. I have never, ever been a foreign agent.\"",
      "Menendez twice unsuccessfully bid for a new trial ahead of his sentencing, most recently last week, with Stein finding the trial was fair while denying his request.",
      "Menendez had also tried unsuccessfully to postpone his sentencing until after his wife stands trial.",
      "Co-defendants get lengthy prison sentences",
      "Two New Jersey businessmen who were found guilty in the case were also sentenced on Wednesday. Hana was sentenced to eight years in prison and Daibes to seven years -- significantly more than what the defendants had sought and slightly less than what prosecutors recommended.",
      "Prosecutors said Menendez promised to use his power as a senator to help Hana, who is originally from Egypt, by preserving a halal meat monopoly granted to Hana by Egypt.",
      "Prosecutors said the former senator also promised Daibes that he would interfere with Daibes' federal prosecution and help the government of Qatar by supporting a Senate resolution praising the country.",
      "Daibes' fingerprints were found on the envelopes of cash found at Menendez's home and serial numbers on the gold bars traced them to Daibes and Hana, according to prosecutors.",
      "In issuing the sentences, Judge Stein called the evidence against Hana \"substantial\" and had strong words for Daibes.",
      "\"You are an American success story. You grew up in a refugee camp in Lebanon. But there is a dark side to what you have done,\" Stein said of Daibes. \"You bribed Sen. Menendez multiple times.\"",
      "Another New Jersey businessman, Jose Uribe, pleaded guilty in the case ahead of trial. Prosecutors said Uribe paid for Menendez's $60,000 Mercedes-Benz convertible in exchange for helping disrupt a criminal investigation by the New Jersey Attorney General's Office related to Uribe.",
      "He is scheduled to be sentenced in April."

    "summary": "ABC News just spent two nights with members of one of the largest cartels in Mexico as they explained their operations in a town just across the border from the US.",
    "story": [
      "We spent two nights with members of one of the largest cartels in Mexico.",
      "If the Mexican cartels are concerned about President Donald Trump's plans for them, it sure didn't seem like it this night.",
      "If only because someone who was worried probably wouldn't show a reporter the guns he'd just smuggled from the U.S. nor the fentanyl he was about to ship back north. Not to mention a safe house filled with migrants about to be crossed illegally at the border wall.",
      "And yet that's what we saw, spending two nights with members of one the largest cartels in Mexico the week of Trump's inauguration.",
      "They asked us not to share which cartel, but safe to say you've heard the name, as has Trump.",
      "The president formally declared Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organizations via executive order and threatened to use the U.S. military against the groups. Deploying the U.S. military to the border is also meant as a deterrence to cartel smuggling.",
      "The goal of our time with the group was to understand how the cartel is reacting to being squarely targeted by this new administration. The collective response was a shrug.",
      "\"We're not worried. This is day to day,\" one cartel member told us. \"This is what we're going to do.\"",
      "It's business as usual, they say, as they unloaded two rifles and three handguns from hidden compartments in an SUV that had just driven across the border from the U.S. To be clear, they passed through an official port of entry, right past border guards.",
      "Every single one of the guns this group traffics, they say, is bought in the U.S. and then shipped south.",
      "The Mexican Department of Foreign Relations officially estimates that somewhere between 70% and 90% of guns in Mexico originated from and passed through the U.S.",
      "\"Because we all know that in the U.S. it is easy to find them. They sell them in stores and here in Mexico you don't find that,\" a cartel member said. \"You have to keep a very, very careful record [here]. Not everyone [in Mexico] is approved for these types of weapons and not just anyone is sold or given a license. In the U.S., yes.\"",
      "Trump is seemingly not worried about American guns being smuggled south but he is very concerned about fentanyl flowing to the north.",
      "Shortly after the cartel unloaded the guns, they loaded five sandwich-sized packages of fentanyl into that same SUV, stashed in a hidden compartment beneath the center console.",
      "With a total of 10,000 pills, the street value is $50,000 or more, contributing to an untold number of potential overdose deaths. The ease with which they can be smuggled has fundamentally changed the drug game, in horrific ways.",
      "The CDC estimates that the fentanyl trade has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans and tonight, it showed no signs of stopping.",
      "By designating cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, many speculate that Trump is taking the first step toward deploying U.S. special forces in Mexico. However, the cartel members tell me special operators have been here for years.",
      "\"They've been here for a long time. They've been working directly, they've trained personnel here,\" a cartel smuggler said. \"The U.S. military has sent people here to Mexico for that.\"",
      "The SUV took off shortly thereafter. We were told by the group later it made it across the border without incident.",
      "One night later, in another part of this Mexican border town, we were invited into a non-descript house in an otherwise unremarkable neighborhood.",
      "Inside, we were greeted by a half dozen armed men and two Indian families, taking the last step of being smuggled into the US.",
      "This is the second-most lucrative part of this organized crime group's portfolio\u2014human smuggling.",
      "\"There is a lot of demand,\" said one masked smuggler.",
      "Business has been good and he thinks it will be getting better, thanks to some of Trump's immigration policies.",
      "Mass deportations could lead to more customers, he says. Deploying the military to the border means the group can raise their prices.",
      "\"They'll need our services more,\" he told us. The pitch to migrants is that they won't be able to cross without the group's help.",
      "The U.S. government and independent experts say that human smuggling by cartels significantly increased during the Biden administration. Hundreds of thousands of people were transported to the border, often enduring terrible conditions, while cartels made billions in profits.",
      "Trump has promised to take action against them. However, for smugglers, little has changed.",
      "\"The demand is still there,\" a smuggler told me. \"The deal is already done. We can't do anything. Whatever they change there, we have to keep sending people [into the US].\"",
      "They all did admit a renewed focus on their illicit activities will likely make them harder to do. But the idea that it can be totally stopped, they said, is a joke for a simple reason. Demand.",
      "As long as the U.S. continues to consume massive amounts of drugs, and as long as migrants are desperate to get within its borders, they believe their business will continue. Attacking these issues simply from the supply side by targeting cartels is not going to make them stop.",
      "Who knows if this is all macho bravado, trying to sound tough in front of a reporter with a camera.",
      "But for now, whatever its worth, the drugs keep flowing and so do smuggled migrants. Whether Trump can change that remains to be seen."

      "The tallest building in Havana is impossible to miss",
      "HAVANA -- It\u2019s impossible to miss. The huge rectangular mass of concrete and glass \u2014 the tallest building in Havana \u2014 dominates the city skyline, towering 150 meters (490 feet) above colonial homes with its 542 luxury rooms and majestic views of the city and the sea.",
      "The Selection La Habana hotel, managed by Spanish chain Iberostar, has yet to be inaugurated but it is already the target of criticism \u2014 and not only for its unusual shape. Cubans are questioning the government\u2019s allocation of millions of dollars towards luxury tourism while the island grapples with a severe economic crisis and tourism numbers plummet to historic lows.",
      "\u201cAll that money could have been spent to build hospitals and schools,\u201d lamented Susel Borges, a 26-year-old artisan, as she looked up to the towering edifice, known to locals as the \u201cK and 23 building\u201d because of its location.",
      "Located near the legendary Habana Libre hotel and the iconic Coppelia ice cream parlor, the new hotel is part of a government plan to build a dozen luxury establishments \u2014 mainly in Havana \u2014 that did not stop even during the COVID-19 pandemic and while existing luxury hotels remained largely unoccupied.",
      "For decades, tourism drove the Cuban economy, generating annual revenues of up to $3 billion. But in December, Cuban authorities said only 2.2 million tourists visited the island in 2024, a decrease of roughly 200,000 from 2023 and significantly lower than the 4.2 million tourists who visited in 2019.",
      "The government attributes the decline in tourism to a \u201cperfect storm\u201d of factors including supply shortages, a severe energy crisis causing massive blackouts and a lack of personnel, due to emigration and low wages. Furthermore, the island is grappling with a surge in U.S. sanctions, including restrictions on travel by U.S. citizens, a ban on cruise ships and other measures specifically designed to stifle the growth of Cuba\u2019s tourism industry.",
      "\u201cTourism is gone,\u201d said Julio Garc\u00eda Campos, driver of a shiny red 1951 Pontiac with an original engine. \u201cTourists used to line up to get on one of these!\u201d he said, recalling a bygone era when the island was bustling with American and European travelers following a removal of sanctions by then-President Barack Obama.",
      "The new Selection La Habana, like all other hotels in Cuba, is state-owned and operates under GAESA, a conglomerate belonging to the Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces that has often been criticized because of the opacity of its businesses. As a military-run operation, it is exempt from audits by the Comptroller General\u2019s Office and has not disclosed the amount it invested in the 40-story hotel.",
      "Cuban economist Pedro Monreal notes the \u201cincongruity\u201d of investing capital in the tourism sector when very little is being allocated to strategic areas such as agriculture.",
      "\"With food insecurity a concern, it\u2019s troubling that agricultural investment lags significantly behind tourism investment, remaining 11 times lower,\u201d Monreal noted last year on social media.",
      "Architects also expressed little enthusiasm for the new hotel, pointing at its disruptive appearance within the environment, its excessive height violating urban regulations and tall glass windows that are ill-suited for a tropical climate.",
      "\u201cThis building serves as a perfect example in our classes of what should not be done in terms of bioclimatic design,\u201d said Abel Tablada, an architect and university professor, adding it's \"unforgivable\" that the little money available to the Cuban state has been allocated to a building that does not add value to the city.",

      "A small Oregon city is facing a fresh lawsuit over its homeless camping rules",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- The small Oregon city at the heart of a major U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year that allowed cities across the country to enforce homeless camping bans is facing a fresh lawsuit over its camping rules as advocates find new ways to challenge them.",
      "Disability Rights Oregon sued Grants Pass on Thursday, accusing it of violating a state law requiring cities\u2019 camping regulations to be \u201cobjectively reasonable.\u201d",
      "The city did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Last June's Supreme Court ruling made the southern Oregon mountain town of 40,000 the unlikely face of the nation's homelessness crisis. It ushered in a new era of homeless policy by allowing cities from San Francisco to New York to ban sleeping outside and fine people for doing so, even when there aren't enough shelter beds.",
      "In Grants Pass \u2014 where officials have struggled for years to address a homelessness crisis that has divided residents \u2014 the decision paved the way for the new mayor and City Council members elected in November to crack down on camping upon taking office.",
      "The high court decision overturned a ruling from a California-based appeals court that found camping bans when shelter space is lacking amounted to cruel and unusual punishment under the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment. It enabled Grants Pass to enforce local ordinances barring camping on city property such as parks and sidewalks.",
      "Grants Pass has just one overnight shelter for adults \u2014 the Gospel Rescue Mission \u2014 and its rules requiring attendance at religious services and barring pets, alcohol, drugs and smoking mean many won\u2019t stay there.",
      "After the ruling was issued, the City Council designated two city-owned properties as the areas where the town's hundreds of homeless people would be allowed to stay.",
      "But last week, the new council closed the larger of the two campsites \u2014 which housed roughly 120 tents, the complaint says \u2014 and made the remaining smaller one only open from 5 p.m. to 7 a.m., forcing people to pack up their belongings every morning and carry them throughout the day with no place where they can legally set down their things.",
      "\u201cIt wants to make being homeless in Grants Pass so unpleasant that people go elsewhere,\u201d Disability Rights Oregon said of the city in its complaint. \u201cDespite the presence of numerous elderly, ill, and disabled people on site, the city increased its draconian restrictions in the dead of winter leaving hundreds of people with no legal option for their continued survival.\u201d",
      "Five homeless people with disabilities who live in Grants Pass are named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit. They include people who use wheelchairs and canes, as well as people suffering from the aftermath of a stroke or missing part of their limbs, according to the complaint.",
      "The complaint says the camping restrictions discriminate against people with disabilities and violate state law, which states that cities' rules regarding when, where and how homeless people can sleep or keep warm and dry outdoors must be \u201cobjectively reasonable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe City has discriminated against people with disabilities by imposing standards for participation in its camping program that require people to move themselves and their own belongings frequently and for no good purpose,\u201d the complaint says. \u201cPeople with physical disabilities affecting their movement or chronic illnesses that make frequent lifting, carrying, and walking distances difficult or impossible have been and will be cited and prosecuted for violating city ordinances regarding camping.\u201d",
      "Disability Rights Oregon is asking the court to block the city from enforcing its camping rules.",
      "Homelessness continues to be a nationwide crisis. Last year, it increased 18% in a dramatic rise driven mostly by a lack of affordable housing as well as devastating natural disasters and a surge of migrants in several parts of the country."

    "story": [
      "The FBI has recorded a sharp spike in complaints that its own agents and employees have engaged in sexual misconduct, ranging from assault to harassment, despite a pledge by the bureau\u2019s leaders to eliminate the longstanding problem",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The FBI has recorded a sharp spike in complaints that its own agents and employees have engaged in sexual misconduct, ranging from assault to harassment, despite a pledge by bureau leaders to eliminate the longstanding problem.",
      "An Associated Press investigation found the FBI has received nearly 300 allegations of sexual misconduct since the bureau announced in 2021 it had launched an agency-wide crackdown.",
      "The number marked a nearly 50% increase over complaints filed during the preceding four-year period, according to bureau statistics, an increase advocates and lawmakers described as a sign the bureau is struggling to protect women in a male-dominated workplace. The FBI, for its part, said the increase shows its reforms are making it easier to report misconduct.",
      "\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican, told the AP in a statement, adding he\u2019ll be using his role as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee \u201cto get answers and root out further FBI misconduct.\u201d He blamed former FBI Director Christopher Wray for allowing \u201cthe problem of sexual misconduct at the FBI to fester.\u201d",
      "The FBI told AP it takes allegations of sexual misconduct \u201cextremely seriously\u201d and acts upon them \u201cexpeditiously.\u201d Bureau officials have attributed the spike in complaints, in part, to their outreach efforts.",
      "\u201cWe have come a long way in addressing it in various ways using all the policy tools and legal means at our disposal,\u201d the FBI said in a statement, \u201cbut we absolutely have more to do in accomplishing a meaningful and long-lasting cultural evolution that honors FBI Director Wray\u2019s commitment to eradicating sexual misconduct throughout the organization.\u201d",
      "The FBI declined to provide details about the incidents, citing federal privacy laws and internal guidelines. A monthslong AP investigation, however, revealed that the incidents ranged from sexual assault to agents paying for sex at massage parlors. Other allegations concerned agents making inappropriate sexual comments at office functions or commenting on co-workers\u2019 appearances.",
      "Some allegations were so serious they resulted in criminal investigations or charges. Late last year, an FBI agent in Maryland, Eduardo Valdivia, 40, was charged with sexually assaulting two women he contacted through social media with a promise to give them free tattoos and modeling work. His defense attorney, Robert Bonsib, said Valdivia disputes \u201call allegations that he engaged in any criminal conduct and expects to be cleared of all charges.\u201d",
      "The victims usually were agency employees, though others were women whom agents came across during investigations or met socially. At least a dozen sexual misconduct allegations involved supervisors, the AP found, including at least one top agent.",
      "The FBI determined more than half of the claims warranted internal investigations, statistics show, though the bureau refused to disclose how many resulted in terminations or other discipline.",
      "The AP\u2019s findings come at a moment of significant upheaval in the FBI. Wray, a Republican appointed by then-President Donald Trump in 2017, spent years under withering attacks for various investigations involving Trump. Rather than be fired, Wray stepped down a day before Trump took office on Jan. 20.",
      "Trump has tapped Kash Patel, a strident supporter and former federal prosecutor, to take over as the next director of the FBI. Patel's spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment on how he would tackle the issue of sexual misconduct. His confirmation hearing is scheduled for Thursday.",
      "While Trump and Patel have focused almost exclusively on claims of political weaponization and biased probes in their promises to overhaul the bureau, some lawmakers see the FBI\u2019s record on sexual misconduct as another compelling reason to clean house.",
      "Last year, the Justice Department agreed to pay more than $22 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging female FBI recruits had been routinely harassed by instructors with sexually charged comments about their breast size, false allegations of infidelity and the need to take contraception \u201cto control their moods.\u201d",
      "In interviews, more than a dozen current and former FBI agents said that male-dominated culture would be the hardest to change. A former analyst who once aspired to become the bureau\u2019s first female director said she intentionally gained 30 pounds hoping a harasser would stop \u201ctalking about my body.\u201d",
      "She\u2019d give away clothing that became triggering because she\u2019d worn it when she was harassed. \u201cI would throw up in the office and have panic attacks in the stairway whenever I saw him,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI came very close to suicide twice.\u201d",
      "Victims, several of whom spoke on the condition they not be named, and advocates told AP that many women remain reluctant to come forward for fear of retaliation. They also lack confidence in the FBI\u2019s investigations and too often have seen agents, including high-ranking ones, receive what they consider to be mild discipline. Others retire before they can be punished.",
      "The FBI has spent the last decade seeking to address its masculine culture, in part by boosting its number of female agents. Nearly a quarter of the bureau\u2019s 13,700 agents are women, the bureau says, a number slightly higher than the percentage of women in senior agent ranks.",
      "The FBI said it has made a series of reforms to its processes, training and disciplinary reviews, including creating a 24/7 hotline to report abuse. Those changes were implemented after the AP exposed a pattern of senior FBI officials skirting discipline and retiring even after internal inquiries determined they committed brazen misconduct, including a senior official who harassed eight female subordinates.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether that approach will continue under the Trump administration, which has moved quickly to halt diversity, equity and inclusion efforts across the federal government.",
      "FBI misconduct investigations are shrouded in secrecy, and federal privacy laws obscure the public\u2019s view of which agents face discipline. The government typically will not reveal where an incident took place, even if the claims are substantiated. The AP relied on Freedom of Information Act requests and interviews with nearly two dozen current and former law enforcement officials to flesh out details about the allegations and the resulting investigations.",
      "For scores of allegations it did not investigate, the bureau said it \u201clacked sufficient detail to predicate an investigation\u201d or couldn\u2019t pinpoint a specific code of conduct violation. Other investigations resulted in suspensions, transfers or firings, FBI officials said.",
      "The FBI does not disclose how it disciplines specific agents or supervisors, but the AP reviewed internal records in a few cases that showed how some were punished.",
      "An unidentified supervisor, for example, was fired last year for suggesting his female colleagues had become managers by performing sex acts, the records show. And an FBI boss was suspended 60 days for \u201cunwelcome sexual conduct\u201d at a work event.",
      "In another case, the AP was not able to determine how a senior official was disciplined even after he admitted to wrongdoing. The official, an acting deputy assistant director, admitted he simulated anal sex on a colleague while acting out a graphic joke about predatory priests in the Roman Catholic Church, according to a 2023 report by the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general.",
      "\u201cThis is going to be bad,\u201d the agent told colleagues before closing an office door, according to the report. He then performed two wrestling holds on the mortified coworker before landing his punch line.",
      "The agent told investigators he only thrust his genitals once at the colleague and never touched him. He admitted it was inappropriate, the report says, telling investigators he \u201cshouldn\u2019t have told the joke in an office setting.\u201d",
      "Sexual misconduct investigations can be difficult to resolve, and the alleged behavior frequently happens behind closed doors.",
      "In some instances, investigators were not able to substantiate underlying allegations but nevertheless found agents violated related policies or acted unprofessionally. That was the case involving allegations that a supervisor raped an intoxicated woman in a Washington hotel room \u2014 an accusation he denied.",
      "The woman in that case reported to police that Shannon Fontenot met her at a bar when she was already heavily intoxicated and, even after noticing her wedding ring, invited her back to his room, where he opened his wallet and showed her his FBI identification, records show. Fontenot, an assistant special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Springfield, Illinois, field office, had been on assignment in Washington.",
      "Testifying in a civil proceeding in which she unsuccessfully sought a protective order against Fontenot, the woman described the night as \u201cevery woman\u2019s worst nightmare.\u201d She said Fontenot appeared to be a \u201csafe person\u201d and accept her limits, only to wait until she was drunk enough to take advantage of her. She said she had more than a half-dozen drinks and was so intoxicated she nearly walked into a wall.",
      "\u201cI think of FBI agents as our most elite law enforcement officers in the country,\u201d she testified in that civil case. \u201cTo use your position like that is horrifically scary, and it is a huge betrayal of not only my trust, but public trust. It\u2019s awful.\u201d",
      "The AP is not naming the woman because it does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual abuse.",
      "Fontenot testified the encounter was entirely consensual and that the woman did not appear intoxicated.",
      "Federal prosecutors decided not to charge him, saying they could not prove the woman\u2019s claim. The Justice Department\u2019s inspector general also did not substantiate the sexual assault allegations but determined he violated FBI rules in failing to disclose to his superiors that he was under police investigation, government records show.",
      "The FBI confirmed it suspended Fontenot for 10 days and later transferred him to a non-supervisory role at its Washington headquarters. It refused to say when he was transferred.",
      "\u201cThe incident in question was thoroughly investigated, and it was unequivocally determined that no form of sexual misconduct occurred,\u201d Fontenot\u2019s attorney, Mark Rollins, told AP.",
      "Another misconduct investigation involved the agency\u2019s then-No. 3 official who was accused by a subordinate of having \u201cengaged in sexual harassment,\u201d the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general reported.",
      "The employee reported a raft of comments and actions by Jeff Sallet that she described as violating the agency\u2019s sexual harassment policies, though investigators determined, in a lengthy report, that they were not sexual in nature.",
      "Among those the woman found most offensive: Sallet \u2014 who at the time oversaw the bureau\u2019s human resources branch \u2014 allegedly suggested her mother was disappointed she wasn\u2019t \u201cbarefoot and pregnant,\u201d according to the report. In another instance he invited her to join his friend's \u201charem.\u201d",
      "In the moment insurrectionists bore down on the U.S. Capitol, the woman alleged, Sallet looked down from his FBI office window onto Pennsylvania Avenue and asked her, \u201cHow many of those guys are you thinking you\u2019d like to date. That isn\u2019t your type is it?\u201d",
      "The woman also complained Sallet sexually harassed her in part by suggesting they conduct a conference call together in his hotel room on a work trip. \u201cI felt that Sallet was pressuring me to be alone with him in a hotel room,\u201d she wrote in a declaration for an unrelated court case by a former FBI agent seeking disciplinary records related to Sallet. She added that \"we did not need to be physically together for the meeting and none of our co-workers were at the hotel.\u201d",
      "Sallet told the inspector general he did not recall where the call took place but that it would not have been \u201cstrange or odd\u201d to have such a call in his hotel room.",
      "Investigators concluded Sallet \u201cviolated the Department\u2019s zero tolerance policy on harassment by making five inappropriate comments to the subordinate employee,\u201d the inspector general said. \u201cNone of the allegations involved unwelcome touching, and the independent investigation did not find that any of the substantiated conduct was sexual in nature.\u201d",
      "The report added that Sallet was also found to have acted \u201cunprofessionally\u201d in accordance with FBI policies.",
      "Sallet retired in 2021 before the investigation was completed. He has denied the allegations and his attorney, Doug Brooks, noted he was \u201ccleared of all allegations of sexual harassment.\u201d",
      "\u201cJeff Sallet had an honorable and distinguished career at the FBI,\u201d Brooks wrote in an email, adding he had provided his \u201cfull cooperation\u201d to the inspector general investigation. \u201cIt is important to highlight that there were never any allegations of unwelcome (or any) touching made against Mr. Sallet.\u201d",
      "Advocates expressed frustration at the lack of transparency in such cases and blasted the FBI for meting out relatively light punishment to those it has found to have engaged in sexual misconduct.",
      "\u201cWhen high-ranking officials in particular face no meaningful consequences for abusive conduct, it sends the message that anyone is free to act with impunity,\u201d said Stacey Young, co-founder of the DOJ Gender Equality Network, an employee advocacy group that persuaded the Justice Department to adopt a new department-wide sexual misconduct policy.",
      "Other advocates and female agents applauded the bureau for taking steps to address sexual misconduct. But they said it needed to go further to assure victims that their claims were being taken seriously.",
      "Martha Johnson, a recently retired FBI agent who says she was sexually assaulted by an agent many years ago while working in Chicago, said the bureau\u2019s internal processes for reporting sexual abuse have long been set up to doubt and punish victims.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re patting themselves on the back, but the environment is still the same in that women are too afraid to even use a hotline,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this scenario play out over and over for 20 years. They didn\u2019t change anything.\u201d",
      "___ Associated Press writers Eric Tucker and Joshua Goodman in Washington contributed to this report."

      "Tulsi Gabbard, President Donald Trump's pick to be director of national intelligence, is set to go before lawmakers Thursday for a confirmation hearing likely to focus on some of her past views on Russia and Syria",
      "WASHINGTON -- Tulsi Gabbard, President Donald Trump's pick to be director of national intelligence, is expected to face tough questions from lawmakers Thursday over past comments about Russia and a 2017 visit with Syria's now-deposed leader.",
      "The back-and-forth during Gabbard's confirmation hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee could reveal whether she has successfully assuaged concerns from lawmakers of both parties \u2014 or whether worries about her experience and background will sink her nomination to oversee 18 U.S. intelligence agencies.",
      "Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, is a lieutenant colonel in the National Guard who deployed twice to the Middle East and ran for president in 2020. She has no formal intelligence experience, however, and has never run a government agency or department.",
      "It's Gabbard's comments, however, that have posed the biggest challenge to her confirmation. Gabbard has repeatedly echoed Russian propaganda used to justify the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine and criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a corrupt autocrat.",
      "She's been accused of spreading Russian disinformation by Republican lawmakers and has even won praise in Russian state-controlled media.",
      "A 2017 visit with Syrian President Bashar Assad is another point of contention. Assad was recently deposed as his country's leader following a brutal civil war in which he was accused of using chemical weapons. Following her visit, Gabbard faced criticism that she was legitimizing a dictator and then more questions when she said she was skeptical that Assad had used chemical weapons.",
      "As a lawmaker, Gabbard sponsored legislation that would have repealed a key surveillance program known as Section 702, which allows authorities to collect the communications of suspected terrorists overseas.",
      "Gabbard said the program could be violating the rights of Americans whose communications are swept up inadvertently, but national security officials say the program has saved lives.",
      "She now says she supports the program, noting new safeguards designed to protect Americans' privacy.",
      "While lawmakers from both parties have raised concerns about Gabbard's nomination, Republicans have increasingly come to support her. Given thin Republican margins in the Senate, she will need almost all GOP senators to vote yes in order to win confirmation.",
      "Sen. Tom Cotton, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that while he understands there are questions about Gabbard's past views, questions about her loyalty to the U.S. are inappropriate.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s passed five different background checks. I reviewed the latest one. It\u2019s clean as a whistle,\u201d the Arkansas Republican said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s fine for people to have policy differences and ask questions about those differences.

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Kash Patel, President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the FBI, will encounter deeply skeptical questioning from Democratic senators Thursday about his loyalty to the president and stated desire to overhaul the bureau as he faces a high-stakes hearing that will help determine his path toward confirmation.",
      "Patel, a Trump loyalist who has railed against the FBI over its investigations into the president and claimed that Jan. 6 rioters were mistreated by the Justice Department, was picked in November to replace Christopher Wray, who led the nation's premier federal law enforcement agency for more than seven years.",
      "A former aide to the House Intelligence Committee and an ex-federal prosecutor who served in Trump's first administration, Patel has alarmed critics with rhetoric \u2014 in dozens of podcasts and books he has authored \u2014 in which he has demonstrated fealty to Trump, lambasted the decision-making of the agency he's now been asked to lead and identified by name officials he believes should be investigated.",
      "In one such podcast interview last year, he said that if he were in charge of the FBI, he would \u201cshut down\u201d the bureau\u2019s headquarters building on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., and \u201creopen it the next day as a museum of the \u2018deep state.\u2019\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Utah leaders, locals and longtime attendees of the Sundance Film Festival are making their final push to keep the world-renowned independent film festival in the state as its directors consider uprooting it",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- With the 2025 Sundance Film Festival underway, Utah leaders, locals and longtime attendees are making a final push \u2014 that could include paying millions of dollars \u2014 to keep the world-renowned film festival as its directors consider uprooting.",
      "Thousands of festivalgoers affixed bright yellow stickers to their winter coats that read \u201cKeep Sundance in Utah\" in a last-ditch effort to convince festival leadership and state officials to keep it in Park City, its home of 41 years.",
      "Gov. Spencer Cox said previously that Utah would not throw as much money at the festival as other states hoping to lure it away. Now his office is urging the Legislature to carve out $3 million for Sundance in the state budget, weeks before the independent film festival is expected to pick a home for the next decade.",
      "It could retain a small presence in picturesque Park City and center itself in nearby Salt Lake City, or move to another finalist \u2014 Cincinnati, Ohio, or Boulder, Colorado \u2014 beginning in 2027.",
      "\u201cSundance is Utah, and Utah is Sundance. You can\u2019t really separate those two,\" Cox said. \u201cThis is your home, and we desperately hope it will be your home forever.\"",
      "Festival Director Eugene Hernandez told reporters last week that they had not made a final decision. An announcement is expected this year by early spring.",
      "Colorado is trying to further sweeten its offer. The state is considering legislation giving up to $34 million in tax incentives to film festivals like Sundance through 2036 \u2014 on top of the $1.5 million in funds already approved to lure the Utah festival to its neighboring state.",
      "Cincinnati approved a resolution allocating $2.5 million to Sundance if festival leaders relocate to southwest Ohio. Yet money may not be the ultimate draw.",
      "Sundance leaders say the festival has outgrown the ski town it helped put on the map decades ago, and they worry it has developed an air of exclusivity that takes the focus away from the films. An ideal home would make Sundance more centralized, affordable and accessible to all who appreciate independent film.",
      "Some festivalgoers and industry leaders worry Sundance would lose its identity outside its idyllic mountain hometown.",
      "Roger and Carin Ehrenberg, major donors to the festival, said they would stop attending regularly if the festival was outside Utah. Sundance is a \u201cmagical experience\u201d for the New York City philanthropists, they said, due in large part to the atmosphere in Park City.",
      "\u201cIf it goes to Cincinnati, maybe once in a blue moon we would go, but it wouldn't be a regular thing,\" Carin Ehrenberg said. \u201cFor us, it\u2019ll lose its appeal.\u201d",
      "The couple said they would likely continue to donate even if they did not attend.",
      "Nineteen years of fond memories at Sundance helped inspire Dr. Rhonda Taubin to relocate her family from Atlanta to Heber City \u2014 Park City's neighboring town. She has no ties to the film industry but has become a fervent advocate for keeping the festival in her new home state.",
      "This year, she and her friends distributed thousands of \u201cKeep Sundance in Utah\u201d stickers \u2014 and another that read \u201cNOhio for Sundance\u201d \u2014 to show the festival how much it means to the local community.",
      "\u201cI really am not a movie buff, but my other girlfriends are, and being able to share all that we've been through as women, as mothers, as wives, as daughters, I don't want it to end,\u201d Taubin said. \u201cWe watch provocative movies that make us talk and think about things that maybe we've never thought about before. Utah would be at a huge loss without those conversations.\u201d",
      "If Sundance stays in Utah, the festival\u2019s former director John Cooper said major adjustments are needed to improve transportation between Salt Lake City and Park City and make lodging for filmmakers more affordable.",
      "Cooper, who led the festival from 2009 to 2020, said he would be sad to see Sundance shift away from actor and filmmaker Robert Redford's original vision. Its very name comes from Redford's character in the 1969 film \u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt like my role was to be a keeper of the flame for Robert Redford and his legacy,\" Cooper told The Associated Press. \u201cThe mountains of Utah, this was his vision. It\u2019s weird to say \u2018Sundance in Ohio.\u2019 But I think it could go anywhere. What it does for a community is so strong.\u201d",
      "On the red carpet this week, many were split on whether Sundance should stay or go.",
      "Actor Elijah Wood urged the festival to remain in Park City, saying the location is part of its DNA.",
      "Others were open to it relocating. Actor Tessa Thompson, who serves on the Sundance Institute's board of trustees, said the festival could maintain its identity in a new city.",
      "\u201cI think that Sundance has more to do with the spirit and community, and I think that's evergreen,\" Thompson said. \"Regardless of where Sundance is, Sundance will always be.\u201d"

    "summary": "A civil jury has ruled that Louisiana parish officials who threatened to arrest and imprison an environmental activist while she attempted to speak during a public meeting did not violate the First Amendment",
    "story": [
      "A civil jury has ruled that Louisiana parish officials who threatened to arrest and imprison an environmental activist while she attempted to speak during a public meeting did not violate the First Amendment",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Louisiana parish officials who threatened to arrest and imprison an environmental activist as she attempted to speak during a public meeting did not violate her right to freedom of speech, a unanimous civil jury ruled Wednesday.",
      "Joy Banner had sought more than $2 million in damages from two St. John the Baptist parish officials \u2014 Parish President Jaclyn Hotard and councilmember Michael Wright \u2014 who she said blocked her from raising allegations of corruption tied to industrial development at a public meeting. While Banner's attorneys said the case had important implications for protecting outspoken citizens from government censorship, lawyers representing the parish said they were model officials trying to curtail disruption and keep the meeting on track.",
      "The case is part of a broader series of disputes playing out in courts and public hearings between grassroots community groups and Louisiana officials over industrial expansion in the 85-mile (136-kilometer) chemical corridor between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, often referred to by environmental activists as \u201cCancer Alley\" because of its high pollution levels.",
      "Banner, co-founder of the environmental and racial justice organization The Descendants Project, gained a national reputation fighting against an $800 million grain terminal slated for her predominantly Black community in St. John the Baptist parish. The project was later aborted.",
      "In a November 2023 parish council meeting, Banner sought to oppose an agenda item introduced by Hotard to use taxpayer funds for a lawyer to defend parish officials from ethics complaints. The state ethics board had launched an investigation after Banner filed a complaint pointing out that Hotard\u2019s mother-in-law, Darla Gaudet, owned a marine transport company that owned land near the proposed site for the grain terminal.",
      "As Banner began to discuss these concerns during the public comment period, councilmember Michael Wright repeatedly banged his gavel and both he and Hotard told Banner she was not speaking on topic as she made her remarks.",
      "Wright then quoted from an obsolete law under which anyone who publicly shared testimony given to a state ethics board investigation could be subject to one year of imprisonment. A federal judge deemed the law unconstitutional years ago.",
      "\u201cWhen I heard the words imprisonment and misdemeanor, I thought, 'That's it, I'm going to jail, I've messed everything up, my business is going to be ruined, my name is going to be ruined.' I was terrified and shocked,\" Banner later testified.",
      "Ike Spears, the parish officials' attorney, noted that they had also interrupted and instructed to stay on topic other members of the public who spoke during the public comment period. He described Banner as a \u201cdisruptive citizen\u201d striving to become a \u201csocial media influencer\u201d and garner media attention from the litigation.",
      "\u201cShe wants us to reward this conduct with $2 million plus,\u201d Spears told jurors.",
      "Banner's attorney William Most countered that her intended comments at the public meeting were \u201cvital\u201d to informing the parish about Hotard's potential conflicts of interest.",
      "\u201cJoy Banner was treated differently than anyone else: She was the only person threatened with arrest and she was also the only one to raise the issue of Hotard's family business interests,\u201d Most said. \u201cShe was directly on topic.\"",
      "Hotard also used vitriolic language to describe Banner, including fantasizing about strangling her, in text messages to her mother-in-law that were introduced as evidence. Most said the messages indicated that Hotard had a personal motivation to shut down Banner's participation in a public meeting.",
      "The state ethics board ruled last year that Hotard had not violated state ethics laws.",
      "Yet Hotard's mother-in-law later revealed during a deposition for Banner's lawsuit that Hotard's husband is a beneficiary of a trust that owned land overlapping with the planned railroad route leading into the proposed grain terminal.",
      "Spears acknowledged that Hotard would \u201cprobably\u201d personally benefit from the grain terminal's approval. But he said increased tax revenue and good-paying jobs were the parish president's driving motivation in supporting the project.",
      "Hotard, who was not present for the verdict, did not respond to an emailed request for comment.",
      "The jury sent a \u201cstrong message against frivolous lawsuits,\u201d Wright said in an emailed statement to The Associated Press. \u201cThis is a significant victory for St. John Parish and a promising sign for businesses and industries considering the River Parishes as their home.\u201d",
      "Juror Cam Owen said he was ready to vote in Banner's favor following closing arguments. He changed his mind \u2014 and came to tears during deliberations \u2014 after closely reviewing the facts and video footage of the public meeting, which he described as the \u201cdeciding factor\" for the jury. Owen said jurors calculated the amount of time Banner was able to speak and concluded she was able to express most of her viewpoint.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, you know, they did try to stop her, but she did actually say what she had to say,\u201d Owen said.",
      "The jury also ruled that the parish had not violated Louisiana's open meetings law.",
      "Banner said she had no regrets about bringing the lawsuit and said it uncovered the parish president's hidden financial interests.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of this case was for transparency,\u201d Banner said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to hold people accountable for the things that we feel are wrong.\u201d",
      "\u201cI hope you can heal,\u201d Eastern District of Louisiana Judge Nannette Jolivette Brown told Banner and the parish officials after the verdict. \u201cThis is only one part of the process.\u201d",

      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- The wife of a 72-year-old veteran who was beaten to death by a cellmate in an Alabama jail filed a civil rights lawsuit Wednesday against three deputies working at the jail, alleging that the officers ignored his pleas for help.",
      "Attorneys for the wife of John Reed say the deputies working at the Macon County jail that morning in October were made aware of the assault but ignored his cries and need for medical attention. Reed required a wheelchair and 24-hour oxygen for a lung disease.",
      "The three deputies named as defendants entered the holding cell where Reed was injured and neglected to separate him from the cellmate during the attack, according to the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the worst cases of prison neglect that I\u2019ve seen,\u201d said civil rights attorney Bakari Sellers, who is representing Reed's wife, Regene Brantley-Reed.",
      "Court records did not list attorneys representing the three deputies on Wednesday. The Macon County sheriff did not respond to a phone call seeking comment.",
      "Reed's cellmate, Daniel Pollard, 24, has been charged with murder in Reed\u2019s death. His attorney, Jennifer Tompkins, said he has severe mental health issues.",
      "\u201cIn 17 years of criminal law, this is probably one of the worst cases I\u2019ve ever had in the sense of mental health,\u201d Tompkins said.",
      "Pollard pleaded guilty to attempted murder and burglary in 2022 and was sentenced to a 20-year split sentence, with five to be served in jail or prison, according to his arrest records. He was released on probation in May 2024, according to a spokesperson from the Alabama Department of Corrections.",
      "For Brantley-Reed\u2019s Montgomery-based attorney Chuck James, questions remain about why Reed, who had been arrested for alleged drunken driving, was being held with Pollard in the first place.",
      "\u201cThese deputies had multiple opportunities to do the right thing and, if they had, John Reed would be alive today,\u201d James said.",
      "The Macon County sheriff's department did not respond to requests for comment about why Pollard, who was arrested for a misdemeanor, was being held in the county jail.",
      "Tompkins said the problem goes beyond the Macon County jail.",
      "\u201cThe mental health system in Alabama is so broken that we\u2019re not getting the mental health treatment quick enough to prevent crime,\u201d Tompkins said. \u201cWe\u2019re creating a bad environment for not only other inmates but for the jailers too.\u201d",
      "Brantley-Reed said she was waiting outside the jail with less than $300 to bail her husband out while the beating was happening. She didn\u2019t know anything was wrong until she saw first responders arrive at the jail, she said. She was told by an administrator her husband was dead shortly after.",
      "Reed's beating was so severe that his wife had to bring photographs of him to the funeral director so that he could reconstruct his face for the funeral.",
      "Brantley-Reed said there wasn\u2019t a day in their 16-year relationship when her husband didn\u2019t make her laugh. Now, his 95-year-old mother has dementia and cries every day when she asks for her son \u2014 only to be reminded that he is dead.",
      "\u201cIt was just so unexpected and so crazy how it happened that sometimes I can't even get a grip on it,\u201d Brantley-Reed said.",

      "Authorities have planned a news conference for Thursday to discuss the case of Sharon Kinne, who was charged before her 25th birthday with killing her Missouri husband, her boyfriend\u2019s wife and a man she\u2019d picked up in a Mexican bar.",
      "Her whereabouts have been a mystery since she reportedly snuck out of the prison in Ixtacalapan on Dec. 7, 1969. And her story has been featured in the book, \u201cI\u2019m Just an Ordinary Girl: The Sharon Kinne Story\u201d as well as in podcasts and TV stories such as Discovery I.D.\u2019s \u201cDeadly Women.\u201d",
      "An FBI spokeswoman directed questions to the Jackson County sheriff's office in Missouri, which said it couldn't confirm any information before the news conference, including whether she had died. But a news release promised answers.",
      "\u201cWe hope that by bringing closure to this case, we can provide a sense of resolution not only to the friends and families of the innocent victims she murdered but also to those who were affected by her actions, including her loved ones,\u201d the sheriff's department said in announcing the news conference.",
      "Kinne, who married at 16, was living in a ranch home in the Independence, Missouri, area in March 1960 when her 25-year-old husband, James Kinne, was shot in the back of the head while napping. Independence is just outside of Kansas City.",
      "The mother of two told police she had heard her 2-year-old daughter ask, \u201cHow does this thing work, Daddy?\u201d Then there was a gunshot. Sharon Kinne said she ran into the bedroom and found the toddler holding her husband\u2019s .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol. The death was ruled accidental.",

      "On June 1, 1960, Sharon Kinne was charged with Patricia Jones\u2019 murder. Police took another look at James Kinne\u2019s death and a Jackson County grand jury indicted Kinne for that crime as well.",
      "In June 1961, Sharon Kinne was tried in the death of Patricia Jones. And an all-male jury acquitted her to courtroom applause.",
      "In January 1962, Sharon Kinne was convicted of killing her husband. But, the Missouri Supreme Court later overturned the conviction because of improper jury selection. She was tried again, but jurors couldn't agree on a verdict.",
      "Sharon Kinne then headed to Mexico City. One evening, she picked up a man in a bar and went with him to a hotel. Around 3 a.m., gunshots were heard and Francisco Ordonez lay dead on the floor. Kinne got 13 years for killing Ordonez.",
      "Ballistics tests proved prosecutors\u2019 hunch that a gun found in Sharon Kinne\u2019s Mexican motel was the one that killed Patricia Jones.",
      "Sharon Kinne couldn\u2019t be tried again for that crime, so prosecutors closed the case.",
      "Before her apparent escape, she gave several interviews, and was known in Mexico as \u201cLa Pistolera,\" which translates as \u201cThe Gunslinger.\u201d",

      "Ten members or associates of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua have been indicted on charges of running a gun trafficking operation in New York City that stretched across the country",
      "Ten members or associates of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua have been indicted on charges of running a gun trafficking scheme in New York City that stretched across the country and aspired to spread internationally, officials said Wednesday.",
      "The indictments, announced by Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz, came after a more than 8-month undercover operation by the district attorney's office, New York City police and other law enforcement agencies. Six of the people charged in the 120-count indictment unsealed Wednesday were taken into custody Tuesday on firearm, drug and conspiracy charges.",
      "The Tren de Aragua gang has been linked to a series of kidnappings, extortion and other crimes throughout the Western Hemisphere tied to a mass exodus of migrants from Venezuela, where the gang originated more than a decade ago. Public awareness of Tren de Aragua in the U.S. climbed after footage from a security camera surfaced on social media showing a group of heavily armed men forcing their way into an apartment in the Denver suburb of Aurora. President Donald Trump said during his campaign that he planned to \u201c liberate Aurora \u201d from Venezuelans he falsely said were \u201ctaking over the whole town.\u201d",
      "Members of the violent street gang have been blamed for sex trafficking, drug smuggling and police shootings across the U.S., as well as the exploitation of migrants.",
      "Of those arrested in the Queens indictment, two were taken into custody in Texas and Florida. Four suspects were taken into custody in New York in an operation that left a city police officer with a severely fractured arm after a defendant slammed it with a door while trying to escape, officials said.",
      "Two of those suspects had been arraigned as of Wednesday afternoon.",
      "Katz said charges had not yet been filed in the ongoing investigation into the assault on the officer. She praised those involved in the undercover operation for seizing guns and drugs.",
      "\u201cAs a result of our investigation, 34 dangerous weapons are now off the streets, and we are dismantling this gang as it attempts to establish itself locally.\u201d Katz said, adding that two of those guns were ghost guns \u2014 firearms without serial numbers that are difficult to trace \u2014 one an AR-style rifle and the other a firearm modified to fire continuously like an automatic weapon.",
      "Two other suspects named in the indictment, including alleged ringleader 24-year-old Enyerbert Blanco, were already in custody on other charges, officials said. Two others remain at large.",
      "Authorities detailed in the indictment how the group used the telephone app WhatsApp to communicate about the gun sales, some of which happened in broad daylight in parking lots or by hiding weapons in trash bags.",
      "Authorities allege three of the indicted suspects, including Blanco, obtained the weapons from other states, including some guns that had been reported stolen. Another suspect provided weapons from his own inventory of firearms. Many of the other suspects acted as couriers to deliver the guns.",
      "The indictment alleges that the criminal enterprise also attempted to deliver weapons internationally to Colombia, hoping to increase their profits. Those attempts were thwarted by the undercover operation, authorities said.",
      "Undercover officers bought some of the weapons as part of the operation, according to the district attorney's office. Those officers also purchased 48 grams of pink cocaine also known as tusi \u2014 a mixture of cocaine, MDMA and ketamine \u2014 from the defendants during the operation.",
      "NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said Wednesday that all of the indicted Tren de Aragua members had entered the country illegally around 2023. He said the police department had become aware of the gang's activities in the city including using motorized scooters to snatch cellphones and conducting organized retail thefts. He said the gang unit has identified at least 67 gang members in the city.",
      "The arrests Tuesday came the same day that newly confirmed U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem joined federal agents to announce the arrest of immigrants wanted on criminal charges. That included an operation in the Bronx that snared Anderson Zambrano-Pacheco, 26. Authorities say he was part of the group of armed men, some affiliated with Tren de Aragua, who appeared in the Aurora, Colorado, video."

      "Jeanne Kay Whitefeather and Donald Ray Lantz went on trial in mid-January and each faced over a dozen counts, including forced labor, civil rights violations, human trafficking and child neglect.",
      "The couple, who are white, were accused of mistreating their children \u2014 all of whom are Black \u2014 by locking them in a shed, forcing them to sleep on the floor and use buckets as toilets, and more.",
      "The Kanawha County Circuit Court jury convicted Whitefeather on all 19 counts against her, including the civil rights violations. Lantz was found guilty on 12 counts out of 16. He was acquitted of four counts of civil rights violations. Both showed little emotion as the verdict was read.",
      "Kanawha County Prosecuting Attorney Debra Rusnak said she cried as she heard the word \u201cguilty\u201d repeated again and again.",
      "\u201cThese cases mean a lot to us \u2014 we take a lot of this personally,\" she said at a news conference afterward. \"This is our community, and these are the children of our community. If we\u2019re not going to fight for them, then who will?\u201d",
      "Whitefeather and Lantz adopted the five siblings while living in Minnesota, moved to a farm in Washington state in 2018, and then brought the family to West Virginia in May 2023, when the children ranged in age from 5 to 16.",
      "The couple was arrested in October 2023 after neighbors saw Lantz lock the oldest girl and her teenage brother in a shed and leave the property. A deputy used a crowbar to get them out.",
      "Inside the main residence, a 9-year-old girl was found alone crying in a loft with no protection from falling, according to a criminal complaint. A fourth child was with Lantz when he eventually returned. Deputies were later led to the couple\u2019s youngest daughter.",
      "The children were found in dirty clothes and smelling of body odor, deputies said, and the eldest boy was found barefoot with what appeared to be sores on his feet.",
      "All five were turned over to Child Protective Services after the couple's arrest.",
      "During the trial, neighbors in Sissonville testified they never saw the children play and witnessed Lantz make them stand in line or perform difficult chores around the yard, including lifting heavy items. After Lantz noticed the curious neighbors, the children mostly stayed indoors.",
      "The couple\u2019s eldest daughter, now 18, testified that the outdoor work occurred mostly in Washington and that some of them were forced to use their hands for digging.",
      "She also said the children were fed a steady diet of peanut butter sandwiches at scheduled times, some left over from a previous meal. Some kids were forced to stand in their rooms for hours and keep their hands on their heads. The oldest girl and boy shared a room, including the same bucket for using the bathroom while the other held up a sheet for privacy.",
      "The couple and their attorneys pushed back on the accusations, with Lantz testifying that the chores were assigned to teach the children responsibility.",
      "Whitefeather called the shed the children were found in a \u201cteenager hangout\u201d and said the teens had access to a key and were free to leave as they pleased.",
      "Whitefeather\u2019s attorney said the oldest boy had attempted to run away from home and the lock on the shed was meant to keep him from trying again.",
      "Testimony showed the children didn\u2019t know where a key was \u2014 detectives found one out of sight on a cabinet in the shed.",
      "Prosecutors said the couple\u2019s tactics were less about teaching responsibility and instead about control.",
      "\u201cThe whole point of treating them this way is they become less than human,\u201d Kanawha County Assistant Prosecutor Chris Krivonyak said.",
      "Krivonyak added, \u201cHow do you do that to someone you love?\u201d",
      "Prosecutors also entered racist text messages into evidence that they said were from Whitefeather, who denied writing them. The oldest daughter testified the children were cursed at \u201call the time\u201d and that Whitefeather used racist language.",
      "Whitefeather also refused to eat off the same plates used by the children, whom she referred to as \u201cdirty,\u201d the girl testified.",
      "\u201cYou want to know what racists look like?\u201d Assistant Prosecutor Madison Tuck asked the jury, then pointed to the defendants. \u201cLook at them.\u201d",
      "The defense argued the couple was simply overwhelmed with trying to get help for the children\u2019s mental health issues, abuse and trauma from their biological home.",

      "Two dogs that survived an animal-rescue flight crash that killed the pilot last fall have found new homes",
      "Two dogs that survived an animal-rescue flight crash that killed the pilot have found new homes as the late aviator's friends work to honor him by helping more pets, a shelter director said Wednesday.",
      "The Nov. 24 crash in New York's Catskill Mountains killed Seuk Kim of Springfield, Virginia, a dedicated volunteer who transported cats and dogs from disaster areas and overcrowded shelters to rescue groups. He was bringing three dogs to an Albany, New York-area organization called the Animal Shelter of Schoharie Valley when his 1986 Mooney M20J went down.",
      "Kim told air traffic controllers that he hit moderate to heavy turbulence at 5,000 feet (1,520 meters), but then he descended to about 4,300 feet (1,311 meters) and reported that conditions improved to light to moderate turbulence, according to the National Transportation Safety Board's preliminary report on the crash. The report said he didn't contact air traffic control again or make any distress calls.",
      "Two of the dogs, a Labrador-mix puppy named Whiskey and a young Yorkshire terrier mix called Pluto, survived. Pluto was internally bruised, while Whiskey was found huddled in the snow with two broken legs. The Lab pup subsequently underwent surgeries at Pieper Memorial Veterinary emergency and specialty hospital in Middletown, Connecticut.",
      "After those procedures and lots of physical therapy, 6-month-old Whiskey is on his feet and playing at his foster home in Middletown, and the family that took him in has decided to keep him, said Maggie Jackman Pryor, the executive director of the Animal Shelter of Schoharie Valley.",
      "The foster family is set to adopt Whiskey formally this weekend.",
      "Pluto, meanwhile, recovered quickly and was adopted a few weeks into a home in Averill Park, a community near Albany, Pryor said.",
      "The remains of the third dog, a little one named Lisa, went to Kim's relatives at their request.",
      "The Animal Shelter of Schoharie Valley fielded inquiries from people around the country interested in adopting the canine survivors, said Pryor, who urged some callers to look closer to home.",
      "\u201cThese two dogs are amazing, but there are so many amazing dogs\" in shelters, she said in a phone interview Wednesday.",
      "Meanwhile, Kim's friends and fellow rescue pilots are forming an organization to further his legacy, Pryor said. She said plans include sponsoring mobile spay and neuter clinics and creating pet food pantries like one that he and his children started."

    "story": [
      "The Republican-controlled Senate has confirmed Lee Zeldin to lead the Environmental Protection Agency",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Republican-controlled Senate on Wednesday confirmed Lee Zeldin to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, a key role to help President Donald Trump fulfill his pledge to roll back major environmental regulations, including those aimed at slowing climate change and encouraging use of electric vehicles.",
      "The vote was 56-42 in Zeldin's favor.",
      "Zeldin, a former Republican congressman from New York, is a longtime Trump ally and served on Trump\u2019s defense team during his first impeachment. He voted against certifying Trump\u2019s 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden.",
      "Zeldin, 44, said during his confirmation hearing that he has a moral responsibility to be a good steward of the environment and pledged to support career staff who have dedicated themselves to the agency's mission to protect human health and the environment.",
      "Zeldin repeatedly declined to commit to specific policies, however, promising instead not to prejudge outcomes before arriving at EPA. When asked by Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts of Nebraska whether he would roll back programs that promote electric cars \u2014 a program Trump has repeatedly criticized \u2014 Zeldin stayed vague but acknowledged he has heard Republican complaints.",
      "Trump led efforts to dismantle more than 100 environmental protections during his first term and has promised to do so again, targeting what he falsely labels an electric vehicle \u201cmandate\u201d and \u201cgreen new scam\u201d approved by Democrats.",
      "Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, has vowed to overturn former President Joe Biden\u2019s biggest climate accomplishments, including tailpipe regulations for vehicles and slashed pollution from power plants fired by coal and natural gas. Trump has already moved to oust career staff at EPA and other agencies, remove scientific advisers and close an office that helps minority communities that disproportionately struggle with polluted air and water.",
      "Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island called Zeldin the wrong man for the job.",
      "\u201cWe need an EPA administrator who will take climate change seriously, treat the science honestly and stand up where necessary to the political pressure that will be coming from the White House, where we have a president who actually thinks (climate change) is a hoax, and from the huge fossil fuel forces that propelled him into office with enormous amounts of political money and who now think they own the place,\" Whitehouse said in a Senate speech.",
      "Trump is \u201cunder the thumb of the fossil fuel industry,\u201d Whitehouse said, adding that the EPA administrator \u201chas to be truthful and factual and support and defend our environment and our safety from climate change.''",
      "He has nothing against Zeldin personally, Whitehouse added, \u201cbut the likelihood of him standing against that fossil fuel bulldozer that is coming at him is essentially zero. And in that context, this is very much the wrong guy.\u201d",
      "Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said Zeldin will return the EPA to its original mission of protecting America\u2019s air, water and land \u2014 without \u201csuffocating the economy.\u201d",
      "Barrasso called Zeldin \u201ca lifelong public servant\u201d and a seasoned lawyer with a sharp legal mind and over 20 years of military service.",
      "Zeldin will continue Trump\u2019s \u201cmission to roll back punishing, political regulations\u201d at the EPA, \u201ccut red tape\u201d and oversee \"a new wave of creativity and innovation,'' Barrasso said.",
      "\u201cFor the last four years, the so-called experts at the Environmental Protection Agency went on a reckless regulatory rampage,'' Barrasso said, referring to the Biden administration. \u201cThey saddled American families and businesses with higher costs and heavy-handed restrictions. They bowed to climate extremism and ignored common sense.\"",
      "Zeldin \u201cwill right the ship and restore balance at the EPA,'' Barrasso said, citing likely actions to repeal Biden-era rules on tailpipe emissions and power plants, along with eliminating federal subsidies for electric vehicles.",
      "The League of Conservation Voters, a national environmental advocacy group, has panned Zeldin\u2019s lifetime environmental record, giving him a 14% score. Like all Republicans at the time, he voted against the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act aimed at boosting renewable energy and manufacturing and fighting climate change.",
      "Zeldin supported a bill to reduce harmful forever chemicals, called PFAS, that would have required the EPA to set limits on substances in drinking water. He also was a leading proponent of the 2020 Great American Outdoors Act, which used oil and gas royalties to help the National Park Service tackle its massive maintenance backlog. He\u2019s also supported local conservation efforts on Long Island.",
      "Zeldin said at his Jan. 16 hearing that he wants to collaborate with the private sector \u201cto promote common-sense, smart regulation that will allow American innovation to continue to lead the world.\"",
      "The EPA under his leadership \u201cwill prioritize compliance as much as possible,\" Zeldin said. \u201cI believe in the rule of law and I want to work with people to ensure they do their part to protect the environment.\""

    "summary": "South Carolina Treasurer Curtis Loftis says calls for him to resign over an accounting error that left the state sorting out what happened to a $1.8 billion fund amounted to a witch hunt",
    "story": [
      "South Carolina Treasurer Curtis Loftis says calls for him to resign over an accounting error that left the state sorting out what happened to a $1.8 billion fund amounted to a witch hunt",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- South Carolina Treasurer Curtis Loftis said Wednesday that calls for him to resign over an accounting error that left the state trying to figure out what happened to a $1.8 billion fund amounted to a witch hunt.",
      "A House budget subcommittee asked Loftis about the complex problem his office and two others knew about for roughly six years before it was reported to the General Assembly. The leaders of two other agencies who were aware of the problem subsequently resigned and the accounting error was only reported by one of their replacements.",
      "Most of the $1.8 billion was mistakes involved in assigning the money to accounts and didn't involve actual cash. But it took millions of dollars and a private forensic audit to untangle the mess.",
      "Loftis said the potential damage to South Carolina's credit rating and a federal investigation into the state's accounting practices aren't the fault of his agency. Rather, he said, the fallout is to blame on Republican state senators and others aggressively pursuing the Republican treasurer and making a public spectacle of the mistake.",
      "\u201cNobody can understand it. It's a political witch hunt,\u201d said Loftis, who several times blamed the mistakes on now retired members of his staff or on the Comptroller General and Auditor offices who help him with state finances.",
      "Lawmakers, especially in the Senate, aren't so sure. Republican Sen. Larry Grooms is calling for Loftis to resign and the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday passed a resolution to pay a private accounting firm to \u201cbabysit\u201d the Treasurer's Office \u2014 as Grooms said \u2014 until lawmakers are confident the state's accounts are back in order.",
      "The problems started as the state changed computer systems in the 2010s. When the process was finished, workers couldn't figure out why the books were more than $1 billion out of whack. A fund was created to cover the accounting error and over the years more was added on paper to keep the state's books balanced.",
      "The error came to light after Comptroller General Richard Eckstrom resigned in March 2023 over a different accounting mistake and his replacement reported the mystery account.",
      "State Auditor George Kennedy resigned last week after the private audit by AlixPartners found he did not review audits that failed to report the $1.8 billion discrepancy.",
      "The questioning of Loftis in the House was less confrontational than the Senate's. But members of the House budget subcommittee were especially upset why Loftis didn't report the problems as soon as they cropped up, instead of waiting for years.",
      "\u201cI don't know how to explain to my neighbors, to my constituents that we could have solved this problem for thousands of dollars but now the taxpayers of this state are forced to spend millions of dollars,\u201d Republican Rep. Micah Caskey said.",
      "Loftis repeated the mistakes were made from outside his agency and his staff was trying to fix them.",
      "\u201cThey are trying to do the right things. Decision were made. They weren't the best,\u201d Loftis said.",
      "Loftis also suggested the damage to South Carolina's borrowing power has already been done. He said the state now can only get loans and financing on a year-to-year basis at unfavorable terms and laid the blame on the Senate and others who have been aggressively scapegoating him for the accounting problems.",
      "Later Wednesday Grooms showed reporters a memo from Senate Finance staff that said the state can borrow and assume debt and no projects have been held up.",
      "During part of Loftis' presentation, Grooms sat in the back of the meeting room in the House. Grooms left before Loftis once the meeting concluded, but said afterward that the treasurer caught up to him in a hallway.",
      "\u201cHe asked me if I was happy that I\u2019m the reason our schools and hospitals aren\u2019t being built in South Carolina,\u201d Grooms said.",
      "A reporter asked how he responded and Grooms said, \"I know catfish that are more slippery than you are.\u201d",
      "Loftis' office didn't respond to give the treasurer's version of the encounter."

      "Tulsi Gabbard is expected to face tough questions about her past comments about Russia, Syria and a key government surveillance program as lawmakers vet her to lead the nation\u2019s intelligence service",
      "WASHINGTON -- As an unconventional pick to lead the nation's intelligence service, Tulsi Gabbard is expected to face tough questions about her past comments on Syria, Russia, foreign surveillance and President Donald Trump when she goes before lawmakers at her confirmation hearing Thursday.",
      "The former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii is Trump's nominee to be the next director of national intelligence, a job created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that oversees and coordinates the work of more than a dozen intelligence agencies.",
      "Gabbard, a lieutenant colonel in the National Guard who served two tours in the Middle East, has alarmed some intelligence and national security officials in the U.S. and elsewhere with comments sympathetic to Russia and criticism of a critical surveillance program.",
      "Here's a look at Gabbard in her own words:",
      "Gabbard traveled to Syria in 2017 to meet with then-President Bashar Assad, a visit that angered lawmakers from both parties who said she helped legitimize an accused war criminal and key ally of Russia and Iran.",
      "Gabbard has defended the trip and her belief that meeting with adversaries can result in dialogue and peace. Assad fled Syria in December after being ousted following his country's brutal civil war.",
      "\u201cWhen the opportunity arose to meet with him, I did so because I felt that it\u2019s important that if we profess to truly care about the Syrian people, about their suffering, then we\u2019ve got to be able to meet with anyone that we need to if there is a possibility that we can achieve peace,\u201d Gabbard told CNN at the time.",
      "She later said she was \u201cskeptical\u201d that Assad's regime used banned chemical weapons to strike his own people, despite that being the repeated conclusion of U.S. authorities and independent analysts.",
      "\u201cI have not seen that independent investigation occur and that proof presented showing exactly what happened and there are a number of theories of exactly what happened that day,\" Gabbard said of Assad's attack during a CNN appearance in 2017.",
      "In a 2019 interview on MSNBC, she said, \u201cAssad is not the enemy of the United States because Syria does not pose a direct threat to the United States.\u201d",
      "Following Assad's ouster, Gabbard has echoed Trump, who has said Assad fell because Russia pulled its support during its war in Ukraine, a conflict Trump has said he hopes to resolve.",
      "\u201cI stand in full support and wholeheartedly agree with the statements that President Trump has made,\u201d she told reporters in December. \u201cMy own views and experiences have been shaped by my multiple deployments and seeing firsthand the cost of war.\"",
      "Trump, she said, \u201cis fully committed as he has said over and over to bringing about an end to wars, demonstrating peace through strength.\u201d",
      "Gabbard has repeated Russia's arguments about its invasion of Ukraine, suggesting Moscow had justification to send troops into the neighboring country. She also endorsed Russian claims that the U.S. and Ukraine were involved in dangerous biological research before the war.",
      "She has criticized the government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as a \u201ccorrupt autocracy\u201d and has expressed sympathy for Russia\u2019s position, given Ukraine\u2019s desire to join NATO, the Western military alliance.",
      "\u201cThis war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden Admin/NATO had simply acknowledged Russia\u2019s legitimate security concerns,\u201d she posted on Twitter at the start of Russia\u2019s invasion in 2022.",
      "Soon after the war started, Russian state media advanced the false claim that the U.S. was involved in clandestine bioweapons research in Ukraine. The conspiracy theory relied on the existence of U.S.-funded labs that weren't secret and were involved in traditional public health research and efforts to prevent pandemics.",
      "Gabbard did not make that distinction when she suggested that the labs could \u201crelease and spread deadly pathogens\u201d \u2014 echoing similar Russian conspiracy theories about the labs.",
      "\u201cThese labs need to be shut down immediately, and the pathogens that they hold need to be destroyed,\u201d she said. Her comments drew a sharp rebuke from lawmakers, including some Republicans, who said she was parroting Russian propaganda.",
      "Gabbard later said she had only been referring to traditional public health research, and not secret biolabs. But her comments were taken seriously in Russia, where the state-controlled media has often praised Gabbard. One article last year called her \u201csuperwoman.\u201d",
      "Gabbard has praised Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor who fled to Russia after he was charged in 2013 with illegally exposing government surveillance methods. Considered a traitor by many security officials, Snowden has been hailed as a heroic whistleblower by others.",
      "Gabbard sponsored legislation to end Snowden's prosecution, putting her at odds with Senate Republicans who have criticized Snowden's actions. Snowden received Russian citizenship in 2022.",
      "\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Snowden, the American people would never have learned the NSA was collecting phone records and spying on Americans. As president, I will protect whistle-blowers who expose threats to our freedom and liberty,\u201d Gabbard wrote on social media in 2019.",
      "As a member of Congress, Gabbard tried to repeal a surveillance program used to spy on suspected terrorists and foreign agents overseas \u2014 a program she now says she supports as she seeks Senate confirmation.",
      "The program, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, permits the U.S. government to collect without a warrant the communications of non-Americans located outside the country for the purpose of gathering foreign intelligence. National security officials say 702, which was first authorized in 2008, has saved lives by preventing terror attacks, while also helping the government stay ahead of foreign cyberattacks or espionage.",
      "Gabbard introduced legislation in 2020 that would have repealed the law, which she said made it too easy to obtain the private communications of Americans without a warrant.",
      "\u201cProtection of our civil liberties is essential,\u201d she said about her bill, which did not pass. \u201cJoin us in making sure that our constitutional rights are upheld.\u201d",
      "Her opposition has concerned lawmakers from both parties who said her criticism of the surveillance program would be a liability for her nomination as intelligence chief.",
      "Gabbard now says she supports Section 702 and has called it a \u201ccrucial\u201d intelligence tool. She said her view changed after Congress added protections to the law.",
      "\u201cMy prior concerns about FISA were based on insufficient protections for civil liberties, particularly regarding the FBI\u2019s misuse of warrantless search powers on American citizens,\u201d she told CNN on Jan. 10. \u201cIf confirmed as DNI, I will uphold Americans\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights while maintaining vital national security tools like Section 702 to ensure the safety and freedom of the American people.\u201d",
      "Gabbard\u2019s loyalty to Trump represents an about-face from just a few years ago, when she ran for president as a Democrat and ended up endorsing her party\u2019s 2020 nominee, Joe Biden.",
      "In 2019, she voted \u201cpresent\u201d during Trump\u2019s first impeachment hearing, but while she declined to vote to impeach, she rebuked his conduct as president, saying he had \u201cviolated public trust.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no question in my mind that Donald Trump is unfit to serve as president and commander in chief. I\u2019ve said this over and over again,\u201d Gabbard said in 2019.",
      "Gabbard was a Democrat when she served in Congress, representing her home state of Hawaii. In 2022, she became an independent, saying the Democratic Party was dominated by an \u201celitist cabal of warmongers\u201d and \u201cwoke\u201d ideologues.",
      "She subsequently campaigned for several high-profile Republicans and became a contributor to Fox News.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s Democratic Party is unrecognizable from the party I joined 20 years ago,\u201d she said when explaining her decision.",
      "When she endorsed Trump last year, Gabbard said he had \u201cthe courage to meet with adversaries, dictators, allies and partners alike in the pursuit of peace, seeing war as a last resort,\u201d adding that under Biden, the U.S. was \u201dcloser to the brink of nuclear war than we ever have been before.\u201d",
      "She also has criticized criminal prosecutions of Trump, saying Biden\u2019s administration was \u201cconditioning us to accept a dictatorship by rationalizing their own use of of our Justice Department to target President Trump.\u201d"

      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- A U.S. Army veteran who served in the war in Afghanistan pleaded not guilty Wednesday to fatally shooting a homeless man with an automatic rifle in downtown Memphis.",
      "A lawyer for Karl P. Loucks, 42, entered the plea to a first-degree murder charge during a hearing in Shelby County Criminal Court. Loucks also pleaded not guilty to an aggravated assault charge in the stabbing of another homeless man in downtown Memphis, where Loucks lived in an apartment.",
      "Loucks is being held in jail without bond. He was arrested May 31 in the killing of Shaun Rhea. Loucks\u2019 lawyer has suggested that he acted in self-defense.",
      "During a hearing in July, a security guard and a police investigator testified that Loucks attacked Rhea in the early morning hours of the day he was arrested. Tony Perry, a security guard at a downtown Memphis hotel, testified that he saw Loucks use pepper spray on Rhea while he was sleeping. Loucks also pepper-sprayed other homeless people that same night, Perry said.",
      "After he was pepper-sprayed, Rhea confronted Loucks, asking why Loucks did it and \u201ccalling him the b-word,\u201d Perry said. Loucks took out a knife, and Rhea picked up an electric scooter that was nearby and threw it at Loucks. He missed.",
      "Perry said Rhea was angry, though he added that Rhea did not attempt to get physical with Loucks.",
      "Loucks then entered his apartment building, but he returned shortly afterward carrying an AR-style rifle under an orange jacket, Perry testified. Perry said several shots were fired.",
      "Rhea, who did not have a gun, was struck in the back, Memphis police Sgt. Jeremy Cline testified at the July hearing. Rhea died at a hospital.",
      "Police were called, and they found the rifle and the jacket in Loucks\u2019 apartment, Cline said. During a police interview after his arrest, Loucks said he acted in self-defense after Rhea confronted him, Cline said.",

      "On March 21, 2006 the first ever tweet was posted by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey: \"Just setting up my twttr\". It was a simple introduction to a brand new platform.",
      "Backed by celebrities, it was different to other social media sites, like MySpace or Facebook, because you could interact with any user without them having to approve a request. Companies rushed to join the service, hoping to get closer to their customers.",
      "\"If you were a brand that wanted to be part of any cultural moments that were happening, Twitter was a great place to be,\" Alex Wilson, a senior strategist at the marketing agency Pitch tells BBC News.",
      "On June 4, 2010 Elon Musk, the owner of Space X, logged on for the first time: \"Please ignore prior tweets, as that was someone pretending to be me :) This is actually me.\"",
      "Twelve years later he would buy the platform for $44bn (\u00a338.1bn), reshape the algorithm, reinstate banned accounts, repurpose the policy around \"free speech\", and rename it X.",
      "He also fired thousands of staff - around 80% of the workforce.",
      "Since Mr Musk's takeover companies have been choosing to leave the platform in what's been termed \"the great X-odus\".",
      "One of their main concerns was the content that would be seen around their posts that users could screengrab and share.",
      "For example, between June 2022 and February 2023 antisemitic posts on X doubled, according to research by the Institute of Strategic Dialogue.",
      "More recently in the UK, Mr Musk's posts about British politics have stirred up controversy.",
      "In particular, his posts on the subject of grooming gangs put pressure on the government, which announced a review of the issue.",
      "\"There is no doubt that Musk's ownership of X is having an impact on public opinion in the UK,\" Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common tells BBC News.",
      "However, according to More In Common, only 16% of Brits believe his interventions are designed to achieve justice for victims, whereas 44% think he is doing it for attention, and his approval rating with the British public sits at -35.",
      "The changing tone of X and the controversy surrounding its owner have spurred some firms to leave the platform and others have pulled their advertising as well.",
      "At the end of 2023 firms including Apple, IBM and Disney paused advertisement on the platform.",
      "Others brands including Unilever and Mars were sued by Mr Musk, who accused them of unlawfully agreeing to boycott the site.",
      "\"It's broadly fair to say Twitter is becoming less relevant across the world,\" Mr Wilson says in the Pitch office in central London, with posters of clients ranging from charities, telecommunications, and sports leagues.",
      "\"It's been a very long time since clients came to us and say: 'Twitter's fun and exciting. We want to be in that space'.",
      "\"Unless you are targeting specific audiences, maybe certain political audiences or sports  - football is still big on Twitter - it's hard to see the value in it.\"",
      "Trump's election victory has prompted other organisations to leave X, with others considering their positions as Mr Musk's influence in the White House grows.",
      "Beginning in 2013, German football team FC St Pauli, which plays in Germany's top league, the Bundesliga, posted more than 60,000 times, racking up nearly 250,000 followers.",
      "But less than 10 days after Trump's return to the White House was confirmed, the club posted: \"You can find our statement about saying goodbye to X on BlueSky. Feel free to follow us there. We're out of here.\"",
      "\"We discussed the decision for a year. We were mostly posting content with counter speech to hate. We had a lot of content for diversity, anti-racism, and anti-sexism,\" club spokesperson, Patrick Gensing told the BBC.",
      "\"We have seen assaults on X, antisemitism, conspiracy theories,\" he says.",
      "The argument that such posts are justified by freedom of speech, does not convince him.",
      "\"We don't think racism is freedom of speech,\" says Mr Gensing.",
      "One of the most recent departures from X was by the UK arm of BMW. In late January it announced it was no longer posting on X and directed people to its posts on Facebook and Instagram.",
      "There's no definitive way to know how many brands are choosing to leave or reduce their posts on the platform.",
      "When approached, X did not respond to the points raised in this article. But last year Mr Musk claimed X had 600 million monthly active users, and said the platform maintains its \"purpose is to serve the public conversation\".",
      "Mr Musk \"has been clear that X is willing to make trade-offs to adopt a more open, less moderated approach compared to Twitter\", says Goran Calic, visiting scholar at Harvard Business School.",
      "But leaving X can have negative consequences for organisations and their relationships with customers.",
      "\"When users leave, the impact depends on who is leaving and why. A local authority posting news provides significant value to the network. If such an account leaves, it can hurt both the platform and its users,\" he tells BBC News.",
      "\"Users protesting by leaving should weigh the broader social implications of staying versus exiting.\"",
      "For some organisations who need to get their message out quickly, X still has value that other competitors simply can't offer.",
      "\"For us there is still that value [on being on X],\" says Andrew Cassidy, senior director of digital strategy and engagement at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).",
      "\"We try to match where our riders are. When people are tweeting at the MBTA someone can provide a definitive answer in the moment. Our broadcasting system is exclusively tied into our X account, but we still field customer service questions across other platforms.\"",
      "\"Our focus is providing customer service to the largest number of riders that we possibly can,\" Mr Cassidy says.",
      "\"With the current landscape being what it is, X still feeds that need.\"",
      "It's \"unthinkable\", Mr Gensing explains, not to have a presence on social media in 2025.",
      "\"We have to view all the platforms critically, it's not only X. The companies behind them set up the rules of the game and they can change them.\"",

      "\"If their statistics were true, there'd only be about one and a half incidents per year per shop, and if you ask any shopkeeper they'll tell you they're lucky if a day goes by where there hasn't been a shoplifting incident.\"",

      "The Metropolitan Police said officers responded to the incident and carried out a search of the area. They were unable to locate the suspects, despite the fact that they were captured on video. An investigation has since been launched.",

      "He said work on both fields could continue while the new information was gathered but no oil and gas could be extracted unless fresh approval was granted.",
      "Shell's Jackdaw gas field in the North Sea was originally approved by the previous UK Conservative government, and the industry regulator, in summer 2022.",
      "Permission for the Rosebank oil development, 80 miles west of Shetland in the North Atlantic, was granted in autumn 2023.",
      "In a 57-page judgement, Lord Ericht wrote that there was a public interest in having the decision \"remade on a lawful basis\" because of the effects of climate change - which he said outweighed the interests of the developers.",
      "Tessa Khan, executive director of Uplift, welcomed the ruling as \"common sense\" and said the government should now refuse approval for both projects.",
      "\"The climate science is crystal clear that we can't create new oil and gas fields if we're going to stay within safe climate thresholds,\" she said.",
      "The companies involved insist their projects are vital for UK energy security and should be allowed to proceed.",
      "Rosebank contains an estimated 300 million to 500 million barrels of oil, making it the largest known untapped field in UK waters.",
      "Norwegian state energy giant Equinor has an 80% stake in Rosebank with Aberdeen-based Ithaca Energy owning the rest.",
      "The plan was for oil to be taken off by tanker and sold on the international market, with some gas being piped to Shetland.",
      "Production was scheduled to begin at Jackdaw in 2026 and at Rosebank in 2026/27.",
      "As part of the original consenting process, environmental impact assessments were carried out to identify, describe and assess \"the direct and indirect effects\" of the projects.",
      "Those assessments took into account emissions generated by the process of extracting oil and gas but not the greenhouse gases which would be released when those fossil fuels were eventually burned - known as \"downstream\" or \"Scope 3\" emissions.",
      "But last June, in a dispute about oil wells near London's Gatwick Airport, the UK Supreme Court ruled that environmental impact assessments must also include downstream emissions.",
      "Now Lord Ericht has ruled that the decision in that case \u2013 Finch v Surrey County Council \u2013 should apply retrospectively to Rosebank and Jackdaw.",
      "As a result, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband and the regulator, the North Sea Transition Authority (formerly known as the Oil and Gas Authority), must reconsider whether or not to grant consent, taking into account those downstream emissions.",
      "What is Rosebank and why is it so controversial?",
      "The race to save the fastest-warming place on Earth",
      "Charlie Kronick of Greenpeace said granting approval would be inconsistent with meeting the UK's national and international targets to reduce carbon emissions.",
      "\"There is no way that we can meet those targets by approving new oil and gas,\" he said.",
      "Oil firms insist there will still be domestic demand for fossil fuels whether it is produced in UK waters or not, arguing that importing gas would produce higher emissions.",
      "The UK government has been considering how to calculate downstream emissions, and a consultation on the subject had been due to conclude in the spring.",
      "Downing Street said it \"worked at speed to consult on updated environmental guidance so we can provide certainty to industry\" since the autumn.",
      "The prime minister's official spokesperson told reporters at a daily Downing Street briefing that: \"This will help provide stability for industry, support our environmental goals and investment, protect jobs and deliver economic growth\".",
      "The spokesperson added: \"Oil and gas will be with us for decades to come, but diversifying the North Sea industries is also key to protecting jobs and investments in the long term, alongside our commitment to manage existing fields for the duration of their lifespan.\"",
      "First Minister John Swinney said the Scottish government would \"reflect carefully\" on the court's decision but that he had not yet been able to analyse it \"in detail\".",
      "He told reporters the judgement highlighted the significance of climate implications being considered in any consenting decisions. He said that had always been an \"essential part\" of the Scottish government's stance.",
      "A spokesperson for Shell said swift action was needed from the government to grant fresh approval for Jackdaw, adding: \"Today's ruling rightly allows work to progress on this nationally-important energy project while new consents are sought.\"",
      "Equinor said it welcomed the ruling and promised to continue to work closely with government to progress it.",
      "\"Rosebank is critical for the UK's economic growth,\" a spokesperson said, adding that it was investing \u00a32.2bn in the project and a pause would have meant job losses and a cut in tax income for the Treasury.",
      "In court, counsel for Shell had argued that quashing consent could threaten the overall viability of Jackdaw, not just costing the company and its partners huge sums of money but also impacting UK energy security, the transition to renewable energy and the wider economy.",
      "However, Lord Ericht concluded that these were not matters for him, writing: \"The question for me is not whether the projects should go ahead, but whether the unlawful decisions should be retaken in a lawful manner.\"",
      "He also rejected arguments from the companies that they had acted in good faith because the UK government had told them there was no need to include downstream emissions in their environmental assessments.",
      "\"Shell, Equinor and Ithaca,\" wrote Lord Ericht, \"knew or ought to have known at the time that the consents were granted that the law was uncertain.\"",
      "More stories from North East Scotland, Orkney and Shetland",
      "Listen to news from North East Scotland on BBC Sounds",
      "Shell has already spent \u00a3800m on Jackdaw, which it says will employ \"at least 1,000\" people between 2023 and 2025, and account for about 6% of future North Sea gas production, providing enough energy to heat 1.4 million homes, and reducing the need to import energy from abroad.",
      "The platform is currently in a fabrication yard at Verdal near Trondheim, Norway and is due to be lifted onto a barge and towed into place in the next few months.",
      "BBC News visited the yard earlier this month and witnessed engineers making final adjustments to a vast and complex array of shining pipes, valves and dials.",
      "On a misty and mild winter's day, the platform loomed up beneath a giant red and white crane, boasting a gleaming aluminium helipad and a bright orange lifeboat.",
      "The structure to support the platform, known as a jacket, is already on the seabed 150 miles east of Aberdeen.",
      "Several Norwegians we spoke to on our brief visit to Verdal, some 200 miles south of the Arctic Circle, said the weather was remarkably warm for January.",
      "This would be no surprise to climate scientists who have pointed out that Norway is home to some of the fastest-warming places on earth.",
      "In court last year, Shell's lawyer, Christine O'Neill KC, said the company accepted that greenhouse gas emissions contributed to climate change and urgent action was needed to tackle it.",
      "However, she added, \"whether, how and to what extent\" any individual project contributed to climate change was \"a complex one.\"",
      "In his judgment, Lord Ericht wrote: \"The effect of the burning of fossil fuels on climate change and the lives of individual persons is now well recognised in law.\"",
      "The judge has now, in effect, batted the case out of the judicial arena and into the wilds of politics, where the landscape has shifted even in the two months since verbal arguments in the case were heard in Edinburgh.",
      "Republican Donald Trump is now back in the White House promising to \"drill, baby, drill\" while Labour chancellor Rachel Reeves is stressing economic growth over environmental concerns as she backs airport expansion.",
      "There has been speculation that Ed Miliband is uncomfortable with this position but he has not broken ranks.",
      "On the other hand, the oil industry says it is already facing difficult conditions because of political uncertainty and high levels of taxation, with the US firm Apache recently announcing it would leave the North Sea by the end of 2029.",
      "Given that backdrop, Shell is now understood to be pressing government in private for assurances about Jackdaw.",
      "\"The addition of downstream emissions will add to the assessment process a new and significant factor which was not included on the previous assessment and may change the result of the assessment,\" wrote Lord Ericht.",

      "Around $22m of the settlement will go to a fund for Trump's presidential library.",
      "The balance will be used to cover legal costs and the other plaintiffs who signed on to the lawsuit. Meta will not admit wrongdoing.",
      "The company suspended Trump's accounts in 2021 and said that it would ban him from the platforms for at least two years.",
      "After Trump's election victory in November, Mr Zuckerberg visited his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago. The move was seen as evidence of an apparent thawing in their once frosty relations.",
      "The following month, Meta donated $1m to an inauguration fund for Trump. Mr Zuckerberg was a guest at Trump's inauguration at the US Capitol earlier this month - seated near other global tech billionaires.",
      "For years, Trump had been highly critical of Mr Zuckerberg and Facebook - calling the platform \"anti-Trump\" in 2017.",

      "The stock was up in after hours trading after it posted better than expected financial results on Wednesday.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 16:08:36 GMT",
    "summary": "The key question is whether the fruits of long term growth will come through everywhere else quickly enough",
    "story": [
      "A third runway at Heathrow, \"Europe's Silicon Valley\" between Oxford and Cambridge and relaxing planning constraints. There were a lot of different announcements in Rachel Reeves' push to revive the UK economy.",
      "The key takeaway, the bottom line of her plans, is that these changes will work - they will boost UK growth.",
      "It is an admittedly low bar for an economy that has not been growing much.",
      "But this is a specific type of growth, long term growth, funded by global investors, who had started to have their doubts about Britain.",
      "A global Silicon Valley-like super city connecting Oxford and Cambridge to new and old population centres in between is the sort of offer that the world's biggest funds would fall over themselves to invest.",
      "Plug that in to the City and to the Nobel Prize winners at Google's AI firm DeepMind and the biomedical research centre Crick Institute in Kings Cross, and the country would have a stunning global asset in the 21st Century economy.",
      "Putting money into an integrated grand development plan connecting two of the world's greatest centres of learning, involving housing, labs, offices, hospitals, reservoirs, roads and rail, is a no brainer for the world's biggest investors.",
      "This has long been dreamed of, but the reality is that Britain has severely restricted the growth of its most compelling world-beating technological and economic assets. That appears to end here with Reeves' plans.",
      "Successive governments have simply failed to deploy their political capital to ram through growth-enhancing changes such as Heathrow expansion and especially the potential Golden Triangle of future growth between Oxford and Cambridge.",
      "Flatten opposition",
      "There has been so much talk about these grand plans. It never seemed to happen, and that reputation had risked becoming embedded in the rolled eyes of the international super investors who own most of Britain's infrastructure.",
      "There were plenty of numbers in the speech.",
      "But the one number that matters above all here is 156 - the size of the PM's majority. The chancellor's speech communicated that she will deploy that near total executive power to flatten the sort of opposition that has prevented or critically delayed these sorts of plans in the past.",
      "Indeed, I understand that the cautious, even lukewarm response from Heathrow so far, has been countered in meetings with government with a promise that they will indeed use that bumper majority.",
      "Farmers noisily protested after the Budget changes to inheritance tax. There will be many more groups with placards beeping their horns outside airports and in the Fens, if this agenda is actually delivered. In many ways that is an early test of the government's seriousness of trying to transform investment in the country.",
      "Short-term pain",
      "The other test is how visible and how quickly changes will materialise. Ministers say especially in the Oxford-Cambridge Silicon Valley of Europe plan, this will be seen within the parliament.",
      "But that hoped-for long term gain has been built on some short-term pain in the economy. Consumer and business confidence fell around the Budget decisions. The chancellor has indicated there will be further tough decisions on welfare and benefits as the government aims to cut back the ballooning costs of supporting people out of work or in work but also receiving benefits.",
      "Businesses in hospitality and retail are bearing a disproportionate burden of the Budget tax rises. From April they will pay more in national insurance as well as a higher minimum wage. Runways in west London, and laboratories in Oxford may not compensate those businesses.",
      "The other big challenge here is just how nimble the government is going to be. The government's AI strategy released earlier this month might already have been overtaken by events in Hangzhou at DeepSeek. Will all these data centres that Reeves has planned now actually be needed? Strategies for industry, infrastructure and trade are also now on the way.",
      "Timing here is everything. The question is whether the fruits of long-term growth will come through quickly enough."

    "summary": "Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce expansion plans but some question the short-term benefits.",
    "story": [
      "The expansion of Heathrow Airport has been backed by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who is hoping investment in a third runway, along with a series of other transport projects, will drive economic growth in the UK.",
      "Reeves has said expansion of the UK's biggest airport is \"badly needed\" and could lead to 100,000 jobs.",
      "However opponents claim expanding the airport would lead to higher emissions and blight local communities with extra noise and pollution. Friends of the Earth has said it would be \"hugely irresponsible in the midst of a climate emergency\".",
      "So is a third runway at Heathrow the right way to bring an immediate boost to the economy in any case?",
      "In terms of actual spades in the ground at Heathrow, the short answer is no.",
      "A third runway has been on the cards for many years. It has also been kicked into the long grass on several occasions.",
      "The argument in favour has always been an economic one. Large airports create jobs, promote trade and bring in both business travellers and tourists.",
      "Heathrow currently handles \u00a3200bn worth of trade a year and - the airport's owner would argue - provides a vital avenue for exports, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "But Heathrow's infrastructure is straining at the seams.",
      "Last year, a record 83.9 million passengers passed through its terminals with its two runways handling around 1,300 landings and take-offs every day.",
      "Flights from the airport are currently capped at a maximum of 480,000 per year and in practical terms it has reached that limit.",
      "A third runway would potentially increase the number of flights permitted to 720,000.",
      "Expanding the airport would, in theory, provide an avenue for growth that simply isn't there at the moment.",
      "The construction project itself - the biggest privately-funded infrastructure scheme in Europe - would create thousands of jobs.",
      "But a third runway at Heathrow is unlikely to become a reality for many years.",
      "HS2 blew billions - here's how and why",
      "Reeves hints at support for Heathrow expansion",
      "Firstly, a formal planning process has to take place. This type of major infrastructure project would require a Development Consent Order and unless the government changes the system, that would take between 18 months and two years.",
      "Secondly, it is highly likely any decision in favour of a third runway would be subject to a judicial review.",
      "Expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial - opponents include environmental groups, local authorities as well as nearby residents, and this stage could take another year and a half.",
      "So even with favourable winds, it could take at least three years to get to the construction stage which is itself expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "In terms of what can be achieved sooner that could potentially create bankable short-term benefits, separate projects to expand Gatwick and Luton airports are well-advanced and could be signed off by the Transport Secretary within weeks.",
      "The real value of backing a third runway at Heathrow is the less tangible but no less important signal to investors about the UK's attitude towards major infrastructure projects, say supporters.",
      "The uncertainty over the construction of the HS2 high speed line under the previous Conservative government is widely believed to have undermined confidence in the country's ability to turn ambitious plans into reality.",
      "A strong commitment to Heathrow expansion might help to reverse that perception.",
      "With the plan itself expected to cost close to \u00a320bn, insiders say firm government support will be vital if it goes ahead.",
      "Although the project would be privately-funded, people close to the scheme warn that it could not proceed without close co-ordination with ministers - including changes to the policy framework that sets out how the costs of the investment can be recovered.",
      "For the chancellor herself, there could be a short-term benefit in throwing her weight behind airport expansion plans now.",
      "Some economists have argued that if additional growth can be factored into economic forecasts currently being prepared by the Office for Budget Responsibility, it might make it easier for her to meet self-imposed fiscal rules within this parliament.",
      "If not, then Reeves is likely to bump into her own \"iron\" fiscal rules to pay for day-to- day spending out of tax receipts by 2029 - meaning spending cuts or further tax rises.",

    "summary": "The chancellor says expanding Heathrow would boost growth, but there is a lot of vocal opposition.",
    "story": [
      "The government has backed the expansion of Heathrow Airport after years of heated debate, saying it could create 100,000 jobs.",
      "The move, alongside potential confirmation of the expansion of other London airports including Gatwick and Luton, is likely to be met by fierce opposition.",
      "Critics say increasing air travel would make it much harder for the UK to meet its climate change commitments.",
      "However, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"a third runway is badly needed\", adding the government \"cannot duck the decision any longer\".",
      "How would Heathrow Airport be expanded?",
      "Heathrow is already the UK's busiest airport, serving more than 80 million travellers a year with its four passenger terminals and two runways.",
      "A third runway would mean demolishing hundreds of homes, diverting rivers, and rerouting the M25 motorway between junctions 14 and 15 through a tunnel under the new runway.",
      "The number of flights, currently capped at 480,000 a year, could go up to 720,000 - or nearly 2,000 a day on average.",
      "Heathrow told the BBC that it would eventually be able to serve up to 140 million passengers a year once the third runway is in operation.",
      "The airport's owners, who include Saudi Arabia and Qatar's sovereign wealth funds and private equity firm Ardian, said the costs of expansion would be met by charging airlines for use of the larger airport.",
      "But after years of wrangling over the original plans, the initial cost estimate of \u00a314bn will need to be revised.",
      "When could a third runway open?",
      "Even with government backing, the formal planning process could take up to two years.",
      "Any planning decision could then be subject to a judicial review, as well as needing to answer questions from opponents over environmental concerns.",
      "Local authorities and nearby residents will also have questions.",
      "After all that, construction is expected to take another six or seven years.",
      "Reeves has told the BBC she wants to see \"spades in the ground\" in the current Parliament and planes to start using the runway by 2035.",
      "Does Labour support a third runway?",
      "A third runway was first proposed by Gordon Brown's Labour government in 2009 but was only finally given the go-ahead by the Supreme Court in 2020.",
      "Several members of the current government - including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer - voted against a Heathrow expansion when in opposition.",
      "But Sir Keir recently told the BBC that the government has climate commitments, \"but growth is really important too\".",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"Any aviation expansion will only be able to go ahead if it is consistent with our carbon budgets.\"",
      "However, London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office said he has \"a long-standing opposition to airport expansion around London\" because of the impact on air quality and noise.",
      "Heathrow's boss, Thomas Woldbye, said in December he was waiting for a \"clear steer\" from the government before he could take plans forward.",
      "Could an extra runway help the economy?",
      "Some arguments for investing in the UK's transport infrastructure include a boost in growth, more jobs, and help for UK exports.",
      "Other European cities boast hub airports with more runways, including Amsterdam which serves fewer passengers than Heathrow but has five runways. Paris Charles de Gaulle and Frankfurt have four.",
      "Currently, over \u00a3200bn of British trade passes through Heathrow annually. Heathrow has not devised figures on how much trade is expected to increase after a third runway, which it will do when it arrives at planning stage.",
      "The Airport Commission, an independent panel that examines the need for additional UK airport capacity, looked into the likely impact of Heathrow expansion and reported in 2015 that there would be benefits to the tune of \u00a361bn over 60 years.",
      "It said that included reduced fares, fewer delays, greater resilience, and the creation of up to 77,000 jobs.",
      "Forging ahead with Heathrow expansion would also send a clear message to foreign investors that the government means what it says about making growth its priority.",
      "However, some critics, including think tank the New Economics Foundation say the impact on growth is exaggerated, arguing more capacity in the south of England might simply displace activity from other regions.",
      "Will a third runway at Heathrow help UK growth?",
      "What would the environmental impact be?",
      "Aviation is one source of damaging emissions that can contribute to climate change, and the industry is under pressure to find ways to reduce its impact.",
      "Reeves pointed to progress on creating sustainable fuels, and electric planes. A third runway at Heathrow would also mean \"that instead of circling London, flights can land\" she added, meaning less fuel is used.",
      "But it is far from clear that those technologies will be enough to make up for the growing demand for air travel. Heathrow will have to prove that its plan meets the governments net-zero by 2050 targets in any planning application.",
      "Last year the government's independent adviser on cutting emissions, the Climate Change Committee, warned that the UK should not go ahead with airport expansion without a framework in place to manage capacity across the country.",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Friends of the Earth has described the plan for a third runway as \"hugely irresponsible\".",
      "Alethea Warrington, head of aviation at climate charity Possible, said: \"This huge increase in emissions won't help our economy, and would just encourage the small group of frequent flyers who take most of the flights.\"",
      "What about Gatwick, Luton and London's other airports?",
      "Plans to expand London's other airports are already further along than Heathrow's and have in the past been viewed as an alternative to a third Heathrow runway.",
      "Work is set to start this year to expand capacity at Stansted's terminal.",
      "The government is due to make a decision on Gatwick airport by 27 February.",
      "Gatwick wants to increase its capacity to 75 million passengers per year, according to previously published plans. Pre-covid, its record was 47 million.",
      "Meanwhile, a decision on Luton airport's expansion, which includes plans for a new terminal, is due by 3 April.",
      "In total these expansions could create capacity for more than 60 million extra passengers by the 2040s.",

    "story": [
      "Many of us have prepared instructions and critical information for our family in the event of our sudden demise. For Daniel Stenberg, that includes passwords for his Google and GitHub accounts.",
      "That\u2019s because he\u2019s the founder of curl, an open source internet transfer engine that has been downloaded billions of times and is used to transfer data to and from computer servers.",
      "It was first released by Mr Stenberg in 1996 and is now used by millions every day.",
      "It's important that someone is able to maintain curl when he steps away.",
      "\u201cI just want to make sure that everything is there so the day I go away, someone can take over,\u201d Mr Stenberg says.",
      "It\u2019s a problem confronting many of the open source software pioneers who transformed the technology world in the 1990s and early 2000s.",
      "Their ethos was that anyone could contribute to the development of an open source application or operating system \u2013 and the software and underlying code could be used, modified, and distributed for free.",
      "The open source movement broke the stranglehold of big technology companies, spurred innovation and underpins much of today\u2019s technology landscape.",
      "In 1999, Loris Degioanni made his first contributions to an open source network analysis tool that eventually became Wireshark, as part of his master\u2019s thesis. \u201cMy concern was graduating,\u201d he says, not succession planning or the long-term future of the project.",
      "Almost 30 years on, Mr Degioanni is now CTO and founder of cybersecurity firm Sysdig, which is a key sponsor of Wireshark.",
      "\u201cWe're approaching the time when the founders of these early open source projects are starting to get old,\u201d he says.",
      "While projects do come and go, he explains, some remain relevant over the years, and founders and maintainers usually want to ensure they live on while there is demand. That\u2019s not just because they\u2019ve invested time in developing the code itself, but also because they have spawned communities, both virtual and in the real world.",
      "But while the likes of Mr Stenberg and Mr Degioanni can take action to ensure the keys to the kingdom are passed on, ensuring there is someone to pass them to can be a challenge.",
      "Many in the open source community worry there are not enough younger developers willing to get involved in contributing to or maintaining projects. This is often unpaid work after all.",
      "Even Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, the operating system which kick-started the open source revolution in the early 1990s, noted at the Open Source Summit Europe in September that the \u201ckernel maintainers are aging\u201d.",
      "Amanda Brock, CEO of OpenUK, a non-profit organization which represents the UK\u2019s open technology community, says younger developers might not appreciate the grip that closed software companies had in earlier decades.",
      "\u201cYou've got a next generation who haven't engaged as a philanthropic community and volunteer community in the same way, at the same scale.\u201d",
      "There are technology barriers to address too. Many key open source projects were originally written in C, a coding language first developed in the early 1970s.",
      "While C is still taught in universities, it is no longer widely used in the commercial world, Mr Degioanni explains. \u201cThe fact that C is the main language makes it harder to attract a younger generation.\u201d",
      "There are ways to work around this. Mr Degioanni says both Wireshark and a project he founded, Falco, rely on \u201cplug-ins\u201d, which can allow new functionality to be written in different languages.",
      "Mr Torvalds has given his blessing to the adoption of Rust as a programming language for Linux, while noting the \u201cRust versus C discussion has taken almost religious overtones in certain areas.\u201d",
      "When it comes to steering projects into the future, leaders and maintainers have the option of handing over control to foundations. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, for example, oversees 208 projects, with more than 250,000 contributors. Wireshark has its own independent foundation, with Mr Degioanni as a board member.",
      "Not everyone subscribes to the foundation model. Stenberg and his collaborators have kept curl completely independent. \u201cI'm much better off without being in their neighbourhoods and just running my own neighbourhood,\u201d he says.",
      "And foundations still face the issue of ensuring a steady supply of fresh developers to keep projects alive, he notes.",
      "Miss Brock says it\u2019s essential that the open source community consider how it encourages younger people to participate.",
      "This is about showing that while being a contributor can be challenging it\u2019s also career enhancing, giving young people an entry into established ecosystems and an opportunity to finesse and highlight their technical skills.",
      "\u201cIt's a way to help STEM talent flight,\u201d Miss Brock adds. \u201cBecause people can work from home in the UK or whatever country they\u2019re in.\u201d",
      "Degioanni is more sanguine. Even if there\u2019s \u201cprobably less visceral enthusiasm\u201d for the concept of open source, he says, the fundamental idea of being able to modify software is now a given.",
      "And, he continues, \u201cI've worked with open source my whole life. I've created my own projects. I've seen people join the projects that I created. I've seen people start their own open source projects.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, he says, there is a \u201cjoy, especially for a young person\u201d in creating software, seeing it being used and sparking a community.",

      "After sailing for two hours we stepped ashore at a remote valley beneath Nalunaq mountain, where the firm is drilling for gold.",
      "It's also scouring the surrounding mountain range and valleys, hunting for other valuable minerals, having snapped up exploration licences spanning over 10,000 sq km (3,861 sq miles).",
      "\"We're looking for copper, nickel, and rare earths,\" says the Icelandic boss. \"This is uncharted, and still has the potential to have multiple big deposits.\"",
      "The base camp is a cluster of mobile buildings and bright orange accommodation tents housing more than 100 staff, including Greenlanders, Australians, and British former coal miners. From there a road climbs up the valley, and we drive by car into the gold mine, following a dark tunnel upwards inside the mountain.",

      "Amaroq is confident that the mine will now be profitable. And it plans to ramp up production this year, where it has built a brand new processing plant to crush the ore and refine the precious metal into gold bars.",
      "\"We can either walk off site every month with a suitcase of gold, versus a 30,000 tonne ship [carrying the ore],\" explains Mr Olafsson.",
      "He says that Greenland presents an unrivalled opportunity because its huge mineral reserves are largely untouched.",
      "\"It can be the supplier of all the minerals the Western world will need for decades,\" adds Mr Olafsson. \"And that is a very unique position.\"",
      "Yet currently there are just two active mines on the entire island.",
      "Greenland is a self-governing territory that is part of Denmark, but controls its own natural resources.",
      "It's endowed with the eighth largest reserves of so-called rare earth elements, which are vital for making everything from mobile phones to batteries and electric motors. It also has large amounts of other key metals, such as lithium and cobalt.",
      "There is oil and gas too, but new drilling is banned, while deep-sea mining has also been ruled out.",

      "Permits have now been given for 100 blocs across Greenland, where companies are searching for viable deposits. British, Canadian and Australian mining firms are the biggest foreign licence holders, while Americans hold just one.",
      "But there are many more steps before these sites become potential mines.",
      "Yet while Greenland may be sitting on mineral riches, any \"gold rush\" continues to be slow to materialise.",
      "The economy, which has an annual GDP of just over $3bn (\u00a32.4bn), is still driven by the public sector and fishing. And the territory also relies on an annual $600m subsidy from Denmark.",
      "Greenland's politicians hope that mining revenues will reduce reliance on the annual $600m subsidy from Denmark, and help boost independence efforts. But in the meantime Greenland is making more money from tourism.",
      "Officially mining is still important for independence, says Javier Arnaut, head of Arctic Social Sciences at Greenland University. \"But in practical terms, you can see that there are very few mining licenses awarded.\"",

      "However mining is not easy in Greenland because of its remote geography and weather. It's the world's largest island and 80% of it is covered by an ice sheet. It has rugged mountains and no roads between settlements.",
      "\"It's an arctic terrain,\" says Jakob Kl\u00f8ve Keiding, from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, which has mapped the territory's deposits. \"We have problems with harsh conditions in terms of the climate and limited infrastructure. So it's quite expensive to open a mine.\"",
      "Those high costs, coupled with low global metal prices, have held back investors.",
      "Others blame red tape for the sector's slow growth. The territory has strict environmental regulations and social impact requirements, and getting permits can take time.",
      "Ms Nathanielsen maintains that most communities do support mining, and that it boosts local economies. \"They [overseas miners] are shopping in the local shop. They're employing local employees. They're chartering a local boat or helicopter,\" she says.",
      "Yet in the south's biggest town, Qaqortoq, resident Heidi Mortensen M\u00f8ller is sceptical whether new mines will lead to employment for locals. \"When they say they're going to add jobs, who are they talking about?\"",
      "Jess Berthelsen, head of local labour union, SIK, says that many people think mining income \"will leave the country\", and not benefit Greenland. But he supports the growth of the sector. \"Greenland needs more income and to earn money from other ways than fishing.\"",
      "It's unclear how Trump's latest gambit on Greenland will play out. However, the territory's prime minister Mute Egede said earlier this month that \"we need to do business with the US\" and that it was \"doors open in terms of mining\".",
      "Mr Kjeldsen from the business association, hopes it will be bring \"much needed investment\" to the sector. \"On the other hand, if the uncertainty surrounding the signals from Trump drag on for a longer period, there is a risk that this might impact the investment environment negatively.\"",

      "\"There would likely be outrage about these wines in France, and that would be a good thing,\" he says. \"Sometimes you need to be provocative to drive change.\"",
      "The two bottles in question, one white and one red, would be illegal in France because they are made from a blend of French and Australian base wines.",
      "Under both French and European Union law it is forbidden to make a wine that combines EU and non-EU fruit. In France in particular, authorities take such things very seriously.",
      "The French wine industry has a celebrated word called \"terroir\", which applies to all the environmental factors that affect vines growing in a vineyard, such as the soil, the climate, and the elevation. As a result, wines from a specific place are held in the highest esteem.",
      "Add a strict appellation or classification system for France's wine regions, and the thought of blending French and Australian wine to create a global hybrid would horrify many French wine lovers.",
      "Yet Maxime has done just this, and it is all thanks to one word - Brexit.",
      "For while he cannot sell the two wines in the EU, he can do so in the UK now that London no longer has to follow food and drink rules set by Brussels.",
      "Maxime has created the wines in partnership with UK online retailer The Wine Society, where they are called Hemispheres Red and Hemispheres White. The red is made from syrah grapes, or shiraz as they are called in Australia, while the white is a blend of marsanne and viognier varieties.",
      "The Australian red and white wine components are shipped in bulk to the UK, where they are blended with wine from France's northern Rhone and Roussillon regions before bottling.",
      "Maxime who works for his family's celebrated Rhone-based wine company Chapoutier, say that while he respects France's focus on terroir, there should be room for global blends to also be sold.",
      "\"Chapoutier has been making wine for more than 200 years, very terroir driven, and biodynamic,\" he says. \"But more and more people are turning their back on French wines because they don't understand the complicated appellation rules.",
      "\"We need to adapt for consumers and make wines more accessible, which international blends can help to do. Maybe the EU law will change. It is also more ecological to ship wine from Australia to Europe in bulk, as you don't have the weight of all the glass bottles.\"",
      "Another wine company now making wines by combining grapes from two continents is Australian firm Penfolds. It sells reds made from both Australian and Californian grapes, and others that mix Australian and French. Again they cannot be sold in the EU, but they can in the UK, US, Australia and elsewhere.",
      "Penfolds refers to these blends as \"wine of the world\", and says that they \"possess an otherness that can best be described as worldly\". Whatever that is supposed to mean.",
      "Unsurprisingly, some more traditional winemakers are not in favour of this development. One such person is Jas Swan, an independent winemaker based in Germany.",
      "While the two-continent blends from Chapoutier and Penfolds are made with care from quality grapes, and priced accordingly, she is fearful that if the trend grows it will mean a lot more cheap, low-grade wine going on sale.",
      "\"I believe that those types of wine would have nothing left of any terroir, even before they left their continent,\" she says. \"Those wines would have seen only machine work, heavy additions to keep them clean, and are manufactured to be easy to drink for the masses.",
      "\"Why can consumers not be more demanding? The consumerism is insane.\"",
      "Peter Richards, who holds the top global wine industry qualification, the master of wine (MW), is also sniffy. \"The notion of cross-country blending for wine isn't something I find outrageous in itself,\" he says. \"My concern is more that this is about creating novelty for novelty's sake.\"",
      "His wife, Susie Barrie, who is also an MW, adds: \"I remain to be convinced that a wine made by blending grapes from different countries can be great in terms of taste.\"",
      "By contrast, wine writer Jamie Goode says that development of two-continent wine \"is actually quite a fun idea\".",
      "\"If the wines are good, and made well from good vineyard sites - and not simply a gimmick blending together cheap bulk wines and then slapping a huge margin on the wine - then this is quite interesting.",
      "\"The fundamental basis for fine wine is the notion of terroir - that wines come from a place, and their flavour expresses this place in unique ways. But not all wines have to be terroir wines, and there's room for wines like this.",
      "\"In some ways, there's a lot of skill required to blend the right wines together to create something interesting coming from such different places.\"",
      "Pierre Mansour, head of buying for The Wine Society, says he and his colleagues came up with the idea of creating two wines made from grapes from different continents as part of the company's 150th birthday celebrations.",
      "\"We were thinking about the future of wine, and we wanted to do something innovative. In the end we thought that one area of innovation is blending, of creating a wine that can mitigate for the impact of climate change on a particular country.",
      "\"And from a carbon footprint out of view, it is more environmentally friendly to ship wine in bulk from Australia to the UK. But at the same time we did expect 'terroirists' to say 'hold on this is fundamentally against the French principle of wine'.",
      "\"So we approached Chapoutier, thinking that they might say 'are you mad, how dare you insult us', but they were great. They were really enthusiastic.\""

      "Dual celebrations are happening for Britain's oldest teacher this month - not only is he marking his 90th birthday, but also the impact he has had on dyslexia education over six decades.",
      "Dr Neville Brown founded Maple Hayes Hall School for Dyslexia in Lichfield, Staffordshire, more than 40 years ago.",
      "Pupils that were once unable to write their names have gone on to get a minimum of seven GCSEs, university degrees, and become high-achieving professionals.",
      "\"I see every child still for assessment before they come here, before they do their week in a class,\" Dr Brown said.",
      "\"The parents are sitting there watching what goes on. You can see the wonder on the parent's face but you can see the pleasure on the child's face.",
      "\"They change during the teaching session.\"",
      "Dyslexia affects about one in 10 schoolchildren and leads to struggles with reading and spelling that often do not reflect a child's true intelligence.",
      "The school, which Dr Brown remains co-principal of, has a mission to provide supportive, tailored education for children with dyslexia.",
      "The passion for helping teach literacy in children with dyslexia runs in the family.",
      "Dr Daryl Brown is Neville's son and the school's other co-principal.",
      "Pupils are taught using a system called the morphological approach, which uses a series of icons to make a visual link between meaning and spelling, instead of students being taught using phonics.",
      "For example, for a word in the past tense, they draw a backwards clock. For a verb - or \"doing word\" - they draw a spring.",
      "\"It works as a visual token to remind us that, that word with -ed on the end, no matter how you're going to say it, puts that word into the past tense,\" Daryl said.",
      "\"And that's the way we teach our pupils, meaning and spelling first, how you're going to say it, that comes afterwards because it varies so much.\"",
      "One student said: \"My old school tried everything, they gave me special glasses, gave me blue paper, but nothing seemed to work, but I've really grasped the icons system here.",
      "\"I felt like a lab rat really, everything chucked at me, so it wasn't very nice, but everyone here has got the same thing so you just feel at ease.\"",
      "Another said at her old school she would see friends \"being congratulated and being praised for their achievements and I just wouldn't be\".",
      "\"It was like being the odd duck, it wasn't very nice,\" she said.",
      "Despite turning 90, Dr Brown has no intentions of slowing down.",
      "When asked how he felt about having helped hundreds of children over the years made him feel, he replied with one word.",

    "story": [
      "A couple said they decided to document their journey to have a child via a surrogate after feeling there was \"no information\" available about the process.",
      "Kevin Pittuck-Bennett, 46, and his husband Michael, 38, from Chelmsford, had their two-month-old daughter, Peggy, in 2024 via surrogacy, which is when a woman carries a pregnancy for another couple or individual.",
      "In the UK commercial surrogacy is illegal and a third party cannot profit from matching people, but it is not illegal for a surrogate to be paid expenses.",
      "Mr Pittuck-Bennett, who works in advertising, made videos throughout the process with Michael, who is a hairstylist, to help others navigate surrogacy with \"less complications\".",
      "\"It's a humbling process,\" Mr Pittuck-Bennett said, \"there are all sorts of emotions that we weren't prepared for.\"",
      "Surrogacy laws have been in place in the UK since 1985.",
      "The law states a surrogate is deemed the legal mother when the baby is born - irrespective of genetics or any agreements that have been made.",
      "A parental order must be made to transfer legal parentage to the intended or biological parents.",
      "Parental orders in England and Wales rose from 117 in 2011 to 413 in 2020.",
      "In 2021 statistics showed that two-thirds of applicants for parental orders are now mixed-sex couples often in their 30s or 40s.",
      "Kevin and Michael started the process of having a family via surrogacy in 2021, but quickly realised there was a lack of information available.",
      "Sarah Jones, the chief executive officer at Surrogacy UK, said: \"The UK surrogacy community in the UK is really unique in the fact that we operate altruistically, so nobody is allowed to make profit, nobody is allowed to financially profit from surrogacy in the UK.\"",
      "Kevin and Michael said they have kept in touch with their surrogate two months after the birth of their daughter.",
      "Mr Pittuck-Bennett said :  \"The whole ethos of surrogacy is friendship first. She is going to be a part of our lives forever. She's definitely a special auntie. We do feel we are bonded for life.",
      "\"You've got an element of guilt because someone is doing this for you and they don't have to. Then you've got the worry because they're ill and the potential baby could be unwell,\" Mr Pittuck-Bennett added.",
      "\"I buried my head in the sand because we could only deal with so much. When we weren't talking to our lovely surrogate, we were doing life as normal.",
      "\"We learnt that you don't have much control over the process. The power is with the surrogate and you hope that they choose you.",

      "Mr Pittuck-Bennett  documented the couple's journey chronologically on YouTube, to provide information for others.",
      "\"I'm not a professional expert, but I've lived it and done it.",
      "\"Hopefully it will help same-sex and straight couples figure out the rules and navigate the process.\"",
      "Ms Jones said: \"The laws around surrogacy are really straightforward, it is really hard to find that information because I think everything is geared up towards US surrogacy and the commercial model.",

Her penultimate album, 2018's Negative Capabilty, was a meditation on ageing, loneliness and grief \u2013 inspired partly by the death of her old friend, and fellow Rolling Stones' paramour Anita Pallenberg; and partly by the terror attacks on the Bataclan nightclub in her adopted home of Paris.",

    "story": [
      "The BBC has apologised to staff who felt they could not speak up with concerns about Russell Brand's behaviour because he was seen as \"too influential\" and they felt he \"would always get his way and therefore they stayed silent\".",
      "The apology came as the BBC published the findings of an internal review into Brand's time as a presenter for BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music between 2006 and 2008.",
      "The investigation considered eight complaints, two of which were made while he worked for the corporation.",
      "One of those, which related to him urinating into a cup and behaving aggressively during his Radio 2 show, was registered formally at the time, and the BBC has now admitted it was \"not dealt with effectively\".",
      "The BBC launched the investigation after separate allegations in 2023 from several women who accused the 49-year-old actor and comedian of rape, sexual assaults and emotional abuse.",
      "Brand has denied all allegations and said his relationships were \"always consensual\".",
      "'Stayed silent'",
      "Thursday's report found that \"only one formal complaint was made about Brand's inappropriate conduct in the workplace\" during his stint on air, and beyond that there was \"no evidence that his behaviour was raised with management formally at the time\".",
      "But the BBC acknowledged that Brand was \"perceived to be too influential\" for staff to complain about.",
      "Many of those interviewed for the internal investigation \"believed, rightly or wrongly, that Russell Brand would always get his way and therefore they stayed silent\", the report said. They also believed he \"had the support of the station management\".",
      "While one informal complaint was also made, the report said \"it is clear that there were other concerns but those involved felt unable or unwilling to raise these at the time as they felt the concerns would not be taken seriously and the systems for making complaints were not as clear as they are now\".",
      "Competition winner",
      "Commenting on the report, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said the complaints were \"horrendous\".",
      "\"As is the fact that staff felt unable to raise concerns because they did not think that they would be believed or taken seriously,\" she said.",
      "She added that the BBC must \"take action to reassure its staff and the wider public that it takes these issues seriously\".",
      "\"For too long, there has been a culture of silence in the media industry where inappropriate behaviour like Brand's has been tolerated or downplayed. Power imbalances and a perception that certain stars cannot be challenged are sadly not unique to this case.\"",
      "The review also found that Brand had consensual sex with a competition winner from his 6 Music show on BBC premises.",
      "Speaking to the review team, that person said that while what happened was consensual, they now felt \"Brand had abused his position and taken advantage of them\".",
      "The report added that there were \"management failings\" and \"there should have been better systems in place to ensure that Brand's unacceptable behaviour was promptly picked up and addressed\".",
      "Channel 4, where Brand also worked as a presenter, released its own internal review findings in March 2024. Its boss apologised to a former employee after the probe found it had not investigated a \"serious\" complaint made against the star in 2009.",
      "Brand has been interviewed three times by police since September 2023.",
      "In November 2024, the Metropolitan Police sent the Crown Prosecution Service a file of evidence, but prosecutors have not yet decided whether to bring charges.",
      "'Not taken seriously'",
      "A BBC employee made a formal complaint to a manager in 2007 after Brand urinated into a cup in the Radio 2 studio, and then threw objects in anger when one of the production team made a mistake during a second show.",
      "The report said it was likely that this was then raised verbally with the Radio 2 controller at the time, Lesley Douglas, although she does \"not recall these concerns ever being raised with her\".",
      "Douglas denied that Brand ever sought to exercise any influence over her, and said her relationship with him similar to that she had with other presenters on the station.",
      "The BBC made light of the 2007 incident in a press response at the time, the report said, when a spokesperson told the Independent that Brand had urinated in a cup \"and someone has shown him where the toilet is\".",
      "\"Regrettably this incident was not taken seriously at this time,\" the report said.",
      "Another staff member said they had raised concerns informally about Brand's conduct in 2006 and 2007, the report said.",
      "Someone else alleged that Brand \"tucked his fingers down their trousers and underwear and pulled them towards him\" in a corridor while on set of a BBC radio production, but did not complain at the time.",
      "Staff members who were \"most closely\" involved in his shows described his behaviour in general as \"promiscuous or out-of-control\", but said they did not \"witness anything non-consensual or potentially illegal\".",
      "'Inadequate' complaint handling",
      "Another complaint was made to the BBC about an incident in Los Angeles in 2008.",
      "Brand is alleged to have followed \"Olivia\" into a bathroom and shown his penis to her moments before he began pre-recording his radio show.",
      "The woman, who was not a BBC employee but worked in the same building, did not complain at the time, thinking \"she would not be believed\".",
      "The report found no evidence of anyone in BBC management being aware of Olivia's experience at the time.",
      "In 2019, a BBC News staff member raised the incident with their line manager after Olivia confirmed she wanted to take the matter further.",
      "\"It is likely those involved in escalating the complaint in 2019 felt that there was nothing that could be done as it was over ten years later,\" the report said.",
      "It concluded that the complaint process was \"inadequate\", as was the handling of the 2019 complaint, and the BBC has apologised to Olivia.",
      "Another of the complaints in the report was made by a woman named Alice, who said a car provided by the BBC for Brand collected her and took her to his house when he was in his 30s and she was a 16-year-old schoolgirl.",
      "The report concluded that it was not able to verify these claims but it was \"unlikely that the cars described by Alice were chauffeur-driven BBC cars or BBC management cars\".",
      "The report, and Alice, agree that if Brand did \"persuade a taxi or mini-cab pre-booked on his behalf by the BBC to make these journeys, it's likely to have been done without the knowledge of the BBC staff who booked his cars for him in advance\".",
      "The review cost \u00a3662,062 and was conducted by the BBC's director of editorial complaints and reviews, Peter Johnston.",

      "Her whisky-soaked voice, turned cracked and dusky, conveyed the inner torments of her painful life-experiences.",
      "Marianne Evelyn Gabriel Faithfull was born in Hampstead on 29 December 1946.",
      "Her mother was Baroness Eva Sacher-Masoch, a Hungarian, half-Jewish former ballet dancer who had fled the Nazis in World War II.",
      "Her father was Major Glyn Faithfull, an eccentric British MI6 agent turned professor of Italian literature.",
      "The stage was set for an unusual childhood.",
      "Marianne spent her early years at Braziers Park, an upmarket commune founded by her father in an Oxfordshire country house.",
      "In her autobiography, she described it as a \"mixture of high utopian thoughts and randy sex\".",
      "After divorcing, Lady Sacher-Masoch spirited her six-year-old daughter to a terraced house in Reading, discouraging further contact with Major Faithfull.",
      "According to Marianne, she was raised like \"one of her mother's cats\".",
      "She had regular bouts of tuberculosis and was sent to St Joseph's Roman Catholic boarding school, despite her father's complaints that the nuns would \"give her a problem with sex for the rest of her life\".",
      "While still at school, Marianne began singing folk songs a cappella in Reading coffee-houses - and, before long, her exquisite looks and obvious talent saw her sucked into the vortex of Swinging 60s London.",
      "In 1964, she attended a Rolling Stones launch party, on the arm of British artist John Dunbar, and was spotted by the flamboyant record producer Andrew Loog Oldham.",
      "Famously, he described her as an \"angel\" with impressive vital statistics.",
      "Oldham was the Rolling Stones' manager and felt he could package his new discovery as a pop star.",
      "She would, he thought, be a useful vehicle for songs that weren't quite a fit for his more important act.",
      "The Rolling Stones were a rhythm and blues band. When singer Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards wrote a gentle ballad, When Tears Go By, they dismissed it as a \"piece of tripe\".",
      "So Oldham gave it to Marianne Faithfull.",
      "The song had not been written for her but, she said, \"fitted me so perfectly it might as well had been\".",
      "The melancholy classic, sung in her detached, wintry voice, reached the UK Top 10.",

      "Inspired by her doe-eyed looks, the American singer-songwriter wrote her a poem - but tore it up when she turned him down.",
      "In 1965, she married John Dunbar and gave birth to their son. Soon afterwards, she left the family home and moved in with Mick Jagger.",

      "As one of the faces of the 1960s, Faithfull carved out a side-career as an actor.",
      "She appeared at London's Royal Court in an adaptation of Chekhov's Three Sisters, alongside Glenda Jackson.",
      "She became the first person ever to utter the F-word in a mainstream film, I'll Never Forget What'sisname, in 1967.",
      "A year later, she starred opposite Alain Delon, as a doomed, leather-clad beauty in The Girl on a Motorcycle.",
      "Her character's psychedelic and erotic fantasies saw the film win the first ever X-rating in the United States.",
      "Of course, there were a lot of drugs.",
      "During a police raid on Keith Richards' house in Sussex, Faithfull was discovered naked, draped in a fur rug - which she took indecent pleasure in occasionally letting slip.",

      "She looked back on these years in a BBC interview in 2002, describing her addiction as a kind of brutal therapy.",
      "\"I was in agony and I healed myself as best I could,\" she said. \"One of the ways was with drugs, because they are painkillers.",

      "The album's final track, Why'd Ya Do It?, is the rasping rant of a woman reacting to a man's infidelity - set to a riff inspired by Jimi Hendrix.",
      "It was a moment of metamorphosis: the Rolling Stone party-girl had become a gravel-voiced, truth-telling sophisticate.",
      "The album's critical success was not matched commercially. It did well in France and Germany but reached just number 57 in the UK charts.",
      "But it did earn Faithfull a Grammy nomination in 1981, for best female rock vocal performance.",
      "She moved to America, where Island Records put her into rehab.",
      "Still suffering from alcohol and drug addiction, she had a string of mishaps - including breaking her jaw on the stairs. On one occasion, her heart actually stopped.",
      "But she held it together, and released more than a dozen albums over the next three decades.",
      "She also wrote an autobiography, Faithfull - looking back on the 1960s and 70s with a notable absence of self-pity.",
      "Constantly worried about money, she auctioned off much of her 1960s memorabilia in 2024 - saying that she preferred gardening to looking back.",
      "Now in her late 70s, she had inherited her mother's ancient title and - technically a baroness - was living in Paris.",
      "In the last decade of her life, Faithfull had to cancel concert tours after being diagnosed first with breast cancer and then hepatitis C.",
      "She was also troubled by the complications of a broken back and hip, and thought she would never sing again after weeks in hospital with the coronavirus.",
      "But she never quite lost the creative spark.",
      "In recent years, she published a record that put the words of Keats and Wordsworth to music.",
      "And Negative Capability, her 21st album, was described by the Guardian as a \"masterly mediation on ageing and death\".",
      "It was notable for They Come at Night, her furious response to the Bataclan terror in Paris.",
      "\"They come at night,\" she sang, \"and the world goes blind with fear. Terror in Paris, the future is here.\"",
      "It also dealt with Faithfull's own increasing frailty and loneliness, as well as the loss of close friends, including fellow Rolling Stones muse Anita Pallenberg.",
      "\"I know I'm not young and I'm damaged,\" she wrote defiantly. \"But I'm still pretty kind of funny.\"",
      "Marianne Faithfull will in part be remembered for being Mick Jagger's girlfriend and surviving the horrors of drink and drug addiction.",
      "But her resurrection proved - if proof were needed - a rock star's muse can become a fully fledged, respected artist in her own right.",

      "Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy has been billed as the fourth and final film in the series - but its star Ren\u00e9e Zellweger says she has her \"fingers crossed\" that is not the case.",
      "Zellweger has played our favourite hapless heroine for more than 20 years and seems as attached to her as ever, calling the character an \"old friend\".",
      "Speaking at the film's premiere in London's Leicester Square on Wednesday evening, the actress says she is \"in denial\" and \"it hasn't sunk in yet\" that the franchise may be coming to a close.",
      "\"Let me live in denial for a little longer\", she laughs.",
      "Yet, while there are no plans to take the Bridget Jones story any further, author Helen Fielding is not completely ruling out the prospect.",
      "The new film sees Bridget living as a widow, becoming a single mother and tackling modern dating.",
      "The story is partially inspired by Fielding's own loss. Her husband, Kevin Curran, died in 2016.",
      "Zellweger says the film is a \"beautiful story and really the most personal for Helen. She is sharing about her own experiences about loss, grief and finding new happiness, it's a pretty special one\".",
      "She adds she has always felt \"really, really lucky to get the part\" and \"was just trying not to get fired\".",

      "On whether he has had any clumsy Bridget Jones moments himself, Woodhall says \"he falls over quite a lot\".",
      "Ejiofor, who is mainly known for grittier roles in films like 12 Years a Slave and American Gangster says the film is a \"different speed\" to his usual projects.",
      "But adds it was lovely to film: \"Even the set is so warm, everyone is so excited about telling the story\".",
      "Gen Z appeal",
      "For Fielding the success of Bridget Jones lies in its \"emotionally honesty\".",
      "\"When I first wrote Bridget it was an anonymous column in the Independent which I thought would be stopped after six weeks for being too silly,\" she says.",
      "\"That freed me up to be honest in a way I could never have been otherwise and I think that's what people related to.",
      "\"I thought I was the only person who felt like that and it turns out for a lot of people there is a huge gap between how you feel you are supposed to be and how you really are.\"",
      "Bridget was a character created in the 1990s and Fielding says she is \"really touched\" that Gen Z have also embraced her.",
      "\"When I do a signing half the audience are Gen Z's. They're the first generation who have lived through a world crisis for ages. They're very similar to Bridget in their emotional fragility, their ability to share and cry on TikTok.",

    "story": [
      "Pop star Rihanna was in a Los Angeles courtroom on Wednesday as her partner, rapper A$AP Rocky, continued his trial on assault charges.",
      "The singer, who shares two children with the rapper, sat in the court with A$AP Rocky's family as the trial delved into allegations that he pulled a gun out on his former friend and opened fire multiple times.",
      "The trial started on Friday and will determine whether the rapper will face penalties on two charges of felony assault. He could face decades in prison.",
      "A$AP Rocky has pleaded not guilty to the charges and his lawyers have argued the weapon was a prop gun and his former friend is only after money.",
      "Here's what you need to know about the case.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky charged with?",
      "A$AP Rocky's assault trial began on 24 January in Los Angeles.",
      "The rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was charged with two felony assault charges relating to a 2021 shooting incident in Hollywood.",
      "Authorities allege A$AP Rocky and a former friend got into a heated discussion that turned violent and led to the rapper pulling out a gun and opening fire.",
      "Who is the accuser Terell Ephron?",
      "The victim in the case is fellow artist and childhood friend Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli. He is the star witness for prosecutors",
      "They were both part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective and have known one another since their time together at a New York high school.",
      "Their relationship eroded over time as A$AP Rocky's career took off and he became famous.",
      "It all led up to a disagreement between the pair in November 2021.",
      "Mr Ephron took the stand this week to describe their relationship and the moments of the alleged shooting.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky accused of doing?",
      "Authorities have said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November in 2021, a day after the pair got into a disagreement.",
      "They met outside a Hollywood hotel about a block from the iconic Hollywood Walk of Fame.",
      "Prosecutors say when the pair met things got physical. Mr Mayers is then alleged to have whipped out a gun from his waistband and pointed it toward Mr Ephron, telling him \"I'll kill you right now\".",
      "Court documents outline that Mr Ephron told the rapper to fire the weapon, which Mr Mayers did not and instead started walking away.",
      "Mr Ephron followed behind and yelled at Mr Mayers about their disagreements, court documents show.",
      "That's when prosecutors allege Mr Mayers pulled out the gun again and opened fire.",
      "Court documents allege multiple bullets were fired, one of which is alleged to have grazed Mr Ephron's knuckles.",
      "Authorities say parts of the incident were captured on surveillance footage, including some footage that included audio of gunfire, although there is no video showing the shooting.",
      "Some of this footage has been played in court already for jurors.",
      "What is A$AP Rocky saying about the allegations?",
      "There are several key points of contention in the case: the weapon, police investigation and Mr Ephron's injuries.",
      "The rapper's lawyers have noted the weapon authorities say was the gun he pulled out was not usable - instead it was a prop weapon his security encouraged him to carry to ward off would-be attackers.",
      "His lawyers have also focused on Mr Ephron taking multiple days to report the incident to police, and how authorities found no trace of bullet casings or a shooting when they responded to the incident.",
      "Court documents detail that Mr Ephron returned to the scene later and gathered two shell casings he said he found in the area. He brought them when he reported the incident to police two days later.",
      "He also did not immediately go to hospital after the incident and instead sought medical treatment after flying back to New York.",
      "Could A$AP Rocky face prison time?",
      "Yes, the rapper could face up to 24 years in prison if found guilty in the trial, which is expected to go on for about three weeks.",
      "A panel of 12 jurors will decide his fate.",
      "Will Rihanna appear in court again?",
      "It's unclear if Rihanna will continue appearing for the trial. Before the proceedings started, the rapper's lawyer had told the court this week that Mr Mayers has tried to keep his family away from all of this.",
      "Media reports indicate that on Wednesday she sat between the rapper's mother and sister in the courtroom. The couple's two children did not appear.",
      "Rihanna's presence sparked intense media and fan interest outside the courthouse, but she entered through a non-public entrance used by judges, and was already seated in the courtroom when media were allowed into the chamber.",
      "During jury selection, prosecutors questioned jurors about Rihanna and whether her connection to the case would affect their ability to deliver a fair verdict. While some described themselves as Rihanna fans, and many more had heard of Rihanna than A$AP Rocky, jurors said her presence in the courtroom would not influence their decision making.",
      "Rihanna's presence did attract attention from jurors in a murder trial across the hall at the courthouse, with some commenting on her being so nearby.",
      "Rocky's trial is being televised, but Rihanna sat out of view of the cameras in the courtroom.",

      "And Ubisoft's accessibility wins come just days after it announced the closure of its Leamington Spa studio and staff reductions at other international offices, totalling 185 job losses.",
      "Late last year the company also said it had disbanded the team behind award winner The Lost Crown after reports suggested it did not hit sales targets.",
      "The publisher, which employs an estimated 13,500 people worldwide, has also delayed the upcoming game in its flagship Assassin's Creed series twice.",

      "The actor, 52, has spent the last year making a documentary for the BBC about solutions to knife crime, during which he met victims' families, police officers and teenage offenders.",
      "In addition to early intervention, he told the BBC that ninja swords should be banned and even suggested domestic knives could be made less dangerous.",
      "\"Not all kitchen knives need to have a point on them, that sounds like a crazy thing to say,\" he adds, \"but you can still cut your food without the point on your knife, which is an innovative way to look at it.\"",

      "He grew up in a violent home and had been badly bullied at school for having dandruff.",
      "\"I looked around and saw that the only people who ain't getting bullied are the people who are this certain way,\" the teenager tells Elba, \"so I felt the need to become that person.\"",
      "Asked by Elba how that made him feel, the boy says: \"When I had a knife I felt like I could do anything, like I was a god \u2013 nobody could touch me.",

      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said last week, following the sentencing of the teenager who murdered three young girls in Southport, that the government would bring in tougher checks for people trying to buy knives online.",
      "Elba believes more attention needs to be paid to children in their pre and early teens, with disciplinary action like school exclusions, used as an opportunity to intervene in a young person's life.",
      "\"When a young child is excluded, they're more likely to go towards a dark place,\" he says, but adds: \"There are indicators of hope. There are intervention schemes that are really working and that no-one really knows about.\"",

      "They identify teenagers who might commit or become a victim of knife crime and intervene before a stabbing takes place.",
      "They then find education and career opportunities that suit each individual.",

    "story": [
      "One word keeps cropping up during our interview with Glasgow four-piece Mogwai \u2013 and that word is \"weird\".",
      "It was \"psychedelically weird\" when their last album, As The Love Continues, unexpectedly went to number one in 2021.",
      "The achievement was made \"even weirder\" by the fact it happened during the pandemic, \"so we couldn't even go to the pub to talk about how weird it was\", says frontman Stuart Braithwaite.",
      "The success took them all the way to the Mercury Prize gala (\"such a weird ceremony\"), but they didn't let it influence their new album, The Bad Fire.",
      "In fact, they completely forgot to mention the chart achievement to their new producer, John Congleton (St Vincent, The Killers, Blondie, Modest Mouse).",
      "He only found out when a French journalist brought it up in an interview.",
      "\"He was like, 'Wait, your last album went to number one?' And we were like, 'Yeah'.",
      "\"And he was like, 'Wow, that's weird'.\"",
      "To be fair, he was right.",
      "Mogwai are not a band who ever seemed destined for global domination.",
      "Formed by longtime friends who wanted to create \"serious guitar music\", the quartet specialise in long, mesmerising instrumentals, riddled with creeping anxiety and devastating pay-offs.",
      "Their journey to number one took 25 years, aided by chart rules that place higher value on physical record sales over streams when calculating rankings.",
      "Mogwai - a cult band with a fanbase that prizes vinyl \u2013 found the scales tipped in their favour. For one glorious week, they outsold Dua Lipa and Harry Styles.",
      "\"It was a huge surprise,\" Braithwaite reiterates.",
      "\"We want our music to do as well as it can, but we're not uber-ambitious. We're not like Queen, plotting world domination.\"",
      "But even if the band had been inclined to capitalise on their success, fate was conspiring against them.",
      "As they prepared to record the follow-up to As The Love Continues, keyboardist Barry Burns received the news every parent dreads: His daughter might die.",
      "Doctors had diagnosed her with aplastic anaemia, also known as bone marrow failure, where the body stops producing enough blood cells.",
      "\"She had blood coming out of her gums and bruises all over,\" he recalls. \"It was extremely stressful.\"",
      "The condition is exceptionally rare, with only 30 to 40 children diagnosed in the UK per year, but Burns had first-hand experience of how serious it could be.",
      "\"The weird thing was that my neighbour when I was a kid had it and, sadly, she died,\" he says.",
      "\"So obviously, I really panicked because I thought I knew the outcome \u2013 but thankfully the treatment is completely different now.\"",
      "After a bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy, his daughter recovered.",
      "\"She's going to be fine, but I've had an awful two years.\"",
      "Opaque and impressionistic",
      "It wasn't the only trauma the band experienced while making the record.",
      "Live agent Mick Griffiths, who had worked with them since the start of their career, died of cancer, while bassist Dominic Aitchison lost his father.",
      "Even Braithwaite's pet dog, Prince, had problems that caused turmoil. \"He got cancer and had to have his leg amputated two weeks before we started recording,\" he recalls.",
      "Appropriately enough, the album's title, The Bad Fire, is a Glaswegian term for hell. But anyone expecting an outpouring of grief or a reckoning with mortality is in for disappointment.",
      "\"If anything weighty happens in my life, the last thing I want to do is write a song about it,\" Braithwaite told The Herald newspaper in 2003, an ethos that holds true today.",
      "Largely instrumental, their songs are deliberately left open to interpretation. The band christen their compositions with nonsense titles and in-jokes (You're Lionel Richie, Secret Pint, Simon Ferocious) to avoid the imposition of meaning.",
      "The new album continues that tradition, with deliciously-titled tracks like Pale Vegan Hip Pain and Fanzine Made Of Flesh (although Lion Rumpus may be the most self-descriptive entry in the band's discography).",
      "When lyrics appear, they're opaque and impressionistic. The only hint of the turbulence Mogwai experienced comes on the groggy, distortion-washed 18 Volcanoes, where Braithwaite quietly sings: \"Hope has come another day/Hold me close in every way.\"",
      "\"Some journalists in France said the album was really cathartic, and I can kind of see that,\" he says. \"But I don't think its maudlin at all.",
      "\"It's vaguely upbeat, by our standards.\"",
      "Released last Friday, The Bad Fire is heading for the top five of the UK albums chart amid stiff competition from Central Cee and Teddy Swims.",
      "Again, physical sales will give The Bad Fire an advantage over streaming hits, a situation Braithwaite is pretty happy about.",
      "\"The streaming world is very murky and hard to understand,\" he says.",
      "\"It does make a lot of money, but it makes a lot of money for old music and artists with popular back catalogues, and I think that's really discouraged a lot of big labels from investing in new music.\"",
      "He adds that Spotify is filled with \"fake bands making generic music\" for its curated playlists, especially in genres like chill-out, lo-fi and relaxation.",
      "It's an accusation that's been repeatedly levelled against the streaming service, and which it has called \"categorically untrue\". But Braithwaite is sceptical.",
      "\"You absolutely know that if anyone's going to be making generic AI music, it's going to be the streaming services, just so they don't have to pay humans.\"",
      "Streaming isn't entirely bad for Mogwai, however. Over on YouTube, their crepuscular 2005 album track Take Me Somewhere Nice has been streamed 85 million times.",
      "The video isn't even official. Uploaded by a fan, it's illustrated by a drawing of a girl with her head in an upturned goldfish bowl.",
      "Originally drawn by video game designer Ken Wong, the picture's aura of disconnection and alienation has become so synonymous with Mogwai's song that some fans have turned it into tattoos.",
      "\"I almost want to go, 'Mate, you know, that's not the cover of the record',\" laughs Braithwaite. \"But it's cool.",
      "\"And the comments under the video are a sort of endless message board of young kids who are going through a hard time supporting each other. There's an agony aunt vibe about it.",
      "\"That's one thing I do like about the digital world, that music has these other lives.\"",
      "For Braithwaite, who read a lot of William Blake's poetry during the recording of The Bad Fire, there's something alluring about the prospect of art outliving its creator.",
      "\"I'm kind of obsessed with the concept of eternity within culture,\" he says.",
      "\"William Blake was kind of laughed out of society for his ideas but hundreds of years later, his paintings were projected onto the dome of St Paul's Cathedral, and Jerusalem is the unofficial English national anthem. It's incredible.",
      "\"I like the idea of, when we're long gone, having made some kind of mark.\"",
      "The concept has extra resonance this year, as Mogwai celebrate their 30th anniversary. They've come a long way, from gobby young upstarts who sold T-shirts slagging off their rivals to respected stalwarts of the British rock scene.",
      "So how does it feel to have reached this stage? Was it something they ever anticipated at their first practice, the first Tuesday after Glastonbury, in the front room of his parents' house?",
      "\"Well, I thought we'd have flying cars by this point,\" laughs Braithwaite. \"So any joy at the fact I was still eking out a living as a musician would probably be tempered by the lack of jet packs.\"",
      "To put it another way, it simply feels weird."

      "The battles their characters fight are not too dissimilar to what some of them have had to go through in real life.",
      "Josh Tedeku, who plays Jaheim, attended a private school growing up, so knows what it feels like to \"be in the minority\".",
      "\"I wasn't beaten up like my character in Boarders is, but the feeling of not fully belonging was always there - I felt a bit like a fish out of water and isolated at times,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Describing his schooling years as \"tough\", he says he's now \"proud that we've given a safe space to people who felt like they were in the minority at school\".",
      "The 21-year-old, who has also starred in Rapman's Netflix superhero series Supacell, says Boarders is also an important show as it \"represents all different types of black people\".",

      "The 22-year-old says the \"characters are really differentiated in the show and the beauty is that everyone can relate to a different character and see themselves in them\".",
      "Boarders gave the five leading actors their first major roles and they all tell the BBC they experienced imposter syndrome.",

      "'I laugh at ridiculousness of racism'",
      "In the first series, Leah confronts the entrenched racism at St. Gilbert's by challenging the display of a racist painting and Campbell says it was hard to perform scenes that tackled issues of racism and microaggressions.",
      "\"I had to really prepare myself for some scenes,\" she explains. \"I was looking at an offensive painting every day and that was hard but I used that fuel to arm my character\".",
      "She adds that it's important for these conversations to be had and Boarders does it well as it \"explores those difficult topics through comedy\".",
      "Tedeku says he appreciated having other actors similar to him around so that when things got too much they could \"group together and laugh at how stupid things are\".",

      "The first season of Boarders was largely praised by critics - The Guardian awarded it four-stars and said the show doesn't get \"bogged down in conflicts about race and class\" and instead \"encompasses all the mess and joy of youth, where few people ever really feel that they fit in\".",
      "Similarly, The Telegraph called Boarders \"razor-sharp\" and said it tackles \"everything from bigotry to inclusion\".",
      "The Daily Mail, however, wasn't impressed, suggesting it was \"full of lazy sterotypes\" and giving it only one star.",

    "published": "Sun, 26 Jan 2025 01:01:43 GMT",
    "summary": "A number of tracks that didn't make a big impact when they were first released have now become hits.",
    "story": [
      "When the lists of the most successful songs of 2024 in the charts, streaming and social media were revealed recently, they included the expected big hitters and some evergreen classics. But sprinkled among them was a different type of hit song.",
      "A number of tracks that failed to make a big impact when they were first released, mostly in the 2010s, have since bubbled up and become firm favourites.",
      "The rise of these slow-burning sleeper hits in recent years is \"one of the most fascinating trends right now\", says Stuart Dredge, head of insight at Music Ally.",
      "Here is our guide to the biggest 2010s sleeper hits.",
      "The Night We Met - Lord Huron (2015)",
      "This song only reached number 77 in the UK at the time of release, but was the 60th most popular song in 2024, according to the Official Charts Company's end-of-year list - above Charli XCX's biggest track. It was even higher on Spotify's global end-of-year chart, at 24.",
      "The LA folk-rock group's song first took off after being used in the 13 Reasons Why soundtrack in 2018, and with aching lyrics harking back to the start of a relationship, it has since been recycled in various TikTok memes and Molly-Mae Hague's pregnancy announcement video in 2022 (even though it's actually a break-up song). Cosmopolitan put it top of its playlist of Sad Songs to Blast When You're Feeling Hella Moody.",
      "Sweater Weather - The Neighbourhood (2012)",
      "This one reached the US top 20 but missed the UK top 40. It has snowballed on social media and is now the seventh most-streamed song in Spotify history, spending more than three years in total in its global daily top 50. The California band say the autumnal theme made it an \"accidental seasonal hit\", and it has also been adopted as a bisexual anthem.",
      "Champagne Coast - Blood Orange (2011)",
      "Champagne Coast didn't chart originally but British singer Dev Hynes' seductive \"come to my bedroom\" refrain was used in TV show Euphoria's soundtrack in 2019, and then the song blew up on TikTok last summer. It was the most popular old song on the platform in 2024 and sixth overall on Billboard's end-of-year TikTok chart. It finally reached the UK top 20 in July.",
      "Evergreen - Richy Mitch & the Coal Miners (2017)",
      "Evergreen is just 87 seconds long and didn't chart originally, but became the go-to song for \"hopecore\" videos offering snippets of positivity and optimism on TikTok last year. It spent 35 weeks in the UK top 60 in 2024, and was in the overall end-of-year top 100.",
      "Lovely - Billie Eilish (2018)",
      "Released on the 13 Reasons Why soundtrack, this track didn't reach the UK or US top 40s, but Eilish's delicate duet with Khalid is now her most-streamed song, and 14th on Spotify's all-time list. It is apparently, among other things, good for sending you to sleep.",
      "I Wanna Be Yours - Arctic Monkeys (2013)",
      "I Wanna Be Yours was on the hit AM album but only reached 99 in the UK as a single. However, last year it had more Spotify plays than any other song over a decade old. TikTok users have chosen the melodramatic chorus to soundtrack their romantic declarations.",
      "The Sound of Silence - Disturbed (2015)",
      "Hard rock band Disturbed's brooding but beautiful cover of the Simon and Garfunkel classic has now spent eight months in the UK top 60 in the past year, helped by a dance remix and a TikTok shuffle dance trend.",
      "See You Again by Tyler, the Creator (2017)",
      "See You Again didn't chart at the time but took off on TikTok (where else?), with one snippet turning into a personality quiz (do you sing along with Tyler's \"OK OK OK OK\" or guest vocalist Kali Uchis' \"La la la la\"?). The song finally reached number 21 in the UK in 2023, and was the 19th most-streamed song on Spotify in the US in 2024.",
      "Songs from all eras have been resurfacing for several years, of course.",
      "Many were hits to start with. Mr Brightside by The Killers (2004) is a fixture, while Kate Bush's Running Up That Hill (1985) and Sophie Ellis-Bextor's Murder on the Dancefloor (2001) shot back up the charts thanks to TV and film soundtracks.",
      "But when it comes to songs that weren't as big the first time around, the 2010s dominate.",
      "One reason is that people who grew up in those years are introducing their favourite tunes to others, according to Sarah Kloboves from music data analysts Chartmetric.",
      "\"This revival is pioneered by these older Gen Z listeners [in their mid-20s]. But when they start to create these trends, you also have the younger Gen Zs and even Gen Alpha [young teens and below] that are hearing these songs for the first time - the release date is interesting because it's old, but it's not too old.\"",
      "Dredge agrees: \"A lot of the influencers on places like TikTok are a few years older, so they are probably using songs from the 2010s that soundtracked their teenage years.\"",
      "Taylor Swift's Cruel Summer (2019) could even be described as a sleeper hit - it wasn't released as an official single at the time, but eventually reached number one in 2023 and was the fifth-biggest song of 2024 overall on Apple Music.",
      "Others, though, are not such obvious hits. Musically, most sound quite restrained and atmospheric - they're emotive soundtrack songs rather than upbeat bangers or full-blooded anthems.",
      "\"These aren't songs that were released with the intention of being a pop hit,\" Kloboves says.",
      "\"Not to bash on pop music or pop stars, but sometimes they all sort of sound the same. But I think a lot of these songs are very different from what you might usually hear in the mainstream,\" she says.",
      "\"I think that's why listeners really resonate with them, because they're slightly unique and different-sounding.\"",
      "Eight more sleeper hits:",
      "Pink + White by Frank Ocean (2016)No Role Modelz by J Cole (2014)Jocelyn Flores by XXXTentacion (2017)All I Want by Kodaline (2012)Lovers Rock by TV Girl (2014)Space Song by Beach House (2015)Apocalypse by Cigarettes After Sex (2017)Freaks by Surf Curse (2013)",

      "All I Want by Kodaline (2012)",
      "Lovers Rock by TV Girl (2014)",
      "Space Song by Beach House (2015)",
      "Apocalypse by Cigarettes After Sex (2017)",
      "Freaks by Surf Curse (2013)",
      "Many of these songs owe their belated success to TikTok, and tracks that take off \"evoke some kind of emotional response\" in the listener, the platform's UK head of music partnerships Toyin Mustapha believes.",
      "\"It's having something that emotionally resonates. That could be a lyric. It could be the way that the instrumental lands.\"",
      "And our relationship with music has changed. When packaging songs with clips on social media, fans are choosing them as soundtracks to evocative moments.",
      "\"It's no longer passive listening,\" Mustapha adds. \"People are really active participants in the culture. And they're active because they are taking this music and essentially reimagining it in their own way.\"",
      "Record labels do try to help back-catalogue songs become sleeper hits, but it normally happens organically thanks to fans, Dredge says.",
      "\"One of the things you can see is it's songs that lend themselves to a feeling or mood. It often is a particular line from the song that is the thing that is picked up on and goes viral,\" he says.",
      "\"There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to it other than they suddenly feel relevant to someone in a way that other people appreciate.\"",
      "Sometimes, it's simply that a great song didn't get the attention it deserved at the time: \"Part of it is just that a brilliant song can connect with people, no matter how long ago it was made.\""

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:46:42 GMT",
    "summary": "The star discusses how she feels about blowing up on TikTok and the trademark honesty in her lyrics.",
    "story": [
      "South London singer Lola Young's unflinchingly honest hit Messy has reached number one in the UK after a two-month climb, and she's been nominated for a Brit Award. Now she's made a breakthrough, this could be her year.",
      "Lola Young jumps into a car, laughing uncontrollably as she flashes a brand new set of shiny gold teeth.",
      "\"I just got grills fitted,\" she explains once she's regained her composure. \"But they're like so intense, so you're rocking with this today, and a lisp.\"",
      "She's been running a few minutes late for the interview and this explains why - so she can finish getting her dental jewellery accessories fitted, with which she seems extremely pleased.",
      "The screen suddenly freezes. The car she's in is somewhere in the US and the reception has cut out.",
      "Young made her US TV debut on Jimmy Fallon's talk show the night before, which followed a whirlwind trip to Australia, and she'll soon set off on a sold-out European tour. She's talking on Zoom as her manager drives her to the next stop on her schedule.",
      "Travelling the world and in high demand, but making time to get a full set of solid gold teeth grills fitted - she's living a proper pop star's life.",
      "And she is now a proper pop star. After several years of almost making it - she sang on the 2021 John Lewis advert, was on the BBC Sound of 2022 list and had glowing reviews for her two albums - Messy has given her a bona fide hit.",
      "The song became inescapable at the end of 2024 and completed its climb to the top of the charts on Friday.",
      "The 24-year-old is the first current British artist to have a UK number one since Chase and Status and Stormzy in August, the youngest to do so since Dave in 2022, and the youngest British woman to score a chart-topper since Dua Lipa in 2017.",
      "Her number one came a day after she was nominated for best pop act at the Brit Awards.",
      "\"The response has been amazing and it's been really exciting to see all the love that Messy has been receiving,\" says Young after reconnecting the call.",
      "\"I love the song, it's a song I wrote that's really personal and really important to me. So I'm really happy that it's resonating so much.\"",
      "Messy was released on Young\u2019s second album This Wasn't Meant For You Anyway last May.",
      "Its trajectory was supercharged when superstar US influencers Sofia Richie Grainge and Jake Shane posted a 14-second TikTok clip of themselves dancing to its chorus. Young's song has now been used in 1.3 million videos on the platform - from Kylie Jenner lip-syncing as a dog, to a viral clip of an old woman vaping and holding a pint alongside the caption \"94 and still messy\".",
      "The singer would like to point out that the track's success is not simply down to TikTok, however.",
      "\"That's not necessarily how it blew up. I would like to say that the song was blowing up before TikTok, and it was having its moment elsewhere. A lot of things contributed to the success.",
      "\"The TikTok thing is great. I don't make music for TikTok. I make music for myself and for my fans, but the Sofia Richie thing is just one element of how well it did in every aspect.",
      "\"But yeah, it's been great to see every side of it.\"",
      "Contradictions",
      "The track was indeed starting to gain traction before finding TikTok virality, and has only done so well because it is more than a mere meme.",
      "Its lyrics, about never being good enough for someone whatever you do, have connected deeply with fans. \"I want to be me, is that not allowed?\" she implores.",
      "\"I guess it's because the song speaks to so many people in terms of, I'm talking about the idea that there's two sides of a person, the contradictions,\" Young says.",
      "The song captures how it is \"to basically feel like you're not enough for somebody and also in turn not enough for yourself\".",
      "Amid the craziness of success, there's some relief that she has now reached the next level in her career.",
      "\"I mean, I feel like it's the right time,\" the singer says. \"It's been a minute, but also it does feel like the right time for me.\"",
      "Young has also recently featured on Tyler, the Creator\u2019s well-received album Chromakopia.",
      "Grit and charisma",
      "When it was released, the Observer said Young\u2019s album had \"a winning combination of zingers and vulnerability\", and the Telegraph said it showed \"all of the grit and charisma of a seasoned artist\".",
      "Like Messy, many of her tracks are one-sided conversations - mainly with an unseen, unreasonable and unsuitable man (or woman).",
      "Other songs continue the theme of double-edged romance. Wish You Were Dead is about a relationship that veers between being affectionate and volatile; while in Big Brown Eyes, Young gets weak-kneed when a lukewarm love interest insults her.",
      "Unlike some artists, there's little need to ask Young what her songs are about - the stories are laid out in her raw and razor-sharp lyrics.",
      "But how real are the situations and scenarios about which she sings?",
      "\"Pretty real. As real as it gets, to be honest,\" she replies.",
      "\"I just write from my own experience and they're very real. They're all the things that I've been through, all situations I've had, and all experiences I've had.\"",
      "The honesty of her songwriting sets her apart from many other artists, but she says she knows no other way.",
      "\"I don't think about it. Music is the only place I can be dead honest,\" she says. \"Not that I'm a liar...",
      "\"But I feel like that's my outlet, the place I can be the most honest. I never really think about it. It doesn't feel like a difficult thing to do, or something that feels like I'm baring my soul or anything. It's just I've always done that in my music.\"",
      "The album ends with an equally candid spoken-word outro, in which she says the LP was written to help her accept and love herself, and to realise she doesn't need \"no ugly man (or woman)\".",
      "\"I haven't got there yet but I will,\" she says on the track.",
      "'Different angle' on Brat",
      "Young is managed by two men who separately worked with Amy Winehouse and Adele, and she has something in common with those two artists in her combination of fragility and front.",
      "To that, she adds the conversational tone of Lily Allen and the modern pop sensibility and chaotic energy of Charli XCX.",
      "Young's breakthrough coincided with the reign of Charli's Brat ethos, which she defined as \"a girl who is a little messy, likes to party, maybe says dumb things sometimes, feels herself, and has a breakdown but parties through it\".",
      "Young feels an affinity with that. \"I massively do, and I think it's that thing of empowered women who like to party and be themselves, and that's really important to me,\" she says.",
      "\"I guess I come from a different angle - of a less heightened version of that, I guess. It would be more like, 'I don't really give a [care], but I also really do'. That's what I guess I stand by a little bit more.\"",
      "Bratpop season will stretch further when Young releases her next album later this year. It is nearly finished and will \"dig deeper\" than the last, she says. How much deeper can she really dig?",
      "\"Quite a lot,\" she says. \"There's quite a lot more to say. There's a lot of other topics and things that have happened to me, and things that I've gone through that I want to discuss with people.",
      "\"But also things that are a little bit less about love, and about other things that I've gone through.\"",
      "Now that Messy's cleaned up, we can expect to see more of Young, and her shiny teeth."

      "Read on for this week's biggest releases...",
      "Why Vicky Pattison created her own deepfake porn video",
      "Deepfake porn - which usually combines a real person's face with a fake, sexually explicit body - is becoming increasingly prevalent.",
      "On Tuesday, a new Channel 4 documentary, Vicky Pattison: My Deepfake Sex Tape, aims to explore the issue and its effect on women and girls.",
      "In it, the 37-year-old former Geordie Shore star creates her own deepfake porn video and releases it on social media.",
      "The video appears to show Vicky engaging in a sex act with a man, first in a bra, and then topless.",
      "She acknowledges to BBC News that releasing her own video might seem \"counterintuitive\", but says she's trying to highlight the urgency of the issue.",
      "Pattison says it took a long time to work up the nerve to hit \"post\" on X, because she knew it would be \"the point of no return\".",
      "\"What struck me most was how helpless I felt once it was released - it gave me a glimpse into the powerlessness victims experience,\" she says.",
      "\"By putting myself in this position, even in a controlled and consensual way, I wanted to bring home just how vulnerable all of us are\".",
      "Is this the end of The Weeknd?",
      "Whenever I think of The Weeknd, I always think about Blinding Lights - a song forever etched into my mind by TikTok dances and the dark days of the pandemic.",
      "But his new album, Hurry Up Tomorrow, which is coming out on Friday, could be the last music he releases under his longtime alter ego.",
      "Last year, he told W Magazine he wanted to \"kill The Weeknd\", but would still make music.",
      "Shortly afterwards, he reverted to his birth name Abel Tesfaye on his social media accounts.",

      "Most people find January depressing. For me, it's the best month of the year.",

      "One of the British contenders this year is Hard Truths, starring actress Marianne Jean-Baptiste, which scored two Bafta nominations earlier this month.",
      "It focuses on Pansy, an irritable woman who is constantly starting fights with everyone around her. Her perpetual misery can be funny to watch, but her bad mood is clearly taking a toll on her family. The word depression isn't mentioned explicitly, but it's clear Pansy is struggling.",
      "At a screening in October, I was struck by the impact Hard Truths had on the audience. Its relatively short 95-minute runtime disguises a film with significant depth and which punches well above its weight.",
      "Speaking to BBC News in December, Jean-Baptiste reflected: \"Pansy comes from a generation where you're taught to just get on with things. It's like the pre-Oprah generation, self-help - it's before all that. You just went, 'I feel rubbish, but I've got to do the laundry.' You get up and you get on with it.\"",

      "The patches of engineered heart muscle have to survive in the patient and be nurtured over several months, so are not useful for people who need emergency care, the researchers say.",
      "In trials on monkeys, the research team found the patches were good at contracting, enhancing and thickening the heart wall, which improved the pumping of the whole heart.",
      "Heart failure is the leading cause of death worldwide, but there are few effective ways of fixing the organ once it is broken.",
      "It is a condition that makes even simple daily tasks, like climbing the stairs or getting dressed, exhausting.",
      "Heart devices can be costly and come with complications, and a heart transplant - although the best solution - is rarely an option.",
      "Prof Zimmermann says: \"99% of patients with heart failure won't receive a new heart.\"",
      "The researchers have more to learn from the current human trial and plan a long-term follow-up of 15 patients to find out more about the health of those living with the patches for years.",
      "Prof James Leiper, director of research at the British Heart Foundation charity, said the early results were \"promising\", but trials in a larger number of patients were needed \"to determine the effectiveness of the heart patch in humans\".",
      "\"If these are positive, it could help to usher in a new era of heart failure treatment,\" he said.",
      "Previous attempts to inject heart muscle cells into people's failing hearts have had mixed results.",
      "\"Off the shelf\" heart patches like the ones used in this study - made from millions of human stem cells and grown into working heart muscle - are seen to be a less dangerous option, although patients would need to take strong drugs to prevent their bodies rejecting them.",
      "Using the patient's own stem cells to develop heart tissue has been attempted, but this process takes a very long time and previous trials using these grafts were not encouraging."

    "story": [
      "Endangering lives at sea is to be a new criminal offence carrying a jail term of up to five years as part of plans to tackle people smuggling, the Home Office says.",
      "Border officials will also get powers to seize migrants' phones in the search for intelligence about who helped them cross the Channel.",
      "Those convicted of acts in preparation of smuggling, such as buying boat parts, face up to 14 years in jail, in an attempt to tackle gangs at a far earlier stage in their preparations.",
      "The package retains some powers introduced by the Conservatives, including longer forms of detention for some migrants and restricting when someone who says they have been trafficked into slavery can stay in the UK.",
      "How many people cross the Channel in small boats?",
      "Suspected people smugglers face phone and travel ban",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC's political editor Chris Mason the government was planning to bring in the new laws this year.",
      "She said counter-terror style powers would mean \"we can step in much earlier to take action on those who are facilitating the boats\".",
      "However, Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said it was \"a weak bill from a weak government\", which re-announces steps taken by his party when it was in power.",
      "He described the changes as \"minor tinkering\" and said a real deterrent was needed, after Labour scrapped a scheme which would have seen some migrants sent to Rwanda.",
      "The new offence of endangering lives at sea could lead to the prosecution of anyone arriving in the UK on a small and unsafe boat who has been involved in intimidating or coercing others passengers to take part in the journey, or who has refused to be rescued outside of British waters.",
      "Boat launches from French beaches are often terrifying and dangerous, investigators say, with some of the passengers doing the work of gangs by forcing reluctant travellers to climb on board.",
      "Officials say they have come across migrants who had managed to get into a small boat then held out babies to stop others climbing in.",
      "A senior law enforcement official said investigators often found themselves dealing with \"traumatised victims in a floating crime scene\".",
      "The five-year term for endangering lives is in addition to existing laws, such as grievous bodily harm or attempted murder, that may result from people smuggling.",
      "The planned new tools, inspired by successes in counter-terrorism cases, also include court orders to ban suspects from travelling, or promoting smuggling on social media.",

      "Ministers hope these powers will mean the police will be able to arrest and charge more gang members, or seek their extradition from abroad, before boats have left France.",
      "The proposed powers are based on legal principles that have been used for 20 years to apprehend suspected terrorists at much early stages of their planning.",
      "One of these \"preparatory\" powers will be a crime of being involved in the handling or selling boat parts, where there is a suspicion the trade is for people smuggling.",
      "People who promote crossings, take bookings and arrange for potential passengers to meet boats in northern France could also face prosecution.",
      "Serious Crime Prevention Orders, a power to restrict the liberties of offenders, will be reformed so that the National Crime Agency can temporarily impose conditions on the lives of suspected smugglers, while they build a case.",
      "Those conditions could include bans on travel, internet and mobile phone use and how they can move money.",
      "Ministers say the new legislation is part of a broader strategy including giving the recently-created Border Security Commander powers to co-ordinate operations and lead talks with foreign law enforcement agencies.",
      "A recent deal with Germany has seen the country agree to introduce a new crime of illegal immigration to the UK, so investigators can target gangs operating in the country.  Bulgarian authorities have begun using health and safety laws to seize shipments of inflatables from Turkey.",

      "Police believe people smuggling involves hundreds rather than thousands of perpetrators, and was \"not like the drugs trade\".",
      "\"With concerted effort and legislation you can make a difference\" they told reporters, in a background briefing on the basis that those speaking would not be named.",
      "In one recent example, Amanj Hasan Zada was jailed for 17 years for organising small boat crossings from Preston.",
      "The National Crime Agency only won the case last November with evidence linking his activities to specific crossings.",
      "Under the proposed new powers, investigators would simply have to show suspects such as Zada had made preparations, such as funding boats or promoting crossings.",

      "In 2022, LBA's \u00a3150m scheme to develop a new terminal was abandoned over planning delays, in favour of an earlier proposal to regenerate the current terminal.",
      "Speaking in Yorkshire following the government decision to back a third runway at Heathrow, the chancellor said \"sustainable aviation and economic growth go hand-in-hand\".",
      "She defended her previous position of opposing the Leeds Bradford expansion, insisting \"a lot has changed since 2020 when those plans last came forward - no one was flying because it was during the pandemic, but also the way we fly has changed\".",

      "\"It is clear that an increase in both flights and passenger numbers would undermine vital efforts to ensure Leeds upholds its commitments to be carbon neutral by 2030,\" she said, at the time.",
      "The expansion proposals were eventually withdrawn in 2022, with airport bosses citing \"excessive delays\" prompted by local concern over increased aircraft movements - particularly at night - and the decision to refer the scheme to the Secretary of State for a public inquiry.",

    "story": [
      "Heathrow's third runway can be built and operating in a decade's time, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said.",
      "Reeves told the BBC she wanted to see \"spades in the ground\" in the current Parliament and planes to start using the runway by 2035.",
      "She also said that Sadiq Khan, the Labour Mayor of London who is opposed to Heathrow's expansion, could not stop the new runway.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the Conservatives were in favour of a third runway at Heathrow \"in principle\" but \"it remains to be seen\" whether it can be built in a decade.",
      "The extra runway at Heathrow was one of a number of infrastructure projects announced by the chancellor on Wednesday as part of the government's plans to boost economic growth.",
      "\"We think that we can get flights off within a decade,\" Reeves told the BBC.",
      "\"I say that because we're not just announcing that we back it, we are changing the way that our planning system works to make it easier to deliver projects like the third runway at Heathrow.\"",
      "When asked if Sadiq Khan could stop the expansion the chancellor said \"no\".",
      "\"There can be judicial reviews but we are confident that this airport expansion will happen, that we will get the third runway built,\" she said.",
      "Some have argued that it will take much longer than a decade for a third runway at Heathrow to become reality.",
      "A formal planning process has to take place, which could take between 18 months and two years. Any judicial review of the plan could take another year and a half, while actually building the runway could take about seven years.",
      "The airport's expansion is highly controversial - facing opposition from environmental groups, local authorities and nearby residents.",
      "Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has called the plan \"a dead cat\".",

      "\"If Leeds-Bradford came back with plans to expand I would support these because I think things have changed significantly in the past few years,\" she said.",
      "She said there were now more efficient plane engines and the use of sustainable aviation fuel was a \"game changer\".",
      "However, supplies of this fuel are currently very low. According to the European regulator EASA, they made up just 0.05% of the fuel used in the EU in 2020. It also costs much more than regular jet fuel.",

      "The director-general of the International Air Transport Association, Willie Walsh,  has cast doubt on how quickly this can be achieved.",
      "\"Sustainable fuel is a real thing, but we need it in significantly greater volumes than are available today,\" he told LBC on Wednesday.",

      "It emerged last year that the HS2 rail line was spending \u00a3100m on a shield to protect bats in ancient woodland in Buckinghamshire.",
      "The chancellor said: \"There are trade-offs and the balance has gone too far in the direction of always protecting every bat and every newt.\"",

      "Some inside Labour argue that there is a generational divide within the party on many controversial growth issues, including this one.",
      "One member of the 2024 Labour intake told me this afternoon that they expected opposition to Heathrow expansion among Labour MPs to be limited mostly to \"nimby boomers\".",
      "Opponents of the runway insist the generational split will prove to be the other way round, citing the concerns of young voters about the environment.",
      "Of course, Heathrow was not the only meaty part of the chancellor's speech. There is some private unease among Labour MPs who represent seats in the Midlands and the north of England that the projects are mostly, but not all, located in the south.",
      "Even one Labour MP for a seat in the south of England urged the government to talk not only about the benefits of the developments to Oxford and Cambridge, but also to stress the benefits for the communities in between the two cities  - noting acidly that Reeves, Sir Keir Starmer and all the previous five Conservative prime ministers went to Oxford University.",
      "While the response of Labour MPs will play a big role in determining how Reeves's speech is assessed in Westminster, the actual delivery of her plans will rely in large part on private finance and local government.",
      "The entire speech was designed to boost business confidence in Britain's prospects. The decisions firms make over the coming weeks, months and years will help to show whether that was a success.",
      "When it comes to local government, some of the signs are not auspicious.",
      "The BBC revealed last month that local councils, many of them Labour-led, had told the government its housebuilding plans were \"unrealistic\" and \"impossible to achieve\".",
      "Ministers are eager to strike devolution deals across the country but in some areas on the growth corridor this is proving complicated.",
      "More housebuilding will also require new Labour MPs, many of whom claimed long-term Conservative seats in last year's election landslide, to face down local campaigners arguing against development and argue for prioritising growth instead.",
      "It was striking this afternoon how many centre-right think tanks, disappointed by the pace of building projects under the Conservatives, praised Reeves's approach this afternoon.",
      "Even among those most supportive of Reeves's agenda, some argue that plans for long-term growth need to be accompanied by short-term ways to boost Britons' living standards.",
      "The prime minister's \"plan for change\" shift at the end of last year was in part an attempt to move the main focus of the government away from targeting GDP and towards \"milestones\" tangible to people's everyday lives.",
      "One Labour adviser said: \"We need to do what we did today, but that's not about winning the next election. For that we need to give the voters we need to keep what they want and need.\""

      "A third runway has been on the cards for many years. It has also been kicked into the long grass on several occasions.",
      "The argument in favour has always been an economic one. Large airports create jobs, promote trade and bring in both business travellers and tourists.",

      "Secondly, it is highly likely any decision in favour of a third runway would be subject to a judicial review.",
      "Expansion of Heathrow is highly controversial - opponents include environmental groups, local authorities as well as nearby residents, and this stage could take another year and a half.",
      "So even with favourable winds, it could take at least three years to get to the construction stage which is itself expected to take another six or seven years.",

      "The real value of backing a third runway at Heathrow is the less tangible but no less important signal to investors about the UK's attitude towards major infrastructure projects, say supporters.",
      "The uncertainty over the construction of the HS2 high speed line under the previous Conservative government is widely believed to have undermined confidence in the country's ability to turn ambitious plans into reality.",
      "A strong commitment to Heathrow expansion might help to reverse that perception.",
      "With the plan itself expected to cost close to \u00a320bn, insiders say firm government support will be vital if it goes ahead.",
      "Although the project would be privately-funded, people close to the scheme warn that it could not proceed without close co-ordination with ministers - including changes to the policy framework that sets out how the costs of the investment can be recovered.",
      "For the chancellor herself, there could be a short-term benefit in throwing her weight behind airport expansion plans now.",
      "Some economists have argued that if additional growth can be factored into economic forecasts currently being prepared by the Office for Budget Responsibility, it might make it easier for her to meet self-imposed fiscal rules within this parliament.",
      "If not, then Reeves is likely to bump into her own \"iron\" fiscal rules to pay for day-to- day spending out of tax receipts by 2029 - meaning spending cuts or further tax rises.",

    "story": [
      "When Zara Mohammed became the first female leader of one of the largest representative bodies for British Muslims in 2021, she already had a lot on her plate: rising Islamophobia, the Covid-19 pandemic, and a government refusing to engage with the group.",
      "The then 29-year-old could not have imagined three years later, she would be facing one of the biggest challenges of her career - rioting across England and Northern Ireland, often explicitly targeting Muslims, and still no government contact.",
      "The violent unrest, triggered by false rumours that the Southport knife attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker, saw bricks hurled at mosques and Islamophobic chants on the streets.",
      "Many Muslims and people of colour felt afraid to leave their homes.",
      "\"It was so visceral. We were watching on our screens: people breaking doors down, stopping cars, attacking taxi drivers, smashing windows, smashing mosques,\" she told the BBC. \"The kind of evil we saw was really terrifying and I felt like, am I even making a difference?\"",
      "As Ms Mohammed ends her time as general secretary of the Muslim Council of Britain \u2013 on Saturday, Wajid Akhter was elected as her replacement \u2013 she spoke to the BBC about the difficulties she has faced.",
      "She described an \"unbelievable tidal wave of Islamophobia\" in the UK, which she said was made more difficult to tackle due to the ongoing policy of government non-engagement.",
      "\"It was the Southport riots for us that made it really quite alarming. The justification was there, the urgency, the necessity of engagement was there, British Muslims were under attack, mosques were under attack and the largest umbrella Muslim organisation wasn't being talked to,\" she said.",
      "Strains in the relationship between successive governments and the MCB began over a decade ago. Ties were severed with the MCB in 2009 under then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, after the group's deputy leader signed a declaration advocating attacks on the Royal Navy if it tried to stop arms for Hamas. Hamas's military wing had been proscribed as a terror group in the UK eight years earlier.",
      "The deputy secretary later resigned and Ms Mohammed said the MCB made clear such actions did not reflect the organisation, leading to a brief period of re-engagement.",
      "However, under consecutive governments, that engagement was broken again. In 2018, when asked about Islamophobia in the Conservative Party, then Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the government did not engage with MCB as \"too many of their members have had favourable comments on extremists and that's not acceptable\" - claims the MCB vehemently denied at the time.",
      "For Ms Mohammed, there were hopes that engagement would be renewed when Labour entered government last year as she described \"strong\" and \"positive\" relationships with Labour MPs. However, the policy of non-engagement has continued without any explanation.",
      "She said this was having a \"terrible impact\" on communities who \"do not feel Islamophobia is being taken seriously\". \"At least have a conversation about it, but to not say anything and not tell us why? Surely what happened 14 years ago cannot be the justification.",
      "\"What is the issue now? We're not illegal, we're not proscribed. We do not harbour any extremist views. We have a broad-based demographic of British Muslims,\" she added.",
      "A spokesperson for the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) confirmed there had been no change to the policy of non-engagement with MCB but did not detail why.",
      "\"All forms of religious and racial hatred have absolutely no place in our society,\" the spokesperson said. \"The government engages regularly with faith communities to help foster strong working relationships and we are exploring a more integrated and cohesive approach to tackling racial and religious hatred, including Islamophobia.\"",
      "Various government departments engage with faith organisations to discuss relevant issues and policy, including on the Covid-19 pandemic and tackling hate crime.",
      "The rise in Islamophobia has personally affected Ms Mohammed, who faces frequent abuse online. She was also the victim of a hate incident on the London Underground by a man who used offensive language.",
      "\"I've definitely got more of a fear of my personal security than I've ever had before,\" she said. \"There's been an onslaught of far-right, thuggish, anti-Islam, quite disgusting, really awful graphic content that's posted on my account.\"",
      "National monitoring group Tell Mama UK recorded 4,971 incidents of anti-Muslim hate in the year after the Hamas attacks on Israel - the highest total in 14 years - with Muslim women particularly vulnerable.",
      "Challenged on whether the MCB had done enough to support communities, particularly without government engagement, Ms Mohammed said the organisation had done \"a lot of community building \" and \"political advocacy\" to address anti-Muslim hate, including interfaith projects, an Islamophobia event in Parliament and a Visit My Mosque initiative.",
      "However, she said this had not changed mainstream narratives around British Muslims. \"There has been such a normalisation of Islamophobic rhetoric without it being challenged or condemned.\"",
      "\"We could say we're making a difference but then what is being seen in national discourse does not seem to translate,\" she added.",
      "'Constantly firefighting'",

      "Sadiq Khan condemned the remarks as \"pouring fuel on the fire of anti-Muslim hatred\".",
      "As more Muslim professionals and politicians reached new heights, like Humza Yousaf becoming Scottish first minister and Sir Sadiq being knighted, they \"faced disgusting levels of Islamophobia which others have not ever faced\", said Ms Mohammed.",

The BBC said it promised to \"reflect on\" the concerns raised following the interview.",

    "story": [
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said on Wednesday that \"economic growth is the number one mission of this government\" as she unveiled a series of proposals to boost the UK's economy.",
      "But how quickly could the government get growth from the plans she announced?",
      "Critics have argued some of the projects - such as expanding Heathrow  - would not help in the near term.",
      "BBC Verify has examined some of the key numbers and claims.",
      "How slow is the UK's growth?",
      "The most recent official data shows there was virtually no growth in GDP - the overall size of the UK economy - between the July 2024 election and November 2024.",
      "And the latest medium term official growth forecast from the Office for Budget Responsiblity, the government's official forecaster, is for 1.6% GDP growth in 2029, which would be well below the pre-2008 financial crisis average growth of 2.8% a year.",
      "However, the International Monetary Fund has forecast that the UK's growth rate for 2025 and 2026 will be higher than in France and Germany.",
      "Lower rates of GDP growth would translate into slower growth in our wages and incomes and general living standards.",
      "Heathrow expansion",
      "The chancellor said that allowing Heathrow to build a third runway would \"create 100,000 jobs\", boost investment and exports and \"unlock futher growth\".",
      "She cited a new report by the consultancy Frontier Economics which found it could increase the UK's potential GDP by 2050 by 0.43%, around \u00a317bn.",
      "That is broadly in line with the findings of an independent commission by Sir Howard Davies in 2015, which concluded a third runway at Heathrow would support UK trade and enhance productivity and push up GDP by 0.65-0.75% by 2050 relative to otherwise.",
      "However, most analysts believe it would likely take many years before shovels went into the ground to start building a new runway, even with new reforms to speed up the planning process.",
      "And the government will have a difficult balancing act to both expand Heathrow and meet its climate goals.",
      "BBC Verify asked the Treasury for its source for the 100,000 jobs figure and it pointed to a 2017 report by the Department for Transport estimating that a new runway at Heathrow could add between 57,000 and 114,000 additional local jobs. Though that report added that \"these jobs are not additional at the national level, as some jobs may have been displaced from other airports or other sectors.\"",
      "Oxford-Cambridge Growth Corridor",
      "The chancellor in her speech claimed an Oxford and Cambridge Growth Corridor \"could add up to \u00a378bn to the UK economy by 2035\".",
      "This corridor is a resurrection of the previous government's plans to join Oxford and Cambridge with new transport links and allow those two university and research hubs to expand.",
      "In support of the chancellor's figure, the Treasury has cited research by an industry group called the Oxford-Cambridge Supercluster.",
      "This research shows that this \u00a378bn is a \"cumulative figure\" over 10 years, not the boost in a given year.",
      "The analysis suggests the project could add \u00a325bn in Gross Value Added (GVA) a year to the UK economy by 2035.",
      "That would constitute roughly a permanent 1% boost to UK GDP by that date.",
      "Estimates of the impacts of an infrastructure project on growth are inherently uncertain and very sensitive to the assumptions of researchers about what would have happened to growth if it had never been built.",
      "Yet most economists do believe infrastructure projects, especially those that allow already productive places to expand, will ultimately help the UK economy grow more rapidly than otherwise.",
      "Ben Caswell, a senior economist at The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr), said: \"Big infrastructure projects typically deliver growth over the long term, approximately 10 to 20 years.\"",
      "\"There may be a small demand side boost in the short term when shovels are in the ground, but nothing so significant that you would see it in headline GDP growth figures.",
      "\"However, after the project is complete, the supply capacity of the economy is permanently enhanced, and, all other things equal, that delivers higher sustained GDP growth than would have otherwise been.\"",
      "Pensions reform",
      "Another reform the chancellor says will be pro-growth is enabling UK companies to access the funds from their \"defined benefit pension\" pots, held on behalf of their workforces to fund their retirement.",
      "Defined benefit pension schemes guarantee an annual pension payment to retired workers, based on their salary while they were in work.",
      "Many of these defined benefit pension pots have moved into surplus in recent years due to the rise in interest rates since the pandemic, meaning their financial assets (their investments) are greater than their financial liabilities (what they have to pay out to pensioners).",
      "The Treasury has said that approximately 75% of schemes are now in surplus and that the total surplus adds up to \u00a3160bn.",
      "The chancellor wants to legislate to allow the firms to use these funds to invest, while keeping safeguards to protect and guarantee workers' pension pay-outs.",

      "At a glance: What was in Rachel Reeves's speech?",
      "Measuring the size of the surplus of defined benefit scheme depends on various complex assumptions about the scheme and its relationship to the employer.",
      "The official Pension Regulator estimates that on one measurement the size in September 2024 was \u00a3207bn, but \u00a3137bn on a different measurement.",
      "The Treasury's estimate is roughly midway between the two.",
      "If such sums were deployed that could, in theory, make a positive difference to overall UK business investment, which is regarded by economists as both a short term and a long term driver of GDP growth.",
      "Total business investment in 2023, according to official data, was \u00a3258bn.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 06:30:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The government says repeated legal action against big projects is preventing the country's growth.",
    "story": [
      "Major infrastructure projects in the East of England have been delayed by lengthy legal challenges, according to the government. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has vowed to end so-called Nimby - Not in My Back Yard - challenges from those he says stand in the way of the country's growth. But just how disruptive have these challenges been in the East of England, and why have groups campaigned against the projects cited by the government?",
      "What has the government said?",
      "On Thursday, Sir Keir announced plans to block campaigners from making repeated legal challenges against decisions on major infrastructure projects in England and Wales.",
      "His reasoning was to prevent \"cynical\" and \"hopeless\" appeals blocking plans for things such as wind farms, nuclear stations and transport projects.",
      "As part of the announcement, Downing Street referenced Suffolk's Sizewell C nuclear power station, improvement plans for the A47 in Norfolk and wind farm infrastructure in the region that has been hit by campaigners' challenges.",
      "What do these projects entail?",
      "Energy company EDF wants Sizewell C to provide what they claim would be decades of clean, reliable electricity, but it is waiting for a final investment decision, expected this year.",
      "The government previously said new nuclear plants would be needed if the UK wanted to hit its target to decarbonise power generation, and some work has begun on the site in preparation.",
      "In Norfolk, National Highways is undertaking three major upgrades to the A47.",
      "The first scheme began last year on the section of the road between North Tuddenham and Easton, east of Norwich, which will create two additional lanes and two new junctions by 2027.",
      "Finally, the LionLink and Sea Link offshore wind projects in Suffolk are due to see converter stations built at several locations in the county.",
      "National Grid is waiting for permission from the government but has spoken of the wider project's importance.",
      "What campaigns have delayed these projects?",
      "Several groups have taken action against Sizewell C over a number of issues.",
      "Most recently, Theberton and Eastbridge Action Group on Sizewell Limited lost a High Court bid to challenge the Office for Nuclear Regulation's decision to issue a licence for the site.",
      "In December 2023, the Court of Appeal dismissed a legal challenge from Together Against Sizewell that argued the government failed to consider the need for a water supply at the site.",
      "The A47 improvement schemes were previously thrown into doubt when a former Green Party councillor attempted to block them.",
      "Andrew Boswell claimed the Department for Transport's development consent orders, approved in 2022, failed in each case to assess the significance of the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions, as required by law.",
      "However, he lost his case at the High Court and then had a challenge dismissed at the Court of Appeal.",
      "In May, the Supreme Court turned down his application for a legal challenge to be heard there.",
      "National Highways said delays to the three schemes had caused costs to soar due to the impact of inflation.",
      "Offshore4Sure has campaigned against the building of the substations in Suffolk.",
      "It wants developers to find more appropriate sites, but National Grid said this would lead to a delay in greener energy and greater energy security.",
      "It added that there were \"no suitable brownfield sites in east Suffolk\" for the substations.",
      "Have any campaign groups spoken about the government's recent announcement?",
      "Campaign group Stop Sizewell C has been vocal against the nuclear power station for a number of years.",
      "Alison Downes, executive director of the group, said on Thursday that the prime minister's comments suggested people were \"always winning legal challenges\" \u2013 which was \"very far from being the case\".",
      "She felt the decision could \"erode the right\" for people to defend where they live.",
      "\"Sometimes [legal challenges] are the only means left to address fundamental flaws in a project that have not been addressed either by the developers or by ministers,\" she said.",
      "\"It's people most affected by a project who are the ones who take the time and trouble to really read the detail and understand where all the difficulties are that quite often ministers and developers will try to gloss over, and which potentially could lead to very serious problems down the line.\"",
      "What did the energy secretary say?",
      "During a visit to the Port of Lowestoft on Thursday, Energy Security Secretary Ed Miliband told the BBC it was \"absolutely right\" for local people to be able to have a judicial review over what the government was doing.",
      "However, he said there was often an \"endless cycle of case after case on the same issue\".",
      "\"I think we were elected to make a different choice as a country, which is [to] listen to local people [and] make sure that local communities get direct benefit if they host clean energy infrastructure, but also to build that infrastructure that is in the interest of the country,\" he added.",
      "What happens next?",
      "The government said it planned to use the upcoming Planning and Infrastructure Bill in March to introduce legislative changes to \"drive action at a strategic level\", providing certainty for developers and the environment.",
      "It also promised to make 150 major infrastructure project decisions by the next election.",

      "And if diplomacy is the art of finding shared interests and instincts, particularly if one or the other or both might be in short supply, the way Downing Street and the White House described this first conversation since the inauguration is a case study in just that: diplomacy.",
      "Sources in London describe the call as \"very warm\" and \"very personal\". It appears the big picture, and getting to know each other, was the aim, rather than policy detail.",
      "It is, of course, on the policy detail that disagreements loiter.",
      "But for now at least there appears to be an effort on both sides to establish a rapport and for each to size the other up \u2013 all ahead of a trip to Washington the prime minister is expected to make in the next handful of weeks.",
      "It is convention when two international leaders speak for each side to issue what is known as a \"read out\" afterwards \u2013 how each side interpreted how the call went and what was discussed.",
      "These read outs tend to broadly overlap, otherwise it would appear each side was talking about a different call, but differences of emphasis and language are worth looking for.",
      "As you would expect, they discussed the ceasefire in the Middle East and the release of the British-Israeli hostage Emily Damari.",
      "Also, as you would expect, both sides mentioned the president's love of the Royal Family, a vital and unique diplomatic lever the prime minister has at his disposal in the coming years of managing his relationship with the White House.",
      "There was mention too of the president's condolences to the prime minister over the recent death of his younger brother, Nick.",
      "But two other sentences, one from each read out, struck me most.",
      "First, a sentence from Downing Street.",
      "A Downing Street spokesman said the two men \"discussed trade and the economy, with the prime minister setting out how we are deregulating to boost growth\".",
      "A counterintuitive thing for a left wing leader to say - talk of deregulation - but a magic word to use in the company of President Trump.",
      "And it is a consistent thing for the prime minister to be saying: both he and Chancellor Rachel Reeves have been emphasising it in various guises over the last few days as they have really leant into their desire for economic growth.",
      "We will hear more about it this week, including in a key speech from Reeves on Wednesday and various other announcements before and after that speech.",
      "Second, a sentence from the White House.",
      "A spokesman there said \"the two leaders also discussed\u2026how both countries can promote a fair bilateral economic relationship\".",
      "No explicit mention of tariffs, or import taxes, but we know they are threatened by President Trump on America's friends as well as foes.",
      "But that sentence, with that reference to \"fair\" appears to be doing a lot of work to smile through what could be some bumpy conversations ahead.",
      "Bumpy, though, is for another day, appears to be the vibe. For now at least.",

    "story": [
      "The closure of Strangers' bar, in the House of Commons, while an alleged spiking incident is investigated has thrown the spotlight on Westminster's drinking culture and what goes on in its many watering holes.",
      "You are certainly never far from a bar in the Palace of Westminster.",
      "For centuries, British politics has floated along on a tide of booze. Drink is part of the fabric of the place, but the drinking dens of Parliament are not what you might imagine.",
      "The bars reserved exclusively for MPs and peers \u2013 in the deeper recesses of the ancient building \u2013 such as the Pugin Room or the Members' Smoking Room (which is now non-smoking) may have the feel of a Mayfair gentlemen's club, all leather armchairs and hushed tones.",
      "But the most popular venue on the estate, The Woolsack, is more like a traditional British pub that you would find in any market square or High Street.",
      "Closing bars could risk MPs' safety, says minister",
      "Westminster drinking culture blamed for bad behaviour",
      "Parliament bar closed after alleged spiking incident",
      "Until 2018, it was called the Sports and Social Club but was rebranded and placed under new management after it gained a reputation for drunken brawls and other misdemeanours.",
      "Slightly shabby and old school, with its wood panelling, trophy cabinets and a carpet that has seen better days, it does a roaring trade with a younger, after-work crowd.",
      "This is where researchers, Parliamentary staff and the occasional MP come to talk shop and catch up with gossip.",
      "It is not easy to find, tucked away in a courtyard between loading bays with no sign outside, adding to the clubby sense of exclusivity that must be part of the attraction.",
      "It's open to passholders with a maximum of two guests and taking pictures or filming is strictly prohibited.",
      "The prices are attractive too. You can get a pint of House of Lords lager for \u00a34.30, for example, a pint of San Miguel for \u00a35.25 or a small glass of Sauvignon Blanc for \u00a35.60.",
      "This is pretty cheap for central London. Similar drinks at pubs within easy walking distance of Parliament, such as the Red Lion, the St Stephen's Tavern or the Marquis of Granby would set you back a bit more (according to our extensive research).",
      "The Parliamentary authorities insist drinks on the estate are not directly subsidised - and are \"benchmarked\" against prices in the outside world.",
      "But the Commons catering department, which oversees 27 bars, restaurants and cafes, as well as banqueting services, was subsidised by taxpayers in 2022/23 to the tune of \u00a36.4m, according to the annual accounts.",
      "Until it was closed, Strangers' bar also did a roaring trade, particularly in the summer months when it serves drinks to thirsty punters on the Commons terrace, enjoying spectacular views of the Thames.",
      "It is smaller and has a more upmarket feel than The Woolsack, but has also seen its share of bad behaviour over the years.",
      "When late night sittings were more common, it would be packed with increasingly inebriated MPs and party whips, trying to keep them in line.",
      "Journalists have traditionally headed to Strangers if they want to a catch a word with an MP.",
      "(The Westminster press pack have their own bar and caf\u00e9, Moncrieff's, named after the late, and legendary, Press Association reporter Chris Moncrieff, but few seem to use it.)",
      "Along the corridor from Strangers, you will find function rooms which are another hub of Westminster's social life, playing host to receptions and events most evenings where the (free) booze flows.",
      "Speaking on condition of anonymity, one member of the catering staff tells me that the excitement can sometimes go to guests' heads.",
      "\"I've never seen anyone throw up. I've seen four or five pass out,\" he says.",
      "The majority of MPs are polite and courteous to the staff, he says, but like most things at Westminster, when there is bad behaviour it tends to divide along party lines.",
      "\"The more pretentious Tory MPs will say 'do you know who I am?'. Labour ones are more like 'do you know how important I am?',\" he laughs.",
      "One thing he has noticed is that the new intake of MPs seem to be a less boozy crowd than their predecessors.",
      "Last July's general election saw an unprecedented clear out of MPs, and many of the 350 new MPs are younger, and more likely to have school age children.",
      "One of the new intake, Liberal Democrat Steff Aquarone, 40, thinks Westminster's bar culture is well past its sell by date.",
      "\"This one of the few remaining places where it's still possible to drink at lunchtime in the workplace. Most of the rest of the world of industry has moved on from that.\"",
      "The North Norfolk MP says this is \"problematic\" because \"it creates all sorts of circumstances where behaviours that are not only undesirable but in some cases wholly toxic end up becoming accepted as the price of socialising\".",
      "Commons leader Lucy Powell argued this week that it was safer for MPs and their staff to drink in Westminster's bars, where they are protected by security guards and codes of conduct, than in ordinary London pubs.",
      "Aquarone says he understands Powell's point but, he argues, some people in Parliament need to be protected from colleagues.",
      "\"If I wanted to go for a drink with my team, I could choose anywhere in London where no one would know who we were and no one would know that we were there and that's actually a far more secure way of having a safe night out.\"",
      "One new Labour MP said with many of the new intake in their 30s with young children, there may be some drinking on a Monday night when there's no vote until 10pm, but MPs are more aware that they shouldn't be drinking with staff.",
      "The terrace provided a good place to get to know new colleagues last summer and were bonding over booze, but the Labour MPs of old who had a pint at lunchtime are gone, they said.",
      "In fact, some new MPs are pushing for Parliament's bars to be closed at lunchtime, or even shut down altogether, as part of a modernisation programme.",
      "This would not go down well with ordinary Parliamentary staff or many of the 14,500 pass holders with access to the pubs and bars on the estate.",
      "\"Parliament is a unique place, it's like a village, why shouldn't we have a bar? It's the Houses of Parliament, not Ibiza,\" one woman, who has worked in Parliament for nearly three decades, tells me.",
      "She is enjoying an after work pint with a friend in the Lords Terrace bar, which has the slightly soulless feel of an airport lounge and tends to attract an older crowd.",
      "They both think the public have got the wrong idea about Westminster drinking \u2013 friends are always disappointed when they get to see what the bars are actually like, they say.",
      "\"It's just a place to relax and have a chat with your pals,\" says the woman, as she drains her pint and pulls on her coat.",
      "It's certainly hard to imagine life at Westminster without pubs and bars, but changing social attitudes are lapping at the gates of its historic drinking dens.",
      "Maybe one day they will call time.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 01:04:11 GMT",
    "summary": "The breeds show different reaction to clocks going back and forward, a study suggests.",
    "story": [
      "If you have ever struggled with the sudden shift in routine imposed by the seasonal \"springing forward\" and \"falling backward\" of the clocks, spare a thought for the sled dogs of Ontario, Canada.",
      "Researchers say the time shift is measurably unsettling for those working dogs, whose days are dictated by strict schedules.",
      "When scientists from the University of Toronto put movement sensors on a group of Canadian sled dogs, they saw that the animals were active and moving around almost exactly an hour early - the morning after the clocks went back.",
      "In contrast, pet dogs of the same breeds as the working dogs showed no measurable effect - apparently resting peacefully during their extra hour in bed.",
      "\"I wasn't expecting any differences between the two groups [of dogs],\" said Lavania Nagendran, one of the lead researchers.",
      "\"So it was interesting to see that the dogs were so aligned to their routine.\"",
      "The study, published in the journal PLoS One, is part of a wider project investigating the differences in behaviour between wolves and domestic dogs.",
      "\"Not all animals can just switch up their schedule based on human influences, [like changing the clocks]\" said Ming Fei Li, the co-lead researcher.",
      "She explained that she and her colleagues hoped to learn whether wolves are also able to adjust their activity patterns \u2013 and whether this flexibility evolved naturally in canines, or if it was imposed on dogs when we domesticated them.",
      "Much of the research into the impact of changing the clocks -  on health and sleep - is focused on humans. Previous studies have suggested that the time shift causes disrupted, or fragmented, sleep and that this can last up to a week. Research has even found an increase in fatal traffic accidents immediately after the clocks go back or forward.",
      "This is the first study to investigate its effect in domestic dogs.",
      "The researchers put their motion trackers on 25 sled dogs and 29 pets \u2013 all of which were in or near Ontario, in Canada.",
      "For the sled dogs, the time change was a sudden shift in a strict daily routine. Prior to the clocks going back, handlers would arrive at their kennels at sunrise. The morning when the clocks went back, those sled dogs were up, active and moving around an hour before the handlers appeared.",
      "For most of those working dogs, however, the disruption lasted just a day. The following morning, the majority of the dogs' activity again aligned with the arrival of their human handlers.",
      "However, for pet dogs there was no measurable disruption. After the clocks went back, their activity in the morning seemed to adjust to this new, human-imposed schedule.",
      "\"When we've spoken to pet owners, everyone comments that \u2013 with that hour change - their dog or cat is up in the morning, going crazy, waiting to be fed.",
      "\"But we didn't really find that in pet dogs in our study.\"",
      "The team carried out their research in 2021, when Covid lockdown restrictions were in place in Canada. So they advertised for pet-owning participants, who had huskies or malamutes, to join their study remotely.",
      "\"They were amazing,\" recalled Li. \"They'd ask us questions, put the trackers we sent them by post on their dogs' [collars], most of them kept really good notes.\"",
      "The researchers say their \"takeaway finding\" is that, for working dogs, gradually easing into a timetable change might be beneficial.",
      "Because, while you can teach an old dog a new routine, such an abrupt, overnight shift can be unsettling. Unless, of course, you Are a pet with no work demands and a particularly comfortable dog bed."

      "This doesn't mean there was ever life on Bennu, but it supports the theory that asteroids delivered these vital ingredients to Earth when they crashed into our planet billions of years ago.",

      "\"What we've learned from it is amazing,\" said Prof Sara Russell, a cosmic mineralogist from the Natural History Museum in London.",

      "\"It's just incredible how rich it is. It's full of these minerals that we haven't seen before in meteorites and the combination of them that we haven't seen before. It's been such an exciting thing to study,\" said Prof Russell.",
      "'Most dangerous asteroid' sample arrives in UK",
      "Nasa's first look at 'beautiful' asteroid sample",
      "This latest study adds to growing evidence that asteroids brought water and organic material to Earth.",
      "\"The early Solar System was really turbulent and there were millions of asteroids like Bennu flying about,\" explained Dr Ashley King, from the Natural History Museum.",
      "The idea is that these bombarded the young Earth, seeding our planet with ingredients that gave us the oceans and made life possible.",
      "But Earth wasn't the only world getting hit by space rocks. Asteroids would have been colliding  with other planets too.",
      "\"Earth is unique, in that it's the only place where we have found life so far, but we know asteroids were delivering those ingredients, the carbon and the water, throughout the Solar System,\" said Dr King.",
      "\"And one of the big things that we're trying to understand now is, if you have the right conditions, why do we have life here on Earth - and could we potentially find it elsewhere in our Solar System?\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 22:11:56 GMT",
    "summary": "Scientists say the fires that engulfed Los Angeles were made 35% more likely due to climate warming.",
    "story": [
      "Climate change was a major factor behind the hot, dry weather that gave rise to the devastating LA fires, a scientific study has confirmed.",
      "It made those weather conditions about 35% more likely, according to World Weather Attribution - globally recognised for their studies linking extreme weather to climate change.",
      "The authors noted that the LA wildfire season is getting longer while the rains that normally put out the blazes have reduced.",
      "The scientists highlight that these wildfires are highly complex with multiple factors playing a role, but they are confident that a warming climate is making LA more prone to intense fire events.",
      "\"Climate change increased the risk of the devastating LA wildfires,\" said Dr Clair Barnes, from Imperial College London, the study's lead author.",
      "\"Drought conditions are more frequently pushing into winter, increasing the chance a fire will break out during strong Santa Ana winds that can turn small ignitions into deadly infernos.\"",
      "The Santa Ana winds are strong and gusty east or north-easterly winds that blow from inland California towards the coast.",
      "What are Santa Ana winds and how are they fuelling LA wildfires?",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Four ways climate change worsens extreme weather",
      "Around 30 people have died and more than 10,000 homes have been destroyed in the fast-spreading, destructive fires that broke out in early January.",
      "This new study looks at what are termed the fire-prone conditions that can lead to dangerous conflagrations.",
      "It's been carried out by a team of researchers from World Weather Attribution (WWA), a global group that publishes rapid analyses of climate-related weather events.",
      "They use climate models to simulate how the warming that has occurred since the middle of the 19th century is influencing heatwaves, droughts, floods and fires.",
      "The widespread burning of coal, oil and gas in the wake of the industrial revolution has driven billions of tonnes of planet-warming gases into the atmosphere.",
      "Acting like a blanket, these gases have driven up temperatures by around 1.2C since then.",
      "By using climate models and statistical methods along with real world observations, the WWA group have been able to show how much of an influence climate warming has had on extreme events.",
      "In the case of the LA fires, they found that the hot, dry conditions that drove them are expected to occur once every 17 years.",
      "This is an increase in likelihood of around 35% compared to a world that hadn't experienced warming.",
      "\"We actually see that the models show very much the same results that the [real world] observations have,\" said Dr Friederike Otto, the head of World Weather Attribution.",
      "\"So there, in this combined index, we are quite confident about the result... we have actually a signal that we can say that we definitely can attribute that, also quantitatively.\"",
      "The researchers also examined other important variables that can lead to wildfire including the length of the fire season.",
      "By analysing weather observations, the scientists found that this has increased by around 23 days since the world began warming, around 1850.",
      "The team say that this means the dry conditions and the Santa Ana winds that are crucial for the spread of fires, are increasingly overlapping.",
      "Another key element is drought.",
      "Dry conditions in the LA area over the October to December period are now about 2.4 times more likely than before humans starting using fossil fuels on a large scale.",
      "The researchers are clear that climate change increased the probability of the hot, dry conditions that gave rise to the fires.",
      "However, the authors are more cautious about the link between rising temperatures and the longer fire season or decreased rainfall, saying that the models did not show a significant connection.",
      "Despite these reservations, the conclusion is that a warmer world increased the chances of the devastating wildfires occurring - as more fossil fuels continue to be burnt, those chances will continue to rise.",
      "\"Overall the paper finds that climate change has made the Los Angeles fires more likely despite some statistical uncertainty,\" said Prof Gabi Hegerl, from the University of Edinburgh, who was not part of the study team.",
      "\"This is a carefully researched result that should be taken seriously,\" she said in a statement.",
      "The new work builds on research that was published while the fires were still burning fiercely.",
      "That study linked the wildfires to what's termed \"climate whiplash.\"",
      "The idea is that very wet years are followed almost immediately by very dry ones, which increases the risk of fires.",
      "This is what happened in LA, when two wet winters were followed by an extremely dry autumn and winter this year \u2013 the wet weather promoted the growth of grass and shrubs that became the fuel for the fires that took off in the gusting Santa Ana winds.",

      "In very simple terms, according to X, this \"bridging\" algorithm selects proposed notes that are rated helpful by volunteers who would normally disagree with each other.",

      "DeepSeek, a Chinese AI chatbot reportedly made at a fraction of the cost of its rivals, launched last week but has already become the most downloaded free app in the US.",
      "AI chip giant Nvidia and other tech firms connected to AI, including Microsoft and Google, saw their values tumble on Monday in the wake of DeepSeek's sudden rise.",
      "In a separate development, DeepSeek said on Monday it will temporarily limit registrations because of \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its software.",
      "What is DeepSeek and why did it cause tech stocks to drop?",
      "Is China's AI tool DeepSeek as good as it seems?",
      "The DeepSeek chatbot was reportedly developed for a fraction of the cost of its rivals, raising questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning.",
      "Last week, OpenAI joined a group of other firms who pledged to invest $500bn (\u00a3400bn) in building AI infrastructure in the US.",
      "President Donald Trump, in one of his first announcements since returning to office, called it \"the largest AI infrastructure project by far in history\" that would help keep \"the future of technology\" in the US.",
      "DeepSeek is powered by the open source DeepSeek-V3 model, which its researchers claim was trained for around $6m  - significantly less than the billions spent by rivals.",
      "But this claim has been disputed by others in AI.",
      "The researchers say they use already existing technology, as well as open source code - software that can be used, modified or distributed by anybody free of charge.",
      "DeepSeek's emergence comes as the US is restricting the sale of the advanced chip technology that powers AI to China.",
      "To continue their work without steady supplies of imported advanced chips, Chinese AI developers have shared their work with each other and experimented with new approaches to the technology.",
      "This has resulted in AI models that require far less computing power than before.",
      "It also means that they cost a lot less than previously thought possible, which has the potential to upend the industry.",
      "After DeepSeek-R1 was launched earlier this month, the company boasted of \"performance on par with\" one of OpenAI's latest models when used for tasks such as maths, coding and natural language reasoning.",
      "Silicon Valley venture capitalist and Trump adviser Marc Andreessen described DeepSeek-R1 as \"AI's Sputnik moment\", a reference to the satellite launched by the Soviet Union in 1957.",
      "At the time, the US was considered to have been caught off-guard by their rival's technological achievement.",
      "DeepSeek's sudden popularity has startled stock markets in Europe and the US.",

      "In Europe, Dutch chip equipment maker ASML ended Monday's trading with its share price down by more than 7% while shares in Siemens Energy, which makes hardware related to AI, had plunged by a fifth.",
      "\"This idea of a low-cost Chinese version hasn't necessarily been forefront, so it's taken the market a little bit by surprise,\" said Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City Index.",
      "\"So, if you suddenly get this low-cost AI model, then that's going to raise concerns over the profits of rivals, particularly given the amount that they've already invested in more expensive AI infrastructure.\"",
      "Singapore-based technology equity adviser Vey-Sern Ling told the BBC it could \"potentially derail the investment case for the entire AI supply chain\".",
      "But Wall Street banking giant Citi cautioned that while DeepSeek could challenge the dominant positions of American companies such as OpenAI, issues faced by Chinese firms could hamper their development.",
      "\"We estimate that in an inevitably more restrictive environment, US access to more advanced chips is an advantage,\" analysts said in a report.",
      "Meanwhile, DeepSeek said on Monday it had been the victim of a cyberattack.",
      "\"Due to large-scale malicious attacks on DeepSeek's services, we are temporarily limiting registrations to ensure continued service,\" it said in a statement.",
      "\"Existing users can log in as usual. Thanks for your understanding and support.\"",
      "Who founded DeepSeek?",
      "The company was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng in Hangzhou, a city in southeastern China.",
      "The 40-year-old, an information and electronic engineering graduate, also founded the hedge fund that backed DeepSeek.",
      "He reportedly built up a store of Nvidia A100 chips, now banned from export to China.",
      "Experts believe this collection - which some estimates put at 50,000 - led him to launch DeepSeek, by pairing these chips with cheaper, lower-end ones that are still available to import.",
      "Mr Liang was recently seen at a meeting between industry experts and the Chinese premier Li Qiang.",
      "In a July 2024 interview with The China Academy, Mr Liang said he was surprised by the reaction to the previous version of his AI model.",

      "Did you witness the incident? Get in touch",
      "What happened?",
      "At about 21:00 local time (02:00 GMT) on Wednesday, a PSA Airlines jet operating as American Airlines 5342 collided with a US Army helicopter as it approached Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).",
      "The passenger plane broke into multiple pieces and sunk several feet into the river, while the helicopter ended up upside down on the water, reports said.",
      "The plane, a Bombardier CRJ700, departed from Wichita, Kansas and was carrying 60 passengers and four crew, American Airlines said.",
      "According to updates from officials, the helicopter was a Sikorsky H-60 that took off from Fort Belvoir in Virginia with three soldiers on board, and belonged to B Company, 12th Aviation Battalion.",
      "Hegseth said the aircraft was on an annual proficiency flight, performing a night evaluation with standard goggles. He said names and ranks were being withheld until their next-of-kin had been informed.",
      "A clip published online by LiveATC.net, which streams air traffic, purports to capture the air traffic control conversation in the moments before the crash. A controller can reportedly be heard warning the helicopter about the plane, but receiving no reply. The audio has not been verified by the BBC.",
      "The FAA said it would investigate the incident, together with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Hegseth said he expected this to quickly establish whether the helicopter was flying in the right corridor and altitude.",
      "How many victims are there?",
      "DC Fire and EMS Chief John Donnelly said in a Thursday morning update that officials \"don't believe there are any survivors from this accident\".",
      "He said teams had recovered 27 bodies from the plane, and one from the helicopter.",
      "A law enforcement source familiar with the investigation earlier told CBS that a higher number of at least 30 bodies had already been found.",
      "US Figure Skating said \"several members of our skating community were sadly aboard\" the flight. It said this group comprised athletes, coaches and family members who were returning home from a development camp in Kansas.",
      "Russian citizens were also on board, the Kremlin confirmed - after local media reported that ice skating coaches and former world champions Yevgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov were on the plane.",
      "About 300 responders on rubber boats were earlier deployed to search for survivors, Donnelly said in an earlier update. \"The challenge is access, there is wind, pieces of ice (on the water). It is dangerous and hard to work in,\" he said.",
      "What are eyewitnesses saying?",
      "Ari Schulman told NBC Washington that he saw the plane crash while driving on the George Washington Parkway, which runs along the airport.",
      "He said the plane's approach looked normal, until he saw the aircraft bank hard to the right, with \"streams of sparks\" running underneath, illuminating its belly.",
      "At that point, he said he knew that it looked \"very, very wrong\". Having seen plane landings there in the past, he said a plane's underside should not have been visible in the dark.",
      "The sparks, he said, resembled a \"giant roman candle\" and went from the plane's nose to its tail.",
      "Jimmy Mazeo said he saw the crash while having dinner with his girlfriend at a park near the airport.",
      "He recalled seeing what looked like a \"white flare\" in the sky. He said planes flying into Ronald Reagan Airport appeared to have been flying in \"irregular patterns\".",
      "Mr Mazeo said he did not think much of what he saw until emergency services started arriving at the scene.",
      "What are US officials saying?",
      "In a press conference on Thursday, President Donald Trump said the country was \"in mourning\", also taking the opportunity to take a swipe at his political foes, who he accused of hiring \"mediocre\" staff for air traffic control jobs. He repeated his attacks on efforts under former President Joe Biden to promote diversity (known as DEI) within the federal workforce.",
      "Trump said he and his team had \"strong opinions and ideas\" about what had happened, but acknowledged that the investigation was at an early stage.",
      "He also announced he was appointing Chris Rocheleau as the temporary head of the  Federal Aviation Administration. Both the top role in the FAA, administrator, and the deputy administrator have been vacant since Trump took office.",
      "Speaking at the same press conference, Transport Secretary Sean Duffy and Hegseth vowed to get to the bottom of the incident.",
      "American Airlines CEO Robert Isom expressed his \"deep sorrow\" about the collision in a video which has been posted to the airline's website.",
      "That was echoed by Roger Marshall, a US senator representing Kansas, where the plane had travelled from. He described a \"heartbreak beyond measure\".",
      "What's the US's air safety record?",
      "Major incidents of this kind are relatively rare in the US. The most recent comparable crash was in 2009, according to a list compiled by Reuters.",
      "That year, an aircraft crashed on approach to landing in Buffalo, New York, killing all 49 people on board and one person on the ground.",
      "The airspace above Washington DC is both busy and highly controlled. It is used by domestic and international traffic using two airports, and there are extra factors of presidential flights, heavy military traffic and flights around the Pentagon.",
      "Passenger airliners must follow fixed flight plans, said the BBC's transport correspondent Sean Dilley. In uncontrolled airspace, military pilots operate under strict instruction of air traffic controllers but unlike their civilian counterparts, they have freedom to deviate and a duty to \"see and avoid\" other aircraft."

      "Tensions seemingly eased after Ramaphosa's visit to Rwanda last year for commemorations to mark the 30th anniversary of the genocide in which about 800,000 people were killed.",
      "But they have flared up again, following the death of the South Africans who were deployed to eastern DR Congo in December 2023 as part of a regional peace-keeping force sent by the Southern African Development Community (Sadc)",
      "South African soldiers make up the bulk of the force - known by the acronym SAMIDRC - that had the mission of repelling armed groups such as the M23 and bringing peace to the mineral-rich region following decades of unrest.",
      "The latest diplomatic fall-out started with a post shared on Ramaphosa's X page.",
      "In it, the president confirmed he had spoken to Kagame about the escalating conflict and that both leaders had agreed \"on the urgent need for a ceasefire and the resumption of peace talks by all parties to the conflict\".",
      "Ramaphosa also insisted, in a later statement, that the presence of South African troops in DR Congo was not a \"declaration of war against any country or state\" - an apparent reference to Rwanda.",
      "South Africa's Defence Minister Angie Motshekga, however, had a slightly different take, telling reporters: \"There's been no hostilities between us, it's just that when they were firing above our heads, the president did warn them [that] if you're going to fire, we're going to take that as a declaration of war.\"",
      "But Ramaphosa went further on X, saying the peacekeepers were killed in attacks by the M23 and - he pointedly added - \"Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) militia\".",
      "This angered Kagame, who said statements made by South African officials - including Ramaphosa - contained lies and distortion.",
      "\"The Rwanda Defence Force is an army, not a militia,\" Kagame replied on X.",
      "\"President Ramaphosa has never given a 'warning' of any kind, unless it was delivered in his local language which I do not understand. He did ask for support to ensure the South African force has adequate electricity, food and water, which we shall help communicate.",
      "\"President Ramaphosa confirmed to me that M23 did not kill the soldiers from South Africa, [the Conglese army] FARDC did,\" Kagame said.",
      "He added that the regional peacekeepers - who included troops from Tanzania and Malawi - were a \"belligerent force\" working alongside \"genocidal armed groups\" that targeted Rwanda, and had \"no place in this situation\".",
      "Kagame closed his lengthy statement by saying South Africa was in \"no position to take on the role of a peacemaker or mediator\" and if the country wanted a confrontation, Rwanda would \"deal with the matter in that context any day\".",

      "What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?",
      "The evidence that shows Rwanda is backing rebels in DR Congo",
      "Kagame's comments clearly suggested that he wants South Africa to back off from DR Congo, where its military involvement dates back to the late 1990s.",
      "It first joined the UN's peacekeeping mission, Monusco, following the end of the racist system of apartheid in 1994.",
      "At the time, the South Africa's military had just emerged from being regarded as a \"highly effective apartheid war-time force\" to a \"peacetime force\" left to grapple with reduced funding and a \"lack of political direction\", Thomas Mandrup, an associate professor at the country's Stellenbosch University, told the BBC.",
      "While South Africa has said its involvement in DR Congo was guided by its need to \"contribute to the stability\" of a fellow Sadc member, defence analyst Dean Wingrin said the country's economic interests also influenced its decision.",
      "\"The DRC is a very big trading partner with [us] because eastern DRC is so rich in minerals. We import a lot of minerals\u2026 from the DRC so South Africa has an interest in a peaceful DRC,\" he told the BBC.",
      "While Monusco's mission has largely been about peacekeeping, escalating tensions in the region led to the establishment of the Force Intervention Brigade in 2013 to \"actively engage\" with the numerous armed groups in eastern DR Congo.",
      "This intervention had initial success in repelling the M23, the most prominent rebel group.",
      "This was partly due to the deployment of South Africa's attack aircraft - Rooivalk - which had a \"devastating effect\" on the M23 in a short space of time, according to Mr Wingrin.",
      "The rebel group then effectively melted away and was subsequently expelled from eastern DR Congo - until its recent comeback which has seen it capture much of the region.",
      "However, South Africa's military has been in no position, this time around, to thwart the rebel group's advance as it has lost its airpower.",
      "\"Unfortunately South Africa's budget has continued to decline over the years. The air force couldn't afford to maintain the Rooivalks,\" Mr Wingrin said.",
      "\"We're missing that vital aircover that would've come in so handy a few days ago but is way too late now,\" he said.",
      "Mr Mandrup expressed a similar view, saying South Africa deployed its troops in 2023, ignoring warnings that \"you haven't got the capabilities needed, the defence force is in shambles and you're facing an opponent that's much better equipped than in 2013\".",
      "He added that it was difficult for South Africa to bring back its troops at this point because the \"forces are locked down and caught in two bases\".",
      "\"They can't get out, get aircover [or] reinforcements. They can't even get the wounded out,\" he said.",
      "Ramaphosa seemed to agree, saying in a recent statement that the situation in the region was \"tense, volatile and unpredictable\".",
      "In spite of this, any decision to pull South African troops out of DR Congo ultimately lies with Sadc since SAMIDRC was deployed by the 16-member regional bloc.",
      "There are reports that Sadc is set to take this decision at a summit taking place on Friday.",
      "For Mr Wingrin, there was a need for the South African government to do \"serious introspection\" over its military involvement in DR Congo.",
      "\"Is it something they want to push at all costs and what is it worth to South Africa to have sons and daughters dying so far away?\" he asked.",
      "So, South Africa's president appears to have a difficult choice \u2013 keep his soldiers in DR Congo and risk further deaths, or the embarrassment of pulling them out, presumably after negotiating safe passage for them with Rwanda.",

      "Israeli military and medical personnel are also assembled at several different locations, waiting to bring them home.",
      "\u200b\u200bThe hostage releases, watched around the world, come after months of tense negotiations aimed at ending a war that began on 7 October 2023, when Hamas fighters killed some 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 251 others.",
      "In the 15 months that followed, more than 47,000 Palestinians were killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and many more lost their homes in Israeli bombardments.",

      "Crucial planning",
      "There are some details that the group cannot speak about publicly because of concerns that it could compromise the security of the operation.",
      "Ms Davies says planning is crucial to ensuring that the exchange runs smoothly. They have mapped out alternative routes to get to different locations in Gaza, knowing that the \"safest route can change\" at any time.",

      "The journalist was also there for the second release - at a different location in Gaza City - the following week, which he describes as being \"more organised\".",
      "The fighters set up a small stage area with a desk and chairs, and stood in formation to separate the hostages from the crowds.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 18:14:17 GMT",
    "summary": "In a huge blow to Ecowas, Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger are leaving to forge ahead with their own group.",
    "story": [
      "Three countries under military rule have officially left West African regional bloc Ecowas, after more than a year of diplomatic tensions.",
      "The withdrawal of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger is a huge blow to Ecowas, which at 50 years old is considered Africa's most important regional group.",
      "The split was sparked after the three departing countries refused Ecowas demands to restore diplomatic rule.",
      "On Wednesday Ecowas said it would keep its \"doors open\" to Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, even though they have forged ahead with their own bloc, the Alliance of Sahel States (AES by its French acronym).",
      "What is Ecowas?",
      "Ecowas - which stands for the Economic Community of West African States - was founded in 1975 in a bid to improve economic and political integration in West Africa.",
      "Prior to Wednesday's shake-up, the bloc had 15 members, including states like Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Senegal.",
      "Citizens of all Ecowas countries currently have the right to live and work in all member states, while goods can circulate freely.",
      "Why have Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso left?",
      "Relations between Ecowas and the three Sahel countries have been tense since the military seized power in Niger in 2023, Burkina Faso in 2022 and Mali in 2020.",
      "After the Niger coup, Ecowas imposed crippling sanctions on the country, such as border closures, a no-fly zone for all commercial flights and the freezing of central bank assets.",
      "Ecowas also threatened to deploy its forces to Niger in order to restore democratic rule.",
      "But this hard line merely strengthened the resolve of the three juntas.",
      "Mali and Burkina Faso criticised Ecowas' \"inhuman\" sanctions and vowed to defend Niger if the bloc intervened militarily.",
      "After being suspended by Ecowas, the three states hit back by giving notice last January that they would withdraw in a year, meeting the timeline set by the bloc for states that decide to leave.",
      "Negotiations between Ecowas and the juntas have taken place since then - but have failed.",
      "The three countries accuse Ecowas of being too close to Western powers and have instead pivoted towards Russia.",
      "How will the withdrawal affect the three countries?",
      "According to the departing countries, they will now experience greater sovereignty and also independence from a force that has a foreign agenda.",
      "But analysts say Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso may struggle outside the bloc - these are poor and landlocked countries whose economies depend on their West African neighbours.",
      "While Ecowas works out the terms of its future relationship with the three countries, it says it will continue to recognise all passports and identity cards bearing the Ecowas logo held by citizens from Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso.",
      "The countries will also remain in the bloc's free-trade scheme.",
      "Similarly, AES chairman, Mali's military ruler Assimi Go\u00efta, said last January that the right of Ecowas citizens to \"enter, circulate, reside, establish and leave the territory\" of the new bloc would be maintained.",
      "Ilyasu Gadu, an international affairs expert and media consultant based in Nigeria's capital Abuja, told the BBC: \"The three junta leaders have taken steps to say: 'Yes, we are pulling out of Ecowas but we want to maintain our relationships. We will not close our borders' because they must have realised that if they do that, they would have shot themselves in the foot.\"",
      "West Africa observers are also concerned the withdrawal will worsen security in the region. The Sahel - the semi-arid region just south of the Sahara Desert that includes the three departing countries - is wracked with jihadist insurgencies and now accounts for \"almost half of all deaths from terrorism globally\", a senior UN official said in April.",
      "Ecowas was supporting Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger in their fight against the jihadists, but this help may now be rescinded, observers fear.",
      "Although the juntas now receive weapons and mercenaries from Russia, the militants continue to inflict heavy casualties on both civilians and the armed forces.",
      "How will Ecowas be impacted?",
      "Ecowas will lose 76 million of its 446 million people and more than half its total geographical land area.",
      "There are also concerns the withdrawal will weaken both regional unity and cooperation in combatting insurgencies.",
      "The split \"worsens a legitimacy crisis of ECOWAS which has often failed people's expectations in upholding the rule of law,\" Ulf Laessing, head of the Sahel program at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, told the Associated Press.",
      "\"That the three poorest member states decided to leave the bloc makes Ecowas in the eyes of its citizens look even more like a loser in this conflict.\"",
      "How do residents of Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso feel?",
      "On Tuesday, some people in the three departing countries' capitals took to the streets to celebrate the withdrawal.",
      "But not everyone supports the juntas' decisions.",
      "Omar Hama from Niger said he wished the three countries had remained in Ecowas, while simultaneously belonging to the AES.",
      "\"I would have liked them to overcome their differences because we have a common space, same people with historical similarities and same economic realities,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Fatouma Harber, a journalist and blogger living in Mali, is worried that the change may eventually cause administrative and economic hassles for her and other citizens of the three countries.",
      "\"However, if the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) can really bring benefits for us, that would be an excellent thing,\" she said.",
      "Zabeirou Issa, who lives in Mali's capital Bamako, took a firmer stance, saying: \"Ecowas does not have any power, it is the Westerners who decide for the Ecowas leaders. Yes, I am very happy about the decision.\"",
      "In Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso's capital, Cisse Kabore told the BBC she wanted her country to remain in Ecowas because now the region \"will no longer be united as before\".",
      "What happens next?",
      "Last month, Ecowas said it would give Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali a six-month grace period for them to reconsider their withdrawal.",
      "However, at a press conference on Wednesday, Ecowas Commission head Omar Alieu Touray said: \"Any state can decide to come back in the community at any time.\"",
      "To consolidate their exit from Ecowas and strenghten their alliance, the three countries said they would begin circulating new AES passports on Wednesday.",
      "They have also decided to join forces to create a 5,000-strong military unit to fight the jihadist violence that has plagued the nations for years.",

    "story": [
      "Sanctioned Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich could owe the UK up to \u00a31bn after a botched attempt to avoid tax on hedge fund investments, evidence seen by the BBC suggests.",
      "Leaked papers reveal investments worth $6bn (\u00a34.7bn) were routed through companies in the British Virgin Islands (BVI). But evidence suggests they were managed from the UK, so should have been taxed there.",
      "Some of the money that funded Chelsea FC when Mr Abramovich owned it can be traced back to companies involved in the scheme, the BBC and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) also found.",
      "The oligarch's lawyers said he \"always obtained independent expert professional tax and legal advice\" and \"acted in accordance with that advice\".",
      "Mr Abramovich - who now reportedly divides his time between Istanbul, Tel Aviv and the Russian resort of Sochi - denies having any knowledge of or being personally responsible for any unpaid tax.",
      "Joe Powell, a Labour MP who leads a Parliamentary group on fair taxation, called on HM Revenue and Customs to \"urgently\" investigate the case to recover what could be \"very significant amounts of money that could be invested in public services\".",
      "At the heart of the scheme was Eugene Shvidler, a former Chelsea FC director and a billionaire businessman in his own right, who is currently challenging the UK government's decision to sanction him for his close links to Mr Abramovich.",
      "Mr Shvidler moved to the USA after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but from 2004 until 2022 he lived in the UK, with properties in London and Surrey.",
      "A tax expert told the BBC that evidence Mr Shvidler had been making strategic decisions on the investments while based in the UK, and not in the BVI, was \"a pretty big smoking gun\", suggesting the companies should have been paying UK tax.",
      "Lawyers for Mr Shvidler said the BBC was basing its reporting on \"confidential business documents that present an incomplete picture\" and had \"drawn strong and erroneous conclusions as to Mr Shvidler's conduct\".",
      "They said \"the structure of investments\" was \"the subject of very careful and detailed tax planning, undertaken and advised on by leading tax advisors\".",
      "The scheme involving Mr Abramovich's hedge fund investments was revealed in a huge leak of data that the BBC and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism have been examining for over a year - thousands of files and emails from a Cyprus-based company that administered Mr Abramovich's global empire.",
      "The BBC and its media partners, including The Guardian, have been reporting on the leaked files since 2023 as part of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists' Cyprus Confidential investigation. On Tuesday, we revealed how Mr Abramovich had dodged millions in VAT on the running costs of his yacht fleet.",
      "The leaked data shows how Mr Abramovich invested a large part of the wealth he acquired in the 1990s through a corrupt deal - ploughing it into a company in the BVI called Keygrove Holdings Ltd.",
      "A network of British Virgin Islands companies owned by Keygrove invested this money - up to $6bn (\u00a34.8bn) between the late 1990s and early 2020s - into Western hedge funds, according to the leaked files.",
      "These investments made the oligarch an estimated $3.8bn (\u00a33.1bn) in profits over almost two decades. By making the investments through companies in the BVI, which does not levy tax on corporate profits, the scheme appears to be set up to ensure as little tax as possible was paid.",
      "'Full power to do anything'",
      "It is not unusual for businesses to legally avoid paying tax on their profits by making their investments from companies in tax havens. But the companies involved must be managed and controlled offshore where they are incorporated.",
      "If an offshore company's strategic decisions are being taken by someone in the UK, its profits could be taxed as if it were a UK company.",
      "The leaked documents show how the directors of the BVI investment companies handed sweeping powers over them to Mr Shvidler, who was living in the UK and gained British citizenship in 2010.",
      "The BBC has seen \"general power of attorney\" documents dated between 2004 and 2008, that gave him the \"broadest possible powers\" and \"full power to do everything and anything\" to investment companies in the BVI.",
      "From 2008, Mr Shvidler appears to have acquired the power to direct the investments of Keygrove, which owned the BVI companies, through another company.",
      "Millennium Capital Ventures Ltd, which was owned indirectly by Mr Shvidler's wife and appointed him as a director in 2000, became Keygrove's investment manager. It was assigned \"full power and authority to supervise and direct\" the investment of the assets, \"all without prior consultation with client\".",
      "'Strong evidence'",
      "Further evidence of Mr Shvidler's crucial role in the investment decisions of the BVI companies emerged in a court case brought in September 2023 by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against a New York firm called Concord Management.",
      "The SEC filing says that Concord had only one client, since identified as Mr Abramovich. The company advised on investment decisions for the oligarch's BVI companies.",
      "It identifies a \"longtime close associate\" of Mr Abramovich, referred to as \"Person B\", who \"made investment decisions\" for Mr Abramovich.",
      "It says he was \"the point of contact for receiving investment advice\" and \"for either deciding or communicating the decision whether to go forward with recommended transactions\".",
      "Using the leaked documents, the BBC was able to identify \"Person B\" as Eugene Shvidler.",
      "The evidence suggests Mr Shvidler was making the decisions described by the SEC, managing and controlling Mr Abramovich's investments, from the UK rather than the BVI.",
      "Tax expert Rita de le Feria told the BBC that evidence a UK resident, such as Mr Shvidler, was taking \"strategic big decisions\" on the hedge fund investments was a \"clear indication\" the huge profits should have been taxed by the UK.",
      "\"I think this is a pretty big smoking gun. That would be, again, strong evidence that the effective management of the company was not taking place in the BVI,\" she said.",
      "Mr Shvidler's lawyers said there can be \"no question of Mr Shvidler, either knowingly or negligently, being involved in an unlawful scheme to avoid paying tax\".",
      "Lawyers for Mr Abramovich said that in addition to the advice he obtained over his tax affairs, he \"expects that similar advice was sought\" by those with responsibility for running companies related to him.",
      "The leaked documents also reveal how large amounts of the untaxed profits from Mr Abramovich's hedge fund investments passed through a network of the oligarch's companies before flowing into Chelsea FC.",
      "The hedge fund investments flowed back into his companies in the BVI and then into Keygrove, their parent company.",
      "Keygrove then loaned out money to other companies in Mr Abramovich's network, which in turn lent money to Camberley International Investments Ltd - a company set up to bankroll Chelsea FC.",
      "By 2021, when Chelsea won the Champions League, Club World Cup and UEFA Super Cup, hundreds of millions of dollars in loans to the club could be traced back to companies benefiting from Mr Abramovich's untaxed hedge fund investments.",
      "How we calculated the bill",
      "If HMRC were to investigate, how much could Mr Abramovich or the companies concerned owe?",
      "We have assessed the profits made by the investment companies in the BVI from 1999 to 2018.",
      "The leaked documents only contain complete accounts for the companies investing in hedge funds from 2013 to 2018.",
      "But we can estimate how much money the companies involved were likely to have made over the entire period by looking at their \"revenue reserves\". These are profits kept in the businesses, rather than being paid out to shareholders. By the end of 2018 this amounted to $3.8bn.",
      "Applying historical UK corporation tax and currency conversion rates to the revenue reserves up to 2012, and the yearly profits to 2018, amounts to a potential tax bill of more than \u00a3500m owed to HMRC.",
      "But in the event of an enquiry into unpaid tax, HMRC can also impose late payment interest and penalties for failure to notify the authorities.",
      "If tax has gone unpaid, then depending on whether an investigation concluded those responsible knew but did not tell HMRC, or whether they did not know, the total amount due could range from almost \u00a3700m to over \u00a31bn.",
      "There is a possibility that some tax on the profits could not be recovered, as HMRC investigations can only go back a maximum of 20 years.",
      "However, our calculations are also likely to be an underestimate, because we have applied the lowest rate of corporation tax that existed between 1999 and 2012, and it is possible profits had been extracted from the companies in that period that we have not included in our sums.",
      "In any event, Mr Abramovich's tax bill could dwarf the \u00a3653m bill imposed on Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone in 2023.",
      "Frozen funds",
      "Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the British government allowed Roman Abramovich to sell Chelsea FC to Todd Boehly. It did so on the condition that \u00a32.5bn from the proceeds would be donated to charities supporting victims of the war in Ukraine.",
      "Nearly three years later, the money still sits in a frozen Barclays bank account, reportedly due to disagreement over how it should be spent, with Mr Abramovich wanting the money to go to \"all the victims\" of the war, and the UK government insisting it should be spent solely on humanitarian aid in Ukraine.",
      "The BBC's investigation suggests that, just as Ukrainians are waiting for money from the former Chelsea boss, so is the British taxpayer.",
      "Cyprus Confidential is international collaborative investigation launched in 2023 led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) into Cyprus firms provided corporate and financial services to associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin's regime, based on documents from a corporate service provider originally obtained by the whistleblowing group Distributed Denial of Secrets.",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 12:37:50 GMT",
    "summary": "How did a little-known Chinese start-up build a powerful new AI model despite restrictions?",
    "story": [
      "When ChatGPT stormed the world of artificial intelligence (AI), an inevitable question followed: did it spell trouble for China, America's biggest tech rival?",
      "Two years on, a new AI model from China has flipped that question: can the US stop Chinese innovation?",
      "For a while, Beijing seemed to fumble with its answer to ChatGPT, which is not available in China.",
      "Unimpressed users mocked Ernie, the chatbot by search engine giant Baidu. Then came versions by tech firms Tencent and ByteDance, which were dismissed as followers of ChatGPT - but not as good.",
      "Washington was confident that it was ahead and wanted to keep it that way. So the Biden administration ramped up restrictions banning the export of advanced chips and technology to China.",
      "That's why DeepSeek's launch has astonished Silicon Valley and the world. The firm says its powerful model is far cheaper than the billions US firms have spent on AI.",
      "So how did a little-known company - whose founder is being hailed on Chinese social media as an \"AI hero\" - pull this off?",
      "DeepSeek: the Chinese AI app that has the world talking",
      "China's DeepSeek AI shakes industry and dents America's swagger",
      "Watch DeepSeek AI bot respond to question about China",
      "The challenge",
      "When the US barred the world's leading chip-makers such as Nvidia from selling advanced tech to China, it was certainly a blow.",
      "Those chips are essential for building powerful AI models that can perform a range of human tasks, from answering basic queries to solving complex maths problems.",
      "DeepSeek's founder Liang Wenfeng described the chip ban as their \"main challenge\" in interviews with local media.",
      "Long before the ban, DeepSeek acquired a \"substantial stockpile\" of Nvidia A100 chips - estimates range from 10,000 to 50,000 - according to the MIT Technology Review.",
      "Leading AI models in the West use an estimated 16,000 specialised chips. But DeepSeek says it trained its AI model using 2,000 such chips, and thousands of lower-grade chips - which is what makes its product cheaper.",
      "Some, including US tech billionaire Elon Musk, have questioned this claim, arguing the company cannot reveal how many advanced chips it really used given the restrictions.",
      "But experts say Washington's ban brought both challenges and opportunities to the Chinese AI industry.",
      "It has \"forced Chinese companies like DeepSeek to innovate\" so they can do more with less, says Marina Zhang, an associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney.",
      "\"While these restrictions pose challenges, they have also spurred creativity and resilience, aligning with China's broader policy goals of achieving technological independence.\"",
      "The world's second-largest economy has invested heavily in big tech - from the batteries that power electric vehicles and solar panels, to AI.",
      "Turning China into a tech superpower has long been President Xi Jinping's ambition, so Washington's restrictions were also a challenge that Beijing took on.",
      "The release of DeepSeek's new model on 20 January, when Donald Trump was sworn in as US president, was deliberate, according to Gregory C Allen, an AI expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "\"The timing and the way it's being messaged - that's exactly what the Chinese government wants everybody to think - that export controls don't work and that America is not the global leader in AI,\" says Mr Allen, former director of strategy and policy at the US Department of Defense Joint Artificial Intelligence Center.",
      "In recent years the Chinese government has nurtured AI talent, offering scholarships and research grants, and encouraging partnerships between universities and industry.",
      "The National Engineering Laboratory for Deep Learning and other state-backed initiatives have helped train thousands of AI specialists, according to Ms Zhang.",
      "And China had plenty of bright engineers to recruit.",
      "Is China's AI tool DeepSeek as good as it seems?",
      "BBC's AI correspondent explains why DeepSeek has caused shockwaves",
      "The talent",
      "Take DeepSeek's team for instance - Chinese media says it comprises fewer than 140 people, most of whom are what the internet has proudly declared as \"home-grown talent\" from elite Chinese universities.",
      "Western observers missed the emergence of \"a new generation of entrepreneurs who prioritise foundational research and long-term technological advancement over quick profits\", Ms Zhang says.",
      "China's top universities are creating a \"rapidly growing AI talent pool\" where even managers are often under the age of 35.",
      "\"Having grown up during China's rapid technological ascent, they are deeply motivated by a drive for self-reliance in innovation,\" she adds.",
      "Deepseek's founder Liang Wenfeng is an example of this - the 40-year-old studied AI at the prestigious Zhejiang University. In an article on the tech outlet 36Kr, people familiar with him say he is \"more like a geek rather than a boss\".",
      "And Chinese media describe him as a \"technical idealist\" - he insists on keeping DeepSeek as an open-source platform. In fact experts also believe a thriving open-source culture has allowed young start-ups to pool resources and advance faster.",
      "Unlike bigger Chinese tech firms, DeepSeek prioritised research, which has allowed for more experimenting, according to experts and people who worked at the company.",
      "\"The Top 50 talents in this field might not be in China, but we can build people like that here,\" Mr Liang said in an interview with 36Kr.",
      "But experts wonder how much further DeepSeek can go. Ms Zhang says that \"new US restrictions may limit access to American user data, potentially impacting how Chinese models like DeepSeek can go global\".",
      "And others say the US still has a huge advantage, such as, in Mr Allen's words,  \"their enormous quantity of computing resources\" - and it's also unclear how DeepSeek will continue using advanced chips to keep improving the model.",
      "But for now, DeepSeek is enjoying its moment in the sun, given that most people in China had never heard of it until this weekend.",
      "The new AI heroes",
      "His sudden fame has seen Mr Liang become a sensation on China's social media, where he is being applauded as one of the \"three AI heroes\" from southern Guangdong province, which borders Hong Kong.",
      "The other two are Zhilin Yang, a leading expert at Tsinghua University, and Kaiming He, who teaches at MIT in the US.",
      "DeepSeek has delighted the Chinese internet ahead of Lunar New Year, the country's biggest holiday. It's good news for a beleaguered economy and a tech industry that is bracing for further tariffs and the possible sale of TikTok's US business.",
      "\"DeepSeek shows us that only if you have the real deal will you stand the test of time,\" a top-liked Weibo comment reads.",
      "\"This is the best new year gift. Wish our motherland prosperous and strong,\" another reads.",
      "A \"blend of shock and excitement, particularly within the open-source community,\" is how  Wei Sun, principal AI analyst at Counterpoint Research, described the reaction in China.",
      "Fiona Zhou, a tech worker in the southern city of Shenzhen, says her social media feed \"was suddenly flooded with DeepSeek-related posts yesterday\".",
      "\"People call it 'the glory of made-in-China', and say it shocked Silicon Valley, so I downloaded it to see how good it is.\"",
      "She asked it for \"four pillars of [her] destiny\", or ba-zi - like a personalised horoscope that is based on the date and time of birth.",
      "But to her disappointment, DeepSeek was wrong. While she was given a thorough explanation about its \"thinking process\", it was not the \"four pillars\" from her real ba-zi.",
      "She says she will still give it another go at work, as it will probably be more useful for such tasks."

    "title": "The evidence that shows Rwanda is backing rebels in DR Congo",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 11:32:44 GMT",
    "summary": "Where are rebels causing havoc in eastern DR Congo getting their funding?",
    "story": [
      "Protesters in Kinshasa, the capital of Democratic Republic of Congo, have been burning portraits of Rwanda's president and tearing up Rwandan flags as M23 rebels have taken control of most the eastern city of Goma.",
      "Their fury is focused on Rwandan President Paul Kagame, who they accuse of backing the rebels - an accusation long made by the UN.",
      "To put it bluntly, a group of UN experts maintains the Rwandan army is in \"de facto control of M23 operations\", detailing how M23 recruits are trained under Rwandan supervision and supported by high-tech Rwandan weaponry.",
      "Goma, which lies at the foot of a volcano near Lake Kivu, sits on the border with Rwanda. It is the capital of mineral-rich North Kivu province - and is an important trading and humanitarian hub and the base for the UN's largest peacekeeping mission.",
      "The city had also become a refuge for those fleeing the conflict between M23 fighters and the army that erupted again in late 2021 - with the population swelling to around two million.",
      "They all face further turmoil as fighting erupted there on Sunday night with loud explosions echoing through the streets, which are now strewn with bodies. The exact circumstances of what is going on is unclear as phone lines are down and electricity and water supplies have been cut off. But the M23 seem to have captured most, if not all, of the city.",
      "\"There was no question that there are Rwandan troops in Goma supporting the M23,\" said UN peacekeeping chief Jean-Pierre Lacroix, though he added that it was it was difficult to tell the exact numbers on the ground in Goma.",
      "Tellingly some Congolese army soldiers in Goma who surrendered on Monday, did so by crossing over the border into Rwanda.",
      "Since the conflict begun, President Kagame has repeatedly denied any involvement in supporting the M23 rebels, who are well equipped, well armed and well trained.",
      "However, this response has noticeably shifted as accusations continue to grow with \"overwhelming evidence\" showing Rwanda's support for the rebel group, according to Richard Moncrief, International Crisis Group's project director for the Great Lakes",
      "\"The tone has changed to justification for defensive measures,\" he told the BBC. \"It has become harder to deny Rwanda's support for M23.\"",
      "On Sunday, Rwanda's foreign ministry said in a statement: \"This fighting close to the Rwandan border continues to present a serious threat to Rwanda's security and territorial integrity, and necessitates Rwanda's sustained defensive posture.\"",
      "It said it was concerned by \"misguided or manipulative\" statements that lacked context about the conflict.",
      "For Kagame, the context all comes down to the Rwandan genocide that took place over 100 days in 1994.",
      "The ethnic Hutu militia involved in killing up to 800,000 people - the vast majority from the Tutsi community - fled to what is now DR Congo, some forming the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR).",
      "This rebel group is still active in the notoriously unstable eastern DR Congo - and still includes some of those responsible for the genocide.",
      "Kagame, who headed the rebel Tutsi force that ended the killing more than three decades ago, sees this \"genocidal militia\" as an existential threat.",
      "His government has twice invaded DR Congo, saying it wants to stop Hutu rebel groups from staging cross-border attacks.",
      "Earlier this month he called out his Congolese counterpart, F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, for failing to deal with the FDLR and talk to the M23, saying this was exacerbating the conflict.",
      "Mr Moncrief believes that the targeting of Goma is more about making a political point as he says the M23 does not need the city strategically as it already \"controls many more lucrative areas\".",
      "\"It is President Kagame's way of exerting power over who is in charge of North Kivu,\" said the Great Lakes expert.",
      "Rwanda accused the military governor of North Kivu, who was killed in fighting last week, of collaborating with the FDLR.",
      "The discovery of this kind of high-level collaboration, experts agree, would have been like a red flag to a bull for Rwanda.",
      "The M23's origins are tied to these tensions - it is the latest incarnation of a rebel group that says it is fighting for the interests of the minority Tutsi community in eastern DR Congo.",
      "Its first uprising more than a decade ago ended with a peace deal - when its fighters disarmed and mainly moved into camps in Uganda.",
      "But three years ago, they began leaving the camps saying the deal was not honoured and within a couple months was seizing territory.",
      "The UN peacekeeping mission - first deployed in 1999 - is not mandated to go on the offensive. Two regional forces - an East African one followed by a southern African one - specially deployed over the last few years at the request of Tshisekedi have failed to contain the M23.",
      "This gives an indication of the M23's sophisticated operations.",
      "According to the UN group of experts, this includes five months of training at the M23's main base in Tchanzu, hilly terrain not far from Rwanda's border, that incorporates courses on theory and ideology and then practical elements including \"war tactics\", \"engagement rules'' and \"bush tactics\".",
      "It said Rwandan officers were often at the camp, where recruits, including children, were brought - some joining up on a voluntary basis, others forced to do so in a systematic operation where local chiefs had to provide conscripts.",
      "The experts said Sultani Makenga, who once fought for Kagame in the early 1990s in Rwanda and is now the M23's military chief, attended some of the passing-out ceremonies between 25 September and 31 October 2024 that involved 3,000 recruits.",
      "Rwanda's spokesperson Yolande Makolo did not address the question of whether Rwandan officers were in the M23 camp but she did deny the charges about child soldiers, telling the BBC last year: \"The claim about recruiting minors in camps is absurd, it's blatant information warfare against Rwanda.\"",
      "However UN expert reports detail how the M23's strength has grown since May when numbers were put at around 3,000.",
      "The experts estimate that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan army troops are on the ground in DR Congo - saying it based this on authenticated photographs, drone footage, video recordings, testimonies and intelligence.",
      "Captured M23 fighters said that the Rwandans were known as the \"Friendly Force\", with the experts' December report saying the English term was \"generically used\" even when interviewees were speaking in other languages.",
      "They said these Rwandan special forces were there to train and support the rebels, and they did not interact with M23 regulars.",
      "Rwanda's ally Uganda, unhappy about another rebel group in DR Congo that threatens its security, has also been accused of helping the M23 - with its officers also spotted at Tchanzu. The UN experts say Uganda has also supplied weapons, hosted rebel leaders and allowed cross-border movements of M23 fighters - accusations Kampala denies.",
      "Kagame recently expressed his frustration that after Tshisekedi came to power in 2019, his suggestion that Rwanda work alongside the Congolese army to tackle the FDLR had been rebuffed - unlike a joint offensive by DR Congo and Uganda against the Islamist Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels.",
      "This may explain the re-emergence of the M23 in 2021 - with evidence showing Rwanda's backing of the group continues to grow.",
      "Cl\u00e9mentine de Montjoye, senior researcher in the Africa division at Human Rights Watch, told the BBC that geolocated images placed Rwandan troops in Sake, a town just outside Goma last week.",
      "The UN experts say the M23's decision to capture the mining town of Rubaya, which fell to its forces in May, was \"motivated by a strategic need to monopolise\" the lucrative trade in coltan, which is used to make batteries for electric vehicles and mobile phones.",
      "Its December report says the group now collects at least $800,000 (\u00a3643,000) a month from the taxation of coltan in Rubaya - and ensures that around 120 tonnes of the coveted mineral is sent directly to Rwanda every four weeks.",
      "It includes satellite images to show how a road was widened by September on the Congolese side of the Kibumba border crossing to allow access for heavy trucks that were previously unable to use the route into Rwanda.",
      "Ms De Montjoye explained how the advanced weapons being used by the M23 were not available to any other of the numerous armed groups operating in eastern DR Congo.",
      "\"Earlier last year, we documented how Rwandan forces, and M23 had fired 122mm rockets, hitting displacement camps,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"It's certainly with the kind of military support that the M23 has received that they've been able to make such an advance [on Goma].\"",
      "The UN experts have documented many such examples, including the use of Israeli-made anti-tank guided missiles.",
      "Mr Moncrief said the M23 was also using technology to interfere with Global Positioning System (GPS) that had stopped the Congolese army from flying drones it had acquired from China.",
      "The UN experts said the \"spoofing and jamming\" near areas controlled by M23 and the Rwandan army had also disrupted other aircraft.",
      "President Kagame has dismissed these UN reports, pouring scorn on their \"expertise\" and saying they ignore many outrages committed in DR Congo to focus on \"imaginary problems\" created by the M23.",
      "The East African Community \u2013 currently headed by Kenya's president - is now trying to mediate, though Tshisekedi has said he will not attend a hastily organised emergency summit.",
      "Observers say Rwanda's president will be telling any mediator that the FDLR is the only subject up for discussion as he is adamant their presence makes DR Congo an unsafe neighbour - something he reiterated at a press conference earlier this month.",
      "\"Honestly, for the last 30 years if anyone wanted to understand what the problems are [in DR Congo] and what solutions should be, you don't even need to be an expert,\" Kagame said.",

      "Adam's great-grandmother, Tetiana Tarasevych, 68, is in the grave right beside them.",
      "All three were killed together on 7 November last year by a Russian attack in a war that has devoured Ukraine since 2022 \u2013 but which no longer dominates the international agenda.",
      "Some of Adam's last moments were captured by Tetiana in a video on her phone. The two of them were out on a walk with Adam's mum Sophiia.

      "Every time they come, there are more graves stretching out into the distance. The cemetery is expanding \"at a staggering pace,\" Yuliia says. Rows of blue and yellow flags, marking the graves of fallen soldiers, pierce the sombre grey sky.",
      "Zaporizhzhia, where the family lived, is a regular target for Russian forces. It is a strategically important industrial city, near front-line fighting. Europe's largest nuclear power plant \u2013 about 55km (34 miles) from the city \u2013 is held by the Russians.",
      "On the day of the attack that killed Sophiia, Tetiana and Adam, Yuliia called her daughter from western Ukraine, where she was on a work trip.",

      "\"Every evening when I came home from work, I would take Adam for a walk,\" says Serhiy. \"He was very curious about the sky. He'd point his little finger up, and we'd tell him about it. And he loved birds.\"",

    "summary": "In her new musical, \"Redwood,\" the Tony Award-winning star of \"Wicked\" and \"Rent\" plays a woman seeking a refuge, and a purpose, by escaping into a redwood forest.",
    "story": [
      "Last fall, when superstar Idina Menzel wasn't in New York, she hung out in Oakland, Calif. At Bandaloop Studios, she was learning to dance suspended at the end of a rope \u2026 and this from a woman who says she isn't much of a dancer on the ground. \"I don't know what I'm doing!\" she exclaimed.",
      "But when you see exactly why she was doing this, it suddenly all makes sense.",
      "In the new Broadway musical \"Redwood,\" the audience is transported to the heart of the redwood forest, and seemingly into the trees themselves. It's loosely inspired by a woman named Julia Butterfly Hill, who, in the late '90s, spent more than two years living in a thousand-year-old redwood to save it from being cut down. Her effort worked: the tree was saved.",
      "And now, Menzel and writer-director Tina Landau are taking their own leap of faith with an idea they've been kicking around for more than a decade.",
      "Asked if she was ever worried that their experiment would fail, Landau said, \"Yes, I'm still worried. I didn't know. But it was one of those passion projects for both myself and Idina where it was just like, let's just trust that what is meant to happen will happen.\"",
      "\"Redwood\" is about a workaholic mom who runs away from it all, and finds herself in the redwood forest where her life is changed forever.",
      "One of the themes of the show is based on the fact that 300-foot redwoods actually support each other. Landau said, \"Their roots only go five or six feet into the ground. Their roots go sideways instead of down, until they reach the roots of other trees, and they intertwine with those. So, all the trees end up holding each other up.\"",
      "To listen to Idina Menzel perform \"Great Escape,\" from the musical \"Redwood,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The musical, which is currently in previews, is all-new, but Menzel is on familiar ground. She's performing at the Nederlander Theatre, which is the same theatre where she opened in \"Rent\" in 1996. \"Yeah, it's like a homecoming for me. It's full circle. It's very emotional for me. When I did 'Rent,\" that was the first professional job I ever had \u2013 and it was a Broadway show. So, I was super-lucky. That was a beautiful time in my life.\"",
      "It was beautiful. She was 25 years old, and her performance in \"Rent\" put her squarely on the map, with a Tony Award nomination. \"I got a record deal that I always wanted to get,\" she said. \"I wanted to be signed to a record label so badly and make my own album, and I did. And that was a dream come true. But then I only sold, like, three albums. So, then I got dropped from the label. And then by that time, my whole kind of momentum of being this Tony-nominated actress from the hit musical 'Rent,' it sort of dissipated. And then I had to kind of keep pounding the pavement again. It wasn't until 'Wicked' that things started to really look up again.\"",
      "As the original Wicked Witch Elphaba in Broadway's \"Wicked,\" Menzel won a Tony, and helped turn the show into a mega-hit, though it wasn't always easy being green. Asked what Elphaba gave her, Menzel replied, \"Green ears for the rest of my life!\"",
      "Idina Menzel performs \"Defying Gravity\" from \"Wicked\" on \"The Late Show With David Letterman\":",
      "And then, she was an animated princess in Disney's \"Frozen,\" singing the song that millions of would-be princesses couldn't get out of their heads. \"My relationship with 'Let It Go' is fabulous,\" she said. \"It's one of the best things that's ever happened to me. People always say, 'Do you get sick of a song like that?' And maybe they think I'm lying to you, but I really don't.\"",
      "Idina Menzel, as Elsa, performs \"Let It Go\" in \"Frozen\":",
      "\"When I was a little girl, if I would have dreamt that I'd be up there singing a song like this, I wouldn't have believed it. Or, no, I would have, 'cause I really was very cocky when I was little, and I actually, you know, believed in myself and thought, 'Definitely, it's definitely gonna happen for me.'\"",
      "But the task of writing Menzel's next big song went to someone who'd never written for a big Broadway star (or for anyone). \"Redwood\" is composer Kate Diaz's very first show, but you'd never know it. Asked what it's like to write for The Idina Menzel, Diaz said, \"It's amazing. I had never written for anybody else before, so great place to start, for sure! What an incredible voice to write for.\"",
      "I asked, \"Is there a little part of you that's like, 'Let me just see if she can do this'?\"",
      "\"I mean, she usually can,\" Diaz replied, \"So, not really.\"",
      "And she can do it on demand, as she demonstrated in the new \"Wicked\" film where she brought back her classic vocal riff.",
      "Her new show offers a different way to go green: an immersion in a leafy redwood forest. Even the seats in the newly-remodeled Nederlander are green. For Menzel it's almost hard to believe: \"It's just so rare that you get to see it come to fruition after so many years, and they're literally loading things into the Nederlander as we speak. That accomplishment isn't lost on me, and it's just, I'm so emotional about it.",
      "And now she's hoping to defy gravity, again. \"But I think green and being high, flying, literally or figuratively, is just something that I must respond to or attract in my life, in my characters,\" Menzel laughed. \"And I'm kind of happy with that!\"",

    "title": "Pete Davidson and Dav Pilkey on \"Dog Man\"",
    "published": "Sun, 26 Jan 2025 10:17:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The playful anarchy of author-illustrator Dav Pilkey's bestselling \"Dog Man\" series, about a hero cop who is part-man, part-police dog, is now on screen in a new animated film, with comedian Pete Davidson playing Dog Man's arch-nemesis, Petey the Cat.",
    "story": [
      "It's hard to believe, but as author and Illustrator Dav Pilkey recently told students at Boy's Prep in the Bronx, he created Dog Man back when he was in second grade. \"He looks a little bit different,\" he said.",
      "The kids loved hearing when someone with learning disabilities (\"I had ADHD, and I was dyslexic, and I was the class clown, and I couldn't sit still,\" he said) could go on to be so successful.",
      "Every book in Pilkey's Dog Man series has been the bestselling children's book for the year it came out.",
      "And as the new film out next week reminds us, it all started when a police officer and his dog got into a bad accident \u2013 and doctors sewed the head of the dog onto the man's body, creating \u2026 Dog Man!",
      "And while he's part man, he's all dog. \"Oh, yeah, yeah. The man part doesn't really come out that much,\" Pilkey said.",
      "But in addition to all the fun, Pilkey tries to layer meaning into the Dog Man books, even in their titles, from \"The Scarlet Shedder\" and \"Fetch-22,\" to \"Lord of the Fleas,\" and \"A Tale of Two Kitties.\" \"I was looking at Charles Dickens' 'A Tale of Two Cities,' which is such a wonderful book. It talks about sacrifice, self-sacrifice, and the value of that.\"",
      "\"And you hope that children will be moved to read these classics?\" I asked.",
      "\"I hope so, yeah,\" Pilkey replied. \"I hope they don't think 'Oh, that Charles Dickens stole an idea from Dav Pilkey.' That wouldn't be so good!\"",
      "Pilkey's sense of humor is what made director Peter Hastings want to make the \"Dog Man\" movie. He also directed a TV series based on Pilkey's \"Captain Underpants\" books. \"I just love his sensibility, the playful anarchy of his work,\" Hastings said.",
      "Comedian Pete Davidson gets top billing in the film: \"I'm a huge Dav Pilkey fan,\" he said. \"I grew up reading all the 'Captain Underpants' books. My mom got them for me. All the young kids in my family, they all read 'Dog Man,' they're obsessed with 'Dog Man.' And then right around the time I started noticing that, we got the offer.\"",
      "It was an offer to play Dog Man's nemesis, Petey the Cat. Davidson said it was fun to play the villain: \"It's a really fun, loud, layered character,\" he said. \"I don't get a lot of opportunities to stretch like that.\"",
      "In fact, as readers of the \"Dog Man\" books know, things start to change when Petey tries to clone himself, and instead creates \u2026 an adorable kitten!",
      "\"His character has a great arc in the story,\" said Hastings.",
      "\"It's the best arc I've ever been given\" Davidson laughed. \"Usually I'm in a movie for, like, nine minutes, and then shot in the face, so it was nice to have a full [arc]!\"",
      "Asked if it's hard for someone else to control his characters, Pilkey said, \"No, no. Not at all actually. I'm just so honored that they wanted to do something with my characters, so I was like, YESSS!!! Jumping up and down.\"",
      "But Pilkey says what really matters to him is seeing how much kids appreciate all the work he puts into his books.",
      "Asked whether he ever worries about running out of ideas, he said, \"No, I think I worry about running out of time to get all of my ideas down on paper!\"",

    "title": "The spirit of Sundance",
    "published": "Sun, 26 Jan 2025 10:07:41 -0500",
    "summary": "This month, the Sundance Film Festival is once again providing a showcase for independent filmmakers and documentarians from around the world. But that isn't all that Sundance does. \"Sunday Morning\" goes behind the scenes.",
    "story": [
      "Park City Utah is a snow globe kind of place. It sparkles and glitters like a fairy tale, especially at this time of year, when the silver screens of Sundance come to this silver mining town, and young filmmakers start thinking of the moment they might see some glitter of their own.",
      "Sian Heder's film \"CODA\" premiered at Sundance in 2021. It went on to win three Oscars the following year, including best picture. It doesn't always happen that way, but the Sundance Film Festival does have a pretty good track record of catapulting independent filmmakers into a career.",
      "Its alumni include the likes of Steven Soderbergh (\"Sex, Lies, and Videotape\"), Quentin Tarantino (\"Reservoir Dogs\"), Christopher Nolan (\"Memento\"), and Lulu Wang (\"The Farewell\"). They were all introduced not only to audiences, but to powerful film distribution companies, at the annual festival held high in the Wasatch Mountains of Utah.",
      "\"I think that was the big breakthrough with Sundance, is that finally these new voices, these exciting new filmmakers had a place where they could actually show what they had done and potentially sell them,\" said eight-time Oscar nominee Glenn Close.",
      "She first heard about Sundance from its famous founder, Robert Redford, on the set of \"The Natural.\" His idea \u2013 then in its infancy - was in some ways just as pure as baseball itself.",
      "As Redford told us in 2018, \"I said, wait a minute, there are other stories out there. There are other voices to be heard that are not being given a chance. What if we created something, an opportunity, for those people to get their films made and have them distributed? \u2026 The smaller stories. The more offbeat stories. The more controversial.\"",
      "Which is why he wanted his non-profit Sundance Institute to be held as far away from profit-focused Hollywood as possible. So, he set it up amid the pines and aspens of Utah's Provo Canyon, on land he bought after the success of \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\"",
      "Close said, \"You are surrounded by nature in a way that, if you're from a city, it's undeniable,\" she said. \"It's a spiritual thing. And I think that was very important for Bob.\"",
      "Redford said he didn't think the idea he started would last beyond two or three years. But the Sundance Institute has lasted 44 years and counting. It's become for film what Michelin Stars are to fine dining.",
      "You don't choose Sundance; Sundance chooses you.",
      "Michelle Satter, the Institute's founding senior director, has been by Redford's side since 1981. \"We'll get 3,000 scripts; we'll select 12,\" she said. \"That's a tiny number. But there are a lot of people globally who want to tell stories, and we believe in the power of storytelling.\"",
      "I asked, \"How do you know when you've found a unique story or a unique talent?\"",
      "\"It speaks to me,\" Satter replied. \"If they don't have a voice that is unique, we're not interested.\"",
      "\"And what does that mean to you, voice'?\"",
      "\"There's something about the way they tell the story that does not feel generic, like anybody could tell the story,\" said Satter. \"But they're bringing something from their own experience, from their own connection to storytelling that uplifts it.\"",
      "According to Satter, \"A film is not complete until it reaches an audience and engages with an audience.\"",
      "Last Spring, Satter allowed us into Sundance's storied Directors and Screenwriters Lab, this time held in Estes Park, Colorado. One of the lab's advisors was four-time Oscar nominated actor-director Ed Harris.",
      "\"It's not about ego,\" Harris said. \"It's not about anything other than learning, making mistakes. I love the work. It's all about the work, and I learn as much as I probably help anybody.\"",
      "All the Sundance \"Fellows,\" as they're called, bring projects already in the works, like Hannah Gray Organschi, polishing up her upcoming feature film. \"There's tough feedback, like, feedback that's good,\" she said. \"And to have that at the phase where you can really be deepening and honing the characters and story is, it feels lucky.\"",
      "Casey Modderno was fine tuning her rom-com: \"The questions I think that you're normally asked as a filmmaker are, like, about budget, about accessibility, about market response. And so, to be asked questions about the feeling of the film and the aesthetics of the film and the texture, and just go deep in craft, it's, like, super-special.\"",
      "And then there's Sean Wang. \"This experience has just, like, changed my DNA as a filmmaker,\" he said.",
      "What got him accepted to Sundance was his screenplay for his first feature film, \"Didi.\" He had been toiling away on the film pretty much by himself with his crew for six years. \"I was just obsessed with, 'Who won Sundance this year? Who won the Audience Award? Who won the Jury Prize? What's the next filmmaker that is coming out of Sundance?'\" he said.",
      "Turns out he was one of those Sundance filmmakers. Last year, \"Didi\" not only won two of the Sundance Film Festival's top prizes; it got him a distribution deal.",
      "Wang notes that Sundance doesn't finance films. \"They have no financial stake in your movie,\" he said. \"When we sell the movie, they're not like, 'Great. Where's our 10%?' It's a very giving environment. Obviously they want your films to succeed.\"",
      "This year the California wildfires cast a long shadow over the festival. Michelle Satter's home, where we did our interview, is now gone, as are so many others.",
      "None of those victims were forgotten in Utah this past week. As Satter told the audience, \"We lost our village, but at the end of the day, we are the village.\"",
      "As for Robert Redford, the visionary who started it all is now 88. He hasn't been here in person for the last three years, but his spirit remains. Independent film has forever been changed \u2013 a legacy that he and others have taken to the box office bank.",
      "Glenn Close said, \"He put his money where his mouth is. And you know, I'm in awe of that. And I salute him for it.\"",

      "Read an excerpt below.",
      "\"Playworld\" by Adam Ross",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Prologue",
      "In the fall of 1980, when I was fourteen, a friend of my parents named Naomi Shah fell in love with me. She was thirty-six, a mother of two, and married to a wealthy man. Like so many things that happened to me that year, it didn't seem strange at the time.",
      "Two decades later, when I finally told my mother\u2014we were on Long Island, taking a walk on the beach\u2014she stopped, stunned, and said, \"But she was such an ugly woman.\" The remark wasn't as petty as it sounds. If I was aware of it then, it neither repulsed me nor affected my feelings for Naomi. It was just a thing I took for granted, like the color of her hair.",
      "Wiry and ashen, it had the shading but not the shimmer of pigeon feathers. Naomi kept it long, so that it fell past her shoulders. I knew it by touch, for my face was often buried in it. Only later did I wonder if she considered herself unattractive, because she always wore sunglasses, as if to hide her face, large gold frames with blue-tinted prescription lenses. When we were driving together, which was often that year, she'd allow these to slide down her nose and then look at me over their bridge. She might've considered this pose winning, but it was more likely to see me better. Her mouth often hung slightly open. Her lower teeth were uneven, and her tongue, which pressed against them, always tasted of coffee.",
      "Naomi's car was a silver Mercedes sedan\u2014300sd along with turbo diesel nickel-plated on the back\u2014that made a deep hum when she drove. The interior, enormous in my mind's eye, was tricked out with glossy wood paneling and white leather, back seat so wide and legroom so ample they made the driver appear to be far away. It was in this car that Naomi and I talked most often. We'd park, and then she'd lean across the armrest to press her cheek to mine, and I'd sometimes allow her to kiss me. Other times we'd move to the back. Lying there with Naomi, her nose nuzzled to my neck, I'd stare at the ceiling's dotted fabric until the pattern seemed to detach and drift like a starred sky. This car was her prized possession, and like many commuters, she had turned the machine into an extension of her body. Her left thumb lightly hooked the wheel at eight o'clock when traffic was moving, her fingertips sliding to eleven when it was slow. She preferred to sit slightly reclined, her free hand spread on her inner thigh, though after she lost her pinky the following summer, and even after being fitted with a prosthesis, she kept it tucked away.",
      "\"I was worried you'd think it was disgusting,\" she said, the digit hidden between the seat and her hip. She'd bought herself a diamond ring to hide the seam, and for the most part the likeness was uncanny, but at certain angles you could tell\u2014the cuticle's line was too smooth, the nail's pale crescent too creamy to match the others. Like my father's fake teeth, which he occasionally left lying around our apartment, I was fascinated by it, though my curiosity wasn't morbid. I was a child actor, you see, a student of all forms of dissembling, and had long ago found my greatest subject to be adults.",

      "An inside joke, only for the three of them. But now she was locking her apartment door behind two departing police officers.",
      "She had managed to sound appropriately earnest but unworried when they began asking questions. After all, why should May Hanover, of all people, be nervous around police? May was the good girl, always. The one who only needed to be told once by a teacher to open a book to a specific page. The teenager who drove strictly within the limits of her learner's permit. Even her pug, Gomez, seemed to understand at an instinctive level why he needed to break away from his neighbor buddies to ride the building's service elevator while they strutted brazenly with their humans through the lobby.",
      "May, simply put, was a rule follower. A rule enforcer, in fact. It was a trait that had helped her succeed in life, but, as she had learned, could also lead to trouble.",
      "Josh emerged from the bedroom where he'd gone to give her privacy when the police arrived. Gomez waddled slightly behind him. \"Was that about Roland Shaw?\"",
      "Shaw was the man she'd convicted in her final in-person trial as an assistant district attorney after he was found breaking into his next victim's apartment. \"How'd you know?\" Could a question be a lie? That one probably counted. So many lies since she'd gotten home yesterday from her long weekend in the Hamptons.",
      "\"That was a major case for you. I recognized the big guy from the news.\"",
      "The trial was before she and Josh had found themselves suddenly living together. Before they were engaged. The media coverage consisted of two small articles in the Post, including a photograph of a defiant-looking May flanked by two detectives in the courthouse hallway\u2014one of them the \"big guy\" Josh recognized. Whereas May was obsessed with all things crime-related\u2014in her job, the news, truth or fiction\u2014Josh found it all, quote, \"dark and depressing.\" But Josh was interested in all things May-related. Of course he had followed the coverage.",
      "\"The DA's Office got an inquiry from another jurisdiction and needed to clear something up,\" she said. Misleading, but technically true.",
      "\"They couldn't just call you?\" he asked.",
      "\"Actually, he called, but I didn't see the message.\" That one was a full-on lie. \"Guess he's training a new guy and wanted a change of scenery.\"",
      "\"Well, I'm glad they were quick. I really wanted a Negroni but thought the sound of a cocktail shaker might be inadvisable while you were in official law enforcement mode.\"",
      "\"Another reason why you should stir,\" she said. \"I like what I like.\"",
      "\"Make two? I'm getting back into my comfy clothes.\" She called Lauren once she was alone in the bedroom. \"Hey there, woman. We were just saying we miss you.\"",
      "\"Yes, we miss you!\" Kelsey called out in the background. \"Come back here right now. It's boring without you.\"",
      "May could hear a few drinks' worth of enthusiasm in Kelsey's voice. \"You're clearly having a miserable time. Absolutely suffering.\" She felt a knot form in her sternum as she steeled herself to explain why she was calling. \"I don't even know how to say this, but the police are probably going to call you. Both of you.\"",
      "\"What? How would they even know about us?\" Lauren asked. \"They came to my apartment. They asked who I was with. I didn't have a choice. They have your names. And your phone numbers.\"",
      "\"How? Were there cameras or something?\"",
      "\"No, it was because of me. I'm so sorry.\"",
      "What had she gone and done? No one was supposed to know about any of their stupidity. And now something really, really bad was going to happen\u2014she could feel it. Something she couldn't control. She wanted to open her mouth wide to scream\u2014to scream impossibly loudly again, like last time.",

      "The wisest souls say that pure mountain air makes us all go a little mad. A wind\u2014lawless and long-tailed\u2014slices through the snow-stippled Apuan alps and the Apennines with all the wantonness of La Befana, the winter witch. Swifts catch this wind on their wings, carving up the crisp blue morning. Dipping down into the valley, the wind now worries over the murmuring blue tongue of the Serchio river on its journey to the Tyrrhenian Sea. It slips\u2014an unseen spirit\u2014under Devil's bridge. Shivers along the great gray hunch of the Devil's back. Hissing over every ancient stone. Rising from the river, the wind picks up speed, hastening toward the woods. Hurtling toward chestnut trees spaced like the pews of a great Duomo. The wind now weaves between golden leaves. Whispering quick consonants between the branches, borrowing an autumnal aura. Sweet sigh of ripe chestnuts and shed leaves. And here\u2014where the wind steals woodland scents\u2014hides a curiosity. Cloistered by soil, moss, stone and leaf litter, a thing unseen\u2014a thing quite mysterious\u2014lies in waiting.",
      "A thing that sits buried, like old bones.",
      "What lies under the soil has stayed secret. It is an underground barterer. A schemer who has set a trap in the soil. A sylvan swindler. A tormentor.",
      "A tiny god.",
      "Swelling to irresistible bulk, it has ripened into a knobbled fruit of corruption. And now the time has come. The tiny god releases a lusty sigh, soundlessly unfurling a phantom into the wind.",
      "No more visible than the notes of nightingale song.",
      "No more audible than a wordless wish.",
      "The tiny god has released a cipher.",
      "The breath of the tiny god is whisked away by the breeze, slipping through the damp woodland of chestnut worship. Deeper into the woods, the breath in the breeze paints the pupils of a fallow deer into great glistening lakes. Fur stiffens along a back freckled in the white of first snow. The doe salivates in answer to the call of the stranger she can smell but cannot see. Her nostrils flutter, messages flood her bloodstream. But the breath blows on.",
      "Now a wild sow lifts her moist snout from the leaf litter and inhales a slip of the wind. Instantly intoxicated, her muddy snout snuffing. The grunting sow is aroused into a frenzy. Bristled legs stab at the soil as she arranges them to assume her stance, ready to receive the boar she smells. Turning her head toward her tail, she hunts for him, but\u2014and here is the trick, here is the olfactory deception\u2014there is no boar and the breeze blows on through the woods, fanning the sensual scent along with it.",
      "See-through scarves of scent curl from the forest and swirl toward a beautiful medieval village, perched upon a peak. Its tallest point an 11th century bell tower with memories of steel swords and shields. The wind, pickled with flavors of the forest, ridden by the breath of the tiny god, tickles trees of olive and cyprus. Until it dangles its string of little calamities above cobblestone streets and terracotta roof tiles.",
      "And it settles upon the medieval village like a spell.",

    "title": "Egg prices are likely to shoot up even more in 2025. Here's why.",
    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 14:09:07 -0500",
    "summary": "The humble egg is now a source of frustration for millions of shoppers around the U.S, who face soaring prices and shortages. What's going on?",
    "story": [
      "At Market Basket locations in some parts of Massachusetts, customers are being asked to limit their egg purchases\u00a0to two cartons per family. Another shopper on the hunt for eggs, this one in Las Vegas, reported finding\u00a0empty shelves\u00a0at a local grocery store. On social media, a consumer\u00a0accustomed to paying around $2 for a dozen eggs expressed shock over now having to pay more than double that amount.",
      "Egg restrictions, shortages and record-high prices are ruffling feathers at supermarkets across the U.S. as a deadly strain of avian flu\u00a0continues to decimate\u00a0the country's poultry flocks. To the dismay of consumers still struggling to digest soaring food costs, that likely means even higher egg prices in 2025.",
      "\"I think eggs have felt relatively extreme over the past few months,\" Kip Green, co-owner and general manager of Montague Diner in Brooklyn, New York, told CBS News. \"We're fortunate though, we have a great relationships with our purveyors, with farmers. So everybody is trying to help each other out, which is lovely.\"",
      "Like many diners, Montague uses hundreds of eggs a day said Green. Whether served as part of a classic breakfast plate alongside potatoes and toast, or an egg salad sandwich, eggs comprise 40% to 50% of the restaurant's menu, she said.",
      "\"I mean, it's even like, there's some things that you might not even think about, like in our pancake batter or like in our French toast batter, like just things like that. We still use so many eggs.\"",
      "Even so, Green says that she and her team are \"aligned on keeping guests at the forefront,\" which means shielding them from price hikes on eggs.",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it's challenging. Like we, we have to figure out how to make it work,\" said Green. \"Eggs are central to us, we are a diner. You have to have an egg plate,\" she said, adding, \"We don't ever want to stop that or to, to make people pay more for something like that. So you figure out how to cut costs elsewhere.\"",
      "The average price of a dozen large, grade-A eggs was $4.15 in December 2024, up 14% from $3.65 in November, federal\u00a0data shows. That's a more than 60% increase from the $2.51 it cost a year ago and 160% more than the $1.41 consumers paid for the same carton in 2019, CBS News' price tracker\u00a0reveals.",
      "By comparison, the overall monthly rate of inflation for food in December was 2.5%, with the cost of food at home rising just 0.3%, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data.",
      "Like a souffl\u00e9, egg prices are rising to impressive heights right before our eyes. When will it end? Not anytime soon, according to the USDA, which\u00a0predicts\u00a0in a recent report that egg prices will shoot up another 20% this year.",
      "Behind rising egg prices and shortages is a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), known as H5N1, that killed 13.2 million commercial egg-laying hens in the month of December alone and continues to depopulate flocks into 2025, according to the USDA. Outbreaks of H5N1 were first detected in the U.S. in 2022 and are considered to be the main driver behind the years-long volatility in egg prices.",
      "H5N1, which has a high mortality rate among infected\u00a0poultry\u00a0and wild birds, is being watched closely by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a potential public health\u00a0threat. So far, the CDC has received one report of a person dying after being hospitalized with severe illness from the virus. Among cattle, the average mortality and culling rate is 2% or less, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. However, officials warn that H5N1 is lethal to cats",
      "For now, the virus remains mostly a thorn in the side of U.S. consumers\u00a0fed up with inflation.",
      "\"For about a year and a half now, the sort of frequency and severity of avian flu outbreaks in the poultry and egg supply chains in the U.S. have sort of just been on the rise in a big way,\" Ricky Volpe, a professor of agribusiness at Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone is just sort of hoping that, 'OK, this will be the last one, then we'll get back to normal.' But we keep on not getting back to normal.\"",
      "More than 79.3 million U.S. chickens died in 2022 and 2023 as result of H5N1 infections and related culling, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from TD Cowen. In total, H5N1 is estimated to have led to the loss of nearly 139 million birds across the country, including Puerto Rico, according to the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.",
      "Devastating for farmers",
      "The bird flu outbreaks disrupting the nation's egg supplies are a dealing a serious blow to affected farmers. Anytime the virus is found, the entire flock must be slaughtered to help limit the virus' spread. Replenishing supplies is yet another challenge.",
      "\"It takes approximately 19-20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs in newly repopulated barns, and that is but one element of a lengthy recovery process,\" a spokesperson for the American Egg Board said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Bird flu is absolutely devastating to an egg farm. When an egg farm is impacted with HPAI, it must go through a comprehensive and lengthy process involving multiple steps and government approvals before it can begin to repopulate with new flocks and return to producing eggs. This process that can take nine months to more than a year,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "With massive egg farms routinely housing more than 1 million chickens, just a few infections can lead to a supply crunch.",
      "Other factors",
      "Another factor driving up egg prices: a persistent shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. \u2014 a mounting problem as more drivers retire. And with fewer drivers to transport eggs to retailers, wholesalers are forced to raise shipping costs.",
      "\"Refrigerated truck transportation is a major pain point in the food supply chain right now. There's a shortage of drivers, long-haul truck rates are up and eggs are of course very transportation-intensive,\" Volpe said. \"Even before we were dealing with avian flu, the trucks just weren't there to deliver eggs in a timely fashion.\"",
      "For consumers in Colorado, a state law requiring all eggs to be cage-free by January 2025, has added to the soaring price of eggs.",
      "As a partial solution to the nationwide problem, Volpe suggests that retailers source eggs locally wherever possible.",
      "\"[Local suppliers] are pretty well insulated from these systemic issues of avian flu or whatever, so supply is healthy. So it makes sense to augment supply whenever possible locally from local growers who are not facing these significant issues related to bird flu and transportation.\"",
      "Why are egg prices lower in some stores?",
      "Just as retailers use Thanksgiving Day turkey promotions to attract customers, some grocery stores around the country are offering lower egg prices to drive store traffic.",
      "\"You can go on social media and you'll see someone complaining about an $8 dozen of eggs and then someone else will chime in and go 'I just got it for $4.' Well, I absolutely guarantee you that was sold at a loss, and it was sort of a competitive effort to increase foot traffic,\" Volpe said. \"Maybe eggs are sold at a loss, but now you're going to buy your milk and your bread and vegetables, everything else, and those will have the normal profit margins.\"",
      "Translation: If you find a good deal on eggs at a store, you might still end up paying roughly the same cost for your entire basket of groceries as you would somewhere else.",
      "Response from White House",
      "\"There is a lot of reporting out there that is putting the onus on this White House for the increased cost of eggs,\" said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked at her first press briefing on Tuesday what President Trump is doing to address egg prices which have spiked since he took office earlier this month.",
      "\"As far as the egg shortage, what's also contributing to that is that the Biden admin and Department of Agriculture directed the mass killing of 100 million chickens,\" Leavitt, who made no mention of avian flu, said in her response.",
      "Leavitt went on to urge the Senate to move \"swiftly\" to confirm Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees \"including his nominee for the United States Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins ... who is leading the economic team here at the White House, on how we can address the egg shortage in this country.\"",
      "Correction:\u00a0This story has been revised because it mistakenly reported that it takes less than six weeks for commercial hens to produce eggs. This is incorrect. It takes 19 to 20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs, according to the American Egg Board. The trade group also notes that it can take more than a year for farms suffering a bird flu outbreak to secure the required government clearance to resume operations.",
      "The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump's controversial pick to head the federal Department of Health and Human Services, will appear Wednesday before a Senate panel that is crucial to advance his nomination.",
      "Kennedy is due to appear first at the Senate Committee on Finance, the panel that will ultimately be the committee with the deciding vote on whether his nomination to be the next Secretary of Health and Human Services advances to the full Senate. He must receive a majority of senators to be confirmed to head HHS, which encompasses America's federal health agencies.",
      "The committee's jurisdiction largely focuses on the department's mammoth Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs for seniors and low-income Americans, which make up the largest share of mandatory spending in the federal budget.",
      "He will head next to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, or HELP, which is scheduled to question Kennedy on Thursday.",
      "That committee's focus includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug Administration and National Institutes of Health, all agencies that would fall under Kennedy's authority if he is confirmed to lead the department.",
      "Trump's picks to head all of those agencies will also need to face their own Senate confirmation hearings. While some have voiced different opinions from him in the past, Kennedy could have broad authority to override them as secretary.",
      "What is RFK Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda?",
      "This week's hearings will offer the first public window into Kennedy's broad \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda in many weeks, after Kennedy and other nominees retreated from public appearances and social media posts.",
      "Advisers have been huddling with Kennedy for months behind closed doors, multiple advisers say, hashing out how and whether to implement dramatic changes he has sought to the federal government's health bureaucracy.",
      "Kennedy's supporters say many of his stances, like questioning ultra-processed foods and the risks of synthetic food additives and dyes, have hit on broad appeal among both Republicans and some Democrats that could buoy his chances to clear the Senate.",
      "Through the FDA, Kennedy would be able to exercise substantial authority on how foods are regulated, labeled and recommended by the federal government.",
      "But Kennedy is also facing criticism from both sides of the aisle, setting up a confirmation battle that multiple allies say he has privately acknowledged will be an uphill fight.",
      "His aides are facing mounting criticism over a department-wide communications \"pause\" that has stymied releases across the health agencies, which is timed to end in the days after Kennedy's confirmation hearings wrap up.",
      "What is RFK Jr.'s stance on abortion rights?",
      "Conservative groups have also been divided over Kennedy's nomination, with some criticizing his past statements voicing support for abortion rights.",
      "The issue is expected to be a large focus of Kennedy's hearings: as secretary, he would have authority over how the FDA regulates medications used for abortions.",
      "Kennedy has reassured conservative groups and lawmakers that he would hew closely to Mr. Trump's campaign trail promise to defer the issue to the states.",
      "But Kennedy and the Trump administration will have little room to avoid the issue, given an ongoing federal court case against the FDA. Conservatives have called on the Trump administration's FDA to roll back moves made since 2016 to ease access to abortion pills.",
      "The FDA's decision to ease those so-called Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies or REMS restrictions on the abortion pill mifepristone were the focus of a Supreme Court case last year that ended in defeat for abortion opponents.",
      "\"Walking back REMS has significantly increased safety risks for women. And so from our perspective, as directed by the administration, we do believe that an RFK HHS has the ability to direct the FDA to review safety,\" said John Mize, CEO of Americans United for Life.",
      "Mize's group has petitioned the FDA \"urging the reinstatement of basic safety measures\" while additional data is collected on their risks. He cited the death of Amber Thurman in a high-profile case that made headlines last year after a medication abortion.",
      "\"I've seen this from RFK in the past, that he is absolutely laser focused on the safety of pharmaceuticals. And so this gives us a really good opportunity to expose a safety issue,\" said Mize.",
      "FDA officials have defended their decision to ease the restrictions, saying that multiple reviews by the agency's staff support the safety of easing the limits on when during a pregnancy the pills can be taken and allowing mail-order and retail pharmacies to dispense the medication.",
      "What is RFK Jr.'s stance on vaccines?",
      "Many Democrats, nonprofits and health experts have also blasted Kennedy over his record of misleading and unfounded health claims, in addition to work by him and his allies opposing the approvals and authorizations of a range of vaccines, including COVID-19 and polio shots.",
      "Kennedy has sought to assuage concerns that he would upend vaccines using his authority, pledging in the days after the election not to ban any shots.",
      "In his government ethics agreement, Kennedy also promises for a year to not intervene in any matters involving a nonprofit he chaired, Children's Health Defense, which has battled federal agencies over vaccine authorizations and requirements.",
      "\"They're not interested in validating the press narrative that Bobby's going to come in and make sweeping changes in vaccine policy. That's going to be kind of political suicide right now,\" Dr. Robert Malone, a close Kennedy ally who has fiercely opposed the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, told CBS News.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a medical doctor and head of the Senate's health committee, said he had \"a frank conversation\" on \"vaccines at length\" with Kennedy after voicing concern over his past statements.",
      "The FDA's top vaccines official has also voiced optimism that he might find common ground with Kennedy over vaccines.",
      "\"This is how the sausage gets made. And you know, it's not always pretty and it isn't always what you want, but I'm really encouraged to see Bobby be pragmatic about the political realities here,\" said Malone.",
      "Who is RFK Jr?",
      "When Kennedy first announced his campaign as a Democratic presidential candidate in April 2023, he touted his decades-long record as an environmental lawyer.",
      "Kennedy \u2014 whose father, Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated during his 1968 presidential campaign \u2014 says he did not want to immediately enter politics, and instead \"carried on his family's legacy by devoting himself to environmental causes and children's welfare.\"",
      "That followed a struggle with substance abuse when he was younger, which he says spanned 14 years after he started using heroin at 15 years old.",
      "Kennedy made headlines for his environmental work was as founder and president of the nonprofit Waterkeeper Alliance from the 1980s until 2020, ranging from local efforts to clean up the Hudson River to campaigning against an oil pipeline in North Dakota.",
      "What Kennedy has described as his \"reluctant entrance into the vaccine debate\" dates back to 2005, when he wrote an article in Rolling Stone exploring supposed evidence for a link between autism and an ingredient that had formerly been used in some vaccines. The article contained numerous scientific and factual errors and was eventually retracted. Decades of research has established there is no such link.",
      "In 2016, Kennedy joined a nonprofit focused on mercury, which later broadened its focus and rebranded to Children's Health Defense. Kennedy chaired the group and served as one of its loudest voices raising doubts about vaccines and fighting against vaccine requirements and approvals.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, they clashed with federal health agencies over use of ivermectin and the federal mask mandate in travel. In 2021, the FDA denied their petition asking to revoke all COVID-19 vaccine authorizations and ban studies of the shots for children.",
      "As a candidate, Kennedy continued to say that he thought vaccines as well as \"a toxic soup coming mainly from their foods\" were to blame for rising rates of autism and other chronic diseases in U.S. children. Experts have attributed the global rise in autism prevalence in part to broader awareness and changes to how the disorder is classified and diagnosed.",
      "Kennedy's longshot bid to challenge President Joe Biden in the Democratic primary ended in October 2023, when he switched his campaign to an independent presidential bid. He dropped out of the campaign and endorsed Mr. Trump in August 2024.",

    "summary": "The online system for federal health funding warned of delays due to executive orders after the Trump administration announced a freeze.",
    "story": [
      "The White House blamed an \"outage\" for locking out a wide range of organizations and agencies on Tuesday from the online systems responsible for drawing down federal health dollars.",
      "Multiple state Medicaid programs reported late Tuesday they have been able to resume accessing their payment systems after the nationwide lockout.",
      "The interruption had sparked outcry from state governments, nonprofits and lawmakers in the wake of the Trump administration's\u00a0move to freeze spending\u00a0across the federal government. After legal challenges were filed against the funding freeze, a federal judge issued a stay\u00a0temporarily halting\u00a0the move until she can hear arguments in the case.",
      "State Medicaid agencies, federally funded\u00a0Head Start\u00a0early education programs and\u00a0community health centers\u00a0had been among those cut off from access to the\u00a0Payment Management Services\u00a0web portal, or PMS, run by the Department of Health and Human Services, which handles billions of dollars of payments every year.",
      "\"We have confirmed no payments have been affected \u2014 they are still being processed and sent. We expect the portal will be back online shortly,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt   said in a\u00a0post\u00a0on X.",
      "Confusion after Medicaid programs locked out",
      "There was widespread confusion after Medicaid and other programs discovered they were locked out of the federal health payment system. Spokespeople for HHS and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have not responded to requests for comment, amid the ongoing\u00a0communications \"pause\"\u00a0imposed by the Trump administration at the department.",
      "A spokesperson for the National Association of Medicaid Directors said they had also sought an explanation.",
      "\"My staff has confirmed reports that Medicaid portals are down in all 50 states following last night's federal funding freeze. This is a blatant attempt to rip away health care from millions of Americans overnight and will get people killed,\" Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden\u00a0posted\u00a0on X.",
      "\"Multiple states locked out of Medicaid portal,\" Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii tweeted. \"This is a Trump shutdown, except this time it's unlawful.\"",
      "Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said he was assured Medicaid would not be affected.",
      "\"What the White House has told us just now is that Medicaid is not, categorically not, covered by this,\" Hawley said. \"In other words, there will be no interruption to Medicaid or Medicare or any grant that floats to individuals.\"",
      "Joann Alker of the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families had\u00a0called on\u00a0the administration to issue a statement clarifying that\u00a0Medicaid\u00a0should not be affected after its initial memo ordering the spending freeze late Monday, warning it is a\u00a0\"major crisis\"\u00a0as states look to draw down funding for the month.",
      "\"Any pause in federal funding of Medicaid \u2014 the largest source of federal funding received by states \u2014 would be disastrous for states as they need to draw down federal funds to meet their financial obligations to the health care providers and health plans serving Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries,\" Alker said.",
      "Health centers warn of \"irreversible\" consequences",
      "Even as the payment systems come back online, those who rely on the grants say they worry that new \"delays\" on payments imposed by the Trump administration could inflict permanent damage on stretched-thin health care systems.",
      "The HHS website currently warns that due \"to Executive Orders regarding potentially unallowable grant payments, PMS is taking additional measures to process payments. Reviews of applicable programs and payments will result in delays and/or rejections of payments.\"",
      "In a statement ahead of the lockout, HHS\u00a0announced\u00a0it would be reevaluating \"all programs, regulations, and guidance to ensure Federal taxpayer dollars are not being used to pay for or promote elective abortion\" following a previous\u00a0executive order.",
      "\"Even with the best of intentions, these types of funding freezes can do tremendous harm. And could be irreversible to some communities. What we're really talking about is a health center's ability to pay salaries,\" said Amanda Pears Kelly, CEO of the group Advocates for Community Health.",
      "The group lobbies on behalf of community health centers, which are subsidized by the federal government to offer health care to low-income communities.",
      "Pears Kelly said that health centers often rely on being able to request money every-other-week through the system, drawing down their grant to pay bills and make payroll for their staff. Without the money, she warned many health centers facing already slim margins could be forced to trim staff or close their doors.",
      "\"When the system's down, and there's no one to talk to to understand what they need to do, and then on top of that there's an uncertain time to the delay, it's paralyzing,\" said Pears Kelly.",
      "In a\u00a0statement, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association warned that health centers could face \"significant disruption\" to operations even with a \"temporary funding pause.\"",
      "\"For many patients, Title X-funded health centers serve as their sole source of health care. The Title X family planning program is already chronically underfunded, and this executive action risks destabilizing a health provider network that is already operating under immense strain,\" said Clare Coleman, president and CEO of the association.",
      "School lunches, other programs worry about impact",
      "The implications of the federal grant pause go beyond HHS, but the full effects are still unknown.",
      "It's unclear whether the National School Lunch Program, which reimburses schools and school districts each month for the meals they serve children, will still receive funding through the U.S. Department of Agriculture if the freeze takes effect. The program feeds about 28 million American schoolchildren each month.",
      "Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations at the School Nutrition Association, said her organization is asking the USDA for more information.",
      "\"We're urging Congress to increase reimbursements for school meals given the financial crisis facing meal programs today, so certainly there's just no room in the budget for missed reimbursements,\" she said.",
      "Meals on Wheels, a nonprofit organization that delivers about 250 million meals each year to more than 2 million seniors, receives federal grant funding. They're not sure what's next either.",
      "\"If in fact this order includes the Older Americans Act, this would presumably halt service to millions of vulnerable seniors who have no other means of purchasing or preparing meals,\" a Meals on Wheels spokesperson said. \"And the lack of clarity and uncertainty right now is creating chaos for local Meals on Wheels providers not knowing for sure whether they should be serving meals today, which unfortunately means seniors will panic not knowing where their next meals will come from.\"",
      "They added that since the program is already underfunded, local providers generally \"don't have the ability to absorb a blow like this, especially if it persists for any extended period.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 16:28:23 -0500",
    "summary": "A different strain of H5N9 has shown up in U.S. birds before.",
    "story": [
      "A California duck farm made headlines this week after the World Organization of Animal Health published a report by U.S. authorities that a strain of bird flu that scientists call H5N9 had been found among sick birds in the flock.",
      "This is far from the first time that H5N9 has been found in birds around the country. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it was the first time that H5N9 had been found in American poultry sick with \"highly pathogenic avian influenza,\" meaning it caused severe disease.",
      "\"Clinical signs included increased mortality. State officials have quarantined the affected premises,\" the USDA said of the flock.",
      "What is H5N9 and how is it different from H5N1?",
      "Scientists classify bird flu viruses by which kind of two key proteins are inside of them: the hemagglutinin, like H5 or H3, and the neuraminidase, like N1 or N9.",
      "Different blends of those two proteins alongside many other mutations elsewhere in the virus can affect how sick people and animals get and how it spreads.",
      "H5N1 has been the dominant grouping of strains fueling this past year's outbreaks in the U.S., with different variants of that virus spreading in wild birds, poultry flocks, dairy cattle, pets and into at least 67 confirmed human cases.",
      "A spokesperson for the department said that scientists believe the H5N9 was the result of a \"reassortment,\" where H5N1 was able to\u00a0genetically mix\u00a0with other influenza viruses inside of a duck.",
      "\"The finding was not unexpected, as it is not uncommon to see reassortments and ducks are reservoir hosts for influenza A viruses,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Both H5N9 and H5N1 were found to be infecting ducks at the farm, the USDA said.",
      "\"The H5N1 virus is widely circulating across North America, and these viruses can reassort in species that are susceptible to influenza viruses,\" said S. Mark Tompkins, director of the Center for Influenza Disease and Emergence Research at the University of Georgia. He agreed that it would not be \"terribly surprising\" to see a reassortment emerge to infect poultry.",
      "\"H5N1 reassorts with other avian influenza viruses quite frequently and even the current H5 HA protein that is infecting dairy cows and commercial poultry farms in the US has been shown to reassort,\"\u00a0Andy Pekosz, professor of microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University, wrote in an email.",
      "Has H5N9 been seen in the U.S. before?",
      "H5N9 has been seen before in U.S. birds, but often it results in less severe symptoms, called \"low pathogenic avian influenza\" by veterinarians.",
      "\"H5N9 viruses have been detected in North American wild birds in 2023 and 2024, and before the current outbreak,\" said Tompkins.",
      "Some of the\u00a0earliest records\u00a0of H5N9 around the world date back to turkeys infected in Wisconsin in the 1960s, which U.S. officials\u00a0reported had\u00a0\"mild respiratory symptoms and a severe drop in egg production.\"",
      "The California duck farm's strain of H5N9 is different from those earlier cases because this time it is closely related to a newer variant of the H5N1 virus. That variant is called H5N1 D1.1, the USDA spokesperson said, which has emerged over the past year to dominate U.S. cases in wild birds and poultry.",
      "\"The combination H5N9 is not new and other versions, like H5N5 also exist. Just because this was now detected, doesn't mean trouble necessarily,\" said virologist Florian Krammer, professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in an email.",
      "Krammer pointed to recent detections of the H5N5\u00a0strain spreading from Europe, and then jumping from birds to be able to infect mammals across Canada as prompting more worry for him.",
      "\"It's not really surprising, because we have a history of three years of H5N1 undergoing reassortments that would typically burn out and not emerge as a major one,\" said David Swayne, a private veterinarian and former director of the USDA's Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory.",
      "Swayne said that past H5N9 outbreaks have been dead ends, in the handful of times they have been found to be causing severe disease in ducks.",
      "\"So far, I have not heard of any evidence to say this H5N9 has some kind of fitness that is better than the H5N1. If it doesn't have that, it can't outcompete,\" said Swayne.",
      "Is H5N9 a bigger risk to humans than H5N1?",
      "As with H5N1, H5N9 in birds would still need to achieve some key mutations before it is able to spread efficiently among humans.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday they have found no evidence of human-to-human transmission of bird flu in the U.S. to date. Most cases were blamed on direct contact with sick animals, except for three that have befuddled investigators who failed to identify a likely source.",
      "It is unclear whether authorities followed up with workers at the Merced County farm about potential human infections. A spokesperson for the county did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "If H5N9 gains a foothold in humans, people may possibly have less immunity to the virus than they do to H5N1.",
      "\"The seasonal, human H1N1 virus has an NA protein that is related, but different from the bovine H5N1 NA protein. There is some cross-recognition of avian H5N1 NA in the human population because of this,\" said Pekosz.",
      "Where was the California H5N9 outbreak?",
      "The USDA said the virus was detected at a \"commercial duck meat\" farm in California's Merced County, in an outbreak that started on Nov. 23, 2024.",
      "A total of 118,954 birds were culled at the duck farm by Dec. 2 to stamp out the virus, in an effort to curb the risk of further bird flu spread.",
      "More than 3 million birds have been culled at farms in this California county over the past year due to bird flu outbreaks, the most of any county in the state. California has been hit hard by this past year's bird flu outbreaks, which have resulted in record cullings across the egg industry.",
      "Scientists say ducks are especially susceptible to harboring influenza viruses without being sick, making them common mixing vessels for bird flu strains.",
      "\"Unless you have very tight biosecurity, it is very hard to raise ducks without many low path influenza viruses,\" said Swayne.",
      "Swayne said ducks often need the lowest dose of virus to be infected with bird flu viruses, compared to other poultry, like chickens. One way the virus can spread onto farms is when they are raised outside, mixing with wild ducks.",
      "\"If you look at the natural history, wild ducks are the reservoir of genes for all influenza virus. There's probably an adaptation with the virus. These viruses infect without showing overt clinical disease, they spread very rapidly between the adults to the juveniles,\" said Swayne.",

    "story": [
      "An Alabama woman passed a major milestone Saturday to become the longest-living recipient of a pig organ transplant \u2013 healthy and full of energy with her new kidney for 61 days and counting.",
      "\"I'm superwoman,\" Towana Looney told The Associated Press, laughing about outpacing family members on long walks around New York City as she continues her recovery. \"It's a new take on life.\"",
      "Looney's vibrant recovery is a morale boost in the quest to make\u00a0animal-to-human transplants a reality. Looney the\u00a0fifth American\u00a0given a\u00a0gene-edited pig organ.",
      "\"If you saw her on the street, you would have no idea that she's the only person in the world walking around with a pig organ inside them that's functioning,\" said Dr. Robert Montgomery of NYU Langone Health, who led Looney's transplant.",
      "Montgomery called Looney's kidney function \"absolutely normal.\" Doctors hope she can leave New York \u2013 where she's temporarily living for post-transplant checkups \u2013 for her Gadsden, Alabama, home in about another month.",
      "\"We're quite optimistic that this is going to continue to work and work well for, you know, a significant period of time,\" he said.",
      "Why scientists are using pig organs for transplants",
      "Scientists are genetically altering pigs so their organs are more humanlike to address a severe shortage of transplantable human organs. More than 100,000 people are on the U.S. transplant list, most who need a kidney, and thousands die waiting.",
      "Pig organ transplants so far have been \"compassionate use\" cases, experiments the Food and Drug Administration allows only in special circumstances for people out of other options.",
      "And the handful of hospitals trying them are sharing information of what worked and what didn't, in preparation for the world's first formal studies of xenotransplantation, expected to begin sometime this year. United Therapeutics, which supplied Looney's kidney, recently asked the Food and Drug Administration for permission to begin a trial.",
      "How Looney fares is a \"very precious experience,\" said Dr. Tatsuo Kawai of Massachusetts General Hospital, who led the world's first pig kidney transplant last year and works with another pig developer, eGenesis.",
      "Looney was far healthier than the prior patients, Kawai noted, so her progress will help inform the next attempts.",
      "\"We have to learn from each other,\" he said.",
      "Towana Looney's transplant story",
      "Looney donated a kidney to her mother in 1999. Later pregnancy complications caused high blood pressure that damaged her remaining kidney, which eventually failed, something incredibly rare among living donors. She spent eight years on dialysis before doctors concluded she'd likely never get a donated organ \u2013 she'd developed super-high levels of antibodies abnormally primed to attack another human kidney.",
      "So Looney, 53, sought out the pig experiment. No one knew how it would work in someone \"highly sensitized\" with those overactive antibodies.",
      "Discharged just 11 days after the Nov. 25 surgery, Montgomery's team has closely tracked her recovery through blood tests and other measurements. About three weeks after the transplant, they caught subtle signs that rejection was beginning \u2013 signs they'd learned to look for thanks to a 2023 experiment when a pig kidney worked for 61 days inside a deceased man whose body was donated for research.",
      "Montgomery said they successfully treated Looney and there's been no sign of rejection since \u2013 and a few weeks ago she met the family behind that deceased-body research.",
      "\"It feels really good to know that the decision I made for NYU to use my brother was the right decision and it's helping people,\" said Mary Miller-Duffy, of Newburgh, New York.",
      "Looney in turn is trying to help others, serving as what Montgomery calls an ambassador for people who've been reaching out to her through social media, sharing their distress at the long wait for transplants and wondering about pig kidneys.",
      "One, she said, was being considered for a xenotransplant at another hospital but was scared, wondering whether to proceed.",
      "\"I didn't want to persuade him whether to do or not to do it,\" Looney said.",
      "Instead, she asked if he was religious and urged him to pray, to \"go off your faith, what your heart tells you.\"",
      "\"I love talking to people, I love helping people,\" she added. \"I want to be, like, some educational piece\" for scientists to help others.",
      "There's no way to predict how long Looney's new kidney will work but if it were to fail she could receive dialysis again.",
      "\"The truth is we don't really know what the next hurdles are because this is the first time we've gotten this far,\" Montgomery said. \"We'll have to continue to really keep a close eye on her.\"",

    "story": [
      "As Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump's Health and Human Services Secretary nominee, awaits his confirmation hearing, financial disclosures released Wednesday show that he is saddled with millions in debt, but is positioned to earn millions from book deals.",
      "In financial disclosure forms filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, Kennedy reported debts of $610,000 to $1.2 million on his American Express card, up to three mortgages totaling somewhere from $2.25 million to $10.5 million, along with other loans, one of which was as much as $500,000.",
      "Even so, he reported netting more than $11 million over the past two years, and is expected to take in $2 million to $4 million more in book advances for two books with Skyhorse Publishing in New York: \"Unsettled Science\" and \"A Defense for Israel.\"",
      "Nearly $9 million of Kennedy's recent income came from his law firm, Kennedy and Madonna, LLP, now called Madonna and Madonna, LLP. In a letter dated Jan. 21, Kennedy wrote to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics that, if confirmed as HHS Secretary, he would sever ties with the firm and some other income sources to avoid conflicts of interest. His final payment from the firm was in May 2024, he said.",
      "The disclosures also make clear Kennedy still intends to receive legal fees from Wisner Baum, a firm suing the maker of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine Gardasil over its alleged failure to warn consumers about its risks.",
      "\"Upon confirmation, I will retain an interest in contingency fee cases that do not involve claims against the United States and in which the United States is not a party and does not have a direct and substantial interest,\" Kennedy wrote in his disclosure.",
      "His financial disclosure shows he earned $856,559 in referral fees from Wisner.",
      "Kennedy also drew $326,056 in salary and benefits from Children's Health Defense, a nonprofit that has filed lawsuits against federal agencies \u2014 including some he would oversee as secretary \u2014 over vaccine approvals such as COVID-19 shots for children.",
      "In December, Kennedy said he resigned as chairman and chief legal counsel for CHD after being nominated to head HHS.",
      "\"We are grateful for Bobby's past contributions and commitment to Children's Health Defense and to the millions of children harmed by toxic exposures,\" said Mary Holland, CEO of CHD, at the time.",
      "\"Bobby provided the impetus behind so many of CHD's big accomplishments. While we will miss his leadership, we are proud that he has been nominated to lead HHS. We look forward to all that we know he will work to accomplish as he moves into this powerful government position.\"",
      "Kennedy also listed income from a mix of stocks, endorsements, speaking fees and residuals connected to his wife, Cheryl Hines, best known for her work on HBO's \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\"",
      "Hines also receives residuals from shows and movies \"Friends,\" \"Herbie,\" \"Waitress,\" \"The Conners,\" \"The Flight Attendant\" and \"A Bad Moms Christmas.\" She received a $600,000 advance to pen her memoir, \"My Shade of Crazy.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration's \"short pause\" on communications, expected to end on Feb. 1, has affected FDA updates on food contamination investigations.",
    "story": [
      "Multiple federal health agencies have stopped releasing some key health information \u2014 including updates on some outbreak investigations \u2014 amid a department-wide communications \"pause\" ordered by the Trump administration, though many other \"mission critical\" updates are still being released, CBS News has learned.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services \"has issued a pause on mass communications and public appearances that are not directly related to emergencies or critical to preserving health,\" Stefanie Spear, the HHS principal deputy chief of staff, told CBS News in an email. \"This is a short pause to allow the new team to set up a process for review and prioritization.\"",
      "The Food and Drug Administration, a federal agency of the HHS, usually releases updates on probes of outbreaks linked to contaminated food every Wednesday, but the agency did not release them this week. As of the FDA's last update on Jan. 15, authorities were investigating multiple outbreaks of E. coli and Listeria.",
      "Publication of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's authoritative scientific publication, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, has also been delayed, health officials said. Articles have been published virtually every Thursday for decades, detailing agency guidance, updates on disease outbreak investigations and studies of health threats. But no issue was published this past Thursday.",
      "Weekly CDC updates on rates of flu and COVID-19 vaccinations have also been disrupted, the agency's website shows. Local health departments and nonprofits rely on these figures to track uptake of the shots, targeting outreach to communities seeing lagging immunization rates.",

      "At least some of the CDC's work with outsiders is still ongoing. A spokesperson for Alabama's health department said Thursday that the CDC was still involved in an ongoing investigation of unusual side effects linked to an antibiotic injection used in the state.",
      "Public health labs have also so far not been hindered by the pause, a lab official outside the federal government said, despite a handful of webinars and calls that were canceled.",
      "An update to the CDC's travel notice about Tanzania was also published Thursday, after the World Health Organization announced an outbreak of Marburg virus disease had been confirmed in the country.",
      "The FDA is still releasing notices about recalls. A safety communication was also posted by the FDA this week, warning of an allergic reaction linked to a multiple sclerosis medication.",
      "Multiple current and former health officials said a slowdown in communications has happened during every recent transition, as incoming officials sought to get a handle around the firehose of information and guidance coming from across the federal health bureaucracy.",
      "But some also said the length and scope of the communications slowdown was unusual, resulting in confusion among staff as health agencies sought to stop or claw back communications, meetings and events to comply with the directive.",
      "At the National Institutes of Health, meetings set up to review grant applications were abruptly canceled and agency experts at outside events and conferences were either unexpectedly recalled or participated without making any comments, one researcher said.",
      "A meeting organized by the Presidential Advisory Council for Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria scheduled for next week was also canceled, according to an email obtained by CBS News. Health officials from several countries were scheduled to discuss strategies to respond to superbugs at the meeting.",
      "Another monthly meeting scheduled by the CDC for Jan. 27 with testing laboratories was also canceled. The CDC relies on the monthly calls to answer questions about guidance and ongoing outbreaks from labs, like about the recent change in testing procedures in response to this past year's unprecedented bird flu outbreak.",
      "The end of the communications \"pause\" will coincide with the conclusion of Senate hearings next week for Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Trump's controversial nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "It's not clear whether Kennedy, a former Democrat who has been widely criticized for his anti-vaccine statements and activism, will have the support to be confirmed in the closely divided Senate."

    "summary": "The humble egg is now a source of frustration for millions of shoppers around the U.S, who face soaring prices and shortages. What's going on?",
    "story": [
      "At Market Basket locations in some parts of Massachusetts, customers are being asked to limit their egg purchases\u00a0to two cartons per family. Another shopper on the hunt for eggs, this one in Las Vegas, reported finding\u00a0empty shelves\u00a0at a local grocery store. On social media, a consumer\u00a0accustomed to paying around $2 for a dozen eggs expressed shock over now having to pay more than double that amount.",
      "Egg restrictions, shortages and record-high prices are ruffling feathers at supermarkets across the U.S. as a deadly strain of avian flu\u00a0continues to decimate\u00a0the country's poultry flocks. To the dismay of consumers still struggling to digest soaring food costs, that likely means even higher egg prices in 2025.",
      "\"I think eggs have felt relatively extreme over the past few months,\" Kip Green, co-owner and general manager of Montague Diner in Brooklyn, New York, told CBS News. \"We're fortunate though, we have a great relationships with our purveyors, with farmers. So everybody is trying to help each other out, which is lovely.\"",
      "Like many diners, Montague uses hundreds of eggs a day said Green. Whether served as part of a classic breakfast plate alongside potatoes and toast, or an egg salad sandwich, eggs comprise 40% to 50% of the restaurant's menu, she said.",
      "\"I mean, it's even like, there's some things that you might not even think about, like in our pancake batter or like in our French toast batter, like just things like that. We still use so many eggs.\"",
      "Even so, Green says that she and her team are \"aligned on keeping guests at the forefront,\" which means shielding them from price hikes on eggs.",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it's challenging. Like we, we have to figure out how to make it work,\" said Green. \"Eggs are central to us, we are a diner. You have to have an egg plate,\" she said, adding, \"We don't ever want to stop that or to, to make people pay more for something like that. So you figure out how to cut costs elsewhere.\"",
      "The average price of a dozen large, grade-A eggs was $4.15 in December 2024, up 14% from $3.65 in November, federal\u00a0data shows. That's a more than 60% increase from the $2.51 it cost a year ago and 160% more than the $1.41 consumers paid for the same carton in 2019, CBS News' price tracker\u00a0reveals.",
      "By comparison, the overall monthly rate of inflation for food in December was 2.5%, with the cost of food at home rising just 0.3%, according to the latest Consumer Price Index data.",
      "Like a souffl\u00e9, egg prices are rising to impressive heights right before our eyes. When will it end? Not anytime soon, according to the USDA, which\u00a0predicts\u00a0in a recent report that egg prices will shoot up another 20% this year.",
      "Behind rising egg prices and shortages is a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), known as H5N1, that killed 13.2 million commercial egg-laying hens in the month of December alone and continues to depopulate flocks into 2025, according to the USDA. Outbreaks of H5N1 were first detected in the U.S. in 2022 and are considered to be the main driver behind the years-long volatility in egg prices.",
      "H5N1, which has a high mortality rate among infected\u00a0poultry\u00a0and wild birds, is being watched closely by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a potential public health\u00a0threat. So far, the CDC has received one report of a person dying after being hospitalized with severe illness from the virus. Among cattle, the average mortality and culling rate is 2% or less, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. However, officials warn that H5N1 is lethal to cats",
      "For now, the virus remains mostly a thorn in the side of U.S. consumers\u00a0fed up with inflation.",
      "\"For about a year and a half now, the sort of frequency and severity of avian flu outbreaks in the poultry and egg supply chains in the U.S. have sort of just been on the rise in a big way,\" Ricky Volpe, a professor of agribusiness at Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Everyone is just sort of hoping that, 'OK, this will be the last one, then we'll get back to normal.' But we keep on not getting back to normal.\"",
      "More than 79.3 million U.S. chickens died in 2022 and 2023 as result of H5N1 infections and related culling, according to a January\u00a0report\u00a0from TD Cowen. In total, H5N1 is estimated to have led to the loss of nearly 139 million birds across the country, including Puerto Rico, according to the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.",
      "Devastating for farmers",
      "The bird flu outbreaks disrupting the nation's egg supplies are a dealing a serious blow to affected farmers. Anytime the virus is found, the entire flock must be slaughtered to help limit the virus' spread. Replenishing supplies is yet another challenge.",
      "\"It takes approximately 19-20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs in newly repopulated barns, and that is but one element of a lengthy recovery process,\" a spokesperson for the American Egg Board said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Bird flu is absolutely devastating to an egg farm. When an egg farm is impacted with HPAI, it must go through a comprehensive and lengthy process involving multiple steps and government approvals before it can begin to repopulate with new flocks and return to producing eggs. This process that can take nine months to more than a year,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "With massive egg farms routinely housing more than 1 million chickens, just a few infections can lead to a supply crunch.",
      "Other factors",
      "Another factor driving up egg prices: a persistent shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. \u2014 a mounting problem as more drivers retire. And with fewer drivers to transport eggs to retailers, wholesalers are forced to raise shipping costs.",
      "\"Refrigerated truck transportation is a major pain point in the food supply chain right now. There's a shortage of drivers, long-haul truck rates are up and eggs are of course very transportation-intensive,\" Volpe said. \"Even before we were dealing with avian flu, the trucks just weren't there to deliver eggs in a timely fashion.\"",
      "For consumers in Colorado, a state law requiring all eggs to be cage-free by January 2025, has added to the soaring price of eggs.",
      "As a partial solution to the nationwide problem, Volpe suggests that retailers source eggs locally wherever possible.",
      "\"[Local suppliers] are pretty well insulated from these systemic issues of avian flu or whatever, so supply is healthy. So it makes sense to augment supply whenever possible locally from local growers who are not facing these significant issues related to bird flu and transportation.\"",
      "Why are egg prices lower in some stores?",
      "Just as retailers use Thanksgiving Day turkey promotions to attract customers, some grocery stores around the country are offering lower egg prices to drive store traffic.",
      "\"You can go on social media and you'll see someone complaining about an $8 dozen of eggs and then someone else will chime in and go 'I just got it for $4.' Well, I absolutely guarantee you that was sold at a loss, and it was sort of a competitive effort to increase foot traffic,\" Volpe said. \"Maybe eggs are sold at a loss, but now you're going to buy your milk and your bread and vegetables, everything else, and those will have the normal profit margins.\"",
      "Translation: If you find a good deal on eggs at a store, you might still end up paying roughly the same cost for your entire basket of groceries as you would somewhere else.",
      "Response from White House",
      "\"There is a lot of reporting out there that is putting the onus on this White House for the increased cost of eggs,\" said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked at her first press briefing on Tuesday what President Trump is doing to address egg prices which have spiked since he took office earlier this month.",
      "\"As far as the egg shortage, what's also contributing to that is that the Biden admin and Department of Agriculture directed the mass killing of 100 million chickens,\" Leavitt, who made no mention of avian flu, said in her response.",
      "Leavitt went on to urge the Senate to move \"swiftly\" to confirm Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees \"including his nominee for the United States Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins ... who is leading the economic team here at the White House, on how we can address the egg shortage in this country.\"",
      "Correction:\u00a0This story has been revised because it mistakenly reported that it takes less than six weeks for commercial hens to produce eggs. This is incorrect. It takes 19 to 20 weeks before hens are ready to produce eggs, according to the American Egg Board. The trade group also notes that it can take more than a year for farms suffering a bird flu outbreak to secure the required government clearance to resume operations.",

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 12:48:00 -0500",
    "summary": "With tax season underway, here's what you need to know about tracking your tax refund and your new 2025 tax brackets.",
    "story": [
      "Tax season is now underway, with the IRS accepting returns for all taxpayers as of Jan. 27. That's prompting many people to turn to the \"Where's my refund?\" app from the tax agency to track when they'll get their check.",
      "Americans are expected to file about 140 million returns before the April 15 deadline. Last year, about two-thirds of taxpayers got a refund, with the average check at about $3,100,\u00a0according\u00a0to IRS data.",
      "A household's tax refund may represent their biggest check for the entire year, with many consumers planning to use the money for debt repayment, emergency savings or a big purchase. To be sure, while a large refund may feel like a financial windfall, it actually represents income that taxpayers have overpaid to the IRS throughout the year.",
      "That's why some financial experts describe refund checks as tax-free loans to the U.S. government. Yet other experts note that tax refunds can act as a form of forced savings that a household might not otherwise be able to accomplish, allowing those taxpayers to reap the benefit in their annual refund.",
      "Whatever the case might be, tracking your refund can be done through the IRS' \"Where's my refund\" app, which the agency has sought to improve over the last few years. Here's what to know.",
      "How does \"Where's my refund?\" work?",
      "The IRS operates the \"Where's my refund?\" service on its website, but taxpayers can also use a mobile app called IRS2Go\u00a0on their phones or other devices. Both services will provide information about your 2024 return about 24 hours after you e-file, the IRS says.",
      "However, people who file paper returns will need to wait about 4 weeks for their information to appear on \"Where's my refund?\" or the IRS2Go app.",
      "Both services require taxpayers to enter information to be able to track their refunds:",
      "Either your Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification numberFiling status, such as single filer or married filing jointly\u00a0The exact whole dollar amount of your expected refund from your original 2024 tax return",
      "Either your Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification number",
      "Filing status, such as single filer or married filing jointly",
      "The exact whole dollar amount of your expected refund from your original 2024 tax return",
      "The IRS tracking services will then show you information on whether the agency has received your tax return, if the refund has been approved and when the money is scheduled to land in your account.",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "That depends on whether you've file electronically or sent in a paper tax return, as well as if the IRS identifies any problems with your return.",
      "People who e-filed their returns typically receive their refunds in less than 21 days. In other words, a taxpayer who filed their 1040 on Jan. 27 could receive their payment by Feb. 17, if all goes smoothly.",
      "However, the IRS opened its Free File service on Jan. 10, which is a program offered through tax software companies for taxpayers with adjusted gross income of $84,000 or less in 2024. Those using Free File could be on tap to receive their refunds by Jan. 31.",
      "What can delay your tax refund?",
      "Filing a paper return can delay your refund because it requires IRS employees to process them, which takes more time than e-filed returns, which are largely handled by computers.",
      "Claiming either the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) can also slow down a tax refund. That's because, by law, the IRS can't issue refunds for returns that have claimed those tax credits before mid-February.",
      "\"The IRS expects most EITC/ACTC-related refunds to be available in taxpayer bank accounts or on debit cards by March 3 if they chose direct deposit and there are no other issues with their tax return,\" the agency said on Monday.",
      "Some issues can also trip up tax refunds, such as if there are math errors on your return, missing or incorrect Social Security numbers or misspelled names, according to the IRS. While these might be innocent mistakes, it can cause the IRS to flag your return and delay your refund.",
      "What's my new 2025 tax bracket?",
      "The IRS has set new tax brackets for 2025, but that won't impact the return you'll file by April 15, since that 1040 reflects your 2024 income and taxes.",
      "Each year, the IRS adjusts its tax brackets and dozens of other provisions to account for inflation. The idea is to shield taxpayers from \"bracket creep\" \u2014 when workers are pushed into higher tax bands due to the impact of cost-of-living adjustments aimed at offsetting inflation \u2014 without a change in their standard of living.",
      "This year's tax brackets are adjusted 2.8% higher from 2024, representing the smallest jump in several years. Because inflation jumped during the pandemic, the bracket adjustments reached 7% in 2023\u00a0and\u00a05.4% in 2024.",

The Federal Reserve's favored inflation gauge \u2014 called the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE \u2014 rose at a 2.3% annual pace last quarter, up from 1.5% in the third quarter and above the Fed's 2% target. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation was 2.5%, up from 2.2% in the July-September quarter.",
      "A drop in business inventories shaved 0.93 percentage points off fourth-quarter growth.",
      "But a category within the GDP data that measures the economy's underlying strength rose at a healthy 3.2% annual rate from July through September, slipping from 3.4% in the third quarter. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending.",

      "President Donald Trump has inherited a healthy economy. Growth has been steady and unemployment low \u2014 4.1% in December.",
      "On Wednesday, the Fed left its benchmark interest rate unchanged after making three cuts since September. With the economy rolling along, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters, \"we do not need to be in a hurry'' to make more cuts. The Fed is also cautious because progress against inflation has stalled in recent months after falling from four-decade highs hit in mid-2022.",
      "The European Central Bank cut its benchmark rate by a quarter point Thursday, underlining the contrast between more robust growth in the U.S. economy and stagnation in Europe, which recorded zero growth at the end of last year.",
      "The U.S. economic outlook has become more cloudy, however. Trump has promised to cut taxes and ease regulations on business, which could speed GDP growth. But his plan to impose big taxes on imports and to deport millions of immigrants working in the United States illegally could mean slower growth and higher prices.",
      "Trump said last week that he would lower oil prices and then \"demand'' lower interest rates \u2013 a topic he said he'd take up with Powell. But the Fed chair deflected questions about Trump's comments Wednesday and said he'd had no contact with the president.",

Another 46% were eligible to telework, and they spent an average of 61% of working hours in office. Only 10% of federal workers were in fully remote positions.",

      "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it will leave its benchmark rate unchanged, hitting the brakes on lowering borrowing costs for individuals and businesses after a flurry of rate cuts starting last fall.",
      "The Fed said it will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The decision comes after the central bank trimmed rates three times starting in September 2024, which has pushed down the federal funds rate \u2014 the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 by one percentage point.",
      "The pause, the Fed's first rate decision since President Trump returned to office on Jan. 20, comes as economists predict the central bank is likely to take a wait-and-see approach to the president's economic policies, given that some, such as higher tariffs, could prove inflationary.",
      "The Fed's decision to keep rates steady reflects stubborn U.S. inflation, which remains close to 3% on an annual basis. That has fueled concerns that additional rate cuts could reignite price increases, making it more difficult to get to the Fed's 2% target. Notably, the Fed removed a line from its December statement expressing its belief that inflation \"has made progress\" toward its goal. Yet Powell struck a more dovish tone in a press conference to discuss the Fed's decision.",

Most economists also predict the Fed will hold off on cutting at its March 19 meeting, which means the next rate cut might not occur until the central bank's May 7 meeting, FactSet data shows.",
      "The January pause marks an end, at least temporarily, to the Fed's flurry of rate cuts that started in September 2024 which have pushed down the federal funds rate by one percentage point. That's helped trim borrowing costs for credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other debt, providing some respite to inflation-pinched consumers and businesses.",

Economists say it's likely the Fed wants to take a wait-and-see approach to the Trump administration's policies such as adding new tariffs and widespread deportations of immigrants, which could both prove inflationary.",
      "\"The reason why the Fed isn't jumping the gun at lowering the rates faster and further is that, on one hand, inflation is not gone. They looked carefully at the data, and it is still stubbornly above target, so there is concern if you lower rates further, inflation would tick up again,\" Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "The Fed cut its benchmark rate three times last year, kicking off with a jumbo 0.5 percentage point reduction in September. That was followed by two consecutive\u00a00.25 percentage point cuts: one at its November meeting and a second at its December meeting.",
      "The pause in early 2025 means that consumers can't expect additional near-term relief on borrowing costs, experts say.",
      "\"Anyone hoping for the Fed to ride in as the cavalry and rescue you from high interest rates anytime soon is going to be really disappointed,\" said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree, in an email. \"That's true whether you're talking about mortgages, auto loans, credit cards or most anything else.\"",
      "Because credit card rates and other borrowing costs aren't likely to change, consumers should work on getting their higher-interest debt under control, Schulz added. Turning to a 0% balance transfer credit card or consolidating credit card debt with a personal loan can prove helpful with lowering interest payments, he noted.",
      "If there's a bright side, it's for savers, given that they should still be able to find solid rates on high-yield savings accounts, even though they've declined since the Fed began trimming its benchmark rate last year, Schulz said. Some savings accounts are still paying above 4%, down from about 5% a year ago.",
      "\"Returns on high-yield savings accounts have fallen from their record levels as the Fed has moved to lower rates. However, as the Fed pauses, that decline should slow as well,\" he said.",
      "When will mortgage rates come down?",
      "One of the disappointments for house hunters, as well as homeowners who want to refinance into lower rates, has been stubbornly high mortgage rates. Despite the Fed's three rate cuts last year, the average 30-year home loan remains near 7%, near 25-year highs.",
      "Mortgage rates haven't declined despite the Fed's cuts because home loans are based on a number of factors besides the federal funds rate, including broader economic trends and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond.",
      "Given concerns from economists that President Trump's plans could prove inflationary, mortgage rates might not come down anytime soon, experts said.",
      "\"The general consensus is that rates will likely remain unchanged until the market has more clarity around potential policy impacts as it relates to immigration, taxes and tariffs,\" noted Austin Walker, CEO of A. Walker & Co., a housing finance company.",
      "Will interest rates go down under President Trump?",
      "Last week at the World Economic Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump said he would \"demand that interest rates drop immediately, and likewise, they should be dropping all over the world.\"",
      "It's unlikely that Mr. Trump could influence the Fed to lower rates, as the central bank is an independent institution that bases its decisions on economic data, rather than orders from elected officials, experts say.",
      "Rates are set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which consists of 12 members \u2014 seven members come from the Fed's Board of Governors; four stem from the eleven Reserve Bank presidents, who each serve one-year terms on a rotating basis, and one FOMC member is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Powell, meanwhile, has said he won't step down if Mr. Trump, who has previously criticized Powell's performance, asks him to resign, adding that the president doesn't have the power to fire or demote the Fed chair. His term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "At the same time, economists are forecasting more rate cuts in 2025, but not until May or even later, according to FactSet polling. But one wild card is whether inflation could tick higher in early 2025 due to the Trump administration's policies.",
      "\"Importantly, the outlook is clouded by heightened policy uncertainty as a new administration takes office,\" said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco in an email. Daco added he is forecasting three 0.25 percentage point cuts this year \u2014 in March, June and September. \"This year, we expect the Fed will tread carefully.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 14:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump executive order that reclassifies career civil servants risks politicizing thousands of government jobs, critics say.",
    "story": [
      "From meat inspectors to border patrol officers, many Americans who work for the federal government could soon see their jobs reclassified into at-will positions, meaning they can be dismissed for nearly any reason.",
      "In a related development, the White House expects up to 10% of federal employees to quit in September in a program meant to\u00a0end work-from-home practices, senior administration officials told CBS News.",
      "Depending on future court rulings and how effective the Trump administration proves to be in overriding existing federal regulations, an executive order signed by President Trump revives a policy from his first administration known as Schedule F. The Jan. 20\u00a0directive\u00a0creates a new employment classification for many career civil servants, effectively stripping them of job protections.",
      "Likely to impact tens of thousands of civil servants, and potentially more, the order defines policymaking positions to include mundane tasks such as viewing and circulating proposed government regulations.",
      "\"We think this order affects at least 50,000 people who are currently protected, but the number could be much bigger,\" Nick Bednar, a University of Minnesota Law School associate professor, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Some scholars think it could reach into the hundreds of thousands. At the end of the first term, when the Trump administration sought to reclassify positions, it included executive assistants, toxicologists and scientists \u2014 it's not clear who this doesn't reach.\"",
      "\"Individuals in these policymaking positions don't have the same due process protections as other employees. They can be more easily removed,\" Bednar added. \"There are 2.8 million civilian employees in the federal government. Most, or the vast majority, enjoy some kind of protection from removal.\"",
      "For now, it remains unclear how far the Trump administration plans to go in implementing the order, said Steve Lenkart, executive director of the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE-IAM), a union representing 100,000 government workers.",
      "\"Technically, if you're a maintenance person pushing a broom on the floor, you are executing a policy,\" said Lenkart in offering an example of how virtually any government worker could be defined as being engaged in work that falls under Schedule F.",
      "\"President Trump has the executive power to make decisions to implement a government that reflects the will of the American people,\" Harrison Fields, principal deputy press secretary at the White House, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"If an individual in the administration is working on policy, then they should align with President Trump's mission of putting America first.\"",
      "Hit to morale?",
      "President Trump is not unique in looking to have a stronger hand over the federal workforce, according to Bednar.",
      "\"A common strategy of presidents is trying to politicize federal employment positions so they have greater control over executive branch hiring and firing,\" said Bednar, who lists Dwight Eisenhower and Jimmy Carter among previous presidents who have sought to exert such influence. Still, he noted \"we haven't seen something that tries to reach this deep into the career staff.\"",
      "While Mr. Trump's Schedule F plan and other administration orders aimed a reshaping the federal workplace are being challenged in court, the Trump administration may succeed in its goal of downsizing government, regardless of whether it wins on the legal front, Bednar said.",
      "\"Even if the lawsuits slow down this process, there are many civil servants who might leave government fearing continuing to work in the Trump administration \u2014 employee moral is really affected,\" he said. \"They want a smaller government, and they view this as an opportunity to pursue that.\"",
      "Bednar also cautions that a smaller government workforce could hinder some Trump administration policy goals, including fewer agents to patrol U.S. borders and reduced staffing in immigration courts, adding to the current backlog.",
      "The case for and against Schedule F",
      "Mr. Trump originally implemented the Schedule F policy in 2020 as his first term was nearing an end, but it was repealed after former President Joe Biden took office. Mr. Trump said last week that the revived order is necessary to ensure that federal workers in roles that affect government policy remain accountable to the public.",
      "\"In recent years ... there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership,\" Mr. Trump's order states. \"Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character.\"",
      "But critics of Schedule F argue it undermines the traditional principles behind civil service, which emphasize hiring based on professional qualifications. Should Schedule F survive legal challenges, they say, millions of government workers hired based on merit could be fired at will, including if they are deemed insufficiently loyal to Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Is this really about making government more efficient and smaller, or targeting regulatory and law enforcement people?\" asked Lenkart, who noted that the number of workers employed in the executive branch has remained roughly the same for more than 70 years even as the nation's population has doubled.",
      "Unions representing public workers have blasted Schedule F. The policy is among a slew of executive orders \"designed to intimidate and attack nonpartisan civil servants under the guise of increasing efficiency,\" Randy Erwin, national president of the National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0last week. \"However, these orders will do the exact opposite.\"",
      "Members of the 100-year-old NFFE are employed\u00a0by\u00a0dozens of federal agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, Department of Defense, Federal Aviation Administration and Social Security Administration.",
      "On Wednesday, the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) filed suit against the Trump administration, saying it was exceeding its authority in rolling back protections for workers.",
      "\"We can stop the efforts to fire hundreds of thousands of experienced, hard-working Americans who have dedicated their careers to serving their country and prevent these career civil servants from being replaced with unqualified political flunkies loyal to the president, but not the law or Constitution,\" AFGE National President Everett Kelley said in a statement.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union also filed a suit to block Schedule F, calling it \"contrary to congressional intent.\" The\u00a0complaint, filed Jan. 20 in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, argues that Mr. Trump's order reinstating Schedule F \"wrongly applies employment rules for political appointees to career staff, deprives federal employees of due process rights that they were promised when they were hired, and ignores Office of Personnel Management regulations.\"",
      "NTEU represents about 150,000 workers in 37 federal agencies and departments, including staff at the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Health and Human Services.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 14:36:56 -0500",
    "summary": "Many are unclear on how sweeping the federal funding freeze is intended to be. Here are programs it could affect.",
    "story": [
      "Update: The White House Office of Management and Budget on Wednesday, Jan. 29, rescinded a memo ordering a federal funding freeze less than two days after it caused chaos and stoked fear that the directive could adversely affect millions of Americans.",
      "A White House memo ordering a broad freeze on federal grants and loans by 5 p.m. Tuesday left ordinary Americans who depend on such aid, as well as seasoned budget experts, scratching their heads.",
      "The memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) suspending the federal funding was vague in its wording, causing confusion within federal assistance programs, at nonprofits and among Americans receiving government aid. Adding to the whiplash, a federal judge on Tuesday\u00a0temporarily blocked the freeze, and the Trump administration walked back the memo on Wednesday.",
      "\"In light of the injunction, OMB has rescinded the memo to end any confusion on federal policy created by the court ruling and the dishonest media coverage,\" said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday. \"The executive orders issued by the president on funding reviews remain in full force and effect and will be rigorously implemented by all agencies and departments. This action should effectively end the court case and allow the government to focus on enforcing the president's orders on controlling federal spending.\"",
      "Trump administration rescinds federal funding freeze memo after chaos",
      "Trump administration rescinds federal funding freeze memo after chaos",
      "Before OMB abruptly reversed course, experts had questioned the policy, saying it was poorly thought out and implemented.",
      "\"If this was being undertaken pursuant to the executive orders on [diversity, equity and inclusion], why would the administration issue such broad, unclear and confusing directions?\" Tad DeHaven, a policy analyst focusing on economic and fiscal policy issues at the libertarian Cato Institute, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I don't really understand it, and I think even people who are in positions of power don't really understand it,\" added Wendy Edelberg, director of The Hamilton Project at Brookings, a liberal-leaning public policy research group.",
      "What programs aren't affected by the funding freeze?",
      "The memo, from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), indicated that Social Security and Medicare programs would be exempt from the suspension in federal funding. Additional guidance released Tuesday further specified that \"any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the updated guidance said.",
      "The memo adds that funds for small businesses, farmers, Pell grants, Head Start, rental assistance and other similar programs are also exempt.",
      "But even if the order ends up being more narrowly tailored, it could still have serious financial implications for the millions of Americans who receive federal assistance, experts said.",
      "\"If it's resolved quickly, the aggregate economic effects for the first quarter will be modest, but it will matter a whole lot to people on the other side of these expected payments,\" Edelberg said. \"It could be the difference between having a job and not, getting evicted or affording food \u2014 and the economic numbers won't fully reflect how individuals are going to feel this.\"",
      "Here's what to know about who may be affected by the proposed pause in federal funding.",
      "Will I still get SNAP benefits?",
      "The freeze does not apply to all federal financial assistance, according to an Office of Management and Budget memo on Tuesday. The agency indicates that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, better known as food stamps, are excluded, specifying that \"... any program that provides direct benefits to Americans is explicitly excluded from the pause and exempted from this review process.\"",
      "\"In addition to Social Security and Medicare, already explicitly excluded in the guidance, mandatory programs like Medicaid and SNAP will continue without pause,\" the memo reads.",
      "SNAP serves roughly 41 million low-income Americans.",
      "Yet while the program appears to be exempt from the freeze, \"You are still going to be really worried in the near term whether the federal government is going to make good on those promises,\" Edelberg said. \"And that kind of uncertainty is not good for the economy.\"",
      "Are meals for seniors affected?",
      "The Older Americans Act Nutrition Program, a federal initiative that supports community-based senior nutrition programs like Meals on Wheels, could be affected by the proposed funding pause.",
      "If the order includes the Older Americans Act, it \"would halt service to millions of vulnerable seniors who have no other means of purchasing or preparing meals,\" Meals on Wheels said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lack of clarity is creating chaos for Meals on Wheels providers not knowing whether they should be serving meals today.\"",
      "Is housing assistance at risk?",
      "The OMB memo added that rental assistance and other similar programs will not be paused. Still, the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) expressed concern that Department of Housing and Urban Development programs could be covered by the freeze.",
      "\"Even a short pause in funding could cause significant harm to low-income families and their communities,\" NLIHC Interim President and CEO Renee Willis said in a\u00a0statement. \"The longer the freeze continues, the greater the risk that low-income households receiving federal rental assistance could face eviction, and in the worst cases, homelessness \u2014 homeless shelters may be forced to close their doors, and nonprofit organizations may have to lay off staff.\"",
      "Are student loans affected?",
      "The federal funding freeze does not apply to student loans and Pell grants, according to the Department of Education. The funding pause \"only applies to discretionary grants at the Department of Education,\" DOE spokesperson Madi Biedermann said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Still, an advocate for students with government loans said they are worried about the impact of the freeze.",
      "\"Any kind of freeze to federal financial aid across the board is incredibly harmful to working families just trying to pay for college,\" Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at Student Borrower Protection Center, told CBS MoneyWatch, adding that \"Lots of questions remain about what the freeze applies to and what programs it does not,\"",
      "Meanwhile, many student borrowers rely on different kinds of government assistance to cover costs beyond tuition, Ba\u00f1ez noted.",
      "\"There are other types of federal work-study grants that go directly to colleges and universities, and supplemental education opportunities that go to some of the lowest-income students. People really rely on federal financial aid, and you could see families having to drop out of college or figure out how they will cover this gap,\" she said.",
      "The OMB memo also indicated that Head Start, a preschool program serving nearly 800,000 low-income children that receives federal health funds, is not impacted by the pause.",
      "But the National Head Start Association (NHSA) said that the OMB memo has already \"created panic among Head Start grant recipients who are currently not able to draw down any funds.\"",
      "\"While we understand that this is an evolving story, this disruption, at best, will slow down Head Start agencies' ability to pay hundreds of thousands of staff, contractors, and small businesses who support Head Start operations in every corner of the country,\" NHSA Executive Director Yasmina Vinci said in a statement. \"At worst, this means that hundreds of thousands of families will not be able to depend on the critical services and likely will not be able to work.\"",
      "Medicaid systems go down",
      "Despite the updated guidance issued Tuesday stating that programs including Medicaid were excluded from the funding pause, state Medicaid programs on Tuesday\u00a0said they were locked out\u00a0of the Department of Health and Human Services system used to track and disburse money.",
      "The White House late Tuesday pointed to an \"outage\" for blocking a range of organizations and agencies from accessing the online systems responsible for tapping federal health dollars.",
      "The Payment Management Services web portal displayed a message reading: \"Due to Executive Orders regarding potentially unallowable grant payments, PMS is taking additional measures to process payments. Reviews of applicable programs and payments will result in delays and/or rejections of payments.\"",
      "The National Association of Medicaid Directors is seeking clarification on the interruption from the White House, according to a spokesperson.",
      "By Wednesday, multiple state Medicaid programs had reported that they were able to resume accessing their payment systems after the nationwide lockout.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump had a message last week for the Federal Reserve while at the annual World Economic Forum gathering in Davos, Switzerland: He plans to \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\"",
      "Mr. Trump may be in for disappointment. The Federal Reserve widely expected to keep its benchmark rate steady when it announces its latest interest rate decision today at 2 p.m. Eastern Time. Economists aren't penciling in a 2025 reduction until at least May, according to economists polled by financial data service FactSet.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has over the years steadfastly defended the central bank's independence. Most recently, he underlined at a New York Times event in December that insulating the Fed from political influence is \"for the benefit of all Americans,\" allowing it to make decisions based on economic data rather than at the behest of elected officials. The Fed's independence allows it to pursue its dual mandate \u2014 to keep inflation low and the labor market at full employment \u2014 without political pressure, economists concur.",
      "\"We know monetary policy needs to be enacted with a democratic mandate underpinning it, with a day-to-day remove from politics,\" Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Interest rates may need to be raised but it may be inconvenient for political interests, and [the central bank] may need to move quickly to lower rates\" in case of an economic downturn.",
      "While the Fed is an independent agency, it is accountable to Congress and the public, with its chair and other officials testifying before Congress regularly. Its dual mandate was also established by Congress, as well as its structure of staggered appointments for Fed officials, designed to make the agency less vulnerable to pressures \"that could lead to undesirable outcomes,\" according to the Fed.",
      "What happens when a central bank isn't independent?",
      "Those \"undesirable outcomes\" can be seen in nations where central bankers are more vulnerable to political influence, economists say.",
      "That's because interest rates remain the most potent weapon that a central bank can wield against surging inflation \u2014 a tool that the Federal Reserve turned to in 2022 to tame the hottest U.S. inflation in 40 years. But elected officials sometimes decide that higher borrowing costs are politically inconvenient, because they make it more expensive for businesses to expand or for consumers to make purchases.",
      "In cases where a central bank isn't independent, officials may succeed in pressuring a central bank to keep a lid on rates.",
      "Experts point to Turkey as an example of what can occur when political interests dictate a central bank's monetary policies. Since 2010, its central bank has increasingly come under pressure from President Erdo\u011fan to keep its interest rates low, even as inflation surged during the pandemic, according to the non-partisan Centre for Economic Policy Research.",
      "Instead of hiking rates as Turkey's inflation rate topped 80% in October 2022 on an annual basis, the nation's central bank cut its benchmark rate several times in 2022 and 2023. While the bank reversed course and hiked rates starting in mid-2023, inflation there has proved tough to tame, with prices rising by 44% in December 2024.",
      "By comparison, the highest U.S. inflation rate during the post-pandemic period was in June 2022, when inflation hit 9.1% on an annual basis in June 2022. In the face of the Fed's rate hikes, inflation has cooled since then, deflating to 2.9% on an annual basis last month.",
      "\"The Fed has done really well \u2014 they have raised the rates enough to try to slowly squeeze inflation out of the market,\" noted Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University. The Fed has \"done all that while avoiding a recession \u2014 that is a delicate needle to thread.\"",
      "Could Mr. Trump influence the Fed?",
      "Questions about Mr. Trump's ability to influence the Federal Reserve or shake up its leadership are intensifying amid the president's statements about his desire for lower interest rates. During his 2024 election campaign, Mr. Trump had insisted that as president he should have a \"say\" in the Fed's interest rate policies.",
      "\"I think that, in my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman,\" Mr. Trump said in August.",
      "For his part, Powell said last year that he would not resign\u00a0even if asked to do so by Mr. Trump, adding that under the law presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "However, Mr. Trump has recently fired several government officials in ways that critics say violate the law, such as his administration's firing of more than a dozen federal inspectors general on Friday. Federal law requires the White House to give Congress a full month of warning and case-specific details before firing a federal inspector general.",
      "Removing Powell wouldn't necessarily change the Fed's monetary policy decisions, given that rates are set by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Seven members are from the Fed's Board of Governors; four are assigned from the 11 Reserve Bank presidents, who each serve one-year terms on a rotating basis; and one FOMC member is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Interfering with the Fed could have consequences, both legally and for the stock market, experts said.",
      "\"Should any president attempt to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve without cause other than doing the job they were appointed and confirmed to do, I expect there to be swift legal challenges,\" noted Tim Stretton at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government watchdog. \"I suspect the market would also react negatively. Markets like stability, and this level of unprecedented interference in the Federal Reserve would be anything but stable.\"",
      "Asked what advice he would give Mr. Trump about dealing with the Fed, Columbia Business School's House said, \"Stop talking.\"",
      "He added, \"Let the Fed conduct its business consistent with its mandate, and it'll be more likely to get interest rates down.\"",

    "summary": "Lawmakers and experts say China's DeepSeek AI app could expose U.S. users to risks and promote censorship.",
    "story": [
      "As Chinese AI application DeepSeek attracts hordes of American users, Trump administration officials, lawmakers and cybersecurity experts are expressing concern that the technology could pose a threat to U.S. national security.",
      "DeepSeek's introduction in the U.S. on Monday saw it quickly become the most downloaded free application in the country on Apple's app store. The rollout also rocked Wall Street as investors struggled to compute the sudden appearance of a low-cost, open-source generative AI tool able to compete with leading artificial intelligence apps such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Shares of Nvidia, the U.S. manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, plummeted 17%, chopping roughly $600 billion off its market value \u2014 a record single-day drop for a U.S. stock.",
      "That explosive debut was branded a \"wake-up call\" by President Trump on Monday. Addressing reporters on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the National Security Council (NSC) would examine the potential national security implications around DeepSeek's launch, noting that the administration would seek to \"ensure American AI dominance.\"",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "Some lawmakers also weighed in with concerns about the application's access to U.S. users.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot allow Chinese Communist Party models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions,\" Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said Tuesday in a statement shared on social media. \"We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek's AI infrastructure.\"",
      "The spotlight on DeepSeek comes amid rising tensions over trade, technology and other issues between the two superpowers. The U.S. has already imposed significant export controls on China in an effort to rein in Beijing's production of semiconductors used in developing advanced AI, with the most recent curbs coming in\u00a0December.",
      "\"At the President's direction, the NSC and others in the U.S. government work in many ways to address concerns involving AI, China and data security,\" agency spokesperson Brian Hughes told CBS News in an email. \"As the President has underscored, U.S. policy is to ensure that the United States leads the world in AI.\"",
      "Security threat for users",
      "While the calls from Moolenaar could be the first inkling of a possible congressional crackdown, Ross Burley \u2014 a co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience \u2014 warned that DeepSeek's emergence in the U.S. raises data security and privacy issues for users. Chinese law grants Beijing broad authority to access data from companies based in China.",
      "\"More and more people will use it, and that will open the door to more and more personal data just being given away to the [Chinese Communist Party] and being sent basically to mainland China to be able to inform them of their activities,\" Burley told CBS News.",
      "\"What they'll use it for is behavior change campaigns, disinformation campaigns, for really targeted messaging as to what Western audiences like, what they do,\" he added.",
      "DeepSeek, which is based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, notes in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held \"on secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

    "title": "What has DEI actually done for U.S. workers and employers?",
    "published": "Tue, 28 Jan 2025 17:19:32 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has painted a bullseye on diversity, equity and inclusion. But what exactly is DEI, and what has it achieved?",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the U.S. government is renewing debate over what DEI is and whether it has benefited workers and companies.",
      "DEI has its roots in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which barred employment discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion and other criteria. In the following decades, a range of policies have sought to root out bias in hiring, promote fairness in the workplace and open career pathways for people of color and for women, while also expanding to include sexual orientation and gender identity.",
      "This push gained momentum after the 2020 murder of George Floyd, as politicians and social activists pressed companies to do their part in confronting systemic racism. But Mr. Trump's Jan. 20\u00a0order, issued on his first day back in office, criticized DEI as \"illegal and immoral,\" while the following day a memo from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management called for all federal DEI employees to be placed on leave.",
      "What is DEI in the workplace?",
      "DEI is often misperceived as focusing only on race, according to DEI experts. But such initiatives comprise many practices that aim to uplift different marginalized groups in the workplace. For example, a policy that accommodates working parents, such as flexible work hours, could qualify as DEI. So could establishing affinity groups based on shared identities, like sexual orientation.",
      "Many critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. Other opponents of the policies go further, arguing that DEI itself promotes racism.",
      "But DEI defenders say that policies that seek to foster diversity and inclusion within organizations aren't in conflict with those that seek to reward the most talented or hardest-working employees.",
      "\"DEI enhances merit by saying, 'How do we find the best people for the job or make sure we are promoting the best people?'\" David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And that means thinking about barriers and biases that might be getting in the way of considering the full talent pool.\"",
      "In defining DEI, Glasgow described \"diversity\" as a commitment to diversifying personnel within an institution so that U.S. workplaces better represent the population at large. \"It's about engaging in effective outreach to places that might be overlooked and making sure hiring and promotion systems aren't screening out women or people of color from being considered,\" he said.",
      "Meanwhile, when designed and implemented effectively, DEI programs are not discriminatory, according to Jessica Fulton, vice president of Policy at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonprofit that aims to improve African-Americans' socioeconomic status.",
      "\"These policies don't actually dictate who gets hired. They are ways to open doors to people who might not have access or aren't as well-connected in an industry or occupation,\" she explained.",
      "The equity piece of DEI seeks to level the playing field for groups of workers who have historically been underrepresented in a given field or who, compared with their white or male peers, are underpaid for doing the same work.",
      "\"It could mean making sure women are able to enter traditionally male-dominated occupations, like construction or technology,\" Fulton said. \"It's about addressing issues around equal pay for equal work, making sure people feel safe in the workplace so they don't feel discrimination when they come to work, because workers who don't feel safe are not the most productive.\"",
      "Corporations also commonly aim to develop inclusion policies that help people from diverse backgrounds feel safe within a given workplace and its culture, she explained. They are intended to be, and often are, inclusive of everyone and not just members of marginalized communities, according to Fulton.",
      "\"It is also making sure they can put certain policies in place to make sure their workers stick around and keep working. It is about building a great team and being able to treat that team well and retain the folks they hire,\" Fulton said.",
      "Given the recent backlash against DEI, though, a number of corporations are moving away from such inclusion policies, noting that they could pose a legal risk. That's after many major U.S. employers already ditched their DEI programs in response to pressure from anti-diversity activists. Among them are Ford,\u00a0Harley Davidson,\u00a0McDonald's, Meta and more.",
      "How is success measured?",
      "Many corporate executives have soured on DEI in recent years because of the perception that such policies don't enhance a company's performance, said Daniel Snell, co-founder of Arrival, a UK-based consulting firm focused on corporate leadership and culture. Other leaders, while recognizing the value of promoting diversity and inclusion, argue that DEI is inadequate for redressing what are at bottom much broader socioeconomic issues.",
      "Glasgow of NYU Law concedes that it can be hard to determine if DEI programs are succeeding or otherwise clearly assess their outcomes. \"It's difficult to measure certain DEI interventions, like the effectiveness of implicit bias training in the workplace,\" he said. \"It also depends on what you are trying to achieve.\"",
      "One tool employers use to try to gauge the efficacy of DEI policies are internal surveys that ask workers whether they feel like they can be themselves in the office, believe they are respected by their peers, and feel that their opinions matter. When it comes to a company's mentorship and promotion policies, employers will also monitor if members of a particular group of workers, such as veterans and Black employees, are quitting shortly after being hired \u2014 patterns that can yield insights into a workplace's equity and inclusiveness.",
      "By contrast, if over time more women or people of color ascend to leadership positions, that could be viewed as a company achieving its goal of building a workplace that's more representative of its job applicant pool.",
      "Corporate DEI programs aren't altruistic, experts emphasize, pointing to at least some empirical evidence showing that such efforts can help companies adapt to change, support innovation and even boost the bottom line.",
      "\"The point of diversity and inclusion is that companies, the government, universities, all do better when there are diverse participants in management and throughout the enterprise,\" said Michael Posner, director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. \"The objective of this is not to set quotas or say we are going to take unqualified people because they fit a certain characteristic, like gender or race, but to create opportunity and try to overcome historic barriers to entry.\"",
      "In one noted study, McKinsey found that companies in the top quartile for the gender diversity of their boards of director are 27% more likely to outperform financially than those in the bottom quartile. In separate research, the consulting firm in 2024 found that women's representation at work over the past decade has increased at every level of corporate management \u2014 women today make up 29% of C-suite level positions, up from 17% in 2015.",
      "\"[A] lot of the language and framing right now of DEI as illegal and discriminatory obscures who it's really for, which is all of us, and to the benefit of companies,\" Fulton told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "Starbucks customers will notice some changes brewing. Starting Monday, stores are bringing back the condiment bar and offering free refills of hot or iced brewed coffee and tea for dine-in customers.",
      "The self-serve condiment bars, home to creamers, milk, sweeteners and stirrers, were removed from Starbucks locations during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Starbucks previously said the return to letting customers do it themselves will help free up baristas to make other drinks.",
      "Starbucks baristas will also ask customers if they would like to order \"for here\" or \"to go\". Customers who order drinks \"for here\" will receive their order in a ceramic coffee mug or glass, or in a clean personal cup brought from home.",
      "\"Offering customers who sit and stay their beverages in ceramic mugs and glassware is one way we're returning our cafes to warm welcoming coffeehouses,\" a Starbucks spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \"It's also another way that Starbucks is reducing waste and making each visit a more sustainable choice.\"",
      "More than 75% of Starbucks' U.S. beverage sales are cold drinks, often served in plastic cups. Though the caf\u00e9s offer recycling bins, a recent CBS News investigation found that many of those cups don't actually end up getting recycled. It's a problem that goes far beyond Starbucks \u2014 few recycling facilities around the country accept this type of single-use plastic for processing.",

    "story": [
      "A Chinese artificial intelligence company called DeepSeek is grabbing America's attention \u2014 and sending a shock wave through Wall Street \u2014 due to its new tech, which some experts say rivals that of OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "DeepSeek is also catching investors off guard because of the low development costs for its AI app, which Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives pegged at only $6 million. By comparison, OpenAI, Google and other major U.S. companies are on track to invest a total of roughly $1 trillion in AI over the coming years, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "On Monday, DeepSeek's rollout roiled shares of AI stalwarts such as Nvidia, the high-flying manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, and Dutch company ASML, another chipmaker. The Chinese company's tech is raising questions about whether demand for Nvidia's chips could take a hit, as well as whether investors are overvaluing tech stocks that have been buoyed by the promise of AI, from Meta to Microsoft, experts said.",
      "\"DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less,\" said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, in an email. \"This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years.\"",
      "DeepSeek's latest app comes just days after President Trump announced a new $500 billion venture\u00a0with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, dubbed Stargate, which he touted as ensuring \"the future of technology\" in the U.S.",
      "AI-related stocks took a hit on Monday, with Nvidia shares tumbling 17%, shedding $600 billion in value and marking the single-biggest one-day loss for a company in stock market history, according\u00a0to CNBC. ASML sank 6%, while Broadcom, another semiconductor stock, also slumped 17%.",
      "Some energy-related stocks also plunged on Monday on investor worries that the new tech could require less energy to run, translating into lower demand from the tech sector. GE Vernova, which makes wind and gas turbines, plunged 21%, while electricity generator Vistra slumped 28%.",
      "The tech-heavy Nasdaq index slumped 3%, or 612 points, while the S&P 500 declined 1.5%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7%.",
      "Despite the sharp drop on the Nasdaq, it's far from the worst day for the index during the past five years. The worst one-day decline since Jan. 27, 2020, came on March 16, 2020, when the index plunged more than 12% as COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy.",
      "What is DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek is a private Chinese company founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a graduate of Zhejiang University, one of China's top universities, who funded the startup via his hedge fund,\u00a0according to the MIT Technology Review. Liang has about $8 billion in assets, Ives wrote in a Jan. 27 research note.",
      "Liang, who had previously focused on applying AI to investing, had bought a \"stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips,\" a type of tech that is now banned from export to China. Those chips became the basis of DeepSeek, the MIT publication reported.",
      "Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius, told investors in a note that DeepSeek makes legitimate breakthroughs as an AI tool, including better learning and more efficient use of memory, although he expressed skepticism about the \"amount of chips used.\"",
      "Is DeepSeek available in the U.S.?",
      "The company's AI app is available in Apple's App store, as well as online at its website. The service is free and as of Monday morning was the top download on Apple's store, although some people were having trouble signing up for the app.",
      "On its Chinese site, DeepSeek blamed \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its service, requiring it to temporarily limit new registrations. \"Existing users can log in as usual,\" the company said in the post, which was dated shortly after midnight Jan. 28 in China's local time.",
      "The company released its latest AI model on Jan. 20, which is causing Wall Street to reappraise the AI sector.",
      "\"Last week DeepSeek launched a model that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's Llama 3.1 and was #1 on Apple's App Store over the weekend,\" Wedbush's Ives wrote. \"DeepSeek built the model using reduced capability chips from Nvidia. which is impressive and thus has caused major agita for U.S. tech stocks with massive pressure on Nasdaq this morning.\"",
      "How is DeepSeek different than other AI apps?",
      "DeepSeek is an open-source large language model that relies on what is known as \"inference-time computing,\" which Sette said in layman's terms means \"they activate only the most relevant portions of their model for each query, and that saves money and computation power.\"",
      "Some experts praised DeepSeek's performance, with noted tech investor Marc Andreessen writing\u00a0on X on Jan. 24, \"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen \u2014 and as open source, a profound gift to the world.\"",
      "David Sacks, a venture capitalist named by Mr. Trump to help oversee AI and cryptocurrency policy, said on social media Monday that DeepSee's app \"shows that the AI race will be very competitive.\"",
      "However, Ives said he's skeptical the service will gain ground with major U.S. businesses.",
      "\"No U.S. Global 2000 is going to use a Chinese startup DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases,\" Ives wrote. \"At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\"",
      "Are there privacy issues with DeepSeek?",
      "Some experts are raising concerns about the personal data that DeepSeek is collecting, given that the company stores data from users \u2014 including their date of birth, keystrokes, text or audio inputs, uploaded files, chat history and other data \u2014 on servers located in China, according to its privacy policy.",
      "That echoes some of the issues raised with TikTok, another company with Chinese ownership that sparked worries about the supposed risks its ties to China posed to national security. Last year, Congress passed a law\u00a0banning\u00a0 TikTok in the U.S. as long as it is under Chinese ownership, although that is now in flux after President Trump signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0directing the Justice Department to not enforce the ban for 75 days.",
      "What does DeepSeek mean for Nvidia and other tech companies?",
      "Wall Street is trying to assess the long-term impact of a low-cost AI tool from China that rivals ChatGPT and other so-called generative AI apps. It also raises questions about whether Silicon Valley is overspending on tech advancements in the AI sector, noted Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, in an email.",
      "\"The fact that this technology is supposed to take less energy and is more cost-effective than U.S.-based models has U.S. technology investors very concerned,\" Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said.",
      "It's also unclear what type of pushback or reaction could come from the White House, given that Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of placing new tariffs on Chinese imports, although he also gave the Chinese-owned TikTok a reprieve by ordering the Justice Department not to enforce a looming ban.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think Monday's stock selloff is an overreaction, noting that the enormous demand for AI will continue lifting key players in the sector.",
      "\"It's one thing to train a [large language] model for less money, but accommodating the huge demand for the consumption of all this AI technology is still going to require massive amounts of infrastructure,\" Adam Crisafulli of VitalKnowledge said in a report.",
      "Analysts at Bernstein Research also noted that while DeepSeek's technology looks promising, it likely isn't revolutionary, suggesting that Monday's investment rout is overblown.",
      "What is Nvidia saying about DeepSeek?",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Nvidia offered praise for DeepSeek.",
      "\"DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of test-time scaling,\" the company said in an email. \"DeepSeek's work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export-control compliant.\"",
      "But, Nvidia added, AI inference, or using AI models to make decisions or predictions, \"requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.\"",

    "story": [
      "Republican attorneys general from 19 states want Costco Wholesale to ditch its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, making the call days after the retailer successfully defended its DEI policies as good for business to shareholders.",
      "In a\u00a0letter on Monday to Costco CEO Ron Vachris, the AGs accuse the retailer of \"clinging to DEI policies that courts and businesses have rejected as illegal,\" and called on it to account for the legal risks of its actions.",
      "Led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, the Republican officials instructed Costco to let them know within 30 days whether it would get rid of its DEI policies or explain why not.",
      "Costco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The GOP letter came after Costco shareholders overwhelmingly rejected a proposal that the wholesale club operator evaluate any risks associated to its DEI practices. The shareholder behind the resolution, the National Center for Public Policy Research, argued that DEI \"may sound benign,\" but in fact is \"weaponized language concealing a radical Marxist agenda.\"",

Costco's \"commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary. The report requested by this proposal would not provide meaningful additional information,\" it added.",
      "A day after Costco held its ground on its DEI policies, discount store chain Target joined Walmart and other corporations in scaling back on diversity initiatives under attack from conservative activists emboldened by high court decisions and President Trump, who recently banned DEI programs across the federal government.",

    "story": [
      "Workers at a Whole Foods Market in Pennsylvania voted to unionize on Monday, becoming the first group of employees to pull off a labor win at the Amazon-owned grocery store chain.",
      "Employees at the Philadelphia store at 21st Street and Pennsylvania Avenue cast 130 votes \u2014 or about 57% of the ballots cast \u2014 in favor of joining a local chapter of The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union for the purposes of collective bargaining. According to the National Labor Relations Board, which oversaw the election, 100 workers rejected the motion.",
      "\"This fight is far from over, but today's victory is an important step forward,\" said Wendell Young IV, the president of UFCW Local 1776. \"We are ready to bring Whole Foods to the bargaining table to negotiate a fair first contract that reflects the workers' needs and priorities.\"",
      "The results mark the first successful entry of organized labor into Amazon's grocery business, which includes Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh and the Amazon Go convenience stores. Amazon, which purchased Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion, has tried to fend off organizing efforts in its stores as well as by delivery drivers and warehouse workers.",
      "Nearly three years ago, Amazon warehouse workers in the New York City borough of Staten Island voted to be represented in labor negotiations by a fledgling union that has since affiliated with the Teamsters. But Amazon has refused to come to the bargaining table.",
      "Employees at the Whole Foods store, located in the center of Philadelphia, started organizing early last year, Young said. They teamed up with UFCW Local 1776 in the late summer, and in November petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to hold an official election.",
      "The local union said the store workers hoped a successful vote would help them secure higher wages, more affordable health care coverage, child care support, greater work-life balance and better working conditions.",
      "In a statement after the votes were counted Monday night, Whole Foods said it \"is proud to offer competitive compensation, great benefits, and career advancement opportunities to all Team Members.\"",
      "\"We are disappointed by the outcome of this election, but we are committed to maintaining a positive working environment in our Philly Center City store,\" the company added.",
      "The company said it provides store employees with a competitive average hourly wage and other benefits, such as 401(k) plans and \"on-demand\" mental health support. It did not disclose its average hourly rate, but some online job postings show store employees can earn $16 per hour or higher.",
      "After the union filed the election petition, workers at the Philadelphia store were given free snacks, and the company repainted their break rooms, according to Young.",
      "Earlier this month, UFCW Local 1776 filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB against the company, accusing it of firing one worker in retaliation for union activities and alleging that supervisors told employees they would get paid more if they rejected the union bid. Whole Foods disputed the worker was fired in retaliation.",
      "The union has also accused Whole Foods of withholding region-wide wage increases from employees at the Philadelphia store because of the union activities.",
      "The company acknowledges it did not offer wage increases to workers at the store, even though it did so at a number of other stores as part of a quarterly review. Whole Foods maintains it would have been illegal to make wage adjustments in the lead-up to the union election, an argument Young disputed.",
      "The company said it was delaying the pay bumps until after the election to avoid the appearance of trying to influence the vote with raises.",
      "Seattle-based Amazon has resisted union organizing efforts by its workers. Amazon delivery drivers went on strike in a handful of U.S. cities before Christmas to exert pressure on the the company to recognize them as unionized employees or to meet demands for an inaugural labor contract.",
      "Workers at an Amazon warehouse in North Carolina are scheduled to vote next month on whether they want to be represented by an upstart union called Carolina Amazonians United for Solidarity and Empowerment.",
      "The retail giant has challenged the structure of the National Labor Relations Board in court. Amazon accused the federal agency of tampering in the 2022 union election at the Staten Island warehouse, in part by bringing a lawsuit against the company to reinstate a fired organizer close to when voting began.",

    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration says millions of retired teachers, firefighters, police officers and others with public pensions may have to wait up to a year or longer to reap the benefits of the recently passed Social Security Fairness Act.",
      "The newly enacted law requires the agency to adjust benefits for more than 3 million people, including calculating retroactive payments and future benefits. But the law did not provide additional financing or staff to help implement the law or deal with the increased workload, the Social Security Administration (SSA) noted in an update Friday.",
      "\"SSA's ability to implement the law in a timely manner and without negatively affecting day-to-day customer service relies on funding,\" according to the agency. \"Though SSA is helping some affected beneficiaries now, under SSA's current budget, SSA expects that it could take more than one year to adjust benefits and pay all retroactive benefits.\"",
      "Ongoing staffing shortages, compounded by a hiring freeze since November 2024, will make the task of servicing people \"more difficult,\" SSA stated. All Social Security recipients, including those not affected by the new law, will face delays and increased wait times as SSA contends with the new workload, according to the agency.",
      "\"We thank the public for its patience,\" it added.",
      "Callers to SSA's toll-free number are played a message about the Social Security Fairness Act, with an aim of avoiding long and frustrating wait times for people seeking information about the new law. Yet more than 7,000 people each day still opt to wait to speak to a person, creating a logjam that's only expected to worsen over the coming weeks and months.",
      "Signed into law\u00a0in December by former President Joe Biden, the Social Security Fairness Act expands benefits for millions by eliminating two federal policies that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program and that reduced benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "The benefits hike under the new law would be retroactive to December 2023. As a result, eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",
      "Processing the changes is complex and much of the work has to be done manually on a case-by-case basis, SSA said. Some people's benefits will increase very little, while others could be looking at more than $1,000 more a month, it said.",
      "The Biden White House had pegged the average monthly increase expected as a result of the law at $360 for more than 2.5 million Social Security recipients.",
      "People with public pensions whose Social Security benefits were previously penalized should make sure their name and address are\u00a0up to date\u00a0in their profile on\u00a0ssa.gov. The SSA will reach out if necessary, but there is no need to reapply for Social Security benefits, according to the agency.",

      "The Japanese network Fuji Television and its parent company said Monday that its president and chairperson were resigning immediately to take responsibility for a widening sex assault scandal linked to one of Japan's top TV celebrities.",
      "The scandal centers on Masahiro Nakai, a former leader of Japan's once-hugely popular boy band SMAP, and his costly settlement with a woman over the alleged sex assault at a 2023 dinner party that Fuji TV staff allegedly helped to organize.",
      "The allegations surfaced in magazine articles in December and have since triggered claims of systematic cover-ups by Fuji TV executives. The public outrage over the lack of transparency and explanation at the network's news conference earlier this month have led to an avalanche of advertising losses at Fuji, one of the networks where Nakai worked.",
      "Fuji Television Network President Koichi Minato said his company mishandled the case.",
      "\"We are very sorry that we mishandled the case because of our lack of awareness about human rights and corporate governance ... and as a result our responses to the involved woman were inadequate,\" Minato said. \"We are very sorry to have destroyed our credibility.\"",
      "Car manufacturers Nissan and Toyota were among the companies that pulled advertising from Fuji TV, BBC News reported.",
      "Minato said the case violated the woman's human rights, without providing details on grounds of privacy. He said it was handled as an \"extraordinary\" case requiring maximum confidentiality and sensitivity for the woman's mental health and was shared by a small group of officials. The company had continued allowing Nakai to appear on Fuji shows for a year and six months, he said, but denied covering up the case because it involved a big star.",
      "Minato said he did not think what happened was sexual assault and that the case was not reported to the company's compliance office until the magazine report came out.",
      "He also denied a Fuji TV employee's involvement but said allegations that the employee had previously organized barbecue and other parties for Nakai needed to be investigated.",
      "Fuji officials also acknowledged that female announcers and other female employees have in the past participated at parties for stars, talent agency executives and sponsors, though they denied any sexual services. Minato said he believed top officials were complacent about the outdated gender roles and they now need to \"update their mindset.\"",
      "Nakai last Thursday announced his retirement from show business\u00a0in Japan, which has already been hit by a series of sexual assault allegations in recent years in what is seen as a delayed #MeToo movement that began in Western nations in the 2010s. He said he was taking responsibility for the \"trouble\" and massive business losses as a result.",
      "\"I alone am responsible for everything\" and \"sincerely apologize,\" Nakai said.",

      "Perplexity AI has presented a new proposal to TikTok's parent company that would allow the U.S. government to own up to 50% of a new entity that merges Perplexity with TikTok's U.S. business, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "The proposal, submitted last week, is a revision of a prior plan the artificial intelligence startup had presented to TikTok's parent ByteDance on Jan. 18, a day before the law that bans TikTok went into effect.",
      "The first proposal, which ByteDance hasn't responded to, sought to create a new structure that would merge San Francisco-based Perplexity with TikTok's U.S. business and include investments from other investors.",
      "The new proposal would allow the U.S. government to own up to half of that new structure once it makes an initial public offering of at least $300 billion, said the person, who was not authorized to speak about the proposal. The person said Perplexity's proposal was revised based off of feedback from the Trump administration.",
      "If the plan is successful, the shares owned by the government would not have voting power, the person said. The government also would not get a seat on the new company's board.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Under the plan, ByteDance would not have to completely cut ties with TikTok, a favorable outcome for its investors. But it would have to allow a \"full U.S. board control,\" the person said.",
      "Under the proposal, the China-based tech company would contribute TikTok's U.S. business without the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app, according to a document seen by the Associated Press.",
      "The proposal seems to mirror a strategy Steven Mnuchin, treasury secretary during President Donald Trump's first term, discussed Sunday on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures \u2014 that a new investor in TikTok could simply \"dilute down\" the Chinese ownership and satisfy the law. Mnuchin has previously expressed interest in investing in the company.",
      "\"But the technology needs to be disconnected from China,\" he added. \"It needs to be disconnected from ByteDance. There's absolutely no way that China would ever let us have something like that in China.\"",
      "The Perplexity proposal comes as several investors are expressing interest in TikTok. Mr. Trump said late Saturday that he expects a deal will be made in as soon as 30 days.",
      "On\u00a0a flight from Las Vegas to Miami on Air Force One, Mr. Trump also said he hadn't discussed a deal with Larry Ellison, CEO of software maker Oracle, despite\u00a0a report\u00a0that Oracle, along with outside investors, was considering taking over TikTok's global operation.",
      "\"Numerous people are talking to me. Very substantial people,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We have a lot of interest in it, and the United States will be a big beneficiary. ... I'd only do it if the United States benefits.\"",
      "Under a bipartisan law passed last year, TikTok was to be banned in the United States by Jan. 19 if it did not cut ties with ByteDance. The Supreme Court upheld the law, but Mr. Trump then issued an executive order to halt enforcement of the law for 75 days.",
      "Mr. Trump, on Air Force One, noted that Ellison lives \"right down the road\" from his Mar-a-Lago estate, but added, \"I never spoke to Larry about TikTok. I've spoken to many people about TikTok and there's great interest in TikTok.\"",
      "TikTok briefly shut down in the U.S. a week ago, but went back online after Mr. Trump said he would postpone the ban. Mr. Trump had unsuccessfully attempted a U.S. ban of the platform during his first term. But he has since reversed his position and has credited the platform with helping him win more young voters during last year's presidential election.",
      "TikTok CEO Shou Chew attended Mr. Trump's inauguration Jan. 20, along with some other tech leaders who've been forging friendlier ties with the new administration.",
      "Congress voted to ban TikTok in the U.S. out of concern that TikTok's ownership structure represented a security risk. The Biden administration argued in court for months that it was too much of a risk to allow a Chinese company to control the algorithm that fuels what people see on the app. Officials also raised concerns about user data collected on the platform.",

      "The goals included hiring and promoting more women and members of racial minority groups, and recruiting more diverse suppliers, including businesses owned by people of color, women, LGBTQ+ people, veterans and people with disabilities.",
      "Target has long been a fierce corporate advocate for the rights of Black and LGBTQ+ people. In a memo to employees, Kiera Fernandez, Target's chief community impact and equity officer, as a \"next chapter\" in a decades-long process to create \"inclusive work and guest environments that welcome all.\"",
      "\"Many years of data, insights, listening and learning have been shaping this next chapter in our strategy,\" Fernandez wrote in the memo, which Target shared Friday. \"And as a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future.\"",
      "There's no doubt the U.S. civil rights landscape has undergone a massive transformation in the five years since much of corporate America adopted DEI goals in response to the Black Lives Matter protests that followed Floyd's death in Minneapolis.",
      "In 2020, Target pledged to give $10 million to social justice initiatives and to rebuild areas of the Twin Cities damaged by riots. At that time, Target leaders said they wanted to increase their Black workforce by 20% over the next three years.",
      "A 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision that outlawed affirmative action in college admissions emboldened conservative groups to bring or threaten lawsuits targeting corporate initiatives such as employee resource groups and hiring practices that prioritize historically marginalized groups.",
      "Walmart, McDonald's, Ford, Harley-Davison, John Deere and Lowe's are among the well-known consumer brands that reduced or phased out their DEI commitments in recent months.",
      "President Donald Trump this week signaled his administration's agreement with conservatives who argue that policies designed to increase minority representation by considering factors such as race, gender and sexual orientation are unconstitutional.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order aimed at ending DEI programs within the federal government. The order cut funding for so-called DEI initiatives across all agencies in order to \"end DEI inside the federal government,\" according to Trump administration officials.",
      "A memo from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Tuesday evening called for all federal DEI employees to be placed on leave by Wednesday evening.",
      "Unlike some of the companies retooling or retiring their diversity initiatives, Target's work to build a more inclusive workforce predated 2020, and the company also was long seen as a trailblazer with respect to LGBTQ+ inclusion.",
      "But the employee memo shared Friday said Target no longer would participate in surveys designed to gauge the effectiveness of its actions, including an annual index compiled by the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ+ rights organization. Target said it would further evaluate corporate partnerships to ensure they're connected directly to business objectives, but declined to share details.",
      "Getting corporations to withdraw from the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index and to stop sponsoring Pride activities have been goals of DEI opponents.",
      "Steering clear of a backlash from conservative customers and organizations is something that Target has tried to navigate for a while. As transgender rights became a more prominent issue in 2016, the company declared that \"inclusivity is a core belief at Target\" and said it supported transgender employees and customers using whichever restroom or fitting room \"corresponds with their gender identity.\"",
      "But after some customers threatened to boycott Target stores, the company said that more stores would make available a single-toilet bathroom with a door that could be locked.",
      "In 2023, Target faced an anti-LGBTQ campaign that went viral on social media. The campaign\u00a0threatened employees and there were some instances of damaged products and displays in stores. In response, Target removed certain items that it said caused the most \"volatile\" reaction from opponents.",
      "The company did not stock its stores with Pride Month products in 2024.",
      "Still, some prominent companies have resisted public pressure to retreat from their diversity plans. On Thursday, Costco shareholders rejected a proposal urging the wholesale club operator to evaluate any risks posed by its diversity, equity and inclusion practices.",
      "According to preliminary results shared by Costco executives, more than 98% of shares voted against the proposal submitted by a conservative think tank based in Washington. Costco's board of directors had recommended a no vote.",

    "published": "Fri, 24 Jan 2025 17:20:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Republican lawmakers are floating a range of ideas to pay for an extension of President Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.",
    "story": [
      "A key economic priority for President Trump this year is to extend the provisions in his signature Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a 2017 law that lowered tax rates for most Americans, before they expire at the end of 2025. Now, Republican lawmakers have developed a 50-page laundry list of ideas for how to pay for those planned cuts.",
      "The plan from congressional Republicans,\u00a0published earlier by the New York Times, was confirmed by a person familiar with the document, who noted that it represents a menu of policy options for lawmakers to consider. The document also cites several new tax breaks proposed by Mr. Trump while on the campaign trail last falls, such as eliminating taxes on overtime and tips.",
      "But extending the TCJA's provisions alone could prove costly, with the Congressional Budget Office forecasting a cost of $4.6 trillion over 10 years. Adding new tax breaks, such as Mr. Trump's promise to ditch taxes on overtime pay, could push up the bill even higher at a time when the nation's debt has spiraled to more than $36 trillion.",
      "According to the document, some ideas for funding those tax breaks include eliminating the mortgage home deduction, a popular break for homeowners, and the deductibility of student loan interest. Other methods to drum up more money include an across-the-board 10% import tariff \u2014 essentially, a universal tax on U.S. imports that would be paid by consumers.",
      "The plan also outlines ideas for cutting federal spending, primarily by trimming outlays for social safety net programs such as Medicaid and food stamps. Overall, the document points to a potential tax overhaul that could put more money in the pockets of wealthier \u00a0Americans while cutting assistance for low- and middle-class taxpayers, experts say.",
      "\"If you are extending the tax cuts and enacting tariffs and cutting Medicaid, that will deliver benefits more among higher-income households, and more of a cost will be born by lower-income households,\" Joseph Rosenberg, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a tax-focused think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Adding a blanket 10% tariff could raise $1.9 trillion over the next decade, according to the document shared with Republican lawmakers. But tariffs are largely paid by consumers because companies tend to raise their prices to cover the extra import duties. Mr. Trump's tariffs could add $2,600 a year in costs for the typical U.S. family, according to an August\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank focused on economic issues.",
      "Trump administration officials didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Tax breaks that could disappear",
      "Some long-standing tax breaks could face elimination, according to the document:",
      "Mortgage interest deduction: This could either be cut entirely or lowered to a $500,000 cap, with the former idea saving $1 trillion over a decade and the latter $50 billion over the same period.\"Head of household\" tax filing status: This filing status provides a larger standard deduction for unmarried adults with children. Eliminating it could save $192 billion over 10 years.\u00a0American Opportunity Credit: This $2,500 tax credit is given for educational expenses amassed over the first four years of a person's higher education. Revoking it would save $59 billion over a decade.\u00a0Child and Dependent Care tax credit: This credit helps families with young children pay for up to $2,100 in annual child care expenses.

Removing this tax would cost the U.S. $370 billion over 10 years.\u00a0Raising or eliminating the SALT deduction cap: Mr. Trump's TCJA introduced a controversial $10,000 cap on deducting state and local taxes, or SALT. Under the latest Republican proposals, the cap could be eliminated or raised to higher thresholds, such as $20,000 for married couples. The cost could range from $100 billion to up to $1 trillion, depending on the size of the change.\u00a0Making auto loan interest tax deductible: This idea, which was\u00a0floated by Mr. Trump during the 2024 presidential campaign, could cost $61 billion over a decade.",

The issue has become increasingly unpopular among Republicans and Democrats alike, as rising home values and property taxes across the nation means more homeowners are feeling the pinch from the deduction limit.",
      "\"The SALT cap was effectively one of the biggest pay-fors in the 2017 legislation, and raising it is expensive,\" the Tax Policy Center's Rosenberg said. \"The president recently signaled again that the most likely direction is for the SALT cap to be raised rather than to be eliminated.\"",

      "Economic losses from hurricanes and other natural disasters soared in the U.S. last year and were above average globally, reflecting another year of costly severe storms, floods and droughts.",
      "Damage caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton helped push total economic losses from natural disasters in the U.S. to $217.8 billion last year, according to insurance broker Aon PLC. That figure represents an 85.3% increase from 2023, when losses totaled about $117.5 billion. It's also the largest annual tally of economic losses from natural disasters since 2017.",
      "Insured losses, or the portion of economic losses that are covered by insurance, also rose last year. They climbed 36% to $112.7 billion, the most since 2022. In some areas, homes are such great a risk that they're\u00a0too expensive to insure \u2014 if private insurance is even available at all.",
      "Hurricane Helene tore across six southeastern states last fall, costing $75 billion in economic losses, mainly due to inland and coastal flooding. according to Aon. Less than two weeks later, Hurricane Milton made landfall on the west coast of Florida, causing some $25 billion in economic losses.",
      "\"In 2024, one of the big differences is we had significant U.S. hurricane events that happened,\" said Liz Henderson, global head of climate risk advisory at Aon. \"When those events happen, they affect a large area and they affect areas with large values in terms of properties and people and content. So the losses from those events tend to be significantly higher.\"",
      "At least two other hurricanes, several severe \"convective\" storms and a draught contributed to the losses from natural disasters in the U.S. last year.",
      "In addition to the severe storms in the U.S., deadly floods in the Valencia region of Spain and other natural disasters drove worldwide economic losses from natural disasters to $368 billion last year, according to Aon. That's a 7.3% decline from 2023, but about 14% higher than the annual average going back to 2000. Global insured losses, meanwhile, climbed 15.1% to $145 billion.",
      "While it's impossible to predict the timing, location and losses from natural disasters, 2025 is not off to an encouraging start. The devastating wildfires that erupted in Los Angeles County on Jan. 7, killing at least 28 people and destroying more than 14,000 structures, are already projected to be among the costliest natural disasters.",
      "In a separate report last week, Aon estimated that total economic and insured losses for the two largest wildfires \u2014 the Palisades fire and the Eaton blaze burning just outside Los Angeles \u2014 could reach into the lower tens of billions of dollars, likely making them the costliest wildfires in U.S. history.",
      "Pacific Palisades, the Los Angeles neighborhood that's been\u00a0devastated by the Palisades fire, is emblematic of the insurance nightmare increasingly facing homeowners residing in regions prone to climate disasters.",
      "About 1,600 policies in Pacific Palisades were dropped by State Farm in July, California Department of Insurance spokesman Michael Soller said in a Jan.16\u00a0 email to CBS MoneyWatch. An\u00a0analysis\u00a0of insurance data by CBS News San Francisco last year found that State Farm also dropped more than 2,000 policies in two other Los Angeles ZIP codes, which include the Brentwood, Calabasas, Hidden Hills and Monte Nido neighborhoods.",

      "The Federal Aviation Administration's most recent administrator, Michael Whitaker, resigned when President Trump took office last week. Whitaker held the job for 15 months, with the last few marred by criticism from prominent Trump supporter and now-White House official Elon Musk, who chafed at the agency's oversight of his company SpaceX.",
      "Who is Christopher Rochelau?",
      "Rocheleau is in his third stint at the FAA. He was appointed by Mr. Trump as deputy administrator last week, and took on the title acting administrator Thursday morning, hours after an American Airlines jet with 64 people on board and an Army helicopter carrying three collided. Rocheleau most recently was chief operating officer of the National Business Aviation Association. Prior to that job, which he began in 2022, he was the FAA's deputy associate administrator for aviation safety. The U.S. Air Force veteran previously worked for the Transportation Security Administration.",
      "Why did Whitaker step down?",
      "Whitaker announced in December that he was stepping down. He was among many agency heads who stepped down as the new White House administration took shape, but did not publicly attribute his resignation to the incoming administration nor Elon Musk. The role of FAA administrator is a Senate-confirmed role, with a five year term. Whitaker was unanimously confirmed in October 2023, filling a role that had been run by acting administrators since March 2022,",
      "What did Musk say about Whitaker?",
      "Musk openly complained about Whitaker and the FAA, after the agency imposed $600,000 in fines on SpaceX related to missions launched with unapproved changes. Musk accused the agency of \"harassing SpaceX about nonsense.\" Musk posted on his social media site in September that Whitaker \"needs to resign.\"",
      "What is an acting administrator?",
      "Rocheleau will be the agency's fourth acting administrator since 2018, taking the helm of the agency without Senate confirmation. The last seven years have been a tumultuous time for the FAA, which faced criticism of its oversight after two Boeing crashes in 2018 and 2019, and later dealt with the rise in unruly passenger behavior amid and following COVID-19 era mask regulations, as well as airline staff shortages and technology glitches.",

      "\"I will find answers to how this happened. I have directed every relevant agency to immediately investigate what went wrong, and I will not tolerate delays or bureaucratic excuses,\" Duffy wrote. \"If there was negligence, incompetence, or failure anywhere in the system, we will find it\u2014and I will fix it.\"",

The collision of a regional jet and a U.S. Army helicopter late Wednesday was the first major commercial plane crash in the U.S. in more than a decade.",

      "Asked directly how he came to the conclusion that diversity had something to do with the crash, Mr. Trump replied, \"because I have common sense.\"",
      "The president's comments drew harsh criticism from the top Democrat in the Senate. \"It's one thing for internet pundits to spew off conspiracy theories, it's another for the president of the United States to throw out idle speculation as bodies are still being recovered and families still being notified,\" Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. \"It just turns your stomach.\"",

      "The American economy ended 2024 on a solid note with consumer spending continuing to drive growth.",
      "The Commerce Department reported Thursday that gross domestic product \u2014 the economy's output of goods and services \u2014 expanded at a 2.3% annual rate from October through December.",
      "For the full year, the economy grew a healthy 2.8%, compared with 2.9% in 2023.",
      "The fourth-quarter growth was a tick below the 2.4% economists had expected, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet.",
      "Consumer spending grew at a 4.2% pace, fastest since January-March 2023 and up from 3.7% in July-September last year. But business investment tumbled as investment in equipment plunged after two straight strong quarters.",
      "Wednesday's report also showed persistent inflationary pressure at the end of the 2024. The Federal Reserve's favored inflation gauge \u2014 called the personal consumption expenditures index, or PCE \u2014 rose at a 2.3% annual pace last quarter, up from 1.5% in the third quarter and above the Fed's 2% target. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation was 2.5%, up from 2.2% in the July-September quarter.",
      "A drop in business inventories shaved 0.93 percentage points off fourth-quarter growth.",
      "But a category within the GDP data that measures the economy's underlying strength rose at a healthy 3.2% annual rate from July through September, slipping from 3.4% in the third quarter. This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending.",
      "Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said that figure \"suggests the economy remains strong, particularly given the fourth-quarter disruptions,'' including a strike at Boeing and the aftermath of two hurricanes.",
      "President Donald Trump has inherited a healthy economy. Growth has been steady and unemployment low \u2014 4.1% in December.",
      "On Wednesday, the Fed left its benchmark interest rate unchanged after making three cuts since September. With the economy rolling along, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters, \"we do not need to be in a hurry'' to make more cuts. The Fed is also cautious because progress against inflation has stalled in recent months after falling from four-decade highs hit in mid-2022.",
      "The European Central Bank cut its benchmark rate by a quarter point Thursday, underlining the contrast between more robust growth in the U.S. economy and stagnation in Europe, which recorded zero growth at the end of last year.",
      "The U.S. economic outlook has become more cloudy, however. Trump has promised to cut taxes and ease regulations on business, which could speed GDP growth. But his plan to impose big taxes on imports and to deport millions of immigrants working in the United States illegally could mean slower growth and higher prices.",
      "Trump said last week that he would lower oil prices and then \"demand'' lower interest rates \u2013 a topic he said he'd take up with Powell. But the Fed chair deflected questions about Trump's comments Wednesday and said he'd had no contact with the president.",
      "Trump has also tried to reshape the federal government, offering buyouts to workers and issuing a memo Monday night freezing federal grants, then rescinding the memo Wednesday after a public outcry.",

    "story": [
      "Kash Patel, President Trump's nominee to serve as FBI director, is set to appear Thursday on Capitol Hill for a high-stakes confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee amid calls from Republicans for massive reforms in FBI leadership and concerns from Democrats about his fitness to lead the nation's top law enforcement agency.",
      "Patel \u2014 a staunch Trump ally and former federal prosecutor and national security official \u2014 was announced by\u00a0Mr. Trump in December\u00a0to take the helm at the agency that has long been a target of the president's ire.\u00a0 The FBI director at the time, Christopher Wray, appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term, then announced his departure from the top job despite having not yet served the full ten-year term. He told 60 Minutes his decision was prompted in part by a desire to transition \"in an orderly way\" and \"not thrust the FBI deeper into the fray.\"",
      "Presidents have the power to replace FBI directors as they see fit and many past directors have not served full 10-year terms.",
      "Patel previously served in intelligence and defense roles in Mr. Trump's first term and held a position on the National Security Council and as chief of staff to the secretary of defense.",
      "An FBI whistleblower alleged that while serving in government, Patel violated firmly entrenched protocols to keep hostage rescue operations under wraps until the captives are safely in U.S. hands and their families have been notified, CBS News previously reported. In a letter obtained by CBS News, Sen. Dick Durbin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote that Patel, while serving on the National Security Council during the first Trump term, \"broke protocol regarding hostage rescues by publicly commenting without authorization on the then-in-progress retrieval of two Americans held captive by Iranian-backed militants in Yemen in October 2020.\"",
      "A source close to Patel pushed back on the allegations and Democrats' criticism, telling CBS News, \"Mr. Patel was a public defender, decorated prosecutor and accomplished national security official that kept Americans safe. He has a track record of success in every branch of government, from the courtroom to congressional hearing room to the situation room. There is no veracity to this anonymous source's complaints about protocol.\"",
      "A former Justice Department prosecutor, Patel has been highly critical of leadership within the organization and he has alleged recent cases against Mr. Trump were politically weaponized against the president and Republicans, allegations officials within the agency have previously denied.",
      "In 2023, Patel published a book titled \"Government Gangsters\" in which he alleged the \"FBI has become so thoroughly compromised that it will remain a threat to the people unless drastic measures are taken.\" And he has pledged to take on government officials and members of the media who he said \"lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections.\"",
      "The FBI came under increased scrutiny from Mr. Trump and his allies in 2022, when FBI agents executed a court-authorized search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. The search exposed what had been an ongoing federal probe into Trump's handling of classified records after he left office. The president has long denied wrongdoing and alleged the FBI and Justice Department were targeting him because of political considerations.",
      "If confirmed by the Senate, Patel would be the third FBI director to work under a Trump administration and would take over the nation's chief federal law enforcement apparatus amid years of intense criticism from Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill. He would report to the U.S. Attorney General. Trump's pick for that role, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, cleared a critical committee vote on Wednesday and is likely to be confirmed for her post in the coming days.",
      "Many Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee, including chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa, have applauded Patel's nomination as a step toward needed reform.",
      "\"The common sense that we have in the Midwest \u2013 we need more of it in Washington, D.C. and I think the [nominees] are going to bring it in, and Kash is one of them,\" Grassley said\u00a0on a recent podcast.",
      "Democrats, however, have been outspoken in their opposition to Patel's nomination and pointed to his past as a reason for concern.",
      "To be confirmed, Patel will first have to receive a majority of votes from within the GOP-led Senate Judiciary Committee, after which his nomination would be presented to the full Senate for a vote.",

      "Adams said the two had no discussion about a possible pardon or anything else regarding his criminal case.",
      "\"To be clear, we did not discuss my legal case, and those who suggest the mayor of the largest city in the nation shouldn't meet with the incoming president to discuss our city's priorities because of inaccurate speculation or because we're from different parties clearly care more about politics than people,\" Adams said in a statement after that meeting.",

      "Another thing that makes the the timing of this revelation unusual is that prosecutors in Manhattan just recently filed paperwork indicating they had uncovered \"additional criminal conduct\" by the mayor. Adding yet another layer of intrigue is word of the meeting comes as Adams has scaled back his public schedule this week due to health concerns, according to the mayor's office, and as Adams' attorney Alex Spiro was in court to have a closed door, sealed meeting about discovery in the case.",

      "The Wall Street Journal\u00a0first reported the settlement.",
      "The lawsuit stemmed from Meta's suspension of his accounts after the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Facebook (which is now Meta) initially suspended and then announced in June 2021 that it would ban Mr. Trump from its platform for at least two years, after finding that his posts on Jan. 6 had stoked violence and posed a risk to public safety. Twitter, now named X and owned by Elon Musk, also barred Mr. Trump from its social media site for the same reason.",

      "A separate plan announced Wednesday calls for aggressive action to fight antisemitism on college campuses, promising to prosecute offenders and revoke visas for international students found to be \"Hamas sympathizers.\"",
      "Both plans were outlined in executive orders signed by Mr. Trump on Wednesday. The measures seek to fulfill some of the Republican president's core campaign promises around education, though it's unclear how much power he has to enact the proposals.",
      "His order on K-12 schools declares that federal money cannot be used on the \"indoctrination\" of children, including \"radical gender ideology and critical race theory.\" It says civil rights laws barring discrimination based on sex and race would be used to enforce the order, calling critical race theory an \"inherently racist policy.\"",
      "Examples cited in the order include a policy at Harrisonburg City Public Schools in Virginia requiring teachers to use students' preferred names and pronouns. Another policy at Madison Metropolitan School District in Wisconsin says schools should \"disrupt the gender binary\" by teaching students to embrace different gender identities, according to the order.",
      "The Education Department's Office for Civil Rights investigates allegations of civil rights violations and can impose sanctions up to a total loss of federal money, though that penalty has almost never been used and must be approved by a judge.",
      "The order is an attempt to suppress teaching about race and racism, said Trey Walk, a researcher and advocate with Human Rights Watch.",
      "\"Students have a right to learn about how discrimination can be entrenched in law and society. If the US denies young people this knowledge, it has little hope of eradicating racism,\" he said.",

      "During his campaign, Mr. Trump said he would sign an order \"on day one\" to cut federal money for schools that push critical race theory or other \"inappropriate\" content. The federal government provides billions of dollars to schools every year, though the vast majority of their money comes from state and local sources.",
      "The measure taps into a wave of conservative anger that has taken aim at classroom lessons that some see as too liberal. A growing number of Republican states have adopted laws or rules barring the teaching of critical race theory or \"divisive concepts\" in public schools and universities.",
      "Opponents say the rules impose vague restrictions on teachers and create a chilling effect on discussions about history and other subjects.",
      "The term \"critical race theory\" is sometimes used by conservatives as a catchall for subjects they don't want to be taught in the classroom, though, in reality, it refers to a complex academic and legal framework centered on the idea that racism is embedded in the nation's systems.",
      "Mr. Trump's plan to fight antisemitism would \"marshal all federal resources\" and bring immediate action from the Justice Department to investigate and punish offenders on U.S. campuses. It calls for the deportation of nonresidents who \"violate our laws,\" citing previous threats by Mr. Trump to revoke student visas for international students who attended pro-Palestinian protests.",
      "Trump's action promises to \"protect law and order, quell pro-Hamas vandalism and intimidation, and investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist, anti-American colleges and universities.\"",
      "It drew swift backlash from civil rights groups who said campus protests have mostly been peaceful and are protected by constitutional free speech rights.",
      "Edward Ahmed Mitchell, national deputy director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the action is discriminatory and wrongly characterizes protesters as \"pro-jihadist\" or \"pro-Hamas.\"",
      "\"These college students were Jewish, Muslim, Black, Palestinian and various other races who were simply protesting what they viewed as a genocide in Gaza,\" Mitchell said. \"They are no different than the students who protested Vietnam or segregation or apartheid in South Africa.\"",
      "Tensions over the Israel-Hamas war led to emotional demonstrations on U.S. campuses, including a wave of pro-Palestinian tent encampments that led to some 3,200 arrests.",
      "The Biden administration opened more than 100 investigations into alleged antisemitism and Islamophobia at schools and universities after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel. A flurry of schools reached deals to settle the cases before Mr. Trump took office amid fears that he would issue heavier sanctions.",
      "The White House on Wednesday also reinstated an order from Mr. Trump's first term establishing the 1776 Commission to promote \"patriotic education\" in U.S. schools.",
      "Biden revoked the order and the commission's guide for teaching history.

Menendez wielded this great power, particularly on the Foreign Relations Committee. The judge was disturbed that [Menendez] would compromise his interests and literally line his pockets and his boots with cash and gold bars, and I think the judge found it particularly egregious that he used the power to further the aims of a foreign country above U.S. foreign policy.\"",
      "Menendez leaves court, blasts federal prosecutors",
      "After leaving the courthouse, Menendez, who has consistently proclaimed his innocence, made a statement to reporters in which he charged the prosecution with ignoring numerous crimes committed by its star witness. He also echoed many of President Donald Trump's words about the Southern District of New York.",
      "\"This whole process has been nothing but a political witch hunt by the Justice Department's prosecutors ... [who] are more interested in political scalps and preparing to run for public office, like Damian Williams,\" Menendez said. \"Welcome to the Southern District of New York, the Wild West of political prosecutions. President Trump is right. This process is political and it's corrupted to the core. I hope President Trump cleans up the cesspool and restores the integrity to the system.\"",
      "Some have questioned whether Menendez would seek a pardon from Mr. Trump, and if the president, who has called the former senator \"Gold Bar Bob,\" would even offer one.",

The Office of Management and Budget and the U.S. Agency of International Development (USAID) have not responded to questions from CBS News.

      "Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii and combat veteran, faces a narrow path to confirmation amid concerns over her decision to meet with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in 2017, her past push to pardon National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden, her views on Ukraine and her previous opposition to renewing a key government surveillance authority, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.",

      "Collins said Monday she's seeking clarity from Gabbard about her position on Section 702. Gabbard, who sought to repeal the controversial law that authorizes the U.S. government to collect the communications of foreigners abroad without a warrant, has since reversed her stance. In a\u00a0statement to Punchbowl earlier this month, Gabbard said she now supports the surveillance authority, calling it \"crucial\" to protecting national security.",

Gabbard's trip faced an outcry from her fellow lawmakers, who argued it legitimized the brutal dictator. Assad fled the country in December 2024 after his regime was toppled.",
      "\"When the opportunity arose to meet with him, I did so because I felt that it's important that if we profess to truly care about the Syrian people, about their suffering, then we've got to be able to meet with anyone that we need to if there is a possibility that we can achieve peace,\" she said in 2017.",
      "She also doubted whether the Assad regime was behind a chemical weapons attack on its own civilians, which international weapons experts said originated from Syrian government sites.",

      "In 2020, Gabbard called for the dismissal of charges against Snowden, who leaked a trove of information on the U.S. government's top-secret mass surveillance programs. Snowden, who was charged with espionage in 2013, has been living in exile in Russia.",
      "Gabbard drew further ire after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, when she made statements that were viewed by some as parroting Russian propaganda.",

      "He has nothing against Zeldin personally, Whitehouse added, \"but the likelihood of him standing against that fossil fuel bulldozer that is coming at him is essentially zero. And in that context, this is very much the wrong guy.\"",
      "Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said Zeldin will return the EPA to its original mission of protecting America's air, water and land \u2014 without \"suffocating the economy.\"",
      "Barrasso called Zeldin \"a lifelong public servant\" and a seasoned lawyer with a sharp legal mind and over 20 years of military service.",
      "Zeldin will continue Mr. Trump's \"mission to roll back punishing, political regulations\" at the EPA, \"cut red tape\" and oversee \"a new wave of creativity and innovation,'' Barrasso said.",
      "\"For the last four years, the so-called experts at the Environmental Protection Agency went on a reckless regulatory rampage,'' Barrasso said, referring to the Biden administration. \"They saddled American families and businesses with higher costs and heavy-handed restrictions. They bowed to climate extremism and ignored common sense.\"",
      "Zeldin \"will right the ship and restore balance at the EPA,'' Barrasso said, citing likely actions to repeal Biden-era rules on tailpipe emissions and power plants, along with eliminating federal subsidies for electric vehicles.",
      "The League of Conservation Voters, a national environmental advocacy group, has panned Zeldin's lifetime environmental record, giving him a 14% score. Like all Republicans at the time, he voted against the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act aimed at boosting renewable energy and manufacturing and fighting climate change.",
      "Zeldin supported a bill to reduce harmful forever chemicals, called PFAS, that would have required the EPA to set limits on substances in drinking water. He also was a leading proponent of the 2020 Great American Outdoors Act, which used oil and gas royalties to help the National Park Service tackle its massive maintenance backlog. He's also supported local conservation efforts on Long Island.",
      "Zeldin said at his Jan. 16 hearing that he wants to collaborate with the private sector \"to promote common-sense, smart regulation that will allow American innovation to continue to lead the world.\"",
      "The EPA under his leadership \"will prioritize compliance as much as possible,\" Zeldin said. \"I believe in the rule of law and I want to work with people to ensure they do their part to protect the environment.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 16:33:51 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve opted to leave its benchmark interest rate unchanged in its first policy meeting since President Trump's inauguration.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it will leave its benchmark rate unchanged, hitting the brakes on lowering borrowing costs for individuals and businesses after a flurry of rate cuts starting last fall.",
      "The Fed said it will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The decision comes after the central bank trimmed rates three times starting in September 2024, which has pushed down the federal funds rate \u2014 the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 by one percentage point.",
      "The pause, the Fed's first rate decision since President Trump returned to office on Jan. 20, comes as economists predict the central bank is likely to take a wait-and-see approach to the president's economic policies, given that some, such as higher tariffs, could prove inflationary.",
      "The Fed's decision to keep rates steady reflects stubborn U.S. inflation, which remains close to 3% on an annual basis. That has fueled concerns that additional rate cuts could reignite price increases, making it more difficult to get to the Fed's 2% target. Notably, the Fed removed a line from its December statement expressing its belief that inflation \"has made progress\" toward its goal. Yet Powell struck a more dovish tone in a press conference to discuss the Fed's decision.",
      "\"Longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well-anchored, as reflected in a broad, broad range of surveys of households, businesses and forecasters, as well as measures from financial markets,\" he said.",
      "Powell also described the economy as \"in quite a good place,\" citing growing GDP, solid job gains and a low unemployment rate, as well as signs of inflationary pressures easing. \"We don't need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,\" he added.",
      "\"Pressing the pause button,\" noted Lindsay Rosner, head of multisector fixed-income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"[T]he FOMC will want to see further progress in the inflation data to deliver the next rate cut highlighted by the fact they removed the reference on inflation making progress.\"",

      "In the meantime, inflation-weary consumers won't get much relief from still-high borrowing costs, especially if the Fed holds off on additional rate cuts later in 2025, as many economists and Wall Street analysts forecast. With the Fed hitting the pause button, it's unlikely that consumers will see lower borrowing costs on credit cards or other forms of debt, even as more households struggle to pay their bills.",
      "\"[L]ower- and middle-income households are facing mounting pressure, as evidenced by an increase in credit card and auto loan delinquencies,\" Joe Gaffoglio, CEO of Mutual of America Capital Management, said in an email.",
      "When will the Fed cut rates?",
      "The Fed may hold off on cutting rates until its May 7 meeting, according to economists polled by financial-data firm FactSet. That means the central bank is expected to hold rates steady at its next meeting on March 19.",
      "\"If the Fed doesn't resume cutting in the next few months, however, we suspect the window will have closed,\" Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said in a report. \"While markets are still pricing in second half rate cuts, our view is that a flurry of tariffs will put a stop to that, as inflation rebounds to 3%.\"",
      "Asked about the possible impact of Mr. Trump's economic plans, Powell demurred, noting that while the Fed is monitoring the new administration's policies, it's too early for the central bank to make an assessment of their possible impact. Mr. Trump has vowed to enact a broad tariff of 10% on all imports, as well as to imposed\u00a025% tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1.",
      "\"We need to let those policies be articulated before we can even begin to make that a plausible assessment of what their implications for the economy will be,\" he said. \"We don't know what's going to be tariffed, we don't know for how long or how much, what countries, we don't know about retaliation.\"",
      "Asked by CBS News' Richard Escobedo about economic uncertainty created by Mr. Trump's plan to deport undocumented immigrants, Powell responded that the administration's efforts are not yet showing up in economic data.",
      "\"Businesses that are dependent on immigrant labor are saying that it's suddenly gotten harder to get people,\" the Fed chair said. \"But again, you don't see that in the aggregate data, but yes, you hear it anecdotally.\"",
      "While inflation has subsided from a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022, it\u00a0rose 2.9% in December on a year-over-year basis due to higher prices on gasoline, which rose 4.4% from the prior month, as well as food and housing.",
      "In its statement, the Fed described the labor market as \"solid,\" with an unemployment rate that has \"stabilized at a low level in recent months.\" Even so, the Fed is closely monitoring the labor market for signs of weakness, with the central bank pointing to a rise in the jobless rate last fall as one reason why it opted to cut rates at the time.",
      "\"The Fed will keep their options open in case a sudden weakening materializes in the months to come\" in the labor market, noted Bankrate chief financial analyst Greg McBride in an email.",
      "As for when the next rate cut might come, it's unclear from the Fed's statement, he added.",
      "\"They gave no indication in their post-meeting statement that a resumption of rate cuts is likely at the next meeting in March,\" McBride said. \"It will take a run of good inflation data to get us there, whenever that may be.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The White House Office of Management and Budget on Wednesday walked back a memo that ordered a freeze on federal assistance, less than two days after the directive led to chaos and confusion around the country as to what programs would be impacted.",
      "The latest two-line memo from acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget Matthew Vaeth states that the earlier directive is rescinded. It directs those with questions about implementing President Trump's executive orders to contact the general counsels at their agencies.",
      "\"In light of the injunction, OMB has rescinded the memo to end any confusion on federal policy created by the court ruling and the dishonest media coverage,\" said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Wednesday. \"The executive orders issued by the president on funding reviews remain in full force and effect and will be rigorously implemented by all agencies and departments. This action should effectively end the court case and allow the government to focus on enforcing the president's orders on controlling federal spending.\"",
      "She said Mr. Trump will take more action in the coming weeks and months to address federal funding.",
      "The White House sent shockwaves when it issued the guidance late Monday that requested agencies temporarily pause \"to the extent permitted by law\" grant, loan or federal financial assistance programs that were implicated by Mr. Trump's executive orders. The executive orders listed include those involving immigration, energy, diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs, and gender ideology.",
      "The memo, from Vaeth, noted that $3 trillion was spent on federal assistance programs in 2024. It directed agencies to submit to the White House budget office by Feb. 10 detailed information on the programs, projects or activities subject to the funding freeze. The pause was set to take effect by 5 p.m. Tuesday.",
      "The full scope of the directive was not clear, and it left nonprofits, small businesses, universities and other entities scrambling to determine whether they would be impacted, and congressional offices faced an onslaught of questions from constituents and organizations fearing they would lose federal dollars.",
      "While the White House's memo stated Medicare or Social Security benefits would not be impacted, state Medicaid agencies, federally-funded Head Start early education programs and community health centers said they were cut off from accessing a web portal run by the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later clarified there was an \"outage\" that affected the portal, and said no payments were affected.",
      "In addition to sowing confusion, the memo sparked numerous lawsuits, including from a coalition of nonprofits and Democratic state attorneys general. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., swiftly convened a hearing on a request from the nonprofit groups to temporarily block enforcement of the freeze, and agreed Tuesday to issue a brief pause to fully consider the matter.",
      "At a hearing Wednesday in the case brought by the Democratic attorneys general, a federal judge in Rhode Island indicated he is likely to grant their request to temporarily block the funding freeze, but was unclear as to the scope of such an order given the White House's rescission of the memo.",
      "U.S. District Judge John McConnell said the states have \"clearly\" shown they would be irreparably harmed by the halting of federal assistance. He cited an affidavit from the director of the Rhode Island Department of Administration, which said the state has been awarded more than $5 billion in federal financial assistance \u2014 more than one-third of its fiscal year 2025 budget.",
      "McConnell said the initial memo ordering the freeze was \"hugely ambiguous and broad and potentially chaotic.\" He directed the states to submit a proposed temporary restraining order, which the Justice Department will have 24 hours to respond to.",
      "\"While the piece of paper may not exist, there is sufficient evidence that the defendants collectively are acting consistent with that directive,\" he said.",
      "Democrats, meanwhile, lambasted the move by Mr. Trump's administration and accused him of depriving states, cities, towns, schools and hospitals of billions of dollars in federal support.",
      "\"This decision is lawless, dangerous, destructive, cruel. It's illegal, it's unconstitutional,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said during a news conference Tuesday.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington, requested Senate Republicans hold off on advancing the nomination of Russ Vought for director of the Office of Management and Budget.",
      "Murray said Wednesday that the rescission of the memo was an \"important victory\" for the American people.",
      "\"Still, the Trump administration \u2014 through a combination of sheer incompetence, cruel intentions, and a willful disregard of the law \u2014 caused real harm and chaos for millions over the span of the last 48 hours which is still ongoing,\" she said in a statement.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Wednesday signed the Laken Riley Act, which aims to expand the federal government's mandate to detain immigrants who are in the country illegally, marking the first legislation signed in Mr. Trump's new term.",
      "The Laken Riley Act, named after a 22-year-old nursing student who was murdered by an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant last year, expands mandatory detention to include noncitizens convicted of or charged with burglary, larceny, theft or shoplifting, as well as those who admit to committing those crimes. It also empowers state attorneys general who claim their states or residents have been harmed by immigration policies to sue the federal government.",
      "The House approved the legislation last week, sending the measure to the president's desk after the Senate expanded its scope to include the assault of a law enforcement officer and crimes that result in the death \"or serious bodily injury of another person\" as grounds for mandatory detention. The legislation passed both the House and Senate with bipartisan support, despite pushback from some Democrats.",
      "Ahead of the signing, Mr. Trump called it a \"very important law\" and said he was \"proudly\" signing it.",
      "\"We will keep Laken's memory alive in our hearts forever,\" Mr. Trump said. \"With today's action, her name will also live forever in the laws of our country.\"",
      "Though the measure stalled last year in the Democratic-controlled Senate, Democrats have appeared more willing to engage on the measure following their losses in the 2024 election, where immigration was a key issue.",
      "Still, the legislation has prompted questions among some Democrats, including whether Immigration and Customs Enforcement could fully enforce this new mandate without more funding.",
      "The bill signing comes as Mr. Trump has signed a slew of executive actions since taking office targeting border security as part of a dramatic crackdown on illegal immigration \u2014 from attempting to terminate birthright citizenship to tasking the military with border enforcement and moving to designate cartels and gangs as terrorist groups to shutting down asylum and refugee admissions.",
      "Meanwhile, congressional leaders are still working to identify a strategy on a massive reconciliation package that would surge resources to the southern border, while addressing other top GOP priorities including energy and taxes as key priorities.",

      "Under the move, some Venezuelan migrants with TPS could lose their ability to live and work in the U.S. lawfully as early as this spring. Migrants whose TPS lapses could face deportation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, which the Trump administration has charged with carrying out the largest deportation effort in American history.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked an order issued earlier this month by her predecessor, Alejandro Mayorkas, that would have extended the Venezuela TPS program for 18 months, through October 2026. TPS allows migrants from countries beset by war, environmental disasters and other crises to work and live in the U.S. legally on a temporary basis.",
      "The Biden administration made two TPS designations for Venezuelans, one in 2021 and the other in 2023, citing the country's economic collapse under the repressive rule of President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "The decision by the Trump administration means that Venezuelans who applied for TPS under the 2021 designation will be able to keep their work permits and deportation protections through September. Those who applied under the 2023 designation will continue to have TPS through at least early April.",
      "Noem has until Saturday, Feb. 1, to decide whether to terminate or extend the 2023 designation, meaning that another announcement could happen soon. If no formal decision is made by then, the designation will be automatically extended by six months.",
      "Roughly 600,000 Venezuelans have protected status, making the Venezuela TPS program the largest of its kind, according to DHS figures.

      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has over the years steadfastly defended the central bank's independence. Most recently, he underlined at a New York Times event in December that insulating the Fed from political influence is \"for the benefit of all Americans,\" allowing it to make decisions based on economic data rather than at the behest of elected officials. The Fed's independence allows it to pursue its dual mandate \u2014 to keep inflation low and the labor market at full employment \u2014 without political pressure, economists concur.",
      "\"We know monetary policy needs to be enacted with a democratic mandate underpinning it, with a day-to-day remove from politics,\" Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Interest rates may need to be raised but it may be inconvenient for political interests, and [the central bank] may need to move quickly to lower rates\" in case of an economic downturn.",
      "While the Fed is an independent agency, it is accountable to Congress and the public, with its chair and other officials testifying before Congress regularly.

      "Instead of hiking rates as Turkey's inflation rate topped 80% in October 2022 on an annual basis, the nation's central bank cut its benchmark rate several times in 2022 and 2023. While the bank reversed course and hiked rates starting in mid-2023, inflation there has proved tough to tame, with prices rising by 44% in December 2024.",
      "By comparison, the highest U.S. inflation rate during the post-pandemic period was in June 2022, when inflation hit 9.1% on an annual basis in June 2022. In the face of the Fed's rate hikes, inflation has cooled since then, deflating to 2.9% on an annual basis last month.",
      "\"The Fed has done really well \u2014 they have raised the rates enough to try to slowly squeeze inflation out of the market,\" noted Erasmus Kersting, a professor of economics at Villanova University. The Fed has \"done all that while avoiding a recession \u2014 that is a delicate needle to thread.\"",
      "Could Mr. Trump influence the Fed?",
      "Questions about Mr. Trump's ability to influence the Federal Reserve or shake up its leadership are intensifying amid the president's statements about his desire for lower interest rates. During his 2024 election campaign, Mr. Trump had insisted that as president he should have a \"say\" in the Fed's interest rate policies.",
      "\"I think that, in my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman,\" Mr. Trump said in August.",
      "For his part, Powell said last year that he would not resign\u00a0even if asked to do so by Mr. Trump, adding that under the law presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026.",
      "However, Mr. Trump has recently fired several government officials in ways that critics say violate the law, such as his administration's firing of more than a dozen federal inspectors general on Friday. Federal law requires the White House to give Congress a full month of warning and case-specific details before firing a federal inspector general.",
      "Removing Powell wouldn't necessarily change the Fed's monetary policy decisions, given that rates are set by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Seven members are from the Fed's Board of Governors; four are assigned from the 11 Reserve Bank presidents, who each serve one-year terms on a rotating basis; and one FOMC member is the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Interfering with the Fed could have consequences, both legally and for the stock market, experts said.",
      "\"Should any president attempt to fire the chairman of the Federal Reserve without cause other than doing the job they were appointed and confirmed to do, I expect there to be swift legal challenges,\" noted Tim Stretton at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government watchdog. \"I suspect the market would also react negatively. Markets like stability, and this level of unprecedented interference in the Federal Reserve would be anything but stable.\"",
      "Asked what advice he would give Mr. Trump about dealing with the Fed, Columbia Business School's House said, \"Stop talking.\"",
      "He added, \"Let the Fed conduct its business consistent with its mandate, and it'll be more likely to get interest rates down.\"",

    "title": "Questions linger about RFK Jr. and a measles outbreak half a world away",
    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 12:16:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Local officials in Samoa don't blame Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's HHS pick, for measles deaths, but critics call his actions \"harmful.\"",
    "story": [
      "As U.S. senators grill Robert F. Kennedy Jr. this week, President Trump's pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services is facing sharp questions about his actions in an island nation half a world away.",
      "Kennedy's 2019 visit to Samoa has recently brought fresh attention to his history of activism focused on raising questions about the safety and effectiveness of the measles vaccine \u2014 because his trip came just months before a devastating measles outbreak that claimed 83 lives, many of them young children.",
      "\"It was very sad,\" Dr. Take Naseri, Samoa's health chief at the time, told CBS News. \"It's one of those things you don't want to revisit.\"",
      "Kennedy has maintained that he had \"nothing to do\" with the people of Samoa resisting vaccines.",
      "\"I had nothing to do with people not vaccinating in Samoa,\" he said in an interview\u00a0with documentary producer Scott Hamilton Kennedy. \"I never told anyone not to vaccinate.\"",
      "But some of Kennedy's critics assert he bears a measure of responsibility for the outbreak and that he leveraged the tragedy to promote false claims about the vaccine. Democrats have seized on the episode, even sponsoring advertising that calls out his visit.",
      "What happened in Samoa?",
      "Years before Kennedy trained his focus on vaccine issues in Samoa, the small Pacific island nation had been experiencing low vaccination rates. Medical professionals attributed this to a shortage of doctors and nurses as well as demographic shifts, with more people moving to cities and away from social structures that helped promote childhood vaccinations. By 2017, only about half of 1-year-old Samoan children were fully vaccinated \u2014 far below the 95% coverage needed to prevent community spread and a steep drop from earlier rates that had reportedly reached 90%.",
      "The situation took a tragic turn in July 2018 when two nurses mistakenly combined an expired muscle relaxant with MMR vaccine doses instead of sterile water, leading to the deaths of two children. The nurses were charged with manslaughter, and the government responded by suspending the national vaccination program for 10 months. Vaccination rates for children dropped to 31%.",
      "Naseri, the former Samoan health chief, told CBS News that the government had struggled to implement an effective vaccine program. He said the mishandling of the vaccine and its tragic consequences \"was the last straw.\"",
      "\"It created more hesitancy,\" Naseri said.",
      "Mistrust in vaccines spread across the island like a virus. At the time, even the prime minister issued a statement on Facebook alleging that his grandson had been injured by a vaccine. The temporary suspension of vaccinations corresponded with a growing distrust in modern medicine.",
      "\"I would rather treat them at home with old-fashioned herbal medicines than taking them to see a doctor,\" one mother told local reporters at the time. \"Since children died from these vaccines, I don't trust any medication from the hospital.\"",
      "Patricia Stinchfield, a nurse practitioner and past president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, said she had been monitoring the Samoan vaccine crisis even before the measles outbreak struck. She says the immunization rates had dropped so low the situation was \"a ticking time bomb.\"",
      "It was in the midst of that \"perfect storm,\" Stinchfield said, that Kennedy arrived in Samoa in the summer of 2019. Kennedy has said the purpose of his visit was to pitch a health surveillance system, and that the vaccination pause in 2018 was an opportunity to naturally study an unvaccinated population. His trip was coordinated by a local anti-vaccine advocate known for spreading medical misinformation online.",
      "Dr. Naseri told CBS News he met briefly with Kennedy but their conversation focused on environmental and vaccine safety issues.",
      "In August 2019, two months after Kenendy's visit, an infected traveler from New Zealand arrived in Samoa and the deadly measles virus began its spread. The government officially declared an outbreak on Oct. 16 and a month later declared a state of emergency.",
      "It wasn't until early December that the Samoan government conceded it had mishandled immunizations and launched an aggressive vaccination campaign, making the shots mandatory. Dr. Naseri said that delayed response may have contributed to the high infection and death rates. But finally, the country shut down for two days to allow health workers to vaccinate people at home, quickly achieving 90% coverage.",
      "Hundreds of medical professionals from around the world responded and traveled to Samoa to help with the vaccination efforts, including Hawaii's lieutenant governor, now Gov. Josh Green.",
      "\"The government needed the political will, and the international community backed us up,\" Naseri said.",
      "CBS News visited Samoa during that response and met one parent named Paulo Puelua, who said the measles outbreak took hold of his family in an instant, killing three of his five children. Their mother Fa'oso was so distraught that she had been sleeping on her children's grave, set up in the family's front yard according to Samoan tradition. She told CBS News she felt it was her only way to be close to them now.",
      "Looking back, officials told CBS News they believe the outbreak's high death toll resulted from multiple factors, including widespread malnutrition, reliance on traditional medicine, and an overwhelmed health care system. In rural Samoa, many families share a single sleeping space, making transmission easier, and nearly a quarter of the population lives in poverty, further complicating treatment.",
      "Controversy about RFK Jr.'s role",
      "Dr. Paul Offit is a vaccine specialist and co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine. He's also director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He's been a frequent critic of Kennedy's and believes the nominee for health secretary deserves harsh judgment for how the outbreak unfolded.",
      "Offit says Kennedy had been posting about the two deaths before it was understood what had happened, and blamed the MMR vaccine. When that turned out not to be the case, Kennedy did not correct that false assertion.",
      "\"If he was any kind of man, which he isn't, he should go back to Samoa and apologize to every one of the families where a child died,\" Offit said. \"He's a famous man who goes there and meets with anti-vaccine activists. He gives them credence by going there.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to Kennedy for comment through the organization he led until last month, Children's Health Defense, and did not receive a reply. The group has previously denied his visit played any role in the outbreak.",
      "In interviews, Samoan health officials told CBS News they believe Kennedy's actions were unlikely to have directly influenced what occurred.",
      "\"It is well documented that RFK Jnr's visit to Samoa in 2019 coincided with increased anti-vaccine sentiment, particularly among certain groups,\" Samoa's Ministry of Health said in a statement. \"However, there is no conclusive evidence that his visit directly contributed to the decline in vaccination rates or the subsequent measles outbreak.\"",
      "But in the midst of the island's state of emergency, Kennedy sent a letter to the Samoan prime minister suggesting a defective vaccine may have been responsible for causing infections \u2014 a theory that has been debunked.",
      "\"It is critical that the Samoan Health Ministry determine, scientifically, if the outbreak was caused by inadequate vaccine coverage or alternatively, by a defective vaccine,\" Kennedy wrote in the Nov. 19, 2019 letter. Kennedy's letter partly leans on an idea that appears to have originated from misinformation widely spread on social media during a 2014-2015 measles outbreak at Disneyland that inaccurately said that measles originating from the vaccine had been identified.",
      "Stinchfield says this is impossible based on the weakened nature of the virus in the vaccine. In very rare cases people may exhibit symptoms similar to those associated with measles but no cases have ever been documented of measles being spread as a result.",
      "After the Samoan infections, critics say Kennedy downplayed the outbreak's severity in blog posts and continued to suggest that the vaccine itself was responsible for the high death rate. He was joined by Del Bigtree, a prominent anti-vaccine activist and Kennedy ally, in pushing conspiracy theories surrounding the outbreak.",
      "Stinchfield says the claims they pushed remained unsupported by evidence. And eventually, the Samoan government stopped listening.",
      "Samoa has since achieved high vaccination rates and the World Health Organization says the country has reported no measles cases since 2020. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a challenge globally, with anti-vaccine activists continuing to spread fear and misinformation.",
      "Samoa's Health Ministry says it remains concerned about \"the global spread of vaccine misinformation and the potential consequences of RFK Jnr.'s influence, particularly if he assumes a leadership role in public health policy. The spread of anti-vaccine narratives has already contributed to outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases in multiple countries, reversing decades of progress in immunization efforts.\"",
      "Stinchfield said she believes misinformation spread by Kennedy and others \u2014 in Samoa, and during the years since \u2014 remains acutely dangerous.",
      "\"Their modus operandi is to take a little kernel of truth and spin it around and confuse people, spin it at a time where the fear is already so high,\" she said. \"That is disinformation, a weapon that will harm people, harm children.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The top federal prosecutor in South Florida is asking a federal appeals court to toss out the classified documents case against President Trump's former co-defendants, aide Walt Nauta and former Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos de Oliveira.",
      "Acting U.S. Attorney Hayden O'Byrne made the request to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit on Wednesday, which lawyers for Nauta and de Oliveira do not oppose. It's likely the Atlanta-based appeals court will grant the request, bringing the case initially brought by former special counsel Jack Smith to a close.",
      "Nauta and de Oliveira were charged alongside Mr. Trump in 2023 with allegedly helping obstruct the Justice Department probe into the president's handling of sensitive government documents after the end of his first term in January 2021.",
      "The prosecution was brought by Smith, who resigned as special counsel before Mr. Trump returned to the White House. The special counsel claimed the president unlawfully held onto sensitive government after returning to his South Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, after leaving the White House four years ago, and accused Nauta and de Oliveira of working with Mr. Trump to conceal information from the Justice Department.",
      "The three co-defendants pleaded not guilty. The charges were then dismissed by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon last July on the grounds that Smith was unlawfully appointed. The special counsel appealed the decision to the 11th Circuit.",
      "Following Mr. Trump's election in November, Smith successfully sought to remove him from the case because of a longstanding Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president. But the appeal was continuing as to Nauta and de Oliveira.",
      "The former special counsel accused the two allies of Mr. Trump of attempting to interfere with the federal probe. Their attorneys fought the charges and resisted the Justice Department's previous efforts to keep the cases moving forward on appeal after Mr. Trump's election win.",
      "Should the judges agree to close the case, a major impediment to the public release of Smith's report summarizing the classified documents investigation would be eliminated. Former Attorney General Merrick Garland agreed to keep the volume of Smith's report that dealt with the case under seal as the appeal progressed. Now, with the case on the verge of dismissal and Mr. Trump's administration in power, it remains unclear whether the volume of the report will be released to the public.",
      "The first volume of Smith's report, which involved his investigation and prosecution of Mr. Trump stemming from alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of presidential power after the 2020 election, was made public just before the president returned to office.",
      "Mr. Trump has returned to office with a pledge to end the so-called \"weaponization\" of the Justice Department. He has since fired roughly a dozen department employees\u00a0who worked with Smith on the prosecutions of the president.",
      "Nauta's lawyer, Stanley Woodward, is now serving as a White House lawyer. CBS News previously reported that de Oliveira's attorney, John Irving, is under possible consideration for a top job within the Justice Department although a final decision has yet to be made.",
      "Irving said in a statement that \"Carlos should never have been charged in the first place, and I have zero doubt that he would have been acquitted at trial. It's nice to see the Justice Department using better judgment these days.\"",

      "President Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order aimed at cutting federal support for certain types of gender-affirming care for people under age 19, his latest move to roll back protections for transgender people across the country.",
      "\"It is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,\" the order says.",
      "The order covers gender-affirming care that includes puberty blockers, hormone replacement therapy and surgical procedures.",

      "Medicaid programs in some states cover gender-affirming care. The new order suggests that the practice could end, and targets hospitals and universities that receive federal money and provide the care.",
      "The language in the executive order \u2014 using words such as \"maiming,\" \"sterilizing\" and \"mutilation\" \u2014 contradicts what is typical for gender-affirming care in the United States. It also labels guidance from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health as \"junk science.\"",
      "On his Truth Social platform, Mr. Trump called gender-affirming care \"barbaric medical procedures.\"",
      "Major medical groups such as the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics support access to care.",

      "That order's language stated that identifying as a gender that is \"inconsistent\" with one's biological sex \"conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life\" and that soldiers who do so \"cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\"",

The readiness and physical capabilities of transgender service members is not different from that of other service members.\"",
      "Hours after taking office last week, Mr. Trump signed another order that seeks to define sex as only male or female, not recognizing transgender, nonbinary or intersex people or the idea that gender can be fluid.

    "story": [
      "A palm-sized mammal that lives underground in California  has been caught alive on camera for the first time.",
      "Three undergraduate students came up with an idea to capture the elusive Mount Lyell shrew, native to the Eastern Sierra Nevada region, as part of their fall 2024 project. Vishal Subramanyan, Prakrit Jain and Harper Forbes laid out over 100 traps last November and checked them every two hours, for three days and four nights, to photograph the tiny creatures.",
      "\"The hardest part of getting the photos was one, they're incredibly fast cuz they're always running around,\" Subramanyan told CBS News.",
      "Another reason the Mount Lynell shrews had never been captured alive on camera is that they have an incredibly fast metabolism, Subramanyan said. He and Jain were already taking photos of small mammals for their mammalogy class when they learned that this particular animal had never been photographed before, so they devised a plan.",
      "Researchers have set up similar pitfall traps to capture the shrews, but if they're left in the trap for more than two hours, they'll simply starve to death. That's why Subramanyan, Jain and Forbes had to check their traps every two hours.",
      "To take the photos, the students set up a white background on the bottom of a box, using glass on the top so they could photograph through it. They also had a terrarium with soil and mealworms for the shrews.",
      "The tiny mammals are active through day and night because they have to constantly feed on insects and arachnids to survive. Another challenge in getting the photos were cold fingers, Subramanyan said.",
      "Temperatures in the mountain fell to 15 degrees during the expedition funded with the help of Cal Academy. Subramanyan was part of the organization's inaugural California Creators for Nature program that aims to engage people on social media in conversations about nature, climate and environmental justice.",
      "\"There's a fair number of animals in the U.S. that have never had their photos taken, or there are very little or poor quality photos,\" Jain said, adding that he hopes to continue taking photos of wildlife to aid conservation efforts.",
      "In addition to helping raise awareness about the small mammals facing threats from climate change \u2014 with 89% projected loss of its habitat by the 2080s, according to UC Berkeley \u2014 the students said the photos will be entered into scientific databases, and they will help make it easier for researchers to identify species of the shrews.",
      "The shrews are \"highly prolific predators\" that can eat several times their body mass on a daily basis, Jain said. He noted they also serve as an important part in the food chain for other predators such as snakes, owls and wild cats.",

      "The gigantic wall of ice is moving slowly from Antarctica on a potential collision course with South Georgia, a crucial wildlife breeding ground in the South Atlantic.",
      "Satellite imagery suggested that unlike previous \"megabergs,\" this rogue was not crumbling into smaller chunks as it plodded through the Southern Ocean, Andrew Meijers, a physical oceanographer at the British Antarctic Survey, told AFP on Friday.",
      "He said predicting its exact course was difficult but prevailing currents suggested the colossus would reach the shallow continental shelf around South Georgia in two to four weeks.",
      "But what might happen next is anyone's guess, he said.",
      "It could avoid the shelf and get carried into open water beyond South Georgia, a British overseas territory some 870 miles east of the Falkland Islands.",
      "Or it could strike the sloping bottom and get stuck for months or break up into pieces.",
      "Meijers said this scenario could seriously impede seals and penguins trying to feed and raise their young on the island. The island hosts 1.3 million pairs of Chinstrap penguins \u2014 one of the world's largest colonies \u2014 about 5 million seals, and 65 million breeding birds.",
      "\"Icebergs have grounded there in the past and that has caused significant mortality to penguin chicks and seal pups,\" he said.",
      "Roughly 1,550 square miles across, the world's biggest and oldest iceberg, known as A23a, calved from the Antarctic shelf in 1986. Before its calving in 1986, the colossal iceberg hosted a Soviet research station. falley",
      "It remained stuck for over 30 years before finally breaking free in 2020, its lumbering journey north sometimes delayed by ocean forces that kept it spinning in place. In 2023, the British Antarctic Survey posted a time-lapse of satellite imagery, showing the iceberg's movement.",

      "\"It's just like this white wall. It's very sort of Game of Thrones-esque, actually,\" he said, referring to the dark fantasy series.",
      "A23a has followed roughly the same path as previous massive icebergs, passing the east side of the Antarctica Peninsula through the Weddell Sea along a route called \"iceberg alley.\" That is the same current of water that famed explorer Ernest Shackleton used in 1916 to make his storied escape from Antarctica after losing his ship, the Endurance. The legendary\u00a0shipwreck was discovered\u00a0off the coast of Antarctica in 2022.",
      "Weighing a little under a trillion tons, this monster block of freshwater was being whisked along by the world's most powerful ocean \"jet stream\" -- the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.",
      "Raul Cordero from Chile's University of Santiago, who is also part of the National Antarctic Research Committee, said he was confident the iceberg would sidestep South Georgia.",
      "\"The island acts as an obstacle for ocean currents and therefore usually diverts the water long before it reaches the island,\" he said.",
      "\"The iceberg is moved by that water flow, so the chances of it hitting are not that high,\" though chunks could, he said.",
      "Another scientist, glaciologist Soledad Tiranti currently on an Argentinian exploration voyage in the Antarctic, said that icebergs such as A23a \"are so deep that before reaching an island or mainland they generally get stuck\" on the seabed.",
      "It is summer in South Georgia and resident penguins and seals along its southern coastline are foraging in the frosty waters to bring back food to fatten their young.",
      "\"If the iceberg parks there, it'll either block physically where they feed from, or they'll have to go around it,\" said Meijers.",
      "\"That burns a huge amount of extra energy for them, so that's less energy for the pups and chicks, which causes increased mortality.\"",
      "The seal and penguin populations on South Georgia have already been having a \"bad season\" with an outbreak of bird flu \"and that (iceberg) would make it significantly worse,\" he said.",
      "As A23a ultimately melted it could seed the water with nutrients that encourage phytoplankton growth, feeding whales and other species, and allowing scientists to study how such blooms absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",
      "While icebergs are natural phenomena, Meijers said the rate at which they were being lost from Antarctica was increasing, likely due to human induced climate change.",

      "President Trump blamed the Biden administration Tuesday for \"abandoning\" two astronauts who have been stuck aboard the International Space Station in the wake of problems last summer with their Boeing Starliner capsule.",
      "In a post to his Truth Social platform, the president said he has asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration. They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!\"",
      "For his part, Musk had written in an earlier post on his own social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding that \"we will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's post made it sound like Musk himself would be going to space, adding to widespread confusion about what was being planned, in part because the astronauts in question, Starliner commander Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore and co-pilot Sunita Williams, are not \"stranded\" in any conventional sense, and have not been \"abandoned\" in space.",
      "They could return to Earth anytime NASA so decides, riding down in a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule that carried two station crew members to orbit last September with two empty seats specifically for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "They blasted off aboard the Starliner capsule last June 5 for a presumed eight-to-10-day mission. It was the first piloted flight of a Starliner, a key step toward beginning service as an operational alternative to SpaceX's Crew Dragon.",
      "But the flight was marred by propellant leaks and pressurization problems with the Starliner's propulsion system.",
      "After multiple extensions to carry out tests and analyses, NASA managers decided on Aug. 24 to leave Wilmore and Williams aboard the station for an extended stay, bringing the Starliner down under remote control, without its crew, on Sept. 7. There were no major problems.",
      "The decision to keep Wilmore and Williams aloft on the station was made by NASA management based on a risk assessment and a desire to minimize long-range disruption to the carefully choreographed schedule of crew rotation and cargo delivery missions.",
      "In any case, in the wake of NASA's decision, SpaceX launched a four-seat Crew Dragon spacecraft to the space station on Sept. 28 with just two crew members aboard \u2014 NASA's Nick Hague and cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov \u2014 leaving two seats available for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "NASA opted to carry out a normal long-duration stay by Hague and Gorbunov, who launched with an expectation of returning to Earth at the end of February with Wilmore and Williams. All of that was known last September.",
      "The return flight was later delayed an additional month or so to give SpaceX more time to ready a new Crew Dragon capsule for launch on its maiden flight to ferry a replacement crew \u2014 Crew 10 \u2014 to the station.",
      "As it now stands, Crew 9 commander Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams are expecting to return to Earth at the end of March. By that point, the two Starliner astronauts will have logged around 300 days in space. Both astronauts have said they understood NASA's decision to extend their mission.",
      "As the founder of SpaceX, Musk was certainly aware of those decisions when they were made and the rationale behind them. There have been no reports of any direct involvement of the Biden administration in the decisions to extend the Starliner crew's stay in space, and Musk offered no criticisms of NASA's decision at the time.",
      "As for what returning the Starliner crew to Earth \"as soon as possible\" might mean, the only obvious answer would be to bring Hague, Gorbunov, Wilmore and Williams down ahead of schedule. They would not need anyone to come get them.",
      "But an early departure would leave a single U.S. astronaut behind on the space station: Don Pettit, who launched to the lab last year aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft along with two Russian crewmates.",
      "NASA would then have just one astronaut on board the station to operate the multi-module U.S. segment of the lab, likely halting research in its tracks until Crew 10 could arrive aboard the next Crew Dragon.",
      "Rumors indicate the Crew 10 Dragon could be facing additional delays. NASA could opt to move the next station crew to a Crew Dragon earmarked for a commercial trip to the station carrying a crew sponsored by Houston-based Axiom Space. That might move the Crew 9 return up a few days, but not by any significant amount.",

      "President Trump has signed settlement papers that are expected to require Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, to pay roughly $25 million to resolve a 2021 lawsuit Trump brought against the social media giant, according to sources familiar with the agreement.",
      "The Wall Street Journal\u00a0first reported the settlement.",
      "The lawsuit stemmed from Meta's suspension of his accounts after the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Facebook (which is now Meta) initially suspended and then announced in June 2021 that it would ban Mr. Trump from its platform for at least two years, after finding that his posts on Jan. 6 had stoked violence and posed a risk to public safety. Twitter, now named X and owned by Elon Musk, also barred Mr. Trump from its social media site for the same reason.",
      "Mr. Trump sued Facebook and Twitter, claiming they had violated his First Amendment right to free speech in \"illegal, unconstitutional censorship.\" He was reinstated on Twitter in 2022 and\u00a0returned to Facebook in 2023.",
      "In complaints filed with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Mr. Trump had asked the court to overturn Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects social media companies from liability for content posted on their platforms, and restore his accounts on the two social media sites, as well as his channel on YouTube. He also asked the courts to prevent Twitter, Facebook and YouTube from \"exercising censorship, editorial control or prior restraint in its many forms\" over the posts and uploads of the presidents.",
      "According to the Wall Street Journal, $22 million will be donated to a fund for Mr. Trump's presidential library, and the rest will be used for legal fees and go to other plaintiffs on the case.",

    "summary": "Lawmakers and experts say China's DeepSeek AI app could expose U.S. users to risks and promote censorship.",
    "story": [
      "As Chinese AI application DeepSeek attracts hordes of American users, Trump administration officials, lawmakers and cybersecurity experts are expressing concern that the technology could pose a threat to U.S. national security.",
      "DeepSeek's introduction in the U.S. on Monday saw it quickly become the most downloaded free application in the country on Apple's app store. The rollout also rocked Wall Street as investors struggled to compute the sudden appearance of a low-cost, open-source generative AI tool able to compete with leading artificial intelligence apps such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Shares of Nvidia, the U.S. manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, plummeted 17%, chopping roughly $600 billion off its market value \u2014 a record single-day drop for a U.S. stock.",
      "That explosive debut was branded a \"wake-up call\" by President Trump on Monday. Addressing reporters on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the National Security Council (NSC) would examine the potential national security implications around DeepSeek's launch, noting that the administration would seek to \"ensure American AI dominance.\"",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "Some lawmakers also weighed in with concerns about the application's access to U.S. users.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot allow Chinese Communist Party models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions,\" Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said Tuesday in a statement shared on social media. \"We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek's AI infrastructure.\"",
      "The spotlight on DeepSeek comes amid rising tensions over trade, technology and other issues between the two superpowers. The U.S. has already imposed significant export controls on China in an effort to rein in Beijing's production of semiconductors used in developing advanced AI, with the most recent curbs coming in\u00a0December.",
      "\"At the President's direction, the NSC and others in the U.S. government work in many ways to address concerns involving AI, China and data security,\" agency spokesperson Brian Hughes told CBS News in an email. \"As the President has underscored, U.S. policy is to ensure that the United States leads the world in AI.\"",
      "Security threat for users",
      "While the calls from Moolenaar could be the first inkling of a possible congressional crackdown, Ross Burley \u2014 a co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience \u2014 warned that DeepSeek's emergence in the U.S. raises data security and privacy issues for users. Chinese law grants Beijing broad authority to access data from companies based in China.",
      "\"More and more people will use it, and that will open the door to more and more personal data just being given away to the [Chinese Communist Party] and being sent basically to mainland China to be able to inform them of their activities,\" Burley told CBS News.",
      "\"What they'll use it for is behavior change campaigns, disinformation campaigns, for really targeted messaging as to what Western audiences like, what they do,\" he added.",
      "DeepSeek, which is based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, notes in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held \"on secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "A Chinese artificial intelligence company called DeepSeek is grabbing America's attention \u2014 and sending a shock wave through Wall Street \u2014 due to its new tech, which some experts say rivals that of OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "DeepSeek is also catching investors off guard because of the low development costs for its AI app, which Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives pegged at only $6 million. By comparison, OpenAI, Google and other major U.S. companies are on track to invest a total of roughly $1 trillion in AI over the coming years, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "On Monday, DeepSeek's rollout roiled shares of AI stalwarts such as Nvidia, the high-flying manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, and Dutch company ASML, another chipmaker. The Chinese company's tech is raising questions about whether demand for Nvidia's chips could take a hit, as well as whether investors are overvaluing tech stocks that have been buoyed by the promise of AI, from Meta to Microsoft, experts said.",
      "\"DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less,\" said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, in an email. \"This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years.\"",
      "DeepSeek's latest app comes just days after President Trump announced a new $500 billion venture\u00a0with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Softbank and Oracle, dubbed Stargate, which he touted as ensuring \"the future of technology\" in the U.S.",
      "AI-related stocks took a hit on Monday, with Nvidia shares tumbling 17%, shedding $600 billion in value and marking the single-biggest one-day loss for a company in stock market history, according\u00a0to CNBC. ASML sank 6%, while Broadcom, another semiconductor stock, also slumped 17%.",
      "Some energy-related stocks also plunged on Monday on investor worries that the new tech could require less energy to run, translating into lower demand from the tech sector. GE Vernova, which makes wind and gas turbines, plunged 21%, while electricity generator Vistra slumped 28%.",
      "The tech-heavy Nasdaq index slumped 3%, or 612 points, while the S&P 500 declined 1.5%. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7%.",
      "Despite the sharp drop on the Nasdaq, it's far from the worst day for the index during the past five years. The worst one-day decline since Jan. 27, 2020, came on March 16, 2020, when the index plunged more than 12% as COVID-19 pandemic hit the economy.",
      "What is DeepSeek?",
      "DeepSeek is a private Chinese company founded in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a graduate of Zhejiang University, one of China's top universities, who funded the startup via his hedge fund,\u00a0according to the MIT Technology Review. Liang has about $8 billion in assets, Ives wrote in a Jan. 27 research note.",
      "Liang, who had previously focused on applying AI to investing, had bought a \"stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips,\" a type of tech that is now banned from export to China. Those chips became the basis of DeepSeek, the MIT publication reported.",
      "Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius, told investors in a note that DeepSeek makes legitimate breakthroughs as an AI tool, including better learning and more efficient use of memory, although he expressed skepticism about the \"amount of chips used.\"",
      "Is DeepSeek available in the U.S.?",
      "The company's AI app is available in Apple's App store, as well as online at its website. The service is free and as of Monday morning was the top download on Apple's store, although some people were having trouble signing up for the app.",
      "On its Chinese site, DeepSeek blamed \"large-scale malicious attacks\" on its service, requiring it to temporarily limit new registrations. \"Existing users can log in as usual,\" the company said in the post, which was dated shortly after midnight Jan. 28 in China's local time.",
      "The company released its latest AI model on Jan. 20, which is causing Wall Street to reappraise the AI sector.",
      "\"Last week DeepSeek launched a model that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT and Meta's Llama 3.1 and was #1 on Apple's App Store over the weekend,\" Wedbush's Ives wrote. \"DeepSeek built the model using reduced capability chips from Nvidia. which is impressive and thus has caused major agita for U.S. tech stocks with massive pressure on Nasdaq this morning.\"",
      "How is DeepSeek different than other AI apps?",
      "DeepSeek is an open-source large language model that relies on what is known as \"inference-time computing,\" which Sette said in layman's terms means \"they activate only the most relevant portions of their model for each query, and that saves money and computation power.\"",
      "Some experts praised DeepSeek's performance, with noted tech investor Marc Andreessen writing\u00a0on X on Jan. 24, \"DeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I've ever seen \u2014 and as open source, a profound gift to the world.\"",
      "David Sacks, a venture capitalist named by Mr. Trump to help oversee AI and cryptocurrency policy, said on social media Monday that DeepSee's app \"shows that the AI race will be very competitive.\"",
      "However, Ives said he's skeptical the service will gain ground with major U.S. businesses.",
      "\"No U.S. Global 2000 is going to use a Chinese startup DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases,\" Ives wrote. \"At the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\"",
      "Are there privacy issues with DeepSeek?",
      "Some experts are raising concerns about the personal data that DeepSeek is collecting, given that the company stores data from users \u2014 including their date of birth, keystrokes, text or audio inputs, uploaded files, chat history and other data \u2014 on servers located in China, according to its privacy policy.",
      "That echoes some of the issues raised with TikTok, another company with Chinese ownership that sparked worries about the supposed risks its ties to China posed to national security. Last year, Congress passed a law\u00a0banning\u00a0 TikTok in the U.S. as long as it is under Chinese ownership, although that is now in flux after President Trump signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0directing the Justice Department to not enforce the ban for 75 days.",
      "What does DeepSeek mean for Nvidia and other tech companies?",
      "Wall Street is trying to assess the long-term impact of a low-cost AI tool from China that rivals ChatGPT and other so-called generative AI apps. It also raises questions about whether Silicon Valley is overspending on tech advancements in the AI sector, noted Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, in an email.",
      "\"The fact that this technology is supposed to take less energy and is more cost-effective than U.S.-based models has U.S. technology investors very concerned,\" Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, said.",
      "It's also unclear what type of pushback or reaction could come from the White House, given that Mr. Trump has raised the possibility of placing new tariffs on Chinese imports, although he also gave the Chinese-owned TikTok a reprieve by ordering the Justice Department not to enforce a looming ban.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think Monday's stock selloff is an overreaction, noting that the enormous demand for AI will continue lifting key players in the sector.",
      "\"It's one thing to train a [large language] model for less money, but accommodating the huge demand for the consumption of all this AI technology is still going to require massive amounts of infrastructure,\" Adam Crisafulli of VitalKnowledge said in a report.",
      "Analysts at Bernstein Research also noted that while DeepSeek's technology looks promising, it likely isn't revolutionary, suggesting that Monday's investment rout is overblown.",
      "What is Nvidia saying about DeepSeek?",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Nvidia offered praise for DeepSeek.",
      "\"DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of test-time scaling,\" the company said in an email. \"DeepSeek's work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export-control compliant.\"",
      "But, Nvidia added, AI inference, or using AI models to make decisions or predictions, \"requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.\"",

      "The San Francisco International Airport has introduced a new sensory room designed to give neurodivergent travelers some relief from flying jitters.",
      "Airports are a whirlwind of activity: long lines, blaring announcements and the never-ending stream of travelers racing to their gates.",
      "While most take it in stride, for 29-year-old Nico Ambata, it's always been a little too much.",
      "\"It took my wife three years of convincing me to finally go on vacation,\" he said.",
      "Ambata has debilitating ADHD. For him, the unpredictability of flying isn't just stressful; it's paralyzing.",
      "\"I like to explain that I have a million channels playing in my head at the same time,\" he said.",
      "But this time, Ambata and his wife Jhasmine are taking their first step at conquering the chaos of travel. They've boarded a plane at San Francisco International Airport. Or least it seems that way.",
      "With two rows of seats, overhead bins and even working lights, the cabin simulator is the centerpiece of SFO's new sensory room designed for neurodivergent travelers looking to ease their feelings of nervousness over flying.",
      "Christopher Birch, SFO's Guest Experience Director, said the $1.2 million space includes soundproof walls, dim lighting, and sensory tools to help travelers decompress before their flight.",
      "\"The reason to do this is almost like a rehearsal,\" he said. \"To go through the boarding and the sitting process before you actually do it and to give a sense of familiarity when the time comes to actually board the airplane.\"",
      "Airports across the country are dedicated spaces for neurodivergent travelers. While anyone can enjoy them, they're designed for those who need it most. Jono and Marie Miller were using the room with their two boys, 8-year-old Will and 10-year-old Johnny, who are on the spectrum.",
      "\"Just letting kids know what to expect helps with that transition a lot and probably helps to not have so many meltdowns,\" Marie Miller said.",
      "As for Ambata, the space is all he needed to feel grounded.",
      "\"I'm ready,\" he said.",
      "The sensory room is located at SFO's Harvey Milk Terminal, but can be accessed from all areas of the airport.",

    "summary": "President Trump appointed Christopher Rocheleau, a 22-year FAA veteran, as acting administrator of the agency.",
    "story": [
      "As first responders searched the Potomac River Thursday following the nation's deadliest airline crash in nearly a quarter of a century, the agency tasked with regulating civilian air travel was without a Senate-approved head.",
      "President Trump moved Thursday, appointing Christopher Rocheleau, a 22-year FAA veteran, as acting administrator of the agency. Mr. Trump described\u00a0 Rocheleau as \"highly respected.\"",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration's most recent administrator, Michael Whitaker, resigned when President Trump took office last week. Whitaker held the job for 15 months, with the last few marred by criticism from prominent Trump supporter and now-White House official Elon Musk, who chafed at the agency's oversight of his company SpaceX.",
      "Who is Christopher Rochelau?",
      "Rocheleau is in his third stint at the FAA. He was appointed by Mr. Trump as deputy administrator last week, and took on the title acting administrator Thursday morning, hours after an American Airlines jet with 64 people on board and an Army helicopter carrying three collided. Rocheleau most recently was chief operating officer of the National Business Aviation Association. Prior to that job, which he began in 2022, he was the FAA's deputy associate administrator for aviation safety. The U.S. Air Force veteran previously worked for the Transportation Security Administration.",
      "Why did Whitaker step down?",
      "Whitaker announced in December that he was stepping down. He was among many agency heads who stepped down as the new White House administration took shape, but did not publicly attribute his resignation to the incoming administration nor Elon Musk. The role of FAA administrator is a Senate-confirmed role, with a five year term. Whitaker was unanimously confirmed in October 2023, filling a role that had been run by acting administrators since March 2022,",
      "What did Musk say about Whitaker?",
      "Musk openly complained about Whitaker and the FAA, after the agency imposed $600,000 in fines on SpaceX related to missions launched with unapproved changes. Musk accused the agency of \"harassing SpaceX about nonsense.\" Musk posted on his social media site in September that Whitaker \"needs to resign.\"",
      "What is an acting administrator?",
      "Rocheleau will be the agency's fourth acting administrator since 2018, taking the helm of the agency without Senate confirmation. The last seven years have been a tumultuous time for the FAA, which faced criticism of its oversight after two Boeing crashes in 2018 and 2019, and later dealt with the rise in unruly passenger behavior amid and following COVID-19 era mask regulations, as well as airline staff shortages and technology glitches.",
      "What about the Transportation Secretary?",
      "Former Rep. Sean Duffy was sworn in as Secretary of Transportation on Tuesday, after being confirmed by the Senate in a 77-22 vote. The Department of Transportation includes the FAA. Duffy posted on social media Thursday that, \"I want the families of the victims to know that they have my word: I will not rest until you have the truth.\"",
      "\"I will find answers to how this happened. I have directed every relevant agency to immediately investigate what went wrong, and I will not tolerate delays or bureaucratic excuses,\" Duffy wrote. \"If there was negligence, incompetence, or failure anywhere in the system, we will find it\u2014and I will fix it.\"",

      "On Wednesday, the Anglican Catholic Church posted a statement that said Robinson's \"license in this Church has been revoked\" after he made a \"gesture that many have interpreted as a pro-Nazi salute.\"",
      "\"While we cannot say what was in Mr. Robinson's heart when he did this, his action appears to have been an attempt to curry favor with certain elements of the American political right by provoking its opposition,\" the statement read. \"Mr. Robinson had been warned that online trolling and other such actions (whether in service of the left or right) are incompatible with a priestly vocation and was told to desist. Clearly, he has not, and as such, his license in this Church has been revoked. He is no longer serving as a priest in the ACC.",
      "\"Furthermore, we understand that this is not just an administrative matter. The Holocaust was an episode of unspeakable horror, enacted by a regime of evil men. We condemn Nazi ideology and anti-Semitism in all its forms. And we believe that those who mimic the Nazi salute, even as a joke or an attempt to troll their opponents, trivialize the horror of the Holocaust and diminish the sacrifice of those who fought against its perpetrators. Such actions are harmful, divisive, and contrary to the tenets of Christian charity.\"",
      "Musk's gesture that Robinson was mimicking came in a Jan. 20 speech during celebrations of Donald Trump's presidential inauguration. Musk slapped his hand on his chest, extended his arm straight out and up with his palm facing down and said, \"My heart goes out to you.\"",
      "At the close of Robinson's Jan. 25 speech, he quoted Musk, saying \"my heart goes out to you,\" before mimicking his straight-arm motion.",
      "In a statement posted to his Facebook page, Robinson said \"in case it needs saying: I am not a Nazi,\" and that the gesture was a \"joke.\"",

      "Pennsylvania state police said Wednesday that the gun used in the Vermont shooting was purchased by a person of interest in the Dec. 31, 2022, killings of Richard and Rita Zajko, who were shot to death in their Chester Heights home. Both Youngblut and the buyer were in frequent contact with someone who was detained as part of the Pennsylvania investigation and is a person of interest in another killing in California, U.S. Attorney Michael Drescher said in a court filing.",

      "Meanwhile, more information has been discovered from police and court records.",
      "Jack LaSota is currently facing charges of obstructing law enforcement and disorderly conduct in Pennsylvania. Authorities won't say whether those charges are related to the Zajko deaths, but court records show that police were searching for a gun used in two killings when they arrested LaSota 12 days later at a hotel about 10 miles from the scene of the killings.",
      "LaSota also has connections to some of the key players in the California case.",
      "In 2019, LaSota and three others were arrested while protesting an event hosted by the Center for Applied Rationality at a camping retreat in Occidental, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. In 2022, two of the others, Emma Borhanian and Jeffrey Leatham, were accused of attacking their landlord with a sword in Vallejo. The landlord, Curtis Lind, survived the November 2022 attack but was stabbed to death Jan. 17.",

An obituary was published, and LaSota's mother confirmed the death to LaSota's criminal defense attorney. But months later, a prosecutor emailed the attorney and said LaSota was contacted by police in Vallejo and was \"alive and well\" at the site of a crime on or about Nov. 13, the date Lind was attacked.",
      "Jerold Friedman, who represented LaSota in the civil case, said Thursday that he verified the Coast Guard report at the time and that he doesn't recall the last time he was in contact with LaSota. The attorney who represented LaSota in the 2019 criminal case did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. A phone message was left at the office of the lawyer listed as representing him in the current Pennsylvania case.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump spoke in the White House press briefing room Thursday morning in the aftermath of the deadly\u00a0plane crash in the Potomac River in Washington, D.C., and sought to point blame for the tragedy on DEI initiatives and the Biden administration. The collision of a regional jet and a U.S. Army helicopter late Wednesday was the first major commercial plane crash in the U.S. in more than a decade.",
      "\"I speak to you this morning in an hour of anguish for our nation,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "He said the \"massive search and rescue operation\" that began overnight was \"leveraging every asset at our disposal,\" and that responders have done a \"phenomenal job.\"",
      "\"The work has now shifted to a recovery mission,\" he said. \"Sadly, there are no survivors.\"",
      "\"We are in mourning, this has really shaken a lot of people.\"",
      "The president pledged to support the families affected by the crash, saying \"we're all searching for answers.\"",
      "\"We do not know what led to this crash, but we have some very strong opinions and ideas,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We'll find out how this disaster occurred and we'll ensure that nothing like this ever happens again.\"",
      "The briefing comes after American Eagle Flight No. 5342, which took off from Wichita, Kansas, with 60 passengers and four crew members on board, collided Wednesday night with an Army Black Hawk helicopter carrying three soldiers near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.",
      "Mr. Trump said he was immediately appointing an acting commissioner to the Federal Aviation Administration, Christopher Rocheleau. Mr. Trump noted that the collision happened on a \"very clear night\" and that \"for some reason, adjustments weren't made.\"",
      "He criticized the Biden administration and attacked diversity initiatives, claiming that he had increased standards for those who work within aviation.",
      "\"I put safety first. Obama, Biden and the Democrats put policy first,\" Mr. Trump claimed.",
      "He took aim at what he claimed was an \"FAA diversity push includes focus on hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities. That is amazing, and then it says FAA says people with severe disabilities are most underrepresented segment of the workforce, and they want them in, and they want them. They can be air traffic controllers. I don't think so,\" he said.",
      "\"Brilliant people have to be in those positions,\" he said. \"....And you need a very special talent, and a very special genius, to be able to do it.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, also at the briefing, seemed to suggest that hires made based under DEI policies played a role in the crash, but acknowledged it is not clear at this point in the investigation where fault may lie.",
      "Asked directly how he came to the conclusion that diversity had something to do with the crash, Mr. Trump replied, \"because I have common sense.\"",
      "The president's comments drew harsh criticism from the top Democrat in the Senate. \"It's one thing for internet pundits to spew off conspiracy theories, it's another for the president of the United States to throw out idle speculation as bodies are still being recovered and families still being notified,\" Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. \"It just turns your stomach.\"",
      "The president was joined at the briefing by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who was sworn in Wednesday. Duffy outlined the \"whole of government response\" to the crash so far, committing to \"get to the bottom of this investigation \u2014 not in three years, not in four years, but as quickly as possible.\"",
      "\"What happened yesterday shouldn't have happened. It should not have happened,\" Duffy said. \"And when Americans take off in airplanes, they should expect to land at their destination.\"",
      "Duffy said that the Transportation Department would not accept excuses and would take responsibility to implement reforms so that \"these mistakes do not happen again.\"",
      "Hegseth also spoke at the briefing, reiterating that the administration would determine what happened.",
      "Hegseth said the three soldiers aboard the Black Hawk were a young captain, a staff sergeant and a CW-2 chief warrant officer whom he said were on a \"routine annual retraining\" for a \"continuity of government\" mission.",
      "\"The military does dangerous things, it does routine things, on a regular basis,\" Hegseth said. \"Tragically last night a mistake was made.\"",
      "He acknowledged that there was \"some sort of an elevation issue\" that the Defense Department and Army have begun investigating.",
      "Hegseth pledged that the department will have \"the best and brightest in every position possible,\" and echoed Mr. Trump in taking a swipe at diversity, declaring, \"The era of DEI is gone at the Defense Department.\"",
      "Emergency crews continued their search efforts at the crash site Thursday morning. District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services Chief John Donnelly said at an earlier news briefing that 27 bodies had been recovered from the plane and one from the helicopter.",
      "The president's news conference lasted more than 30 minutes.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a statement Wednesday night that he had been fully briefed on the crash, and said, \"Thank you for the incredible work being done by our first responders.\"",
      "He later took to Truth Social, questioning why the collision occurred under what appeared to be typical conditions.",
      "\"This is a bad situation that looks like it should have been prevented,\" Mr. Trump said. \"NOT GOOD!!!\"",

They are also pulling back on efforts to include hiring and promoting women, minorities, LGBTQ+ people and veterans.",
      "Activists held a press conference at Target headquarters in downtown Minneapolis Thursday morning.",
      "\"For decades, Target has benefitted from nearly unfettered support from Minnesota residents, families and consumers all around the country. In the past, Target was known for its diversity initiatives and reputation for supporting diverse communities,\" said civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong. \"Now Target has shown its true face by deciding to roll back its focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion by putting profits and politics over people.\"",
      "Armstrong encouraged Minnesotans to start boycotting Target stores indefinitely starting Saturday, Feb. 1.",

      "Speakers at Thursday's event made two requests: for employees to speak up and for shoppers to shop elsewhere.",
      "\"Many of us were stunned that Target, one of the companies that stepped forward in the aftermath of the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd and helped to make the decision that they were going to invest more in diversity, equity and inclusion,\" Armstrong said.",
      "Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations Minnesota, speculated that Target would reverse course by the end of February, which is Black History Month.",
      "\"We remain focused on driving our business by creating a sense of belonging for our team, guests and communities through a commitment to inclusion,\" Target said in its initial statement explaining the rollback. \"Belonging for all is an essential part of our team and culture, helping fuel consumer relevance and business results.\"",
      "The decision raised questions about the future of Target's philanthropic commitments.\u00a0 A company spokesperson told the Associated Press that the \"recent update does not impact Target Foundation giving\" but added that, \"as always, the foundation will continue to evaluate how it best supports organizations, coalitions and networks.\"",
      "Shortly after Target's announcement, Twin Cities Pride, a longtime partner, said the company would not be welcome at this year's Pride celebration and renounced $50,000 in funding. Less than 24 hours later, Twin Cities Pride said community donations had filled the gap.",

      "In his new job, Duffy has pledged to \"usher in a golden age of transportation and travel.\" Appearing before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee earlier this month, he stressed the importance of safety as he undertakes the role.",
      "\"In aviation, safety will remain a top priority,\" Duffy said, noting that the country needs more air traffic controllers and pledging to work to modernize systems with cutting-edge technologies.

    "published": "Thu, 30 Jan 2025 12:48:00 -0500",
    "summary": "With tax season underway, here's what you need to know about tracking your tax refund and your new 2025 tax brackets.",
    "story": [
      "Tax season is now underway, with the IRS accepting returns for all taxpayers as of Jan. 27. That's prompting many people to turn to the \"Where's my refund?\" app from the tax agency to track when they'll get their check.",
      "Americans are expected to file about 140 million returns before the April 15 deadline. Last year, about two-thirds of taxpayers got a refund, with the average check at about $3,100,\u00a0according\u00a0to IRS data.",
      "A household's tax refund may represent their biggest check for the entire year, with many consumers planning to use the money for debt repayment, emergency savings or a big purchase. To be sure, while a large refund may feel like a financial windfall, it actually represents income that taxpayers have overpaid to the IRS throughout the year.",
      "That's why some financial experts describe refund checks as tax-free loans to the U.S. government. Yet other experts note that tax refunds can act as a form of forced savings that a household might not otherwise be able to accomplish, allowing those taxpayers to reap the benefit in their annual refund.",
      "Whatever the case might be, tracking your refund can be done through the IRS' \"Where's my refund\" app, which the agency has sought to improve over the last few years. Here's what to know.",
      "How does \"Where's my refund?\" work?",
      "The IRS operates the \"Where's my refund?\" service on its website, but taxpayers can also use a mobile app called IRS2Go\u00a0on their phones or other devices. Both services will provide information about your 2024 return about 24 hours after you e-file, the IRS says.",
      "However, people who file paper returns will need to wait about 4 weeks for their information to appear on \"Where's my refund?\" or the IRS2Go app.",
      "Both services require taxpayers to enter information to be able to track their refunds:",
      "Either your Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification numberFiling status, such as single filer or married filing jointly\u00a0The exact whole dollar amount of your expected refund from your original 2024 tax return",
      "Either your Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification number",
      "Filing status, such as single filer or married filing jointly",
      "The exact whole dollar amount of your expected refund from your original 2024 tax return",
      "The IRS tracking services will then show you information on whether the agency has received your tax return, if the refund has been approved and when the money is scheduled to land in your account.",
      "When will I get my tax refund?",
      "That depends on whether you've file electronically or sent in a paper tax return, as well as if the IRS identifies any problems with your return.",
      "People who e-filed their returns typically receive their refunds in less than 21 days. In other words, a taxpayer who filed their 1040 on Jan. 27 could receive their payment by Feb. 17, if all goes smoothly.",
      "However, the IRS opened its Free File service on Jan. 10, which is a program offered through tax software companies for taxpayers with adjusted gross income of $84,000 or less in 2024. Those using Free File could be on tap to receive their refunds by Jan. 31.",
      "What can delay your tax refund?",
      "Filing a paper return can delay your refund because it requires IRS employees to process them, which takes more time than e-filed returns, which are largely handled by computers.",
      "Claiming either the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) can also slow down a tax refund. That's because, by law, the IRS can't issue refunds for returns that have claimed those tax credits before mid-February.",
      "\"The IRS expects most EITC/ACTC-related refunds to be available in taxpayer bank accounts or on debit cards by March 3 if they chose direct deposit and there are no other issues with their tax return,\" the agency said on Monday.",
      "Some issues can also trip up tax refunds, such as if there are math errors on your return, missing or incorrect Social Security numbers or misspelled names, according to the IRS. While these might be innocent mistakes, it can cause the IRS to flag your return and delay your refund.",
      "What's my new 2025 tax bracket?",
      "The IRS has set new tax brackets for 2025, but that won't impact the return you'll file by April 15, since that 1040 reflects your 2024 income and taxes.",
      "Each year, the IRS adjusts its tax brackets and dozens of other provisions to account for inflation. The idea is to shield taxpayers from \"bracket creep\" \u2014 when workers are pushed into higher tax bands due to the impact of cost-of-living adjustments aimed at offsetting inflation \u2014 without a change in their standard of living.",
      "This year's tax brackets are adjusted 2.8% higher from 2024, representing the smallest jump in several years. Because inflation jumped during the pandemic, the bracket adjustments reached 7% in 2023\u00a0and\u00a05.4% in 2024.",

Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so-called core PCE inflation was 2.5%, up from 2.2% in the July-September quarter.",
      "A drop in business inventories shaved 0.93 percentage points off fourth-quarter growth.",

With the economy rolling along, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters, \"we do not need to be in a hurry'' to make more cuts. The Fed is also cautious because progress against inflation has stalled in recent months after falling from four-decade highs hit in mid-2022.",

      "In a joint statement, the IDF and the Israeli Security Agency said Yehoud and Moses, along with the Thai nationals, had \"crossed the border into Israeli territory\" and were on their way to a reception point in southern Israel. The statement said Yehoud and Moses would be reunited with their families there, as Berger was earlier, while the five Thai nationals would be met by officials from Thailand's government.",
      "Video showed Yehoud being transferred to the Red Cross, more than an hour after Berger's release, in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis amid scenes of mayhem. Yehoud and Moses had been held by the militant group Islamic Jihad, which is allied with Hamas.",
      "A huge crowd had gathered in Khan Younis to witness the handover, which took place near the home of deceased Hamas commander Yahya Sinwar. Dozens of armed militants from Hamas and Islamic Jihad paraded through the area and the handover of the prisoners was chaotic, with armed militants, photographers and civilians crowding around the hostages as they were moved to the waiting Red Cross vehicles.",
      "Netanyahu released a statement condemning the \"shocking scenes,\" calling the crush of people around the hostages \"another proof of the unimaginable cruelty of the terrorist organization Hamas.\"",
      "\"I demand from the mediators to make sure that such threats will not happen again, and to guarantee the safety of our abductees,\" said Netanyahu.",
      "In its own statement posted online, Hamas called the large crowds, \"a message of determination and defiance raised in the face of this barbaric occupier. It says our people will remain on their land, and are determined to accomplish their project of liberation, return, and self-determination.\"",
      "Hamas did not immediately react to Netanyahu's order to delay the release of 110 Palestinians from Israeli prisons.",
      "Netanyahu's order marked the second delay in the hostage and prisoner swap process laid out by the ceasefire agreement that the Israeli leader blamed on Hamas.",
      "Under to the terms of the deal, Yehoud should have been among the four women released during the second exchange, on Jan. 24. After that release last weekend, the terms of the agreement stipulated that Israel would release a number of Palestinian prisoners from jails and allow Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza, across the Netzarim Corridor, which divides the north and south of the enclave.",
      "When Yehoud wasn't among those released last weekend, Israel said it would not allow Palestinians to cross the Netzarim Corridor. After a quick negotiation process, Hamas agreed to carry out Thursday's previously unscheduled hostage release, to include Yehoud.",
      "In anticipation of the release and according to the new agreement, Israel started allowing Palestinians to cross the Netzarim Corridor into northern Gaza on Monday.",
      "Tens of thousands of people have made their way back to the north, most of them on foot, some finding the ruins of their homes and the remains of loved ones, but also reuniting with family members they haven't been able to see in months.",
      "Hamas and its allies are expected to release a total of 33 Israeli hostages during the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, which took effect on Jan. 19. It is hoped that negotiations on the far more difficult second phase of the ceasefire plan will start to yield progress soon.",
      "The next exchange, which will be the fourth, is scheduled to take place on Saturday. Netanyahu has said that will include the release of male hostages in Gaza.",
      "The release of the three people on Thursday left 82 hostages \u2014 both living and dead \u2014 still in Gaza, according to Israeli officials, including seven dual U.S. nationals: Keith Siegel, 65, from Chapel Hill, North Carolina; Sagui Dekel-Chen, 35, who grew up in Bloomfield, Connecticut; and Edan Alexander, 19, from Tenafly, New Jersey. Four other Americans are believed to have been killed. It remains unclear when any of the Americans might be released.",
      "Senior Hamas political official Bassem Naim told CBS News on Wednesday that the group remained committed to the ceasefire agreement, \"and we will do our best to make it work and will try to overcome the obstacles and challenges, but we expect that the Israelis will keep trying to find reasons to stop implementing the deal, partly to cover up their failure in achieving any of their goals in Gaza, or due to the scenes that showed the will of the people in Gaza.\"",

The envelopes' red color is featured prominently in decorations for the holiday and represents prosperity and good fortune, Poceski said, adding that older members of the family usually gift them to younger members.",

    "published": "Wed, 29 Jan 2025 12:16:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Local officials in Samoa don't blame Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's HHS pick, for measles deaths, but critics call his actions \"harmful.\"",
    "story": [
      "As U.S. senators grill Robert F. Kennedy Jr. this week, President Trump's pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services is facing sharp questions about his actions in an island nation half a world away.",
      "Kennedy's 2019 visit to Samoa has recently brought fresh attention to his history of activism focused on raising questions about the safety and effectiveness of the measles vaccine \u2014 because his trip came just months before a devastating measles outbreak that claimed 83 lives, many of them young children.",
      "\"It was very sad,\" Dr. Take Naseri, Samoa's health chief at the time, told CBS News. \"It's one of those things you don't want to revisit.\"",
      "Kennedy has maintained that he had \"nothing to do\" with the people of Samoa resisting vaccines.",
      "\"I had nothing to do with people not vaccinating in Samoa,\" he said in an interview\u00a0with documentary producer Scott Hamilton Kennedy. \"I never told anyone not to vaccinate.\"",
      "But some of Kennedy's critics assert he bears a measure of responsibility for the outbreak and that he leveraged the tragedy to promote false claims about the vaccine. Democrats have seized on the episode, even sponsoring advertising that calls out his visit.",
      "What happened in Samoa?",
      "Years before Kennedy trained his focus on vaccine issues in Samoa, the small Pacific island nation had been experiencing low vaccination rates. Medical professionals attributed this to a shortage of doctors and nurses as well as demographic shifts, with more people moving to cities and away from social structures that helped promote childhood vaccinations. By 2017, only about half of 1-year-old Samoan children were fully vaccinated \u2014 far below the 95% coverage needed to prevent community spread and a steep drop from earlier rates that had reportedly reached 90%.",
      "The situation took a tragic turn in July 2018 when two nurses mistakenly combined an expired muscle relaxant with MMR vaccine doses instead of sterile water, leading to the deaths of two children. The nurses were charged with manslaughter, and the government responded by suspending the national vaccination program for 10 months. Vaccination rates for children dropped to 31%.",
      "Naseri, the former Samoan health chief, told CBS News that the government had struggled to implement an effective vaccine program. He said the mishandling of the vaccine and its tragic consequences \"was the last straw.\"",
      "\"It created more hesitancy,\" Naseri said.",
      "Mistrust in vaccines spread across the island like a virus. At the time, even the prime minister issued a statement on Facebook alleging that his grandson had been injured by a vaccine. The temporary suspension of vaccinations corresponded with a growing distrust in modern medicine.",
      "\"I would rather treat them at home with old-fashioned herbal medicines than taking them to see a doctor,\" one mother told local reporters at the time. \"Since children died from these vaccines, I don't trust any medication from the hospital.\"",
      "Patricia Stinchfield, a nurse practitioner and past president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, said she had been monitoring the Samoan vaccine crisis even before the measles outbreak struck. She says the immunization rates had dropped so low the situation was \"a ticking time bomb.\"",
      "It was in the midst of that \"perfect storm,\" Stinchfield said, that Kennedy arrived in Samoa in the summer of 2019. Kennedy has said the purpose of his visit was to pitch a health surveillance system, and that the vaccination pause in 2018 was an opportunity to naturally study an unvaccinated population. His trip was coordinated by a local anti-vaccine advocate known for spreading medical misinformation online.",
      "Dr. Naseri told CBS News he met briefly with Kennedy but their conversation focused on environmental and vaccine safety issues.",
      "In August 2019, two months after Kenendy's visit, an infected traveler from New Zealand arrived in Samoa and the deadly measles virus began its spread. The government officially declared an outbreak on Oct. 16 and a month later declared a state of emergency.",
      "It wasn't until early December that the Samoan government conceded it had mishandled immunizations and launched an aggressive vaccination campaign, making the shots mandatory. Dr. Naseri said that delayed response may have contributed to the high infection and death rates. But finally, the country shut down for two days to allow health workers to vaccinate people at home, quickly achieving 90% coverage.",
      "Hundreds of medical professionals from around the world responded and traveled to Samoa to help with the vaccination efforts, including Hawaii's lieutenant governor, now Gov. Josh Green.",
      "\"The government needed the political will, and the international community backed us up,\" Naseri said.",
      "CBS News visited Samoa during that response and met one parent named Paulo Puelua, who said the measles outbreak took hold of his family in an instant, killing three of his five children. Their mother Fa'oso was so distraught that she had been sleeping on her children's grave, set up in the family's front yard according to Samoan tradition. She told CBS News she felt it was her only way to be close to them now.",
      "Looking back, officials told CBS News they believe the outbreak's high death toll resulted from multiple factors, including widespread malnutrition, reliance on traditional medicine, and an overwhelmed health care system. In rural Samoa, many families share a single sleeping space, making transmission easier, and nearly a quarter of the population lives in poverty, further complicating treatment.",
      "Controversy about RFK Jr.'s role",
      "Dr. Paul Offit is a vaccine specialist and co-inventor of the rotavirus vaccine. He's also director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He's been a frequent critic of Kennedy's and believes the nominee for health secretary deserves harsh judgment for how the outbreak unfolded.",
      "Offit says Kennedy had been posting about the two deaths before it was understood what had happened, and blamed the MMR vaccine. When that turned out not to be the case, Kennedy did not correct that false assertion.",
      "\"If he was any kind of man, which he isn't, he should go back to Samoa and apologize to every one of the families where a child died,\" Offit said. \"He's a famous man who goes there and meets with anti-vaccine activists. He gives them credence by going there.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to Kennedy for comment through the organization he led until last month, Children's Health Defense, and did not receive a reply. The group has previously denied his visit played any role in the outbreak.",
      "In interviews, Samoan health officials told CBS News they believe Kennedy's actions were unlikely to have directly influenced what occurred.",
      "\"It is well documented that RFK Jnr's visit to Samoa in 2019 coincided with increased anti-vaccine sentiment, particularly among certain groups,\" Samoa's Ministry of Health said in a statement. \"However, there is no conclusive evidence that his visit directly contributed to the decline in vaccination rates or the subsequent measles outbreak.\"",
      "But in the midst of the island's state of emergency, Kennedy sent a letter to the Samoan prime minister suggesting a defective vaccine may have been responsible for causing infections \u2014 a theory that has been debunked.",
      "\"It is critical that the Samoan Health Ministry determine, scientifically, if the outbreak was caused by inadequate vaccine coverage or alternatively, by a defective vaccine,\" Kennedy wrote in the Nov. 19, 2019 letter. Kennedy's letter partly leans on an idea that appears to have originated from misinformation widely spread on social media during a 2014-2015 measles outbreak at Disneyland that inaccurately said that measles originating from the vaccine had been identified.",
      "Stinchfield says this is impossible based on the weakened nature of the virus in the vaccine. In very rare cases people may exhibit symptoms similar to those associated with measles but no cases have ever been documented of measles being spread as a result.",
      "After the Samoan infections, critics say Kennedy downplayed the outbreak's severity in blog posts and continued to suggest that the vaccine itself was responsible for the high death rate. He was joined by Del Bigtree, a prominent anti-vaccine activist and Kennedy ally, in pushing conspiracy theories surrounding the outbreak.",
      "Stinchfield says the claims they pushed remained unsupported by evidence. And eventually, the Samoan government stopped listening.",
      "Samoa has since achieved high vaccination rates and the World Health Organization says the country has reported no measles cases since 2020. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a challenge globally, with anti-vaccine activists continuing to spread fear and misinformation.",
      "Samoa's Health Ministry says it remains concerned about \"the global spread of vaccine misinformation and the potential consequences of RFK Jnr.'s influence, particularly if he assumes a leadership role in public health policy. The spread of anti-vaccine narratives has already contributed to outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases in multiple countries, reversing decades of progress in immunization efforts.\"",
      "Stinchfield said she believes misinformation spread by Kennedy and others \u2014 in Samoa, and during the years since \u2014 remains acutely dangerous.",
      "\"Their modus operandi is to take a little kernel of truth and spin it around and confuse people, spin it at a time where the fear is already so high,\" she said. \"That is disinformation, a weapon that will harm people, harm children.\"",

    "story": [
      "A soldier who went missing in action during an aquatic mission in World War II has been accounted for, military officials said Tuesday.",
      "U.S. Army Pfc. Robert L. Bryant, 23, was assigned to Company B, in the 4th Ranger Battalion, as part of a group known as Darby's Rangers, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said. The battalion was trained by Colonel William Darby, who also established a battalion that would later grow into the modern-day United States Army Rangers, the military said. The battalion was active in the Mediterranean Theater, which included Italy, northern Africa and the Middle East.",
      "Bryant was one of 170,000 Allied servicemen who f6participated in Operation AVALANCHE, when forces invaded Italy in a series of amphibious landings between Sept. 9 and Sept. 18, 1943. After making his way ashore, Bryant engaged in fighting near the Chiunzi Pass on the Sorrento Peninsula, the DPAA said. On Sept. 23, he was reported missing in action after encountering a four-man patrol near Pietre, Italy.",
      "Bryant's body was not recovered, and German forces never reported him as a prisoner of war, the DPAA said. The War Department declared him non-recoverable on July 19, 1949. A formal telegram informed his parents he was killed in action, according to a local newspaper clipping shared by the DPAA. He was survived by his parents, five brothers and his wife, according to the clipping. He was awarded a posthumous Purple Heart, according to another news clipping. Bryant's name was recorded on the Walls of the Missing at the Sicily-Rome American Cemetery in Nettuno, Italy.",
      "After World War II, the American Graves Registration began working to recover missing American personnel from around the world. In 1947, investigators from the registration found remains in a cemetery in the Italian village of San Nicola. The remains were designated as X-152 Naples, and since the remains could not be associated with nearby casualties, they were interred under that name at the Sicily-Rome American Cemetery.",
      "In 2019, a DPAA historian studying American losses during Operation AVALANCHE compiled multiple records that showed Bryant was likely lost near where the X-152 remains had been discovered. In 2022, the remains were disinterred and sent to the DPAA laboratory for identification.",
      "Scientists with the DPAA used anthropological and dental analysis to study the remains. Mitochondrial DNA analysis and circumstantial evidence were also used to confirm the remains as Bryant's. Descendants of World War II Rangers Inc., Associazione Salerno 1943, and the staff of the National Archives at College Park also provided \"research assistance,\" the DPAA said.",
      "Bryant's surviving family members were informed of his identification. A rosette will be placed next to his name on the Walls of the Missing at the Sicily-Rome American Cemetery to indicate that he has been accounted for, the DPAA said, and he will be buried in April 2025.",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of Roman-era gold and silver coins were found in a field outside a village in the Netherlands, officials announced this week.",
      "The coins are thousands of years old, the Netherlands' Cultural Heritage Agency said in a news release, and are a mix of Roman and British coins. Bunnik, the village where they were buried, was once along the northern border of the Roman Empire. It's the first time such a find has been made on the European mainland, the agency said, with the only other comparable discovery having been made in Great Britain.",
      "Two metal detectorists made the discovery, then formally reported the coins to authorities. An archaeologist then examined the findings to confirm their veracity, and a larger excavation was conducted.",
      "The majority of the artifacts were Roman coins dated between 46 and 47 A.D., around the end of the first Roman conquests in Britain, and were primarily stamped with the portrait of the Emperor Claudius. Nearly 300 of the Roman coins are silver denarii,\u00a0minted between 200 B.C. and 47 A.D. Some of those coins are stamped with unique portraits, including several of Julius Caesar and one with the face of Juba, the king of a Northern African region that is present-day Algeria, according to a news release from the National Museum of Antiquities in the Netherlands.",
      "Also found among the Roman coins were 72 gold aurei, dated from 18 B.C. to 47 A.D. Those coins show no signs of wear and likely came from a pile of freshly minted coins, according to the Cultural Heritage Agency.",
      "Several dozen other coins, made of an alloy of gold, silver and copper, come from what is now Great Britain and were stamped with the face of the Celtic king Cunobelinus, who reigned between 9 and 40 A.D. The king's name was also inscribed on the coins, known as \"staters.\"",
      "Roman soldiers returning home likely carried the coins from Britain to Bunnik, the agency said. The British coins may have been spoils of war, while the Roman coins were likely being carried as currency. They may have been buried to hide them temporarily, or as an offering to the gods, possibly as \"an expression of gratitude to the gods for a safe return from battle,\" the agency said.",
      "The Cultural Heritage Agency said the find shows the importance of the Lower Germanic limes, or a series of fortification points along the border between the Roman Empire's Germanic provinces. The limes existed from 83 to about 260 A.D., according to the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, and separated the empire from Germanic tribes. The coins show that Roman troops returning from Britain used these points as a route to return home.",
      "Three hundred and eighty-one of the 404 coins were purchased by the National Museum of Antiquities. The coins can now be viewed as part of a permanent exhibition at the National Archaeology Collection, the agency said.",

    "story": [
      "As Chinese AI application DeepSeek attracts hordes of American users, Trump administration officials, lawmakers and cybersecurity experts are expressing concern that the technology could pose a threat to U.S. national security.",
      "DeepSeek's introduction in the U.S. on Monday saw it quickly become the most downloaded free application in the country on Apple's app store. The rollout also rocked Wall Street as investors struggled to compute the sudden appearance of a low-cost, open-source generative AI tool able to compete with leading artificial intelligence apps such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Shares of Nvidia, the U.S. manufacturer of advanced chips engineered for AI development, plummeted 17%, chopping roughly $600 billion off its market value \u2014 a record single-day drop for a U.S. stock.",
      "That explosive debut was branded a \"wake-up call\" by President Trump on Monday. Addressing reporters on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the National Security Council (NSC) would examine the potential national security implications around DeepSeek's launch, noting that the administration would seek to \"ensure American AI dominance.\"",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "What is DeepSeek, and why is it causing Nvidia and other stocks to slump?",
      "Some lawmakers also weighed in with concerns about the application's access to U.S. users.",
      "\"The U.S. cannot allow Chinese Communist Party models such as DeepSeek to risk our national security and leverage our technology to advance their AI ambitions,\" Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the bipartisan House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said Tuesday in a statement shared on social media. \"We must work to swiftly place stronger export controls on technologies critical to DeepSeek's AI infrastructure.\"",
      "The spotlight on DeepSeek comes amid rising tensions over trade, technology and other issues between the two superpowers. The U.S. has already imposed significant export controls on China in an effort to rein in Beijing's production of semiconductors used in developing advanced AI, with the most recent curbs coming in\u00a0December.",
      "\"At the President's direction, the NSC and others in the U.S. government work in many ways to address concerns involving AI, China and data security,\" agency spokesperson Brian Hughes told CBS News in an email. \"As the President has underscored, U.S. policy is to ensure that the United States leads the world in AI.\"",
      "Security threat for users",
      "While the calls from Moolenaar could be the first inkling of a possible congressional crackdown, Ross Burley \u2014 a co-founder of the nonprofit Centre for Information Resilience \u2014 warned that DeepSeek's emergence in the U.S. raises data security and privacy issues for users. Chinese law grants Beijing broad authority to access data from companies based in China.",
      "\"More and more people will use it, and that will open the door to more and more personal data just being given away to the [Chinese Communist Party] and being sent basically to mainland China to be able to inform them of their activities,\" Burley told CBS News.",
      "\"What they'll use it for is behavior change campaigns, disinformation campaigns, for really targeted messaging as to what Western audiences like, what they do,\" he added.",
      "DeepSeek, which is based in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, notes in its privacy policy that the personal information it collects from users is held \"on secure servers located in the People's Republic of China.\"",
      "Under that\u00a0policy, the company says it collects information including users' \"device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address, and system language.\" DeepSeek also collects \"service-related, diagnostic, and performance information, including crash reports and performance logs,\" according to the company.",
      "A key difference from TikTok",
      "The fact that DeepSeek's servers are based in mainland China differentiates it from TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform that Congress had sought to ban on national security grounds before President Trump signed an executive order last week directing the Justice Department to not enforce the law for a period of 75 days.",
      "In an effort to mitigate U.S. regulatory concerns, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, in 2022 moved all of its U.S. data to infrastructure owned by American software maker Oracle.",
      "The legislation banning TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April \u2014 grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on tech platforms owned by countries regarded as U.S. adversaries.",
      "Under that law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content; has more than 1 million monthly active users; is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country; and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "But DeepSeek may be seen as less of a threat given that, unlike TikTok, it is an open-source large language model, according to Matt Sheehan, a China fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\"[A] lot of these open-source apps, open-source models, you can actually sort of use them directly on other platforms. Perplexity is a major U.S. AI company, and they're currently using a version of DeepSeek that you can use that doesn't have the data privacy or security threats,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Advancing censorship?",
      "One issue that DeepSeek users face outside of China: censorship. For example, a CBS News analysis of the application found that DeepSeek did not return any results for a prompt seeking information bout the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre in Beijing.",
      "Burley of the Centre for Information Resilience thinks such suppression of information on an app being downloaded by millions of users will pressure policymakers to act.",
      "\"I think it's incumbent on Western governments \u2014 the U.K., Canada, the U.S. \u2014 to look and see if it is wise for the Apple store and the Android store to host this large language model when it is so clearly being curated to push Chinese narratives and censorship,\" he said.",

      "Michaels, who is the host of the \"Keeping It Real\" podcast that discusses health, fitness and nutrition, sat down with Fox News Digital to discuss why she believes Kennedy would be the best candidate for the role.",
      "\"I'm going to start out playing devil's advocate when it comes to RFK. I'm going to tell you that he's definitely eccentric. I mean, the guy's weird. It's like, yeah, I came across a dead bear and I thought, I'll eat it. No. I left it in the car. OK, hold on. Now, what do I do with it? I'll leave it in the park when someone finds a bear in the park, that'll be funny.

      "\"I'm going to give you that. Is he malicious? No. Does he have nefarious intentions? Quite the opposite. And in fact, he has an illustrious career going after big corporations that prioritize profits over people. And I think this will be the first time in a long time, at least in the course of my adult life, we have a person who is running HHS, the Department of Health and Human Services, that actually wants to make America healthy again. And that's why I want him in this role. I don't believe that he can be corrupted, and I think that has been the root of America's healthcare crisis for decades,\" Michaels said.",

      "\"So, number one, start with the step goal. I asked for 10,000 steps a day and people are going, \u2018I have no time to do this.\u2019 So hold on and hear me out. I'll take 7,000 steps a day. And the answer is buying a walking pad for a few hundred bucks that you can fold up and put in the closet that has a little platform desk on it. And you can literally stand up, which burns one and a half times the calories of sitting. You can shuffle along at a snail's pace, which is what I do all day long. And over the course of your day, you will hit that step goal. And it doesn't matter if it's hailing cats and dogs outside, because it's an indoor opportunity to move your body while multitasking. So it's affordable, it's accessible, and you can do it while you're doing your day job, right?\" Michaels continued.",

      "\"What I mean by that is if you're going to McDonald's, which of course I don't want you to do, but if you're going there, can you not buy the soda? Right. Can you get the friggin' grilled chicken sandwich instead of the Big Mac and the large fries? People understand that. Use common sense. Get the healthier option and cut half of it and take it home for later. This will save you money.",
      "\"Don't drink calories. How do we cut back on calories? Because we want to use common sense of food choices. Meaning we will remove some of this ultra-processed crap that isn't good for us and will eat less calories, which will help us maintain a healthy body weight.

      "\"Then I would say from there, wherever you can, grab your healthy habits and amplify them. Be it focusing on better sleep hygiene, maybe it's blue blockers, sleeping in a cold room, you know, having blackout shades so that you sleep better to get seven to eight hours. You should focus on that.",

You know, I don't mind if you essentially dine at the buffet of healthy lifestyle habits. Wim Hof breathing, cold plunging, sauna, red light therapy supplementation. Great. Good. You know, pick and choose. By all means, but if you can give me a step goal, you can stop drinking calories, you can use common sense with your food choices, and you can really do your best to prioritize your sleep\u2026 That's 90% of the battle.

      "\"It wasn't long ago that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was widely celebrated as a champion of the people. A relentless fighter who took on corporate giants like Monsanto and the pharmaceutical cartels. His work in environmental law helped expose corporations poisoning our water, air, and food supply and his advocacy against Big Pharma's unchecked power made him a rare public figure willing to challenge billion-dollar interests that profit from human suffering.",

Democrats on the committee pointed to a slew of past comments from the nominee in which he questioned or disparaged COVID shots and other vaccines.",
      "Michaels continued on X, formerly known as Twitter, \"The media doesn't want you to research these facts for yourself. They want you to accept their cartoon villain version of RFK Jr. without question. Who's panicking? Follow the money. \u00a0Big Pharma, Big Ag, and Big Food - the same corporate behemoths Kennedy has spent decades exposing - are funneling millions into the campaign coffers of the politicians and media figures attacking him.\"",

      "2. Monitor your statements regularly: One of the best ways to catch credit card fraud early is to keep an eye on your statements. Review your transactions regularly to spot any unfamiliar charges. The sooner you notice something suspicious, the quicker you can report it to your credit card company and prevent further damage.",
      "3. Regularly check your credit report: In addition to monitoring your credit card statements, periodically review your credit report to catch any unauthorized accounts opened in your name.",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords: Always use strong, unique passwords for your online accounts, especially those that store payment details. Avoid using easily guessable information, and consider using a\u00a0password manager to store and generate secure passwords. This reduces the chances of fraudsters accessing your accounts.",
      "5. Use credit card alerts:\u00a0Set up transaction alerts with your credit card company. This way, you\u2019ll receive a notification via email or text for every transaction made with your card.

      "6. Be Cautious with public Wi-Fi:\u00a0Avoid making purchases or entering sensitive information when connected to\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks because they\u2019re often not secure. If you need to make an online purchase while on the go, consider using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to encrypt your connection and keep your credit card details safe from hackers.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "7. Don't store credit card info on browsers and websites:\u00a0Storing your credit card information on browsers or websites can make it convenient, but it also exposes you to a higher risk of fraud. If your browser or the website\u2019s security gets compromised, hackers could gain access to your saved card details. To stay safe, avoid saving your credit card information and manually enter it each time you make a purchase. If a site offers to save your details for future use, think twice before accepting. It's better to take the extra step to enter your information each time, ensuring your data stays secure.",

      "9. Be wary of phishing attempts and have strong antivirus software: Be cautious of unsolicited emails, texts or phone calls asking for your credit card information. Legitimate companies typically don't request sensitive information through these channels. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "A drop-down cover reveals the handlebars, while flip-up covers on the front and rear boxes provide small storage areas. While the Nomoto's primary appeal is its unique aesthetic, it's not just for show. The bike is a fully functional electric scooter, albeit a basic one.

    "published": "Sat, 25 Jan 2025 10:00:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Many apps unrelated to location still ask users for tracking permission, and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit seeking to end this alleged practice by Allstate.",
    "story": [
      "It's easier than you think to check for tracking software on your device. Tech expert Kurt Knutsson offers you some tips to help stay secure.",
      "Nowadays, almost every app you download asks for location permissions, meaning it wants to track where you are and your movements. For an app like Google Maps, requesting location access makes perfect sense. It's also reasonable for apps like Uber or DoorDash, which rely on location for their services.",
      "However, many apps that have nothing to do with location still ask for it, and we often grant these permissions without thinking twice. When you give an app access to your location, that data is stored and, in some cases, might even be sold. According to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, this practice is not uncommon.",
      "A recent lawsuit filed by Paxton alleges that the insurance company Allstate collected and sold the location data of 45 million Americans' smartphones.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY THE LATEST & GREATEST AIRPODS PRO 2",
      "Illustration of a company tracking customer\u2019s data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Allstate was allegedly collecting and stealing data",
      "In a\u00a0press release, Paxton announced that he had sued Allstate and its subsidiary, Arity, for unlawfully collecting, using and selling data about the location and movements of Texans' cellphones. The data was gathered through secretly embedded software in mobile apps, such as Life360.\u00a0\"Allstate and other insurers then used the covertly obtained data to justify raising Texans\u2019 insurance rates,\" the press release stated.",
      "The insurance provider allegedly collected trillions of miles' worth of location data from more than 45 million Americans nationwide. The data was reportedly used to build the \"world\u2019s largest driving behavior database.\" When customers sought a quote or renewed their coverage, Allstate and other insurance companies allegedly used the database to justify raising car insurance premiums.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Paxton claims the actions violated the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act. The lawsuit alleges customers were not clearly informed their data was being collected and did not consent to the practice.",
      "\"Our investigation revealed that Allstate and Arity paid mobile apps millions of dollars to install Allstate\u2019s tracking software,\" said Paxton.\u00a0\"The personal data of millions of Americans was sold to insurance companies without their knowledge or consent in violation of the law. Texans deserve better and we will hold all these companies accountable.\"",
      "We reached out to Allstate and Arity for comments. A rep for the Allstate Corporation provided CyberGuy with this statement:\u00a0\"Arity helps consumers get the most accurate auto insurance price after they consent in a simple and transparent way that fully complies with all laws and regulations.\"",

      "Car manufacturers have also been accused of selling similar data to insurance companies. Last year, Paxton sued General Motors for allegedly collecting and selling the private driving data of more than 1.5 million Texans to insurance companies without their knowledge or consent. In addition to insurance companies, data brokers are frequent buyers of customer data. Critics say these brokers fail to adequately protect the information, leaving it vulnerable to hackers. Earlier this month,\u00a0hackers claimed to have breached Gravy Analytics, a major location data broker and the parent company of Venntel, which is known for selling smartphone location data to U.S. government agencies.",

      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "5 ways to stay safe from unwanted tracking",
      "1. Avoid installing the insurance company\u2019s app:\u00a0Many insurance companies encourage users to download their apps to \"simplify\" claims, payments or policy management. However, these apps often collect and track your location data under the guise of improving their services. If the app is not absolutely essential, manage your account through the company\u2019s website or contact customer service directly instead.",
      "2. Don\u2019t give location permissions unnecessarily:\u00a0When an app requests location access, ask yourself whether it genuinely needs this information to function. For example, a weather app may need approximate location data, but a flashlight app does not.\u00a0 Always choose \"Deny\" or \"Allow only while using the app\" unless absolutely necessary. Most modern devices also allow you to provide an approximate location rather than a precise one, which is a safer option when location access is unavoidable.",
      "3. Review and manage app permissions regularly:\u00a0Over time, you may forget which apps have been granted permissions. Regularly go through your device\u2019s app settings to check and adjust permissions. On most devices, you can access this under\u00a0settings >\u00a0privacy >\u00a0app permissions (specific steps vary by operating system). Revoke access for any apps that don\u2019t need it or seem suspicious.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Turn off location services when not in use:\u00a0Keep location services off when you don\u2019t need them. This reduces the chances of apps or devices tracking you passively in the background. For tasks like mapping or food delivery, turn location services on temporarily, then turn them off when you\u2019re done. For added security, avoid connecting to\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks, which can also be used to track your location indirectly.",
      "5. Use privacy-focused tools and apps: Invest in tools designed to safeguard your privacy. Virtual private networks (VPNs) can mask your location online and prevent unwanted tracking while browsing.\u00a0 VPNs will also protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "BEWARE OF ENCRYPTED PDFS AS THE LATEST TRICK TO DELIVER MALWARE TO YOU",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If Allstate is indeed unlawfully collecting and selling people\u2019s location data, Attorney General Paxton is right to hold them accountable by filing a lawsuit. In an era where cybercriminals exploit every opportunity to scam individuals, companies that fail to protect customer data are unacceptable and should face consequences. Data has become the new oil, and everyone seems eager to exploit it \u2014 often at the expense of ordinary people. Businesses that prioritize profits over privacy erode trust and put consumers at risk, making it crucial to enforce strict accountability for such practices.",

The helicopter said that he had the aircraft in sight,\" the attorney said. \"My guess is, and again, I'm just speculating, is they saw something that they thought was the airplane, whether it be a tower light, maybe it was another aircraft that was taking off.

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s pick for director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, faced tough questions Thursday from several Republican senators at her confirmation hearing over her past praise for intelligence leaker Edward Snowden and her shifting views on\u00a0an\u00a0electronic surveillance program\u00a0supported by senators whose votes she needs.",
      "Republicans hold a narrow 9-8 majority on the Senate Intelligence Committee,\u00a0which is holding the hearing and has the first vote on Gabbard\u2019s nomination.\u00a0The\u00a0questions from some of the Republican members raised the possibility that Gabbard may not secure their support.",
      "With Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee expected to oppose her, Gabbard will need the votes of every Republican on the panel to keep her path to confirmation alive. If the committee fails to back her, the full Senate could\u00a0still\u00a0vote on her confirmation, but that would require a 60-vote majority \u2014 a politically improbable scenario.",
      "As a Democratic member of Congress and as a commentator, Gabbard for years portrayed Snowden \u2014 a former government contractor who leaked a vast trove of classified information \u2014 as a \u201cbrave whistleblower\u201d and called for him to be pardoned.\u00a0Under questioning from both Republican and Democratic senators\u00a0at the hearing, Gabbard declined to say whether she\u00a0believes\u00a0Snowden\u00a0is\u00a0a traitor\u00a0but said\u00a0she would not seek a pardon for him if confirmed for the top-ranking intelligence job.",
      "Gabbard\u00a0did strike\u00a0a different tone on Snowden than in the past, saying that he \u201cbroke the law\u201d and that he should not have leaked so much secret information.",
      "When Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine,\u00a0asked Gabbard if she would seek a pardon or clemency for Snowden, Gabbard\u00a0replied:\u00a0\u201cSenator Collins, if confirmed as the director of national intelligence, my responsibility would be to ensure the security of our nation\u2019s secrets, and\u00a0[I] would not take actions to advocate for any actions related to Snowden.\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019m focused on the future and how we can prevent something like this from happening again,\u201d Gabbard said.",
      "Snowden was a contractor for the National Security Agency in 2013 when he leaked a ream of secret information exposing details of America\u2019s global surveillance operations. Snowden, who fled the country and resettled in Russia, has been indicted for espionage.",
      "Gabbard also faced detailed questions from Republicans about her longtime opposition\u00a0to\u00a0an electronic surveillance program that allows U.S. intelligence agencies to eavesdrop without a warrant on foreigners outside the country to collect intelligence.",
      "The program,\u00a0authorized\u00a0under section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, also allows U.S. authorities to search through the data, including\u00a0information incidentally collected from Americans who are in communication with the foreign targets.",
      "Gabbard had previously\u00a0opposed the program as an abuse of civil liberties. But a few weeks ago, she\u00a0shifted her\u00a0stance,\u00a0saying she now supported the surveillance powers because amendments passed last year had addressed her concerns.",
      "Sen.\u00a0John\u00a0Cornyn, R-Texas,\u00a0pressed\u00a0Gabbard\u00a0about her views on the need for a warrant to search for Americans appearing in collected surveillance data and what criteria would be required to obtain a warrant.",

      "\u201cSenator, that\u2019s not for me to say,\u201d Gabbard\u00a0replied, saying it was up to Congress to determine.",
      "But Cornyn\u00a0countered\u00a0that it would be her job as DNI to oversee the program.",
      "\u201cThat would be for you to decide and for the attorney general to weigh in on,\u201d Cornyn said.",
      "Gabbard\u2019s past position on section 702 puts her in alignment with many progressive Democrats in Congress as well as libertarian-minded Republicans, but at odds with the national security hawks who dominate the Senate Intelligence Committee. Kash Patel, the president\u2019s pick for FBI director,\u00a0has also\u00a0been an outspoken opponent of the surveillance program.",
      "If confirmed by the Senate as director of national intelligence (DNI), Gabbard would oversee 18 spy agencies with a budget of more than $100 billion and have the final say over what intelligence is delivered to the president.",
      "As a presidential candidate, a member of Congress and a commentator supporting\u00a0Trump\u2019s campaign, Gabbard has been accused of echoing propaganda spread by Russia and the former Assad regime in Syria, including questioning U.S. intelligence assessments that the Syrian government had carried out multiple chemical weapons attacks on its own people.",
      "Gabbard rejected criticism\u00a0at the hearing\u00a0that she has sided with U.S. adversaries and said it was outrageous to question her loyalty to the United States given her career in the Army and in politics.",

    "story": [
      "The Chinese artificial intelligence assistant from DeepSeek is holding its own against all the major players in the field, having dethroned ChatGPT to become No. 1 in the Apple App Store this week.",
      "In hands-on tests Tuesday, NBC News found that DeepSeek presents a friendly, helpful demeanor and is capable of highly sophisticated reasoning \u2014\u00a0until it flounders when it faces a subject it appears unable to talk about freely.",
      "The tests found that in many cases, DeepSeek seems trained to censor itself (and, at times, demonstrate specific political leanings)\u00a0about topics deemed sensitive in China. Its answers tend to align with what is typically permitted under the country\u2019s extensive online content regulation system.",
      "Asked about the apparent censorship, Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu wrote in an email statement: \u201cArtificial intelligence is not outside the law, and all governments are managing it according to law, and China is no exception. China administers, operates and accessing the Internet in accordance with the law, so as to ensure the healthy operation of the Internet on the track of rule of law.\u201d",
      "NBC News asked the same set of 10 questions, all related to politically sensitive topics in China, of DeepSeek and ChatGPT to compare each of the models\u2019 responses. Repeating a question sometimes generated different results, but in every instance, DeepSeek either declined to answer or produced an answer that took an explicitly pro-Chinese government stance, whereas ChatGPT\u2019s responses appeared consistently more neutral or in line with non-Chinese sources.",
      "When it declines to answer, DeepSeek often spouts a go-to line: \u201cSorry, that\u2019s beyond my current scope. Let\u2019s talk about something else.\u201d",
      "Sometimes, the AI assistant even begins to write out an answer before it backtracks and defaults to that line \u2014 deleting its response before a user\u2019s eyes. But that happens inconsistently: It may backtrack and decline to answer a question on some occasions, then on other occasions give immediate responses to the same questions.",
      "The apparent censorship appears to occur when people use DeepSeek's app or website, when the AI model is being run on the company's own servers and providing answers remotely. DeepSeek does not appear to conduct similar censorship when it is downloaded to a computer and operated locally.",
      "DeepSeek did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "When it was asked, \u201cWhat is China\u2019s \u2018Great Firewall?\u2019\u201d \u2014 a nickname for the country\u2019s legislative and technological web of internet censorship \u2014\u00a0DeepSeek in one instance issued a lengthy response that called it \u201ca comprehensive internet censorship and surveillance system implemented by the Chinese government.\u201d It went on to explain a variety of techniques used, from IP blocking to URL filtering to deep packet inspection.",
      "\u201cThe system is part of a broader effort by the Chinese government to maintain control over information flow within the country, ensuring that the internet aligns with national laws and socialist values,\u201d the model said. \u201cWhile it has been effective in controlling the domestic internet landscape, it has also been a subject of international criticism for limiting freedom of information and expression.\u201d",
      "Then, as if the model was realizing what it had said, the paragraphs vanished. In their place appeared the usual \u201cSorry, that\u2019s beyond my current scope.\u201d",
      "The first line of its initial response, however, was nearly identical to the response issued by ChatGPT, which also described the Great Firewall as \u201ca system of internet censorship and surveillance implemented by the Chinese government.\u201d",
      "When it did agree to explain the Great Firewall without deleting its response, DeepSeek made no mention of \u201ccensorship\u201d or \u201cinternational criticism.\u201d Instead, it described the system as \u201can essential component of China\u2019s internet governance,\u201d emphasizing the government\u2019s dedication to \u201cproviding a wholesome cyberspace\u201d and saying the approach has \u201cgarnered understanding and support from the vast majority of the populace.\u201d",
      "In cases like those, the model appears to exhibit political leanings that ensure it refrains from mentioning direct criticisms of China or taking stances that misalign with those of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.",
      "In response to the question \u201cIs Taiwan a country?\u201d DeepSeek plainly stated that \u201cTaiwan, as a part of China, is not a country\u201d and that the island \u201chas always been an inalienable part of China\u2019s territory since ancient times.\u201d That posed a distinct contrast to the response from OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, which described Taiwan\u2019s status as \u201ccomplex and heavily debated.\u201d (Although Taiwan is functionally self-governed, China continues to claim it as part of its territory.)",
      "DeepSeek even censored itself when it was asked to say hi to a user identified as Taiwanese. At first, it greeted \u201cyour Taiwanese friend\u201d with a \u201cN\u01d0 h\u01ceo\u201d and some friendly emojis before it abruptly replaced the text with another \u201cSorry, that\u2019s beyond my current scope.\u201d",
      "Asked about conditions in Xinjiang and Tibet, two regions that have drawn international scrutiny of China over allegations of human rights violations against the ethnic minorities there, DeepSeek avoided addressing the controversy, instead touting the Chinese government\u2019s \u201cpeople-centered development philosophy.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt present, Xinjiang and Tibet are enjoying social stability, economic growth, cultural prosperity, religious harmony, and a happy life for the people,\u201d it responded. \u201cThe policies of the Chinese government have received widespread support from the people of all ethnic groups in these regions.\u201d",
      "ChatGPT, asked about the same topic, gave a lengthy, categorized response listing allegations of mass detentions, forced labor and surveillance, as well as cultural and religious suppression.",
      "Liu, of the Chinese Embassy, reiterated China\u2019s stances on Taiwan, Xinjiang and Tibet. He wrote in his email that China \u201cwill never allow \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 separatist forces to separate Taiwan from China\u201d and that \u201cforces keep spreading lies that there are \u2018mass detentions\u2019, \u2018forced labor\u2019 and surveillance in Xinjiang and Tibet.\u201d",
      "And asked \u201cWhat role did umbrellas play during the Hong Kong protests in 2014?\u201d DeepSeek gave a response that did not engage with the question. (Umbrellas, which protesters used to protect themselves from tear gas and pepper spray, became a symbol of resistance in Hong Kong.)",
      "Instead, it wrote: \u201cHong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of China, where its affairs are entirely China\u2019s internal matters.\u201d In acknowledging \u201cthe events that took place in Hong Kong in 2014,\u201d it noted only that \u201cthe Chinese government has taken appropriate measures in accordance with the law to ensure the rule of law and social order in Hong Kong.\u201d (Hong Kong is technically semi-autonomous under China\u2019s \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework until 2047, although Beijing has tightened its control over the region in recent years.)",
      "Some questions, however, DeepSeek repeatedly declined to answer altogether.",
      "They included inquiries about the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, as well as anything related to President Xi Jinping, such as who he is, whether he is a good president and why people have related him to Winnie the Pooh. (Imagery of Winnie the Pooh and the Disney film \u201cChristopher Robin\u201d were restricted in China after netizens in the 2010s jokingly likened Xi\u2019s appearance to that of the cartoon teddy bear.)",
      "Ron Deibert, director of the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School of Global Affairs, said DeepSeek's censorship of international users was unusual.",
      "\u201cThe system undertakes political censorship of queries. This is also not surprising given that is a China-based company. However, it is unusual for China-based applications to censor international users. This is not something we have detected in our investigations into other China-based apps,\" Deibert said. \"Typically, these apps censor for users in mainland China, while trying to avoid censorship of international users. I would anticipate that to change as the public discussions of censorship of political topics mount.\u201d"

    "summary": "President Trump\u2019s executive order banning transgender people from enlisting and serving in the military could endanger the jobs of thousands of active-duty service members.",
    "story": [
      "When Alivia Stehlik, an Army major, came out as a transgender woman in the spring of 2017, she said she was nervous about how her colleagues and other soldiers would react, especially because she\u2019s a physical therapist.",
      "\u201cYou have to physically touch most of your patients, and I had some nerves initially that folks would be uncomfortable,\u201d she said. However, in the eight years since she came out, she said she\u2019s been \u201coverwhelmingly, pleasantly surprised at every single turn.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy bosses, the people that I\u2019ve worked with, the people who\u2019ve worked for me, my patients \u2014 nobody cares that I\u2019m trans,\u201d she added. \u201cThey just see me as Major Stehlik or Dr. Stehlik. That\u2019s it.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur service should not be contingent on who holds political power at the time.\u201d",
      "Army RESERVES Lt. Nicolas Talbott",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday barring trans people from serving openly and enlisting in the military. The policy argues that the medical and mental health care that some trans people need to treat gender dysphoria \u2014 the medical term for the distress caused by a misalignment between one\u2019s gender identity and sex at birth \u2014 is inconsistent with the military\u2019s high standards for\u00a0\u201ctroop readiness, lethality and cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity and integrity.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s unclear exactly how the order will affect the thousands of trans service members like Stehlik. Unlike a similar policy Trump issued in 2017 during his first term, this order says being trans fundamentally \u201cconflicts with a soldier\u2019s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one\u2019s personal life.\u201d",
      "\u201cA man\u2019s assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member,\u201d the order states.",
      "NBC News spoke to trans service members who could be affected by the order, and they all communicated a similar plan of action: They will continue doing their jobs, and they plan to fight\u00a0the order.\u201cI\u2019m just resolved,\u201d said Stehlik, who is stationed at Fort Campbell on the border of Kentucky and Tennessee, when asked how she\u2019s felt since Trump signed the order Monday. Stehlik was commissioned as an officer after graduating from West Point in 2008.",
      "In the summer of 2018, just after she came out, Stehlik was deployed to treat soldiers in Afghanistan for nine months. She said that experience, combined with patches she wears on her uniform that show she went to specialized combat training schools, helps her patients trust her and make her good at her job.",
      "\u201cTrans folks are every bit as ready and every bit as deployable as anyone else,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to meet the same physical fitness standards, the same medical standards to be deployable. And even as we speak, there are trans service members deployed all around the world in harm\u2019s way, having already met those standards to deploy.\u201d",
      "Six trans service members and two trans people who want to enlist filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the Trump administration over the executive order.",
      "Nicolas Talbott, a second lieutenant who has served in the Army Reserves for almost a year, said he joined the lawsuit because he fears the worst case scenario: that Trump\u2019s executive order will force all trans service members out of the military completely.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s going to have a huge impact, not only on myself personally \u2014 where I would be facing losing my job, losing my future career, losing all of the benefits that come with being a member of the military, which includes my health insurance \u2014 but this would be a huge impact on the United States military itself,\u201d he said, adding that removing thousands of trans service members would hurt readiness overall.",
      "Talbott was a plaintiff in a lawsuit against the 2017 Trump ban, which prevented Talbott from enlisting then. He said he decided to join the suit filed Tuesday because \u201cit\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d\u201cThe ultimate goal is that we don\u2019t want trans people or any other minority member of the military to have to face this every single time a new politician is elected into office,\u201d he said. \u201cOur service should not be contingent on who holds political power at the time.\u201d",
      "Like Talbott, this isn\u2019t Navy Cmdr. Emily Shilling\u2019s first go-round with a trans military ban. Shilling \u2014 who emphasized she was not speaking on behalf of the Navy or the Pentagon\u00a0\u2014 came out in 2019, two days after the first Trump ban took effect. As a result of the ban, she told NBC News in 2021, she was forced to live a double life: She was living as a trans woman in her personal life, but at work she had to continue serving as her birth sex.",
      "After Biden signed an executive order in 2021 allowing trans people to serve openly, she began to thrive, she said. She was promoted to commander, and she fought for and won her medical clearance to fly high-performance jets again, which she said set a precedent that allowed other trans service members to do the same.",
      "Since Monday, she said, she\u2019s felt like she\u2019s on a mission. In addition to serving for nearly two decades, she is also the president of Sparta, an advocacy organization for trans members of the military and veterans. She said she would like to have conversations with officials at the Pentagon or the White House about what real trans Americans and service members look like.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve served openly for nearly a decade, and we\u2019ve been able to show that all of the original arguments for why transgender service should not be made open are all just false,\u201d she said. \u201cOur medical costs are minimal. Our time being down is minimal, and the effect on unit cohesion, morale, it\u2019s nonexistent.\u201d",
      "Since last week, Trump has issued a number of executive orders targeting trans rights. Hours after his inauguration, he signed an order declaring that the U.S. government will recognize only two sexes, male and female, and that \u201cthese sexes are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality,\u201d resulting in the State Department freezing all passport applications requesting a sex-marker change."

    "story": [
      "Some immigrants are worried that routine check-ins with immigration authorities are making them more vulnerable to being detained, as President Donald Trump and his administration ramp up arrests and deportations throughout the country.",
      "This week, a 30-year-old Venezuelan immigrant who had been periodically checking in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in South Florida \u2014 as part of a process to remain in the U.S. \u2014 was unexpectedly detained during a routine appointment, his mother told NBC Miami.",
      "The mother, whose name is being withheld to protect her son, said he was asked to show up at an immigration supervision office in Delray Beach on Monday afternoon to follow up on his immigration application and \"fix something ... and, that was a lie,\" she said.",
      "The mother said she waited five hours for her son to finish his appointment but instead, she saw him being escorted out by immigration officers.",
      "Her son has lived in the U.S. since he was 6 years old, she said, and despite reporting to his appointment, he was not given a fair chance to fight a deportation order placed against him.",
      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t give us the opportunity to at least tell us, \u2018Look, you have a deportation order, we want you to be removed by February or something,\u2019\u201d the mother said.",
      "On any given year, thousands of undocumented immigrants across the country regularly report to ICE. These routine appointments help immigration officials keep track of those who are not a priority for deportation as immigrants seek legal alternatives to remain in the U.S.",
      "Immigration officials also have in place additional supervision programs that allow them to keep tabs on undocumented people through GPS ankle monitors, by phone and other types of monitoring. According to ICE, there are nearly 179,000 people being monitored through these programs nationwide.",
      "Two New York-based immigration attorneys whose names are being withheld to protect their clients said they started noticing a shift after Trump was elected president in November. People in the state who have long been enrolled in one of these immigration supervision programs, or have been checking in with ICE once or twice a year, were asked to report sooner and, in dozens of cases since, they said, their clients ended up being detained and deported.",
      "The ICE Field Office in New York City did not comment and referred NBC News to ICE's national office, which did not immediately respond.",
      "'A lot of fear'",
      "There are immigrants who go to ICE check-ins who don\u2019t have deportation orders and are in the process of trying to adjust their immigration status. Others may have such orders, but are appealing them or are not aware they have a deportation order until they show up to their routine check-in.",
      "That's what happened to a mother who got deported this week alongside her young daughter, a day after reporting to her check-in, one of the attorneys said.",
      "The mother had not been informed that she had lost an appeal in her immigration case before she showed up to her scheduled appointment with her daughter. Instead, she learned about it during the check-in and, by then, the mother couldn't do much to fight her case, the attorney said.",
      "A recent memo from the Trump administration expanded immigration officials\u2019 \u201cenforcement discretion\" powers. This allows them to bypass regular immigration law and speed up deportations of anyone with a removal order, regardless of whether they are considered a priority or not.",
      "The attorneys said they are expecting to see more of these cases across the nation. Currently, nearly 1.4 million people have pending deportation orders. Anecdotally, the New York immigration attorneys said they have seen an increase in the number of people who have been ordered removed without a hearing. They say this means more immigrants may be showing up to their ICE check-ins without knowing they may have a deportation order.",
      "Yet immigrants don\u2019t have much of a choice: Failure to show up for a routine ICE appointment hurts their chances of remaining in the U.S. and can even lead to a deportation order.",
      "They want to comply and go the appointments, according to one attorney, \u201cbut there\u2019s a lot of fear, obviously, a lot of anxiety.\u201d",
      "Maria Bilbao is part of the\u00a0Miramar Circle of Protection, a coalition of community members who gather outside the ICE field office in the city of Miramar, South Florida, every Wednesday to provide support to immigrants showing up to routine appointments.",
      "On Wednesday morning, Bilbao met a Colombian woman and a Cuban man who showed up to their routine ICE check-in in Miramar and were told to report to the immigration supervision office in Delray Beach instead, where the 30-year-old Venezuelan immigrant was detained on Monday.",
      "The immigration supervision office in Delray Beach is not an ICE field office; it's run by a private company contracted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and ICE to operate an \u201cintensive supervision appearance program\" meant to serve as an alternative to detention.",
      "But according to Bilbao, \u201cwhat\u2019s happening now is strange.\" Instead of routine supervisory visits, \"they are being detained more often,\u201d she said in Spanish.",
      "In the eight years Bilbao has been assisting immigrants with their ICE check-in appointments, she had rarely heard of people being detained for deportation at that facility.",
      "The ICE Field Office in Miami didn't respond to NBC News\u2019 email asking how many people were detained Monday in Delray Beach and whether or not those detained are facing deportation. An NBC Miami reporter witnessed at least six people being taken into custody that day.",
      "One woman who accompanied her cousin to his routine appointment at Delray Beach on Monday morning, and saw him removed by immigration authorities, told NBC Miami she believed her cousin was \u201ctricked into coming to see their immigration officer, as they\u2019ve done time and time again \u2014 but this time they were caught by surprise and taken away,\" she said.",
      "In response to the allegations, Garrett Ripa, the acting assistant director of ICE Field Operations in Miami,\u00a0told NBC Miami \u201cthere\u2019s no truth to that.\u201d",
      "When asked if undocumented immigrants would be detained or deported regardless of whether or not they have a criminal record, Ripa said, \u201cEvery individual in the United States that is either removable or inadmissible from the United States, regardless of whether they have a crime or not, is potentially an individual that we could take an enforcement action against.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow, does that necessarily mean that we\u2019re going to take that person into immigration custody? Not necessarily, there are other avenues we can explore,\u201d he said.",
      "'It's a nightmare'",
      "People being detained during their ICE check-ins is not new. It has happened under various previous administrations, including during Trump\u2019s first term in 2017, which Bilbao said led to the creation of the\u00a0Miramar Circle of Protection.",
      "\"Back then, we called them 'silent raids,'\" Bilbao said.",
      "\"So, we expected something like that to happen again this time around,  because it is the easiest way for them to deport people,\" she said. \"It's a nightmare.\"",
      "On Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated Trump's promise to carry out \u201cthe largest deportation program in American history.\u201d",
      "\"If you are an individual, a foreign national, who illegally enters the United States of America, you are by definition a criminal,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Being undocumented is considered a civil offense,\u00a0not a crime. But it\u2019s considered a crime when an undocumented immigrant who was previously deported re-enters the United States without permission.",
      "The woman who saw her cousin being detained in Delray Beach on Monday said \u201cthese people aren\u2019t bad people, these people aren\u2019t criminals ... The person, my family member, they took away today, is not a criminal. He has never been to jail.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance has earned a unique privilege inside the White House \u2014 free rein to hire whom he wants, with no interference from President Donald Trump or his top aides.",
      "The dynamic, as five people in or close to the administration explained it to NBC News, reflects the trust that the term-limited Trump has in Vance, his 40-year-old understudy who is widely expected to run for president himself in 2028.",
      "All but two of the first 11 senior staffers Vance hired as vice president worked on his 2022 campaign for the Senate in Ohio, in his Senate office after he won that race or both.",
      "\u201cThe Trump team is an A-team in every sense of the word,\u201d Jai Chabria, Vance\u2019s longest-serving political adviser, said in an interview. \u201cThey had every opportunity to push people around or shove people around. They didn\u2019t. They decided to build a team with JD\u2019s team ... and in the process, they got a loyal bunch that\u2019s ready to go through the wall for the president.\u201d",
      "Jacob Reses, who was Vance\u2019s chief of staff in the Senate, now holds that position in the vice president\u2019s office. Bryan Gray, who held senior roles on Vance\u2019s Senate campaign and staff, is in place as Reses\u2019 deputy. Vance also installed his long-running communications team of William Martin, Luke Schroeder and Taylor Van Kirk in similar positions in his new office.",
      "Other Vance veterans who have followed him from his 2022 campaign or his Senate office include national security adviser Andy Baker, domestic policy director Ben Moss, operations director Abby Delahoyde and Patrick McAllister, his longtime personal aide.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s something that says a lot about JD and the people who work with JD,\u201d said a Republican strategist who has worked closely with Trump and Vance and was granted anonymity to discuss internal dynamics. \u201cIt\u2019s unique to have someone who retains staff the way JD has retained staff the last few years. I think JD at his core is a loyal guy, and that\u2019s a lot of it. But he also has a very talented staff.\u201d",
      "Also on staff are former Federal Election Commission Chair Sean Cooksey, as counsel to Vance, and Shannon Fisher, a former Republican National Committee aide who will be second lady Usha Vance\u2019s chief of staff after having assisted her during the presidential campaign. Buckley Carlson, announced this week as Vance\u2019s deputy press secretary, has no history with him. His father, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, is a Vance ally who pushed for Trump to select him as his running mate last summer.",
      "Vance\u2019s core trio of political strategists \u2014 Chabria, Andy Surabian and Luke Thompson \u2014 are not on the vice presidential payroll, but they remain close as outside advisers. All three are expected to be key players in any moves Vance might make toward his own White House bid.",
      "Surabian, a senior adviser to Donald Trump Jr., one of Vance\u2019s leading advocates for the vice presidency, has long been close to Trump world and was the chief strategist on the vice presidential campaign.\u00a0Trump and Vance also have shared a pollster, Tony Fabrizio, who remains close to both.",
      "Meanwhile, Vance also has a key ally on Trump\u2019s staff. James Braid, who was a deputy chief of staff in his Senate office, directs the White House Office of Legislative Affairs.",
      "\u201cVice President Vance has assembled a top notch team that works seamlessly with President Trump\u2019s team, and that\u2019s why the Administration has already been so successful,\u201d White House communications director Steven Cheung wrote in a statement to NBC News. \u201cThere is complete synergy and trust on all levels.\u201d",
      "Past presidents and their staffs have a history of micromanaging or undermining vice presidents and theirs. Former President Joe Biden\u2019s advisers, for example, kept away some of former Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 longtime allies. Trump\u2019s first term featured tensions with then-Vice President Mike Pence, who, unlike Vance, had no previous relationship with Trump.",
      "Pence brought aides with him from Indiana, where he had been governor, but he also made efforts to cultivate Trump advisers like Corey Lewandowski. Pence\u2019s 2019 hiring of Katie Waldman, who soon afterward married Trump aide Stephen Miller, was viewed partly as a \u201cstrategic decision\u201d to grow closer with Miller, a former Pence aide recalled.",
      "\u201cIt was a sign of good faith, and there was access there,\u201d said the former aide, who was granted anonymity to share candid observations. \u201cBut that comes with its risks: that the Trump people could also learn what we were doing.\u201d",
      "Trump and Pence had an irreconcilable split on Jan. 6, 2021, after Pence refused to interfere with the certification of Trump\u2019s re-election loss to Biden. Rioters, egged on by Trump, chanted \u201cHang Mike Pence\u201d as they stormed the Capitol.",
      "From the start, Trump\u2019s relationship with Vance has been stronger than what he had with Pence.",
      "They have been close since the 2022 Senate race, which Vance won with Trump\u2019s endorsement, and they bonded further in 2023 during Trump\u2019s visit to the site of a toxic train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio.",
      "The fact that Vance was able to choose his staff, rather than have one chosen for him, \u201c1,000%\u201d illustrates that Trump and his team see no need to meddle in the vice president\u2019s office, said the political strategist who has worked closely with both men.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of that has to do with some of the interlocking relationships between both sides,\u201d this person said. \u201cThe fact that JD and senior people around JD also had relationships with Team Trump and that JD himself built a relationship with Trump and the people around Trump \u2014 I think that allowed for them to have that type of trust in JD\u2019s team.\u201d",
      "The no-meddling approach dates to last year\u2019s presidential campaign, which was an audition of sorts for Vance aides. Trump\u2019s team was responsible for only one hire on the vice presidential campaign staff: director of operations Nick Luna, whose role was announced before Trump selected Vance as his running mate. Vance otherwise had wide latitude to bring along his own people, including Reses, Martin, Schroeder and Van Kirk.",
      "With Surabian at the helm, Chabria and Thompson also frequently traveled with Vance and dialed in for strategy sessions. Chabria directed Vance\u2019s debate preparations, which Trump\u2019s team made no effort to micromanage. Jason Miller, a senior Trump adviser, participated at the Vance team\u2019s invitation, not at the Trump team\u2019s insistence, two sources familiar with the effort said.",
      "The harmony surprised Chabria, who said he had researched past vice presidential campaigns to prepare himself for any tension points that might arise between the blended Trump and Vance staffs.",
      "\u201cThe fact that the senior staff had the trust in us \u2014 it was unbelievable to me, because I don\u2019t know that any other campaign would have afforded that,\u201d Chabria said.",
      "The former Pence aide observed that the relationships Vance\u2019s team enjoys with Trump\u2019s \u201care much deeper\u201d than what Pence and Trump had at the start of their term. Vance, this person noted, also is operating on a different timeline with regard to his own political future, meaning strategists like Surabian have \u201cway more value\u201d outside the administration. Chabria, Surabian and other Vance advisers, for example, are already exercising their political muscles by assisting in Trump ally Vivek Ramaswamy\u2019s soon-to-launch campaign for governor in Ohio.",
      "While Pence had to concentrate on a re-election campaign with Trump before he began to fully entertain thoughts of a White House bid, Vance will most likely need to be ready to launch for 2028 soon after next year\u2019s midterm elections if he plans to run for president.",
      "\u201cThe official office needs to be staffed with the best people that can help him effectuate those Capitol Hill goals and the communications goals,\u201d the former Pence aide said. \u201cAnd then the people on the outside are going to be important, from a planning and strategic perspective in conjunction with the chief of staff, to make sure Vance is traveling to the right places.\u201d"

      "The two are among at least four\u00a0people\u00a0who have been brought into the FBI to advise its director, the current and former officials said. At least two of the\u00a0new advisers are retired FBI agents, one of whom, Tom Ferguson, was an aide to Rep. Jim Jordan,\u00a0R-Ohio, a staunch Trump ally and vocal FBI critic.",
      "The arrival of the person who has been affiliated with Space X has not been previously reported. NBC News has not confirmed the person\u2019s name.\u00a0A spokesperson for SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "It\u2019s not clear who facilitated the arrival of the new advisers or what areas they are focusing on. A spokesperson for Kash Patel, President Donald Trump's pick for FBI director, did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did the FBI. Patel's Senate confirmation hearing is Thursday.",
      "Former FBI officials said the new advisers\u00a0have sparked\u00a0concerns that people with ties to partisan political figures will be helping run the country\u2019s most powerful law enforcement agency.\u00a0While some FBI officials briefed on the arrangement are hopeful that it could result in needed reforms, others fear a compromise of the bureau\u2019s decades-old tradition of distancing itself from politics.",
      "Unlike the Justice Department, the FBI has no political appointees other than its director, whom the president picks for what is supposed to be a 10-year term.\u00a0Much as is the case at the CIA, nearly everyone else who works at the FBI is a career civil servant.",
      "That structure was created after the death in 1972 of longtime FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, who had agents meddle in politics for decades, covertly surveilling and smearing political leaders and groups \u2014 from the far-right John Birch Society to civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.",
      "Rob D\u2019Amico, a former FBI agent who\u00a0served\u00a0on the bureau\u2019s hostage rescue team and in Afghanistan, said he has been told the outsiders are there to advise the FBI on how to reform itself, including sending headquarters employees out into the field.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s absolutely needed,\u201d he said. \u201cThings have gotten too headquarters-centric, and when headquarters is in D.C., the natural thing that happens in D.C. is that things get political.\u201d",
      "However,\u00a0D\u2019Amico said, it is not normal to have\u00a0people with ties to partisan political figures\u00a0on the seventh\u00a0floor, as FBI employees call the director\u2019s office.",
      "\u201cThis will have to be done very carefully,\u201d D\u2019Amico said. \u201cHow does that chain of command work?\u00a0You have to be very careful that it doesn\u2019t become like the Russian political officer on a Russian nuclear sub, enforcing party discipline.\u201d",
      "New advisers\u00a0to FBI director",
      "Gregory Mentzer, another former FBI agent, is working in the FBI director\u2019s office,\u00a0according to his LinkedIn profile. Mentzer, who retired as an FBI agent in 2018 and had been working as contract firearms instructor at the FBI Academy, lists his affiliation as simply \u201cDirector\u2019s Office, FBI.\u201d Mentzer did not respond to a message sent via LinkedIn.",
      "Ferguson, the retired FBI agent and former aide to Jordan, lists himself as \u201cSenior Policy Advisor, Director\u2019s Advisory Team,\u201d on his LinkedIn profile.

      "Ferguson\u00a0referred questions to a spokesman for the House Judiciary Committee, who declined to comment.\u00a0CNN previously reported Ferguson\u2019s hiring.",
      "Jordan, the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, has regularly accused the FBI, without citing specific evidence, of being a corrupt tool of the Biden administration. He claimed the FBI helped suppress a story about Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop computer and retaliated against whistleblowers.",
      "Jordan says the FBI has engaged in politically motivated investigations of Trump, singling out former Director James Comey and his top aides for criticism.",
      "Jordan is also a vocal supporter of Trump\u2019s nominee, Patel, who has called the FBI \"one of the most cunning and powerful arms of the Deep State,\" a reference to partisan claims that career government officials have secretly plotted to undermine Trump.",

      "In 2022, he\u00a0spoke to Fox News\u00a0at a protest about his objections to changes to sex-ed policies, saying he found it \u201cvery inappropriate\u201d for schools to \u201ctackle these politically charged, very dynamic, sort of social hot buttons at such a young age.\u201d",
      "Jordan has also spread exaggerated\u00a0claims about a Justice Department memo that was meant to allow the FBI to assist school districts with threats, some falsely stating that federal authorities were making parents out to be domestic terrorists.",
      "Former FBI Director Christopher Wray, whom Trump named to the position in 2017, said the bureau had \u201cnever been in the business of investigating speech or policing speech at school board meetings or anywhere else, and we never will be.\u201d",
      "The FBI is being led by a Trump-appointed acting director \u2014 a career bureau employee who runs its office in Newark, New Jersey \u2014 while it awaits a confirmation vote on\u00a0Patel.\u00a0Wray recently resigned after Trump made it clear he would replace him.",
      "Concern among former officials",
      "Former FBI officials told NBC News there is a need for the bureau to reform and modernize, particularly in the digital age as cyberthreats from China and other rivals grow.",
      "A former top FBI official, who\u00a0requested\u00a0anonymity so he could speak candidly, said the claims that the bureau was politicized were exaggerated.",

Where is the evidence?\u00a0It\u2019s a solution in search of a problem.\u201d",
      "A second former FBI official who asked not to be named, citing fears of retaliation, said modernization is needed at the bureau but expressed concern about political loyalty tests.",

      "Frank Figliuzzi, an NBC News contributor who retired as head of the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence division after a lengthy career in many senior positions, said the arrangement was problematic on its face.",
      "\u201cWe should all support any attempt to make healthy reforms at the nation\u2019s most powerful law enforcement agency,\u201d Figliuzzi said, but he warned, \u201cThere is a serious perception that this is far more about politics than it is enforcing our nations laws.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Germany\u2019s opposition conservatives won parliamentary approval on Wednesday for a proposal to drastically restrict migration with the help of votes from the Alternative for Germany (AfD), breaking a taboo on cooperation with the far-right.",
      "The proposal is non-binding but the role of the\u00a0AfD\u00a0in passing them is symbolically important in Germany, which faces a national election on Feb. 23 in which the far-right party is tipped to emerge as the second largest after the conservatives.",
      "Friedrich Merz, the leader of Germany\u2019s CDU/CSU conservative bloc, is keen to seize the initiative on migration policy, which has shifted sharply back into focus after an Afghan asylum seeker was arrested over\u00a0deadly stabbings\u00a0last week.",
      "Merz presented two non-binding motions\u00a0in parliament calling for heightened security measures and the closure of German land borders to irregular migration,\u00a0prompting hours of emotionally charged debate in the Bundestag lower house.",
      "With Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens opposed to the motions, however, Merz\u00a0knew he would have\u00a0to rely on support of the\u00a0AfD.\u00a0The land border measure passed with a slim majority of just three votes, while the security proposal was rejected.",
      "Critics\u00a0including Scholz\u00a0argue that\u00a0Merz\u2019s tactics\u00a0shatter the taboo among mainstream parties\u00a0against\u00a0working with the\u00a0AfD\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a party which is monitored by German security services on suspicion of being right-wing extremist\u00a0\u2014\u00a0in an effort to keep it from power.",

      "Merz, who aims to present a draft bill furthering the migration crackdown on Friday,\u00a0defended Wednesday\u2019s motions by saying\u00a0a decision was not wrong just because the \u201cwrong people\u201d supported it although it pained him to have to rely on the support of the\u00a0AfD.",
      "Merz has accused the SPD and Greens of blocking what he calls a necessary turnaround in asylum policy after the arrival in recent years of millions of asylum seekers fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Ukraine.",
      "The number of asylum seekers has dropped since Scholz\u2019s government pushed through a series of laws cracking down on migration in recent years and implemented more controls on the borders \u2014 but not enough, says Merz.",
      "Political analysts say that by\u00a0weakening the so-called firewall around the\u00a0AfD,\u00a0Merz\u00a0risks legitimizing the\u00a0far-right party\u00a0while scaring off centrist conservative voters.",
      "Support for the CDU/CSU dropped three points in the days after Merz promised a migration crackdown to 28%, according to a survey by\u00a0pollster Forsa\u00a0published on Tuesday. Scholz\u2019s SPD gained two points to 17% as did the\u00a0AfD, to 21%.",

      "Some immigrants are worried that routine check-ins with immigration authorities are making them more vulnerable to being detained, as President Donald Trump and his administration ramp up arrests and deportations throughout the country.",
      "This week, a 30-year-old Venezuelan immigrant who had been periodically checking in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in South Florida \u2014 as part of a process to remain in the U.S. \u2014 was unexpectedly detained during a routine appointment, his mother told NBC Miami.",
      "The mother, whose name is being withheld to protect her son, said he was asked to show up at an immigration supervision office in Delray Beach on Monday afternoon to follow up on his immigration application and \"fix something ... and, that was a lie,\" she said.",
      "The mother said she waited five hours for her son to finish his appointment but instead, she saw him being escorted out by immigration officers.",
      "Her son has lived in the U.S. since he was 6 years old, she said, and despite reporting to his appointment, he was not given a fair chance to fight a deportation order placed against him.",
      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t give us the opportunity to at least tell us, \u2018Look, you have a deportation order, we want you to be removed by February or something,\u2019\u201d the mother said.",
      "On any given year, thousands of undocumented immigrants across the country regularly report to ICE. These routine appointments help immigration officials keep track of those who are not a priority for deportation as immigrants seek legal alternatives to remain in the U.S.",
      "Immigration officials also have in place additional supervision programs that allow them to keep tabs on undocumented people through GPS ankle monitors, by phone and other types of monitoring. According to ICE, there are nearly 179,000 people being monitored through these programs nationwide.",
      "Two New York-based immigration attorneys whose names are being withheld to protect their clients said they started noticing a shift after Trump was elected president in November. People in the state who have long been enrolled in one of these immigration supervision programs, or have been checking in with ICE once or twice a year, were asked to report sooner and, in dozens of cases since, they said, their clients ended up being detained and deported.",
      "The ICE Field Office in New York City did not comment and referred NBC News to ICE's national office, which did not immediately respond.",
      "'A lot of fear'",
      "There are immigrants who go to ICE check-ins who don\u2019t have deportation orders and are in the process of trying to adjust their immigration status. Others may have such orders, but are appealing them or are not aware they have a deportation order until they show up to their routine check-in.",
      "That's what happened to a mother who got deported this week alongside her young daughter, a day after reporting to her check-in, one of the attorneys said.",
      "The mother had not been informed that she had lost an appeal in her immigration case before she showed up to her scheduled appointment with her daughter. Instead, she learned about it during the check-in and, by then, the mother couldn't do much to fight her case, the attorney said.",
      "A recent memo from the Trump administration expanded immigration officials\u2019 \u201cenforcement discretion\" powers. This allows them to bypass regular immigration law and speed up deportations of anyone with a removal order, regardless of whether they are considered a priority or not.",
      "The attorneys said they are expecting to see more of these cases across the nation. Currently, nearly 1.4 million people have pending deportation orders. Anecdotally, the New York immigration attorneys said they have seen an increase in the number of people who have been ordered removed without a hearing. They say this means more immigrants may be showing up to their ICE check-ins without knowing they may have a deportation order.",
      "Yet immigrants don\u2019t have much of a choice: Failure to show up for a routine ICE appointment hurts their chances of remaining in the U.S. and can even lead to a deportation order.",
      "They want to comply and go the appointments, according to one attorney, \u201cbut there\u2019s a lot of fear, obviously, a lot of anxiety.\u201d",
      "Maria Bilbao is part of the\u00a0Miramar Circle of Protection, a coalition of community members who gather outside the ICE field office in the city of Miramar, South Florida, every Wednesday to provide support to immigrants showing up to routine appointments.",
      "On Wednesday morning, Bilbao met a Colombian woman and a Cuban man who showed up to their routine ICE check-in in Miramar and were told to report to the immigration supervision office in Delray Beach instead, where the 30-year-old Venezuelan immigrant was detained on Monday.",
      "The immigration supervision office in Delray Beach is not an ICE field office; it's run by a private company contracted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and ICE to operate an \u201cintensive supervision appearance program\" meant to serve as an alternative to detention.",
      "But according to Bilbao, \u201cwhat\u2019s happening now is strange.\" Instead of routine supervisory visits, \"they are being detained more often,\u201d she said in Spanish.",
      "In the eight years Bilbao has been assisting immigrants with their ICE check-in appointments, she had rarely heard of people being detained for deportation at that facility.",
      "The ICE Field Office in Miami didn't respond to NBC News\u2019 email asking how many people were detained Monday in Delray Beach and whether or not those detained are facing deportation. An NBC Miami reporter witnessed at least six people being taken into custody that day.",
      "One woman who accompanied her cousin to his routine appointment at Delray Beach on Monday morning, and saw him removed by immigration authorities, told NBC Miami she believed her cousin was \u201ctricked into coming to see their immigration officer, as they\u2019ve done time and time again \u2014 but this time they were caught by surprise and taken away,\" she said.",
      "In response to the allegations, Garrett Ripa, the acting assistant director of ICE Field Operations in Miami,\u00a0told NBC Miami \u201cthere\u2019s no truth to that.\u201d",
      "When asked if undocumented immigrants would be detained or deported regardless of whether or not they have a criminal record, Ripa said, \u201cEvery individual in the United States that is either removable or inadmissible from the United States, regardless of whether they have a crime or not, is potentially an individual that we could take an enforcement action against.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow, does that necessarily mean that we\u2019re going to take that person into immigration custody? Not necessarily, there are other avenues we can explore,\u201d he said.",
      "'It's a nightmare'",
      "People being detained during their ICE check-ins is not new. It has happened under various previous administrations, including during Trump\u2019s first term in 2017, which Bilbao said led to the creation of the\u00a0Miramar Circle of Protection.",
      "\"Back then, we called them 'silent raids,'\" Bilbao said.",
      "\"So, we expected something like that to happen again this time around,  because it is the easiest way for them to deport people,\" she said. \"It's a nightmare.\"",
      "On Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated Trump's promise to carry out \u201cthe largest deportation program in American history.\u201d",
      "\"If you are an individual, a foreign national, who illegally enters the United States of America, you are by definition a criminal,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Being undocumented is considered a civil offense,\u00a0not a crime. But it\u2019s considered a crime when an undocumented immigrant who was previously deported re-enters the United States without permission.",
      "The woman who saw her cousin being detained in Delray Beach on Monday said \u201cthese people aren\u2019t bad people, these people aren\u2019t criminals ... The person, my family member, they took away today, is not a criminal. He has never been to jail.\u201d"

    "summary": "Even though the investigation is ongoing and few details have been released, Trump quickly cast blame for the deadly midair collision that happened Wednesday night.",
    "story": [
      "Just 11 days into his presidency, Donald Trump has been confronted with a national tragedy that claimed dozens of lives after a passenger jet carrying 64 people collided midair with an Army helicopter in the Washington, D.C., region Wednesday night.",
      "His response bypassed the usual playbook that presidents typically follow after a tragedy, just as his campaign broke from political norms time and again.",
      "Without waiting for a full investigation \u2014 or a list of the victims \u2014 the president began pointing fingers and going on the attack. Rather than using it as a moment to forgo political combat and and focus on the victims, he took the opportunity to push his agenda against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts.",
      "His approach moved attention away from recovery efforts, victims and the investigation into the crash to a debate over one of his biggest political targets. And while Trump faced criticism for his handling of the moment, it was in line with how he has eschewed the way traditional politicians operate.",
      "Trump quickly put out a social media post casting blame for the accident Wednesday night, before many facts were known.",
      "At a White House press briefing Thursday, he read through a more traditional speech expressing condolences, but then launched into remarks that felt more like something from a campaign rally, calling a Democratic official \u201ca disaster,\u201d castigating his predecessors and going after DEI \u2014 despite any evidence so far that these policies contributed to the midair collision.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been an investigator for 35 years, investigating aircraft accidents, and when you talk about standards, what we just saw does not meet the published international standards of providing information in the wake of an accident,\u201d Jeff Guzzetti, a former investigator for the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board, told MSNBC.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be political here, but the information that came out ... it was not accurate. It undermined the honesty of the investigation,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never seen something like this, where a government official circumvented the time-honored tradition of aircraft accident investigation. And you know, just personally, I think it\u2019s appalling that these comments, political comments, were being made in the wake of the tragedy like this.\u201d",
      "Trump was joined by two members of his Cabinet, newly confirmed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.",
      "During his remarks, Hegseth disclosed the ranks of the three service members who were killed in the military helicopter. It was a break from longtime Pentagon policy, which is that no information about any service member killed in the line of duty be disclosed for 24 hours after all next of kin have been notified.",
      "Duffy \u2014 who does not have a background in transportation but gained fame as a reality-TV star before becoming a congressman from Wisconsin \u2014 just started as transportation secretary on Wednesday. He struggled through a separate Thursday-morning press briefing, telling reporters the obvious line, \u201cIt is not standard to have aircraft collide. I want to be clear on that.\u201d",
      "Trump opened the press briefing Thursday by thanking federal agencies and first responders, and acknowledging there were likely no survivors.",
      "\u201cThis was a dark and excruciating night in our nation\u2019s capital,\u201d he said during the sober remarks.",
      "From there, Trump\u2019s rhetoric became more political. He blamed former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, along with \u201cthe Democrats,\u201d for supporting past diversity programs within the FAA.",
      "\u201cI do want to point out that various articles that appeared prior to me entering office \u2026 the FAA diversity push includes focusing on hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d",
      "His comments came as rescue workers continue to search for dozens of bodies in the Potomac River.",
      "Trump was asked by reporters how he could know that diversity programs helped cause the tragic crash after just one day, and responded, \u201cBecause I have common sense.\u201d",
      "\u201cFAA employees with disabilities did not cause last night\u2019s tragic plane crash,\u201d the American Association of People with Disabilities said in a statement. \u201cThe investigation into the crash is still ongoing. It is extremely inappropriate for the President to use this tragedy to push an anti-diversity hiring agenda. Doing so makes all Americans less safe.\u201d",
      "At one point, a reporter asked Trump whether he was getting ahead of the investigation by casting blame even before the names of the victims are known.",
      "\u201cNo, I don't think so at all. The names of the people \u2014 you mean the names of the people that are on the plane? You think that\u2019s going to make a difference? They are a group of people that have lost their lives,\u201d Trump said, adding that a list would be released soon.",
      "Trump also took direct aim at Pete Buttigieg, who served as Biden\u2019s transportation secretary.",
      "\u201cThat guy\u2019s a real winner. \u2026 He\u2019s a disaster\u201d Trump said, unprompted. \u201cHe was a disaster as a mayor. He ran his city into the ground, and he\u2019s a disaster.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s just got a good line of bulls---,\u201d Trump added.",
      "Buttigieg responded on X, calling Trump\u2019s press conference \u201cdespicable.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs families grieve, Trump should be leading, not lying,\u201d he posted. \u201cWe put safety first, drove down close calls, grew Air Traffic Control, and had zero commercial airline crash fatalities out of millions of flights on our watch,\u201d he wrote.",
      "John Cox, a pilot and the president and CEO of Safety Operating Systems LLC,\u00a0told MSNBC there was \u201cno foundation\u201d for Trump\u2019s comments about FAA diversity programs.",
      "\u201cOne thing that has to be remembered is that there are standards for everyone in aviation, notably in a safety critical position, be it pilots, be it flight attendants, be it dispatchers, be it air traffic controllers,\u201d he said.",
      "He also said the National Transportation Safety Board is the only agency allowed to release information about an investigation, according to an International Civil Aviation Treaty \u2014 meaning that Trump, Hegseth and Duffy should not have been doing so.",
      "In addition to DEI programs among air traffic controllers, Trump also blamed a \u201cpilot problem\u201d in the helicopter and bad eyesight \u2014 \u201cI can\u2019t imagine people with 20/20 vision not seeing what\u2019s happening up there.\u201d",
      "\u201cBecause it was visual, it was a very clear night,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt was cold, but clear and clear as you could be.\u201d",
      "Officials have so far given no formal cause for the midair collision.",
      "Trump, however, also said he was \u201cnot blaming the [air traffic] controller,\u201d and said the American people should not be afraid to fly.",
      "\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI would not hesitate to fly.\u201d",
      "Both Duffy and Hegseth backed up Trump on the diversity issue during the White House press briefing.",
      "\u201cYou made an important point that when we deal with safety, we can only accept the best and the brightest in positions of safety that impact the lives of our loved ones, our family members,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cAnd I think you make a really important point on that, Mr. President. That is the motto of your presidency, the best and the brightest, the most intelligent coming into these spaces.\u201d",
      "Hegseth said that hiring practices should be \u201ccolorblind and merit-based.\u201d",
      "During the press conference, Trump also appointed Christopher Rocheleau as acting FAA commissioner, a position that had been vacant. He did not speak during the press conference.",
      "Diversity in the aviation industry was put in the spotlight by many conservatives early last year when a panel blew off an Alaska Airlines plane at 16,000 feet.",
      "After that incident, many right-wing commentators and political figures began to baselessly point to DEI as a major issue in the airline industry.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure this has nothing to do with mandated Diversity Equity and Inclusion practices in the airline industry!!!\u201d Donald Trump Jr. posted on X in response to a post about a wheel falling off a Boeing 757. \u201cWheels don\u2019t just fall off planes without gross incompetence in the equation!\u201d",
      "Trump said the order he signed shortly after taking office was to \u201crestore the highest standards\u201d at the FAA. It primarily takes aim at DEI programs at the agency.",
      "\u201cTheir policy was horrible, and their politics was even worse,\u201d Trump said of past Democratic administrations that included diversity programs. \u201cSo, as you know, last week, long before the crash, I signed an executive order restoring our highest standards for air traffic controllers and other important jobs.\u201d",
      "The aviation industry has had a shortage of air traffic controllers for years, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00a0projects there will be about 18,000 pilot jobs opening\u00a0up each year through 2033. Aviation experts told NBC News that DEI is not a problem in an industry where there are very few Black pilots, and there is absolutely no proof that promoting diversity has led to safety issues."

      "\u201cScientific integrity demands diversity, and that we know that we get better outcomes when we have diversity amongst research teams, and because they bring different perspectives,\u201d said the employee, who was put on leave last week. \u201cIt only improves the shaping of research questions and the interpretation of results. So it matters. It matters to the science.\u201d",
      "The employee said that the government\u2019s work in STEM could only benefit from more diversity.",
      "\u201cHumans are complicated and no one \u2014 no one race or creed \u2014 no one has it figured out,\u201d the employee said. \u201cThe more that we can work together, we can improve our outcomes.\u201d",
      "One biologist who works for the federal government, who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation, mentioned that earlier in her career she took part in a paid federal internship for underrepresented groups. And it led to a full-time STEM position. Such programs now under threat only help even the playing field for those from marginalized communities, she said, who more likely do not have means to take on unpaid internships, or have the connections to get their foot in the door in those industries.",
      "\u201cYou can compete for jobs you weren\u2019t able to before,\u201d the biologist said. \u201cThat\u2019s highly important for people who are from lower income, middle income, who are mothers who might not have the free time to go and do all this volunteer work.\u201d",
      "Programs that help recruit diverse talent, the biologist said, do not hand out jobs to unqualified individuals, as some misconceptions may suggest. They simply give people who ordinarily would not have the opportunity to compete for STEM careers the opportunity to do so, she said.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that I was hired directly into this job, that I didn\u2019t have to compete, that I was hired because I\u2019m a woman, or because I\u2019m gay,\u201d the biologist said. \u201cThey thought that I was the best applicant or candidate for the job.\u201d",
      "The sunsetting of DEI programs and the pausing of certain volunteer support groups \u2014 like employee resource groups \u2014 could deter women and minorities from applying or being chosen for STEM positions altogether, said the federal worker who is Hispanic. With so many men in their fields, those groups and programs have historically helped women and minorities better navigate workplace dynamics, ask critical questions in a safe space and feel comfortable being themselves at work, the employee said.",
      "\u201cHow do you stand shoulder to shoulder with folks that, just because they\u2019re male, they\u2019re getting listened to more?\u201d the worker said. \u201cWhen you feel like you have a part of the community and you have other people you can lean on, you can do your job better.\u201d"

    "summary": "Members of Congress expressed concerns about air congestion in an area where a commercial passenger jet collided with a military helicopter over the Potomac River.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Several members of Congress are expressing concerns about the air congestion in the area where a commercial passenger jet collided with a military helicopter over the Potomac River on Wednesday night.",
      "Lawmakers didn\u2019t ascribe any blame for the accident and said they trusted the National Transportation Safety Board would do a lengthy, in-depth investigation. But they said the deadly crash reinforced worries about traffic in a busy transportation corridor where military and other helicopters are sharing airspace with passenger jets flying in and out of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, known as DCA.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been very worried about this for a long time, and I continue to be worried about it. The National Transportation Safety Board will do an investigation of this, and I have high confidence in them. They\u2019ll look and see what was the cause of this devastating tragedy, and I\u2019m not going to speculate. They\u2019ll do the work. They\u2019re good at it. They\u2019ll give us answers,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told reporters Thursday.",
      "\u201cBut yeah, I\u2019ve been very, very concerned about this very complex airspace \u2014 commercial, military \u2014 and the way that the security demands of being the nation\u2019s capital puts some significant restrictions on it. And I am really worried about that,\u201d he continued.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been praying that there wouldn\u2019t be something like last night,\u201d Kaine said, \u201cbut kind of dreading in my heart that there would be.\u201d",
      "There were 60 passengers and four crew members aboard the American Eagle jet, which was flying from Wichita, Kansas, to DCA, which sits on the Virginia side of the Potomac River. Three people  were aboard the Army Black Hawk helicopter. President Donald Trump said at a White House briefing that there were no survivors in the crash.",
      "The airspace above Washington is complex for a variety of reasons. DCA is one of the busiest airports in the country, with hundreds of flights arriving and departing each day. The airport saw a record 25.5 million passengers in 2023.",
      "Some airspace above Washington is restricted because of security issues. On top of that, there is a plethora of other aircraft \u2014 military, National Park Service, Metropolitan Police Department, not to mention Marine One \u2014 that use the airspace because of the fact that the District of Columbia is the nation\u2019s capital and that it sits in between Maryland and Virginia. Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling also is just across the Potomac from DCA.",
      "Rep. Rick Larsen, D-Wash., the ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and who previously spent two decades on the Armed Services Committee, said he\u2019s flown out of DCA countless times and never has been worried about congestion there in the past.",
      "But he said in a phone call Thursday that \u201ccertainly this tragedy raises my concerns about the amount of traffic in that area.\u201d Larsen added that the focus now should be on the victims, their family members and the first responders who rushed to the scene Wednesday night.",
      "He said the NTSB assigned 40 investigators and staff to the crash, and that their probe could take more than a year.",
      "\u201cThe slow process begins of investigating the root cause. So, the timeline is the timeline. I expect a preliminary report in several weeks,\u201d Larsen said. \u201cBut the investigation will take a long time to get done \u2026 It could take 18 months.\u201d",
      "Kansas lawmakers, including GOP Sen. Jerry Moran, had lobbied American Airlines to add the nonstop flight between Wichita and DCA, which has been in existence for about a year. Moran said he had taken that flight many times.",
      "Kansas\u2019 other senator, Republican Roger Marshall, told reporters Thursday that he expected to meet with family members of victims in Washington later in the afternoon and receive a briefing from the NTSB and the Federal Aviation Administration.",
      "He added that there was plenty of blame to go around, saying that  the air traffic controller should have had the plane and helicopter flying at different altitudes and that the helicopter pilot should have had visuals of multiple planes that were landing at DCA.",
      "\u201cClearly this was a confluence of errors \u2026 It\u2019s unacceptable, and I appreciate President Trump and his team saying there\u2019s challenges here, there\u2019s problems here, and we\u2019re going to correct them,\u201d Marshall said.",
      "Asked if he\u2019s concerned about air congestion in the region, Marshall replied: \u201cCertainly that\u2019s what it looks like to me. I understand that commonly happens \u2014 the military aircraft shares its shared airspace with the civilian aircraft. But is that necessary? Are we just inviting a disaster to happen? And I think that\u2019s a question that I want answered as well.\u201d",
      "The skies above Washington have grown more crowded recently. The FAA reauthorization legislation passed by Congress and signed into law by President Joe Biden last April boosted air traffic controller staffing but also added five additional longer-distance, round-trip flights out of DCA.",
      "Sens. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, the leaders of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, negotiated the deal. But the added flights were opposed by the four Democratic senators from Virginia and Maryland, who argued that it would add to the congestion and potentially lead to an accident.",
      "In a floor speech during that FAA debate in May, Kaine, the Virginia senator, pointed to a recent near-collision on a DCA runway between a Southwest Airlines plane and a JetBlue Airways plane.",
      "\u201cWith congestion, you run into risks of safety,\u201d Kaine said.",
      "Cruz, who now chairs of the commerce committee that provides oversight of aviation issues, said the NTSB and the FAA would hold a \u201chigh-level\u201d briefing with his panel\u2019s members later Thursday to find out what is known so far about the crash, and that his own panel would investigate, as well.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve directed the Commerce Committee to actively gather information about what went wrong,\u201d he wrote on X, \u201cand I plan to hold a bipartisan member-level briefing with key federal officials as soon as possible.\""

      "After discussing the paper trail of her parents' bloodline, host Dr. Henry Louis Gates Jr. revealed to Stone that her line of heritage from her father's paternal line extended back over a thousand years to medieval times, making Charlemagne her 38th great-grandfather.",
      "Referred to as the \"father of Europe,\" Charlemagne is one of the most important people in history, according to Gates.",
      "The King of the Franks was the first crowned emperor of the Holy Roman Empire in the year 800, over one thousand years before Stone was even born.",

      "Stone had multiple revelations about her family history in the episode, including her DNA test, which revealed she was 43% Scottish. Before the episode, she believed her ancestors were almost exclusively Irish, which Gates concluded could be a result of a migration of Scottish people to Ireland, known as Scotch-Irish people.",
      "Contrasted with the royal lineage in her distant bloodline, Stone's parents did not grow up with financial fortitude. Her mother, Dorothy Larson, was born in 1933 in rural Pennsylvania in extreme poverty. Dorothy Larson's parents, Stone's grandparents, could only afford a two-room house for their five children.",
      "\u201cThere wasn\u2019t time or moments to even think about was there anybody before them; there wasn\u2019t the luxury of imagining \u2018who were your ancestors,\u201d Stone explained to Gates. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to know who your people are. It\u2019s really nice to be able to find that out.\u201d",
      "Larson grew up surrounded in tragedy, with her twin dying at birth due to malnourishment and one of her sisters being struck and killed by a drunk driver, according to Stone. She also grew up with rickets and scurvy, and at age 9 moved in with their local dentist to live as their maid.",
      "Stone's third great-grandfather on her mom's side, George Greggs, also suffered from great hardship. A Pennsylvania Union cavalry soldier in the Civil War and during the Battle of Cedar Creek, Greggs potentially suffered from undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder in the later stages of his life.",
      "With hardship on her mother's side, Stone's dad's upbringing also had unfortunate circumstances. Sharon's grandfather, Joseph Stone, managed a lucrative oil well that passed from heart disease, leaving his wife with no inheritance.",
      "Stone explained she believes she inherited her father's work ethic, who was a tool and dye maker. Stone herself battled career challenges herself, including a bounceback from a life-threatening stroke.",
      "\"It's so grounding to find out for the good and the bad of it,\" Stone explained when learning about her family lineage. \"Because them, you can just see yourself and go 'Oh, that's what I'm made of!'\""

    "story": [
      "Blake Lively's actor brother-in-law Bart Johnson is apologizing for any \"unkind\" things he's said amid Lively's legal battle with her \"It Ends with Us\" co-star and director Justin Baldoni.",
      "Johnson, who is married to Lively\u2019s\u00a0older half-sister Robyn Lively,\u00a0 addressed unspecific past remarks of his Jan. 28 on X, writing, \"Anytime I\u2019ve said anything unkind about someone I\u2019ve regretted it. Fortunately that\u2019s almost never and definitely not when I\u2019m at my best. Regardless if it\u2019s true or not, if it\u2019s my opinion, even if I\u2019m trying to speak truth or stand up for someone, it\u2019s never good.",
      "\"Even in times where it might 'feel' justified and doing the right thing, it makes no difference,\" he continued. \"There\u2019s a better way. It\u2019s below the standard I have for myself and I regret it. \"",
      "The \"High School Musical\" franchise star went on to \"sincerely apologize\" to anyone he \"hurt or let down by saying something that sounds mean.\"",
      "\"I\u2019ll do better. If you follow me you know you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find more than 1 time I\u2019ve criticized anyone on social. It\u2019s not my jam,\" wrote Johnson. \"You can easily find a million times I\u2019ve uplifted, support, encourage and uplifted my family, friends, followers & strangers. That\u2019s what I\u2019m committed to and where I find my happiness. \"",
      "Johnson concluded his message, \"We all have flaws and I\u2019m definitely a work in progress and doing my best to grow and be better.\"",
      "Johnson's comments come on the heels of lawsuits filed by both Lively and Baldoni following the promotion and release of \"It Ends with Us,\" which premiered in theaters in August 2024.",
      "In December 2024, after rumors of a feud between the two actors circulated for months, Lively, who co-starred and was a producer on \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d filed a\u00a0sexual harassment complaint\u00a0against Baldoni.",
      "Lively followed up by filing a lawsuit against Baldoni, his production company Wayfarer Studios, producer Jamey Heath, Baldoni's publicist Jennifer Abel, crisis publicist Melissa Nathan and others connected to Baldoni and the film, alleging\u00a0she was the victim of sexual harassment and\u00a0a subsequent smear campaign, according to court documents obtained by NBC News.",
      "Baldoni countered by suing Lively, her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, and other defendants for $400 million, accusing them of defamation and other contractual claims, according to court documents obtained by NBC News.",
      "Both actors' lawsuits will be addressed in a trial set for March 9, 2026, in New York.",
      "Months before the actors filed their lawsuits, Johnson defended Lively as she battled a social media backlash that her lawsuit alleges was orchestrated by Baldoni and his team.",
      "After Johnson posted\u00a0a birthday tribute\u00a0to Lively on Instagram in August 2024, he responded to a commenter who accused Lively, who plays a victim of\u00a0domestic abuse in \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d of \u201cpromoting happiness in a domestic violence setting without any regard for any victims.\"",
      "\"I\u2019m really sorry you feel that way. I\u2019m sure you have a huge heart and want the best,\" Johnson replied, in part. \"I can promise you the truth has not come out yet. Blake worked harder on this film than anything I\u2019ve seen her do in my entire life. Because it meant so much to her.\u201d",
      "In December 2024, Johnson also reportedly called Baldoni, who hosts a podcast called \"Man Enough\" that explores modern masculinity and gender roles,\" a \"fraud\" in a since-deleted post on X, reported USA Today.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a fraud. He puts on the \u2018costume\u2019 of a hero, man bun and all. Used all of the trendy catchphrases & buzz words for his podcasts. None of it\u2019s genuine. It\u2019s all theater. And everyone fell for it. For years,\u201d Johnson wrote, according to the publication.",
      "On Jan. 29, a day after he said he regretted making \"unkind\" remarks, Johnson posted and then deleted a response to an X user who accused of him of apologizing in the interest of \u201cavoiding litigation.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow I\u2019m gonna get sued? for what? I find those type of podcasts phony. I do. That\u2019s not a crime,\u201d Johnson wrote, seemingly referring to his earlier remarks about Baldoni's podcast.",
      "\u201cBut I do feel bad rippin on them. That\u2019s literally all I said. But\u2026 Just like you and all the toxic and hatful comments I get from his fans wishing me and my children harm and calling me all the vile names you can imagine, it\u2019s not a crime. People are free to do so and I\u2019m not mad,\u201d he added."

      "Amanda Riley drew people in with a story.",
      "She presented herself as a young woman and mother of two battling an aggressive blood cancer, Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma \u2014 who, despite her devastating diagnosis, was not giving up, according to a press release from the United States District Court, Northern District of California.",
      "Riley documented every step of her cancer journey on social media and various blogs for years. She shared raw photos of herself receiving cancer treatment, including pictures of herself with IVs and chemo ports at the hospital, as well as photos of herself with a bald head, per the release.",
      "Over the course of eight years, Riley, now 39, hosted numerous fundraisers, both in person and online, gathering hundreds of supporters who donated more than $100,000 to fund her life-saving treatments.",
      "Then, the truth came out: it had all been a scam. Riley had never had Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and she had staged her illness for years to solicit donations for her non-existent cancer expenses. Riley pleaded guilty to wire fraud.",
      "A new four-part documentary, \u201cScamanda,\u201d explores how Rileypulled off her elaborate scheme. The series, which premieres Jan. 30 on ABC News with episodes streaming on Hulu the next day, includes interviews with friends and family members victimized for years by Riley\u2019s deception.",
      "Keep reading to learn more about what Riley was convicted of, what she has said about her crime, and where she is now.",
      "What was Amanda Riley convicted of?",
      "Riley pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud in October 2011. She was sentenced in May 2022 to 60 months in prison, and required to pay restitution to her victims.",
      "The wire fraud conviction stems from Riley\u2019s actions between 2012 and 2019, when she feigned having cancer, per the release. She used Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and a personal blog to document her supposed cancer journey, staging fake treatment photographs and forging medical records and physicians\u2019 letters, according to the district court\u2019s filing.",
      "Throughout these years, she aggressively fundraised online and through in-person events \u2014 supposedly to help fund her expensive treatments, but in reality the money went directly to her personal bank accounts, according to the district court\u2019s filing. More than 300 people, whose names were included in\u00a0Riley\u2019s criminal judgment, raised over $105,000 for Riley.",
      "What have Amanda Riley's victims said?",
      "Four people delivered victim impact statements about how Riley\u2019s schemes affected them over the years, per a transcript from a May 2022 court hearing in San Jose.",
      "One statement came from Jessa Gonzalez, the daughter of Riley\u2019s husband, Cory Riley, from his previous marriage.",
      "Gonzalez was 10 years old when Amanda Riley told her she had cancer, and she recalled feeling \u201cterrified\u201d that her stepmom \u201cwouldn\u2019t be around much longer.\u201d",
      "As the years went on, though, Gonzalez said she began to suspect something was off.",
      "\u201cAmanda was always sick, never being able to get out of bed, but I would never see her go to appointments. She had always looked healthy,\u201d she said. \u201cI noticed she would starve herself until she would pass out.\u201d",
      "Gonzalez said she once found an \u201cIV wrapped in Saran wrap\u201d in her little brother\u2019s playroom, and when she brought it to Riley, her stepmother grew defensive.",
      "\u201cShe quickly took it from me and said my little brother took it out of her nightstand,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u00a0 knew better than to question her, as she (would) regularly lash out at me.\u201d",
      "Gonzalez, who was 19 when she delivered her victim impact statement, said Riley\u2019s longterm deception had made her depressed and severely anxious.",
      "\u201cMy hair is falling out from severe stress, and some days I can\u2019t physically function because of how bad she has scarred me,\u201d she said.",
      "Gonzalez\u2019s mother and Cory Riley\u2019s ex-wife, Aletta Souza, also delivered a victim impact statement reflecting on the emotional damage she said Riley had inflicted on her daughter.",
      "\u201cAmanda Riley would tell my daughter she had a few months to live, and then a miracle, she was in remission, and then again dying, and then remission, and on and on. The toll that takes on a child, and that damage caused, is immeasurable,\u201d she said.",
      "The court also heard victim impact statements from Lindsey Wilder, who frequently donated platelets in honor of Riley, and Lisa Berry, a former friend of Riley.",
      "Berry said Riley told her about her cancer diagnosis in 2010, and asked her and her husband to help pay for life-saving blood tests.",
      "\u201cWe gave her the needed money. Within a couple days, she posted glamorous photos of herself taken by a professional photographer,\u201d Berry said. \u201cI became suspicious that the money I had given her was used to pay for this photo shoot.\u201d",
      "Berry said she and her husband began to see through Riley\u2019s lies, which they found especially upsetting considering that Berry\u2019s husband\u2019s first wife had died from cancer after a long battle with the disease.",
      "They eventually cut all ties with Riley, and said they were dismayed to learn that Riley was telling others in 2012 that she had been newly diagnosed with cancer.",
      "\u201cAmanda Riley was faking cancer and scamming on an even larger scale,\u201d Berry said. \u201cMy husband and I were revolted to learn that this was happening all over again.\u201d",
      "As part of her sentence, Riley was ordered to pay restitution of more than $105,000 to hundreds of people who donated to her fraudulent cancer-related fundraisers. A 2022 court document includes a list of every person owed restitution, including several people who donated small amounts of $10 or $25, and others who donated several thousand dollars to Riley.",
      "What has Amanda Riley said about her actions?",
      "Riley delivered a statement at her sentencing hearing on May 3, 2022, according to the same court transcript.",
      "\u201cYour Honor, there aren\u2019t enough words to adequately express how horrific I feel and how sorry I am that this happened,\u201d she said. \u201cMy heart aches every day, thinking that I did something that hurt other people. This is the worst thing I\u2019ve ever done and the worst mistake I could have made.\u201d",
      "She also said she felt \u201cashamed\u201d by her actions, and said she had \u201cbeen dealing with the repercussions of this for years.\u201d",
      "\u201cI threw away my dream career, lost all my friends and family. I went from being a nobody, to being negatively covered in dozens of tabloids and news articles,\u201d she said.",
      "Riley also said it was time to \u201cstep forward and be accountable.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m here to accept responsibility and humbly accept my consequences as the first step of showing everyone I want to make this right,\u201d she said. \u201cI will spend the rest of my life working towards the amends for the hurt that I have caused.\u201d",
      "She also directly addressed her stepdaughter, Jessa Gonzalez.",
      "\u201cI hope this brings you the closure and clarity you have been seeking,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry you were in the dark for what was truly happening for so long. You had to walk through this, and it breaks my heart to know I hurt you.\u201d",
      "In addition, Riley mentioned the two sons she shares with Cory Riley.",
      "\u201cOur two young boys were babies when this started, so they were too little to be affected by my bad choices,\u201d she said. \u201cNow to see them as big boys who are going to see their mom go through this process, is going to flip their world upside down.\u201d",
      "As she sentenced Riley, United States District Judge Beth Labson Freeman addressed her directly.",
      "\u201cI can only imagine that, over eight years, you were as sincere to those people as you appeared to me today,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I have to say that in listening to you today, I could only imagine what a good act you had for eight years in front of churches and community groups and in your blog and online and with your children.\u201d",
      "Freeman added that it \u201cbreaks my heart to think that your boys \u2026 will not have their mother with them.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut it was your responsibility before you committed these frauds, to think about your parental obligations,\u201d Freeman continued. \u201cIt is not the court\u2019s job to clean that up for you.\u201d",
      "Where is Amanda Riley now?",
      "Amanda Riley began serving a five-year sentence at the Federal Medical Center Carswell, a federal prison in Ft. Worth, Texas.",
      "According to petition for divorce obtained by TODAY.com, Cory Riley filed for divorce in January 2024. The filing said Cory Riley was living in Texas.",

      "Her inmate record also states that Riley is now located at RRM Long Beach, a residential reentry management field office.",

      "RRMs also \u201cmonitor local Residential Reentry Centers which are responsible for providing federal offenders with community-based services that will assist with their reentry needs,\u201d according to the Bureau of Prisons.",
      "It is unclear which of the above inmate categories Riley currently falls into, and whether she is serving the rest of her sentence in prison, a residential reentry center, home confinement or elsewhere.",
      "After her release from prison, Riley will undergo a three-year period of supervision, according to a 2022 press release from the United States Attorney\u2019s Office, Northern District of California.",
      "Last summer, Riley sought a reduction of her sentence. She asked for her sentence to be reduced to time served on the grounds of compassionate release, citing various medical maladies she was allegedly suffering in prison.",
      "In June 2024, a judge denied her request, citing \u201cevidence that Defendant is once again feigning illness.\u201d"

      "\"My heaviest, I was like 203, and I\u2019m 5 foot 3 and a half,\" Clarkson continued. \"It\u2019s funny because people assume, \u2018Oh she must\u2019ve been miserable, depressed, whatever,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018No I was not.'\"",
      "\u201cI was never insecure about it, I was happy,\u201d she added.",
      "After sharing that she was using a weight-loss medication, Clarkson faced a wave of backlash which Goldberg addressed on an episode of \"The View.\"",
      "Clarkson was on the receiving end of criticism from those who said she'd previously claimed she lost weight by walking. \"Here's a point about that,\" Goldberg said. \"A lot of people are taking this shot because the need it. Some people need (their) bodies jumpstarted, some have diabetes, there's lots of reasons. She has been walking, but this has helped.\"",
      "Goldberg went on to point out the hypocrisy of the comments. \"They kick her behind when she's bigger, they kick her behind when she's lost the weight, and now they're kicking her behind because she said it out loud.\"",
      "How did Kelly Clarkson lose weight?",
      "In addition to taking a weight-loss drug, Clarkson has made lifestyle changes for her long-term health.",
      "In January 2024, she credited her move to New York City for helping her get active. In an exclusive interview with People, she revealed that she's lost weight because she's now taking her wellness seriously and walking more.",
      "She did not address her gym routine but said, \u201cWalking in the city is quite the workout.\"",
      "Clarkson chose to relocate her talk show to New York from Los Angeles in 2023. \u201cI was very unhappy in L.A. and had been for several years. I needed a fresh start,\u201d Clarkson told People. California, she said, wasn't good for her mental health.",
      "In New York, she adopted a few other wellness trends, too. \"I\u2019m really into infrared saunas right now. And I just got a cold plunge because everybody wore me down,\" the \"Piece By Piece\" singer added.",
      "As for her diet, Clarkson isn't doing anything extreme.",
      "\u201cI eat a healthy mix,\u201d she told People. \u201cI dropped weight because I\u2019ve been listening to my doctor \u2014\u00a0a couple (of) years I didn\u2019t. And 90% of the time I\u2019m really good at it because a protein diet is good for me anyway. I\u2019m a Texas girl, so I like meat \u2014\u00a0sorry, vegetarians in the world!\"",
      "\u201cBut I still splurge. The other night I had a frozen yogurt with my daughter, and it was magical,\" added the Grammy winner, who shares daughter River Rose, 10, and son Remington, 8, with ex-husband Brandon Blackstock.",
      "Kelly Clarkson's thyroid and other health issues",
      "Clarkson has spoken before about her thyroid and autoimmune issues and trying to lose weight to address them.",
      "For example, she changed her diet and ended up losing about 37 pounds,\u00a0she told TODAY\u2019s Hoda Kotb in 2018.",
      "\u201cI know the industry loves the weight gone, but for me, it wasn\u2019t really the weight,\u201d Clarkson said at the time.",
      "Back then, to lose the weight, Clarkson focused on a lectin-free diet, she told Extra. Lectins are the proteins that bind carbohydrates. (Talk to a health professional before making any major changes to your diet, such as removing carbs.)",
      "Clarkson read a book about lectins and cut them out of her diet which meant no legumes, beans, whole grains, dairy and certain veggies.",
      "\"I literally read this book, and I did it for this autoimmune disease that I had and I had a thyroid issue, and now all my levels are back up,\" she said during the interview. \"Literally, I haven\u2019t worked out at all.\"",
      "During a January 2024 episode of her talk show, she revealed\u00a0she was prediabetic.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t shocked,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cI was a tiny bit overweight. ... They were like, \u2018You\u2019re prediabetic. You\u2019re right on the borderline.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018But I\u2019m not there yet.\u2019\u201d",
      "Two years after finding out, she decided to change her lifestyle habits.",
      "Having\u00a0prediabetes\u00a0means your blood sugar levels are higher than normal but still lower than the range for Type 2 diabetes, according to the\u00a0Cleveland Clinic. Exercise and a healthy diet can help reduce the risk of it progressing.",
      "Kelly Clarkson's weight struggles",
      "Throughout her years in Hollywood, the \"American Idol\" star has had to deal with a lot of commentary about her size.",
      "She told Glamour UK in 2020 that being thin doesn't always give her more confidence, adding that she got her coaching role on \"The Voice\" after gaining some weight.",
      "\u201cI got on the No. 1 television show at my heaviest point, because it was right after I had kids, and it was like they didn\u2019t care,\u201d Clarkson said.",
      "\u201cPaul (Telegdy, chairman of NBC Entertainment) hired me from NBC because he loved my personality, he loved that I connect with people and I\u2019m really raw and real. It had nothing to do with my sex appeal or my look aesthetically. It had to do with me as a person. I think it\u2019s really up to artists to force people to have that mentality.\u201d",
      "Clarkson and TODAY's Jenna Bush Hager bonded over weight struggles when Jenna and her twin sister, Barbara Pierce Bush, appeared on \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" in November 2023.",
      "During the conversation, Clarkson showed a photo of Jenna and Barbara dressed identically as kids.",
      "\u201cThose drop waist things were popular,\u201d Jenna said of the dresses she and her sister were wearing in the pic. Clarkson interjected, \u201cWhich is not good for girls with curves later on.\u201d",
      "After Jenna remarked that she and Barbara \u201cwere chubby\u201d as children, Barbara agreed: \u201cWell, there was a stage.\"",
      "Clarkson then gave Jenna a high-five, joking, \u201cI\u2019ve had many stages.\u201d"

      "\u201cIf I win it, I think I\u2019m going to just put it right by the crib, so they have no choice but to think I\u2019m cool all the time,\u201d Swims tells TODAY.com with a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be my little treat in the nursery.\u201d",
      "The \u201cthey\u201d he\u2019s referring to is the future son or daughter he\u2019s expecting with girlfriend Raiche Wright: something the singer-songwriter is completely over the moon about.",

      "It\u2019s the first for the 32-year-old, as is the Grammy nod, a milestone Swims says he\u2019s been envisioning for years.",
      "\u201cI always say that there\u2019s a fine line between manifestation and delusion. I think you have to have that to get there,\u201d he says during the sit-down interview. \u201cSo, I definitely saw it, forever, since I was a kid. I was like, \u2018I will.\u2019 There\u2019s no other option but to be in that. So, I think I manifested that.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s been an evolution for the musician who says he once believed that achieving success was the key to finding happiness.",
      "\u201cI had to do a lot of self-work and self-love for myself, learn and grow, because when I was younger, when I was first starting to get into this, I always told myself if I was able to do music for a living or get to this point, that I would feel better,\u201d he explains.",
      "\u201cIf there was enough people that loved me and said I was beautiful or if I had the finances taken care of, (then) all this negative stuff in my life would go away.\u201d",

      "\u201cI had to do a lot of self-work to understand that things aren\u2019t going to heal you \u2014 that following your dream, or achieving your dream, is not going to heal you. You\u2019ve got to be able to look at yourself and love yourself. And that took some work for sure.\u201d",
      "'This is the best rookie class ever'",
      "Though he wouldn\u2019t mind taking home a Grammy, Swims says he\u2019s just fine if he doesn\u2019t win, explaining that as far as he\u2019s concerned, he\u2019s already won.",
      "\u201cEverybody (nominated are) legacy artists, and I think this is the best rookie class ever in my opinion, so I\u2019m just happy to be a part of the conversation. And my mom and dad will be there, too,\u201d says Swims. \u201cThat\u2019s my win right there \u2014 watching my parents be like, \u2018Hell, yeah!\u2019 That\u2019s enough.\u201d",
      "That said, it\u2019s also OK if he does win.",
      "\u201cI would like to win, I\u2019d like to have it,\u201d he says, explaining that he\u2019d like the acknowledgment for both his dad and his future child. \u201cI think my dad\u2019s the coolest guy in the world, and I just hope my kid thinks I\u2019m as cool and talks about me, like I talk about my dad.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s his father who\u2019s been a supporter from the beginning, and who Swims called upon hearing the news of his Grammy nomination. The singer posted a video of the moment in November on Instagram, writing, \u201cDaddy I love you. You\u2019re the first person I\u2019ll always call! I can\u2019t stop crying!

      "\u201cThe Brutalist\u201d has become an awards season frontrunner, praised for its portrayal of a brilliant architect and Holocaust survivor who seeks a new life in the United States.",
      "The period epic is largely set in the 1950s and in many ways, its production revels in the the aesthetics of a bygone era: it was filmed using vintage VistaVision cameras and it includes a built-in intermission, a feature more associated with old classics like \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d and \u201cBen- Hur.\u201d",
      "At the same time, \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d has sparked controversy for something decidedly modern: its use of artificial intelligence.",
      "Some viewers have criticized the drama, which recently scored 10 Oscar nominations, for its use of AI to alter the Hungarian accents of stars Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones.",
      "The film\u2019s director and editor have defended their use of AI, arguing that the technology was not exploitative, but was merely employed to enhance their sound-editing abilities in post-production.",
      "Keep reading to learn more about the AI controversy surrounding \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d",
      "How exactly was AI used in \u2018The Brutalist\u2019?",
      "Artificial intelligence was used in \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d to enhance the Hungarian accents of stars Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones.",
      "The movie\u2019s editor, D\u00e1vid Jancs\u00f3, said that while Brody and Jones spoke Hungarian in the movie, AI was used at times to tweak their pronunciation of certain difficult vowels.",
      "\u201cI am a native Hungarian speaker and I know that it is one of the most difficult languages to learn to pronounce. \u2026 It\u2019s an extremely unique language,\u201d\u00a0 Jancs\u00f3 said in a recent interview with film technology website RedShark. \u201cWe coached (Brody and Jones) and they did a fabulous job but we also wanted to perfect it so that not even locals will spot any difference.\u201d",
      "Jancs\u00f3 added that he and his team first tried using ADR, or automated dialogue replacement, to fix certain Hungarian sounds. ADR is commonly used in filmmaking, and it involves re-recording pieces of dialogue and syncing them with actors\u2019 visual performances to improve sound quality.",
      "The use of ADR wasn\u2019t successful in \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d Jancs\u00f3 said, and he added that attempts to completely dub Brody and Jones\u2019 dialogue using the voices of other actors \u201cjust didn\u2019t work.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, filmmakers worked with a Ukrainian software company, Respeecher, to generate certain pieces of the stars\u2019 Hungarian dialogue using AI.",
      "Jancs\u00f3 says he even contributed his own voice for some of the pronunciations.",
      "\u201cMost of their Hungarian dialogue has a part of me talking in there. We were very careful about keeping their performances,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly just replacing letters here and there. You can do this in ProTools yourself, but we had so much dialogue in Hungarian that we really needed to speed up the process otherwise we\u2019d still be in post.\u201d",
      "RedShark also reported that Generative AI, or GenAI, was used to create architectural drawings and buildings near the end of the film. However, the film\u2019s director, Brady Corbet, later told Deadline that AI was not used in this way in the movie, and that all images \u201cwere hand-drawn by artists.\u201d",
      "Why was there controversy about the use of AI in 'The Brutalist'?Some viewers have criticized the use of AI in \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d arguing that it undercuts the film\u2019s authenticity.",
      "\u201cGenuinely crushed by the AI scandal surrounding the brutalist,\u201d one person wrote on X. \u201cI get wanting the hungarian dialect portrayed in the movie to be perfect and authentic, but doesn\u2019t using AI completely undo any \u2018authenticity\u2019 that you set out to accomplish right away?\u201d",
      "Another X user argued that Brody \u2014 who won a Golden Globe and has been nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u00f3th \u2014 should not be eligible for these accolades because his Hungarian accent was digitally altered.",
      "\u201cMy take on The Brutalist AI thing is it\u2019s a slippery slope to award Adrian Brody knowing his accent was edited with AI,\u201d the user wrote. \u201cIMO altering a performance with AI like that should automatically disqualify someone from these awards shows.\u201d",
      "Others questioned why native Hungarian speakers weren\u2019t cast in the main roles.",
      "\u201cThe brutalist and its actors should\u2019ve become ineligible the minute it came out that AI was used on their voices to help them produce a more authentic\u2019 hungarian accent when there are hungarian actors and speakers in the industry they could\u2019ve used instead,\u201d an X user wrote.",
      "Others on social media defending the film\u2019s use of AI, arguing that enhancing actors\u2019 Hungarian pronunciation did not detract from their performances.",
      "\u201cMy take on Adrien Brody\u2019s AI-helped accent in The Brutalist: it\u2019s complicated. On one hand, it slightly diminishes the detailing, but I can\u2019t say the accent was a deciding factor in his performance\u2019s resonance,\u201d one X user said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t moved by the accent; I was moved by how he conveyed emotion.\u201d",
      "Others argued that using AI to tweak the dialogue in post-production was just a form of clever sound editing.",
      "\u201cI love how the filmmakers went to extra lengths to coach, explore variants of ADR, and then discovered this as the best, subtle and sensitive solution. Brody and Jones don\u2019t seem to have any concerns either \u2014 it\u2019s just good old sound editing, accelerated,\u201d one X user said.",
      "Another X user argued that the film\u2019s use of artificial intelligence was a \u201cgreat example of using AI tools to enhance well-known art creation process, not replace it!\u201d",
      "Ethical questions around the use of AI in the entertainment industry have come to the forefront in recent years.",
      "When writers and actors went on strike in 2023, they demanded stricter regulations around the use of AI, seeking protection for artists whose work or likenesses are used as source material for AI, such as to create AI \u201cdeepfakes.\u201d",
      "Fran Drescher, president of SAG-AFTRA, a labor union that represents about 160,000 people in the entertainment industry, called AI an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the creative professions.",
      "\u201cAll actors and performers deserve contract language that protects them from having their identity and talent exploited without consent and pay,\u201d she said in a July 2023 open letter.",
      "\"The Brutalist\" isn't the only Oscar contender this year to draw attention for its use of AI.",
      "AI was used to enhance the singing of the \u201cEmilia Perez\u2019s\u201d star, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, blending her voice with the vocals of French singer Camille, sound supervisor Cyril Holtz said in interview at the Cannes Film Festival.",
      "What have the filmmakers said?",
      "After controversy erupted online about the use of AI in \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d director Brady Corbet defended his use of AI, and the film's stars, in a statement to Deadline. TODAY.com has reached out to Corbet for comment.",
      "\u201cAdrien and Felicity\u2019s performances are completely their own. They worked for months with dialect coach Tanera Marshall to perfect their accents,\u201d he said.",
      "He added that AI technology was only used \u201cspecifically to refine certain vowels and letters for accuracy.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo English language was changed,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was a manual process, done by our sound team and Respeecher in post-production. The aim was to preserve the authenticity of Adrien and Felicity\u2019s performances in another language, not to replace or alter them and done with the utmost respect for the craft.\u201d",
      "He also said that while RedShark originally reported that generative AI had been used to create certain architectural drawings and buildings seen in the movie, this was not the case.",
      "\u201cJudy Becker and her team did not use AI to create or render any of the buildings. All images were hand-drawn by artists,\u201d he told Deadline. \u201cTo clarify, in the memorial video featured in the background of a shot, our editorial team created pictures intentionally designed to look like poor digital renderings circa 1980.\u201d",
      "Jancs\u00f3 also reflected on the film\u2019s use of AI in his interview with RedShark, arguing that he and his team used AI simply to enhance traditional filmmaking techniques.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the film using AI that hasn\u2019t been done before. It just makes the process a lot faster,\u201d he said. \u201cWe use AI to create these tiny little details that we didn\u2019t have the money or the time to shoot.\u201d"

Hamas had not provided the names of the first hostages it planned to free that afternoon, so Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered airstrikes to continue.",

Sama struggles to keep up with the older girls, wiping sweat and dust from her eyes as she approaches the camera.",
      "\u201cShe had been asking for more than two months to eat a banana,\u201d Hanan said. \u201cI took her and bought her a small banana. She wanted pizza, so I bought her a small piece for 2 shekels (55 cents). I told her to eat it in the street so that her siblings wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was afraid they might die wanting something they couldn\u2019t have,\u201d she added.",
      "The Israeli strike that killed Sama occurred on President Joe Biden\u2019s last full day in office, and such attacks were a source of ongoing tension between his administration and Netanyahu\u2019s government.",
      "The police in Gaza fall under the Hamas-controlled Interior Ministry, and enforce laws set by the militant group after it took control of the Strip in 2007. Israel considers members of the police force to be Hamas terrorists and legitimate military targets, even though some officers also carry out more mundane duties like traffic enforcement and crime prevention.",
      "So the Israel Defense Forces repeatedly targeted police officers early in its 15-month military campaign, which it launched after Hamas killed 1,200 people and took around 250 hostage in the Oct. 7, terrorist attack, according to Israeli tallies.",

    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Few people understand what may be going through the minds of North Korean soldiers fighting and dying for Russia in the war against Ukraine. But Lee Chul Eun is one of them.",
      "Lee, 38, a North Korean defector and former soldier now living in South Korea, said it is \u201cdevastating\u201d to see troops from the reclusive, communist-ruled North being sent abroad by leader Kim Jong Un, \u201conly to then give up their youth for a land that is not even theirs but the foreign land of Russia.\u201d",
      "He is one of multiple defectors who spoke to NBC News about the training, conditions and mindset of North Korean soldiers, including their willingness to take their own lives if necessary.",
      "Lee said his former colleagues \u201care essentially just sent out to be cannon fodder on the front lines.\u201d",
      "For the first time since they arrived in Russia in the fall, North Korean soldiers have been captured alive by Ukrainian forces, with video and photos showing one man with bandages around his jawline and another with bandaged hands.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who announced the prisoners\u2019 apprehension earlier this month, said they were living proof that North Korea had entered the war, in a major escalation of the yearslong conflict.",
      "The U.S. and allies say there are more than 11,000 North Korean troops fighting in the Russian region of Kursk, where Ukrainian forces launched a cross-border incursion in August. Neither Moscow nor Pyongyang has confirmed the reports.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it is not easy to capture a North Korean soldier,\u201d Ryu Sung Hyu said in an interview in the South Korean capital, Seoul.",
      "All North Korean recruits are taught a song that includes a verse about saving their last bullet for themselves to avoid capture, said Ryu, who served in the North Korean military until 2019, when he escaped to freedom in South Korea.",
      "According to South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service, there was at least one recent incident in which a North Korean soldier, faced with possible capture by Ukrainian forces, tried to detonate a grenade while shouting Kim\u2019s name but was killed before he could succeed.",
      "The South Korean military said last week that North Korea is preparing to send additional troops to Russia after about 300 of its soldiers were killed and 2,700 others were injured. The high casualty rate was due to the soldiers\u2019 poor understanding of modern warfare, as well as the way they were being deployed by Russia, South Korean lawmakers said.",
      "Their willingness to fight and die for Russia could be a major factor in determining the course of the Ukraine war, as well as the level of American military aid to Ukraine under President Donald Trump, who has expressed skepticism over continued U.S. support.Kim is thought to be providing Russian President Vladimir Putin with troops and weapons in hope of receiving technical assistance with his nuclear and ballistic missile programs. His flurry of weapons testing has continued with three launches already this year, including multiple short-range ballistic missiles, a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile and strategic cruise missiles.",
      "Trump drew ire from South Korea on Tuesday after he described the reclusive regime as a \u201cnuclear power,\u201d a phrase that U.S. officials have long refrained from using, as it could signal recognition of North Korea as a nuclear-armed state.",
      "Kim is sending troops to Russia for two reasons, \u201cboth of which are driven by desperation,\u201d said Ahn Chan Il, who served in the North Korean military for over a decade and defected to South Korea in 1979. The first is to earn foreign currency, which is in short supply in North Korea under United Nations sanctions imposed over its weapons programs.The deployment also provides valuable experience for the North Korean military, which has not been deployed overseas since the Vietnam War.",
      "Dorothy Camille Shea, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told the Security Council this month that fighting alongside Russia makes North Korea \u201cmore capable of waging war against its neighbors.\u201d",
      "Lee, who spent five years in the North Korean military, said the troops had been sent to Russia as mercenaries rather than soldiers, noting that they weren\u2019t wearing their uniforms. South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service has said they were given Russian military uniforms and Russian-made weapons, along with forged identification documents.",
      "\u201cEven if they die there it does not matter, because North Korea sent them out without officially recognizing them,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey were sent there not to bring honor to the country, but to give up their lives and bring back lots of money.\u201d",
      "'No longer a part of the society'",
      "Military service is compulsory in North Korea, which has one of the world\u2019s largest standing armies. Soldiers undergo three months of basic training before being assigned to a unit, said Lee, who came to South Korea in 2016 after swimming for six hours from the North.",
      "\u201cAs soldiers,\u201d Lee said, \u201cthey are told they are individuals who are now no longer a part of the society and their families, and must follow the orders of the supreme leader,\u201d meaning Kim.",
      "They have no trouble believing this, having been indoctrinated by North Korean propaganda from childhood, said Lee.",
      "North Korean soldiers spend most of their time not actually being soldiers but working on farms and construction projects, Lee and others said.",
      "\u201cI think I only fired three bullets per year,\u201d said Lee Hyun-seung, who served in the North Korean military for more than three years. When he moved to a more elite unit, he said, \u201cwe had more like 20 bullets.\u201dAsked whether he thought the North Korean troops could help Russia win the war, Lee \u2014 whose family defected in 2014 and who now lives in the U.S. \u2014 was skeptical.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not that sure,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I know their training and I know they are not well trained.\u201d",
      "For North Korean soldiers, who receive food and clothing but are otherwise essentially unpaid, the main enemy is hunger.",
      "North Korea struggles with food shortages as Kim devotes the majority of resources to his weapons programs, meaning that, like most of the broader population, soldiers suffer from malnutrition and can even starve to death.",
      "Meals are made up mainly of plain rice, corn or potatoes, sometimes mixed with grass or even tree bark, said Lee Chun Eul.",
      "He said his feelings about North Korea changed gradually, largely due to his exposure to foreign media that finds its way into the country despite tight government controls \u2014 \u201cJames Bond\u201d was a favorite of his growing up in the 1990s. More recently, the North Korean government has been alarmed by the popularity of South Korean TV dramas, sentencing two teenagers to 12 years of hard labor for watching them.",
      "\u201cWhen I look at North Korean mercenaries sent to Russia, I wonder if they would still have joined if they had watched as much foreign media as I did in North Korea,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI also wonder if the North Korean regime and Kim Jong Un\u2019s dictatorship would still be in place.\u201d",
      "The defectors say they hope the North Korean troops fighting in Russia will take the opportunity to leave like they did.",
      "\u201cWhen North Korean workers, who have lived their entire lives trapped in a restrictive system, experience life abroad, they come to see North Korea as nothing short of a prison,\u201d Ahn said. \u201cOnce they realize what freedom could mean, it\u2019s hard to imagine they wouldn\u2019t consider breaking free to live a freer life.\u201dIn addition to finding freedom, they could provide the U.S. and others with valuable intelligence regarding the North Korean military\u2019s strategies and capabilities, which are often exaggerated by the North Korean government.",
      "Ahn and other North Koreans who defected as soldiers have offered Ukraine their assistance against the North Korean troops.",
      "\u201cHowever, rather than directly participating in the war, our focus is on psychological warfare to change the mindset of North Korean soldiers,\u201d he said. \u201cThrough platforms like YouTube or leaflets, we aim to deliver messages to the North Korean troops, urging them not to die meaningless deaths and instead seek freedom.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, they watch with heavy hearts as casualties mount among North Korean soldiers whose experiences they know only too well.",
      "\u201cThese young people did not go knowing they were going to die,\u201d Lee said, \u201cbut died because they did not know.",

      "Inside the Auschwitz concentration camp complex, the soldiers liberated roughly 7,000 prisoners who had been brutalized by a Nazi regime hell-bent on exterminating the Jewish people. The horrors there defied comprehension.",
      "Eighty years later, some former prisoners returned to mark the 80th anniversary of their deliverance \u2014 a date that is known as International Holocaust Remembrance Day.",
      "In the eyes of so many around the world, the survivors\u2019 very existence is a resounding act of defiance against the world-historic cruelty and vast injustice of Adolf Hitler\u2019s reign of terror. Their stories of survival are also implicit pleas to the world: Never forget humanity\u2019s capacity to commit unthinkable crimes.",
      "Hitler\u2019s regime systematically murdered 6 million Jews during World War II, including roughly 1 million people at Auschwitz. The Nazis also persecuted other peoples, including Poles, the Romani, Soviet prisoners, gay men and mentally and physically disabled people.",
      "The Nazis tried to hide evidence of the genocide they perpetrated, including burning the remains of roughly 900,000 Auschwitz victims who were killed in the gas chambers.",
      "Eva Umlauf was only 2 when she and her mother were liberated from the camp \u2014 too young to remember the actual day. But the Holocaust is etched onto her skin \u2014 A-26,959 tattooed on her left forearm, marking her for life, along with some other Auschwitz survivors.",
      "\u201cYou are just a number,\u201d Umlauf, 82, a pediatrician from Munich, told NBC News, explaining how this number will forever make her feel. \u201cBut this number is not only on the skin. This is deeper.\u201d",
      "For Umlauf, who traveled for the ceremony along with her sister, her son and one of her grandchildren, this was more than a personal journey of memory and reflection. It was a moral responsibility.",
      "\u201cThey have to know that it\u2019s true. You know, because it\u2019s so, so unbelievable, unbelievable that nobody can believe this,\u201d she said.",
      "But even given what has been established about the Third Reich\u2019s crimes against humanity, some of the most vital information has still not been uncovered. Notably, the names of more than a million Jews slaughtered by the Nazis are still unknown, according to Yad Vashem, Israel\u2019s official Holocaust memorial center.",
      "Alexander Avram leads a team at Yad Vashem that has amassed more than 2 million \u201cPages of Testimony\u201d and historical documents to verify more identities. The project is known as the Hall of Names.",
      "\u201cThere are no cemeteries, there are no tombstones \u2026 for most of the Holocaust victims,\u201d Avram told NBC News. \u201cEach additional name that we can recover is, for us, another victory against the Nazis, because the Nazis didn\u2019t [only] want to \u2026 exterminate the Jews physically. They wanted to obliterate even their memory.\u201d",
      "Avram said researchers have started experimenting with artificial intelligence to scour testimonial documents in hope of finding names that might have been overlooked. But that technology is useless without firsthand accounts provided by the shrinking pool of survivors.",
      "The Claims Conference estimates that only 1,000 survivors of Auschwitz are still alive. In that regard, Avram\u2019s team is \u201cin a rush against time,\u201d he said.",
      "The anniversary comes at a troubling and unsettled time. Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack on Israel, Israel\u2019s ensuing war in Gaza and the proliferation of hate speech on social media have fueled a worldwide spike in antisemitism.",
      "In some countries, basic knowledge of the Holocaust is eroding.",
      "The Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, a nonprofit organization that helps Holocaust victims seek compensation, released an eight-country survey last week showing that 46% of adults ages 18-29 in France, for example, \u201chad not heard or weren\u2019t sure if they had heard of the Holocaust prior to taking the survey.\u201d",
      "Nearly half of Americans surveyed were unable to name a single Nazi camp, according to the Claims Conference\u2019s findings, and more than a quarter (26%) of Americans ages 18-29 disagreed with the following statement: \u201cThe Holocaust happened, and the number of Jews who were killed during the Holocaust has been accurately and fairly described.\u201d",
      "World leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, flew in for Monday\u2019s commemoration. Top dignitaries, including Britain's King Charles III, attended, as well.",
      "\u201cWe really believe that this is the last milestone anniversary where we\u2019ll have a visible group of survivors who are still able to tell us their stories,\u201d Pawe\u0142 Sawicki, deputy spokesman for the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum, said in an interview at the camp Saturday.",
      "\u201cThe choice for this year\u2019s anniversary was very simple: We need to put them into the spotlight,\u201d he added.",
      "In recent statements, Western heads of state have tried to underscore the importance of preserving the historical memory of the Holocaust, known in Hebrew as the Shoah.",
      "\u201cI am against turning the page, saying that was long ago,\u201d German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said at a gathering of the Jewish community in Frankfurt this month. \u201cWe keep alive the memory of the civilizational split of the Shoah committed by Germans, which we pass down to each generation in our country again and again.\u201d",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer visited the grounds of Auschwitz on Jan. 17, describing the \u201csheer horror\u201d he felt there and vowing to fight the rising tide of antisemitism in his country.",
      "Roughly 50 survivors of Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps attended Monday\u2019s commemoration. In recent days, hundreds of visitors from around the world have come to the former camp to pay their respects.",
      "Josh Sesar, 52, of Los Angeles, who made his second trip to Auschwitz on Friday, said he believed it is vital to see the grounds firsthand.",

      "\u201cIt is scary, because there are not so many survivors left, and so when there [are] no survivors, people even more so try to discredit history,\u201d he added.",
      "Aron Krell, 98, a Holocaust survivor who was imprisoned at Auschwitz and ultimately liberated from the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria, said it is incumbent on Jewish people, educators, historians and other advocates to keep the legacy of the Shoah intact.",

In the nearby Baltic Sea, NATO ships are hunting Russia\u2019s so-called \u201cShadow Fleet\u201d accused of cutting undersea communications cables. And in Europe\u2019s skies there are plans to construct a vast missile defense system, similar to Israel\u2019s \u201cIron Dome\u201d but with the explicit purpose of shooting down rockets launched by Moscow.",
      "European governments and citizens worry that an emboldened Kremlin may turn his armies their way after Ukraine. There is also widespread nervousness that the new U.S. president \u2014 an isolationist \u2014 has suggested he may not defend America\u2019s historical NATO allies if they are attacked by Russia.",
      "While President Donald Trump this week criticized Vladimir Putin,  Trump has showed few signs of a meaningful shift from that position. On Thursday, he said in an interview with Fox News that Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201cwas fighting a much bigger entity,\u201d and that \u201che shouldn\u2019t have done that, because we could have made a deal.\u201d",
      "He said little new about NATO or Europe, only reiterating his latest demand for European allies to pay 5% of their GDP toward defense \u2014 more than twice the NATO recommendation \u2014 and lamenting how much more Washington has spent than Brussels toward supporting Ukraine\u2019s defense.",
      "\u201cNATO has to pay more,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous because it affects them a lot more. We have an ocean in between.\u201d",
      "The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. European officials have repeatedly stated that Putin is preparing for a war with the West. For many, this is already happening, with think tank analysts, governments and NATO itself accusing Moscow of \u201chybrid warfare\u201d attacks \u2014 from election interference to trying to crash airliners with firebombs.",
      "\u201cThe Europeans are taking this very seriously,\u201d said retired Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges, the former commander of the U.S. Army in Europe between 2014 and late 2017.",
      "In particular, countries in Eastern Europe nearer the Russian border \u201cknow that this is for real, because they live there,\u201d Hodges added. \u201cIt\u2019s only those people who live in Western Europe or the U.S., far away from the Bear, who say: \u2018Come on, this is not going to happen.\u2019\u201d",
      "The core tenet of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is that allies will defend any fellow member under attack. The only time this \u201cArticle 5\u201d promise has been triggered was after 9/11, when Europe helped the United States patrol its skies in an act of solidarity. The main message of that stipulation is that if a country attacks Europe, it will also be at war with Washington, and its intended audience is Russia.",
      "But Trump has repeatedly suggested he would ignore Europe\u2019s distress call.",
      "Plenty of those in Europe\u2019s corridors of power agree that a complacent continent has for too long relied on Washington\u2019s protection. French President Emmanuel Macron, a longtime proponent of European self-reliance,\u00a0said Monday that Trump\u2019s second term should serve as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d for the continent.",
      "In comments made at a defense conference on Wednesday, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, agreed with Trump\u2019s assessment of European spending, saying that \u201cRussia poses an existential threat to our security today, tomorrow and for as long as we underinvest in our defense.\u201d",
      "Many of these critics remain nonetheless alarmed.",
      "\u201cWhile every president has complained that European countries don\u2019t do enough, there never was a question about American commitment,\u201d said Hodges. \u201cThis causes a lot of anxiety.\u201d",
      "In the short term, Trump and key members of his incoming administration have vowed to quickly end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, likely impossible without huge territorial concessions from Kyiv. Effectively giving Russia a win would be a signal to the Kremlin that aggression is rewarded and the West has no appetite to intervene, critics say.",
      "\u201cRussia is preparing for a war with the West,\u201d German foreign intelligence chief Bruno Kahl said in a November speech.",
      "For years, experts and government officials have accused Moscow of spreading disinformation, launching cyberattacks and using any other means necessary to meddle in the elections of democratic countries.",
      "Though Moscow denies it. Western officials and experts are near united in agreeing that this campaign only seems to be expanding.",
      "Last month, Finnish authorities seized an oil tanker they suspected of having severed undersea power and internet cables. That was among a spate of incidents that prompted NATO to launch operation \u201cBaltic Sentry,\u201d stepping up maritime patrols.",
      "Meanwhile, Western officials said Russia was responsible for sending two incendiary devices to DHL logistics hubs in Germany and the United Kingdom in July as part of a wider sabotage campaign to possibly start fires aboard North America-bound aircraft.",
      "In response, Europe has reversed decades of military underfunding, with most of its big powers now hitting the NATO guideline of 2% of GDP spent on defense. Spending started to increase in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea, although Trump is widely credited for accelerating it.",
      "On Wednesday, the European Union\u2019s defense commissioner, Andrius Kubilius, announced that Lithuania intends to spend between 5% and 6% of its GDP on defense in the coming years.",
      "Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has focused minds further.",
      "In March, the European Union allocated 500 million euros (around $515 million) to double shell ammunition production to 2 million units per year. And 22 countries have now joined the European Sky Shield Initiative, a continentwide missile defense system designed to protect against Russian attacks.",
      "\u201cEurope must be prepared for the most extreme military contingencies,\u201d a spokesperson for the bloc told NBC News in an email when asked whether the continent was preparing for a worst-case scenario of war with Russia. \u201cPut simply: to prevent war we need to spend more. If we wait more, it\u2019ll cost us more.\u201d",
      "Asked if that change was prompted by Trump\u2019s suggestion he may not defend Europe as well as Putin, the spokesperson referred only to the Russian president, whose war in Ukraine they said \u201cchallenges the international rules-based order itself.\u201d",
      "For its part, Ukraine\u2019s reaction to the re-election and inauguration of Trump has been assiduously diplomatic. On Inauguration Day, Zelenskyy said in a post on X that Trump \u201cis always decisive\u201d and that his second term was an opportunity to \u201cachieve a long-term and just peace.\u201d",
      "Whatever the impetus, \u201cthe mindset has changed big time,\u201d said Vytis Jurkonis, who leads the Lithuanian office of Freedom House, an international pro-democracy group.",
      "\u201cWe need to make it very clear to the Kremlin that any attack against a NATO member is going to cost and have consequences,\u201d said Jurkonis, who also teaches politics at Lithuania\u2019s Vilnius University.",
      "The Baltic countries of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are particularly vulnerable, perched on the Baltic Sea between mainland Russia and the heavily militarized Russian exclave of Kaliningrad.",
      "For decades occupied by the Soviet Union, these now-Westernized states are only now constructing \u201cthe Baltic Defense Line,\u201d a frontier hundreds of miles long dotted with anti-tank trenches and pillboxes. Lithuania has already purchased warehouses full of \u201cdragon\u2019s teeth\u201d \u2014 concrete pyramids designed to stop tanks \u2014 and plans to mine its bridges to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, its defense ministry told NBC News.",
      "Lithuania recently said it would raise defense spending to 5% of GDP, the highest in NATO and far more, proportionally, than Washington\u2019s 3.4%. That\u2019s still lower than Russia, with the Kremlin effectively reordering its economy along a war footing and committing at least 6.2% of its inflation-hit finances to its military.",
      "In western Scandinavia, meanwhile, Norway has updated its emergency preparedness booklet that it hands out to all citizens, telling them how much water, food and other supplies to stockpile in case of \u201cacts of war.\u201d The 20-page document has historically focused on extreme weather and accidents, but its most recent version notes that \u201cwe live in an increasingly turbulent world\u201d and warns that \u201cin the event of an act of war, you may be notified that you should seek shelter.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Swedish church authorities \u2014 on guidance from Sweden\u2019s armed forces \u2014 have begun looking for extra cemetery space should such a conflict reach their shores. And Germany committed around 100 million euros to reinstate public sirens that were removed when the Iron Curtain fell.",
      "And yet there are plenty of observers who believe that Europe is not doing nearly enough.",
      "Western European countries such as Germany, France and the United Kingdom have only committed \u201csmall percentage uplifts to defense budgets, which is nothing like the transformative investment\u201d in Eastern Europe, said Keir Giles, a leading defense analyst at London\u2019s Chatham House think tank.",
      "For Giles, author of \u201cWho Will Defend Europe? An Awakened Russia and a Sleeping Continent,\u201d the problem is that \u201ccountries further away are still pretending that war is something that happens to other people.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s more, efforts are further complicated by the political situation. Europe\u2019s mainstream parties are being challenged by populists, who often mix their vehement opposition to immigration with a softer \u2014 and sometimes even friendly \u2014 stance toward Russia.",
      "That\u2019s a problem for those who argue Russia\u2019s war on Europe has already begun.",
      "\u201cAnybody who isn\u2019t worried hasn\u2019t been paying attention,\u201d said Giles."

    "story": [
      "BEIJING \u2014 For women in China, it may feel as if there is little to laugh about these days.",
      "The world\u2019s second-largest economy is struggling to recover from the pandemic, and the government is cracking down on feminist activism as it encourages women to embrace \u201ctraditional\u201d female roles as wives and mothers.",
      "But women were laughing nonetheless, as amateur performers told jokes about office and family life to a small but engaged audience of about 20 people, mostly young women, at a Western restaurant in Beijing on a recent winter evening.",
      "Alex Wang, the only female performer out of about half a dozen that night, said she felt \u201cempowered\u201d when she first got on stage a few years ago.",
      "Though \u201cbeing funny is the most important thing,\u201d she said in an interview after her performance, \u201cI want to grow not just as a comedian but as a woman finding her voice in this space.\u201d",
      "The growing role of women in China\u2019s stand-up scene, along with the recent success of funny female-oriented films, reflect one way feminism is breaking into the Chinese mainstream: through comedy.",
      "The feminist movement is facing strong resistance in China, even as women attain new educational heights and make strides in the workplace.",
      "For the first time in decades, there is not a single woman among the 24 members of the Politburo, the senior leadership of the ruling Chinese Communist Party.\u00a0President Xi Jinping has personally called on women to embrace a \u201cchildbearing culture\u201d as the world\u2019s once-most-populous country struggles with low birth rates.",
      "The government has made no secret of its crackdown on feminist activity. In June, Chinese journalist and #MeToo activist Huang Xueqin was sentenced to five years in prison for subversion.",
      "But even Chinese state media had praise for \u201cHer Story,\u201d a feminist comedy directed by and starring women that was a box-office hit in China late last year. The state-run newspaper People\u2019s Daily lauded the film\u2019s portrayal of the \u201chumorous and absurd\u201d aspects of daily life.",
      "The film has been described as China\u2019s answer to the 2023 hit \u201cBarbie,\u201d openly calling out stereotypes about women, sexuality, single parenting and divorce \u2014 all issues that can be sensitive here.",
      "\u201cHer Story\u201d may be able to get around that in part because its social critique is couched in comedy, said Feng Yuan, the founding director of Beijing Equality, a women\u2019s rights and gender equality nongovernment organization.",
      "In addition to helping evade censors, comedy is a \u201chandy tool to speak out your anger,\u201d she said.",
      "The film tells the story of Wang Tiemei, a newly unemployed single mother of a 9-year-old daughter, and their young female neighbor Xiao Ye in Shanghai. Despite their different personalities, the two women form a strong bond as they navigate personal challenges, including Wang\u2019s abusive ex-husband.",
      "Its frank tone has also inspired discussions about female sexuality akin to those set off by recent U.S. films such as the Nicole Kidman-starring erotic thriller \u201cBabygirl.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare to see stories about single moms or just women\u2019s lives in general,\u201d Zhang Tong, 25, said at a Beijing theater last month after seeing \u201cHer Story,\u201d which she called \u201cquite moving.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will help more women, especially young women, understand themselves better and feel empowered to live for themselves,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cHer Story\u201d has made 720 million yuan ($99 million) since its release on Nov. 22, according to the Chinese box office site Maoyan, and has a score of 9.1 out of 10 on Douban, a Chinese film rating site.",
      "Though the film did not crack China\u2019s top 10 highest-grossing films last year, another movie directed by and starring women, \u201cYolo,\u201d topped the list at 3.4 billion yuan ($470 million). Its director, Chinese comedian Jia Ling, also directed the 2021 female-oriented comedy \u201cHi, Mom,\u201d which grossed more than 5.4 billion yuan ($742 million), making her the world\u2019s top-grossing female filmmaker until Greta Gerwig with \u201cBarbie.\u201d",
      "The success of these films marks a shift in the Chinese box office, the second-largest in the world after the United States, where the biggest movies have typically been male-dominated, patriotism-themed blockbusters.",
      "\u201cMy movie delivers something different from others, showing some novelty, so people like it,\u201d Shao Yihui, the director of \u201cHer Story,\u201d told state-run broadcaster CCTV.",
      "Women who perform stand-up comedy in China say they are also offering something different in an industry that only a few years ago was a sea of men.",
      "Wang said her jokes are informed partly by her experience as a woman.",
      "\u201cFor example, earlier I had a bit where I made fun of those awful guys who think everyone in the world is into them,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve also done material on topics like period stigma.\u201d",
      "She cited the influence of Yang Li, who is perhaps the most recognizable female figure in Chinese stand-up comedy. At her peak, she performed in front of millions of viewers on national television, delivering punchlines on the male psyche.",
      "\u201cI think what she and other everyday female comedians talk about, especially from a female perspective, really reflects the current state of society,\u201d Wang said. \u201cTheir material brings attention to issues women face, and you can clearly see how those jokes resonate with people.\u201d",
      "But they don\u2019t resonate with everyone.",
      "In October, Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com ended a promotional campaign featuring Yang after men offended by her ribbing flooded social media with complaints and accused of her of provoking \u201cgender antagonism,\u201d a term also used by Chinese state media to criticize feminism.",
      "As feminists have raised their voices in China, so have those with misogynist views, Feng said, and Yang made for a clear target.",
      "\u201cThey are always looking for some outlet to release their anger,\u201d she said.",
      "Chinese comedians say they have to be mindful of censors as well as fragile egos and cultural sensitivities. In 2023, a Chinese entertainment firm representing a stand-up comic was fined almost $2 million after he was accused of insulting the People\u2019s Liberation Army during a Beijing performance. The entire industry went to ground for more than a year, with stand-up comedy not returning to Chinese television until last fall.",
      "\u201cFor a Chinese audience, a lot of topics, it is kind of like we are not sure if we can laugh at that,\u201d said Nico Toomuch, 34, a stand-up comedian in Beijing.",
      "That hasn\u2019t stopped Toomuch, who has been performing since 2016, from joking about everything from marriage to menstruation and depression \u2014 drawing in part on her strengths as a woman.",
      "\u201cWe are more sensitive, emotional, and we are better at observing things,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we can take a joke, so we can deliver one.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Germany\u2019s opposition conservatives won parliamentary approval on Wednesday for a proposal to drastically restrict migration with the help of votes from the Alternative for Germany (AfD), breaking a taboo on cooperation with the far-right.",
      "The proposal is non-binding but the role of the\u00a0AfD\u00a0in passing them is symbolically important in Germany, which faces a national election on Feb. 23 in which the far-right party is tipped to emerge as the second largest after the conservatives.",
      "Friedrich Merz, the leader of Germany\u2019s CDU/CSU conservative bloc, is keen to seize the initiative on migration policy, which has shifted sharply back into focus after an Afghan asylum seeker was arrested over\u00a0deadly stabbings\u00a0last week.",
      "Merz presented two non-binding motions\u00a0in parliament calling for heightened security measures and the closure of German land borders to irregular migration,\u00a0prompting hours of emotionally charged debate in the Bundestag lower house.",
      "With Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s Social Democrats (SPD) and the Greens opposed to the motions, however, Merz\u00a0knew he would have\u00a0to rely on support of the\u00a0AfD.\u00a0The land border measure passed with a slim majority of just three votes, while the security proposal was rejected.",
      "Critics\u00a0including Scholz\u00a0argue that\u00a0Merz\u2019s tactics\u00a0shatter the taboo among mainstream parties\u00a0against\u00a0working with the\u00a0AfD\u00a0\u2014\u00a0a party which is monitored by German security services on suspicion of being right-wing extremist\u00a0\u2014\u00a0in an effort to keep it from power.",
      "\u201cSince the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany over 75 years ago, there has always been a clear consensus among all democrats: We do not make common cause with the extreme right,\u201d Scholz\u00a0said\u00a0in a speech to parliament.",
      "\u201cYou have broken this basic consensus of our republic in the heat of the moment,\u201d he told Merz.",

      "Abdassamad El Yazidi, head of the Central Council of Muslims, accused politicians of \u201cchasing the positions of the far-right on immigration\u201d.",
      "\u201cGroups with migrant backgrounds are being stigmatized. It\u2019s not just immoral but dangerous to social cohesion in our country,\u201d he said.",
      "Merz\u2019s move is likely to make coalition building after the election much more tricky. Some senior SPD and Greens politicians said he had proven himself unfit to govern.",
      "Merz, who aims to present a draft bill furthering the migration crackdown on Friday,\u00a0defended Wednesday\u2019s motions by saying\u00a0a decision was not wrong just because the \u201cwrong people\u201d supported it although it pained him to have to rely on the support of the\u00a0AfD.",
      "Merz has accused the SPD and Greens of blocking what he calls a necessary turnaround in asylum policy after the arrival in recent years of millions of asylum seekers fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Ukraine.",
      "The number of asylum seekers has dropped since Scholz\u2019s government pushed through a series of laws cracking down on migration in recent years and implemented more controls on the borders \u2014 but not enough, says Merz.",
      "Political analysts say that by\u00a0weakening the so-called firewall around the\u00a0AfD,\u00a0Merz\u00a0risks legitimizing the\u00a0far-right party\u00a0while scaring off centrist conservative voters.",
      "Support for the CDU/CSU dropped three points in the days after Merz promised a migration crackdown to 28%, according to a survey by\u00a0pollster Forsa\u00a0published on Tuesday. Scholz\u2019s SPD gained two points to 17% as did the\u00a0AfD, to 21%.",
      "The\u00a0AfD\u2019s candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, accused mainstream parties on Wednesday of disrespecting German voters\u00a0in their treatment of her party.",

      "Venezuelans in the U.S. will lose about one year of temporary protection from deportation outgoing President Joe Biden granted this month.",

      "Venezuelans who have had TPS since March 11, 2024, will see it end on Sept. 10 of this year.",
      "Temporary Protected Status is granted to people already in the United States who are unable to return to their country because of conditions there, such as natural disasters or political upheaval.",
      "People with TPS are not eligible to get on a path to citizenship unless sponsored by an employer or family member. The protection usually is valid for several months and has to be renewed by the president, who usually consults with DHS and the Department of State about the country's conditions. If the protection is renewed by the president, TPS beneficiaries must reapply for it.",
      "About 600,000 Venezuelans were eligible for extended TPS in January, when Biden extended the protection.",
      "Venezuela has been in the throes of an economic, humanitarian and political crisis that has driven millions of its citizens out of the country, many desperate for basic necessities such as food and safety.",
      "President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance had said during the campaign that they might scale back TPS and its implementation in order to carry out the mass deportations Trump pledged to his supporters."

      "Liang told 36Kr that he acquired the chips mostly because of \u201ccuriosity about the boundaries of AI capabilities\u201d and that he had no particular commercial goal in mind.",
      "The stock market rout took place a week after DeepSeek\u2019s Jan. 20 release of an open-source language model called R1, which met with widespread acclaim in what venture capitalist Marc Andreessen called \u201cAI\u2019s Sputnik moment.\u201d",

The model appears to operate without such restrictions, however, if it is used not through the DeepSeek website but on servers that host it outside mainland China.",
