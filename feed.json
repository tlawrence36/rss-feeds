      "John Oliver has brought his quirky humor to minor league baseball with the debut of the Erie Moon Mammoths",
      "ERIE, Pa. -- Besides being a fan, John Oliver has had a certain affinity for minor league baseball.",
      "On Saturday night, the comedian and host of HBO's \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d saw his latest crazy creation set out into the world as the Erie Moon Mammoths made their debut in front of a record crowd of 7,070 at UPMC Park.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sending our furry child out into the world and you are the custodian of it. Now, please be careful with our child,\u201d Oliver said a couple hours before the Moon Mammoths took the field against the Chesapeake Oyster Catchers.",
      "Oliver spotlighted Minor League Baseball promotions and alternate nicknames during \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d on May 4. At the end of the segment, Oliver invited teams to send in proposals why they should get rebranded by the show's staff.",
      "Forty-seven teams sent in pitches, including the Erie SeaWolves, the Double-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers.",
      "Erie president Greg Coleman sent a list of 11 reasons why they were the perfect candidate, including: \u201cThe SeaWolves play baseball nowhere near the sea.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo have so many teams expressing interest was really edifying. I think it kind of validates the fact that we thought there was something special about minor league baseball. We thought this would be a group of people that would respond to the ludicrous idea that we had,\u201d Oliver said.",
      "Erie was announced as the winner on May 18. After six weeks of research by Oliver and his staff, the Moon Mammoths were unveiled on June 29. That included the mascot named Fuzz, a purple woolly mammoth wearing a space helmet.",
      "\u201cErie did stand out to us as being, you know, uniquely eccentric. And I say that as both a compliment and an insult, which is the biggest compliment there is,\" Oliver said. \u201cThere was something about the Moon Mammoth that spoke to us for being particularly odd. It felt like it could make a baseball team's theme. You could almost see the logo in your head and it felt like something to be extra surprising.\u201d",
      "The fact that this came together in less than three months is a minor miracle. It usually takes 16 months for a team to have an alternate identity approved and then take the field.",
      "\u201cI thought we had a good chance when I sent it in. And then when we were selected it was a little surreal,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cAnd since then working with the \"Last Week Tonight\" team, they've been wonderful and detail oriented.\u201d",
      "The Moon Mammoths name was inspired by George Moon, who found the bone of a prehistoric mammoth while scuba diving in 1991. The remains are housed at the State Museum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg.",
      "Moon has become a regional celebrity since the rebranding was announced. He was at the game and caught the ceremonial first pitch from Oliver.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fun. I\u2019m enjoying it,\u201d Moon said. \u201cFrom all those years ago to today, I would never have thought anything like this would\u2019ve been possible. The newspaper did something on its 30th anniversary (in 2021). Other than that, I haven't heard much.\u201d",
      "Coleman said since the Moon Mammoths were unveiled, the team has done the equivalent of four years of online sales in three weeks. The line of people waiting to get into the team store, which was located in left field, stretched out to near home plate in the concourse area.",
      "Karyn Drombosky and Sean Mizerski drove from Pittsburgh and were wearing homemade tusks as they waited to get into the team store.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just great. We\u2019re big baseball fans. We see the Pirates all the time, and minor league games are fun. There\u2019s so much silliness,\u201d Drombosky said. \u201cWe watch John Oliver pretty regularly. We were like surprised but excited when we saw he picked the Erie team to take over.\u201d",
      "In addition to throwing out the first pitch, Oliver was a batboy during one inning and also led the crowd in \u201cTake Me Out to the Ballgame\u201d during the seventh inning stretch. The cap and jersey that Oliver wore for the first pitch are going to the Baseball Hall of Fame.",
      "Erie trailed 6-3 going into the bottom of the ninth but got within one run on Kevin McGonigle's two-run double. Chesapeake's Yaqui Rivera struck out Josue Brice\u00f1o with the bases loaded to end the game.",
      "\u201cThe atmosphere was great. Everything worked smoothly. It doesn\u2019t happen very often in minor league baseball to be able to have an event like that. It was a fun night for everyone,\u201d Erie manager Andrew Graham said.",
      "The Moon Mammoths will be back on Aug. 19 as well as Sept. 12 and 13. Coleman said there will be at least four Moon Mammoths games next season.",
      "\u201cI love minor league baseball. There is a special eccentricity to it,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cIt felt like a nice fit with our show because minor league baseball, as you know, is willing to try anything. That was proven by the fact that over half the league was willing to sight unseen, rebrand and put their trust in the hands of a group of people who are objectively untrustworthy. That\u2019s a bad decision, and it\u2019s that kind of bad decision making that I love about minor league baseball.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Renowned conductor Roger Norrington, known for his historically informed performances, has died at 91",
      "Roger Norrington, a conductor acclaimed for historically informed performances during more than a half-century leading orchestras in Europe and the United States, has died. He was 91.",
      "Norrington died Friday at his home, his son Tom said Saturday. Norrington lived outside Exeter, England.",
      "Norrington conducted both period-instruments and modern orchestras, asking both types to play without vibrato and usually at faster tempi than modern practice.",
      "\u201cHe was an extraordinary dramatist. He made things happen emotionally,\u201d Myron Lutzke, an Orchestra of St. Luke\u2019s cellist who helped persuade Norrington to become music director, said Saturday. \u201cHe had his detractors, certainly, and some of them were some of my best friends. But for me, he got the music off the page. He made the concert experience transformative.\u201d",
      "Born on March 16, 1934, Norrington was the son of Arthur, president of Trinity College, Oxford, and the former Edith Carver. A violinist and boy soprano in his youth, Roger attended The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, Dragon School, Westminster School, Cambridge and the Royal College of Music, where he studied under conductor Adrian Boult.",
      "In 1962, Norrington founded the Sch\u00fctz Choir, originally dedicated to the works of Heinrich Sch\u00fctz. He became music director of Kent Opera from 1969-84, the Bournemouth Sinfonietta from 1985-89 and New York's Orchestra of St. Luke's from 1990-94.",
      "He was principal conductor of Camerata Salzburg from 1997 to 2006, the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra from 1998 to 2011 and the Zurich Chamber Orchestra from 2011-16.",
      "\u201cOrchestras didn\u2019t generally use vibrato until the 1930s,\u201d Norrington told The Guardian in 2007. \u201cIt is a fashion, like smoking, which came in at about the same time. Smoking is now going, so maybe vibrato will too. ... I have discovered, all the way from Monteverdi to Mahler, is that when music is played as it should be, the sound is wonderful, the expression is wonderful and the instruments match together.\u201d",
      "Norrington was nominated for four Grammy Awards and won in 2001 for a recording of Nicholas Maw's Violin Concerto with Joshua Bell and the London Philharmonic. Norrington retired after conducting the Royal Northern Sinfonia in an all-Hadyn concert on Nov. 18, 2021.",
      "\u201cI have enjoyed every minute of over 50 years of making music with some of the most wonderful and talented musicians in the world,\" he said in a statement. \u201cThe time has come to step off the podium.\u201d",
      "His first marriage, to Susan McLean May, ended in a divorce in 1982. He married the choreographer Kay Lawrence in the mid-1980s; she died last year.",
      "Norrington was made a Knight Bachelor in 1997.",
      "He is survived by Tom and two children from his first marriage, Ben and Amy.",

      "Coldplay's concert at Gillette Stadium on Wednesday took an unexpected turn when a couple caught on the jumbotron sparked debate online",
      "LONDON -- It started out as a routine bit of fun at a Coldplay concert: Lead singer Chris Martin asked the cameras to scan the crowd for his \u201cJumbotron Song,\u201d when he sings a few lines about the people the camera lands on.",
      "At a concert at Gillette Stadium in Massachusetts on Wednesday, a man wearing a birthday sash was up first. Two people in banana costumes were highlighted.",
      "But in between, something else ensued. For several seconds, a couple was shown on the big screen. They were cuddling and smiling, his arms wrapped around her, as she leaned back into him. When they saw themselves on the big screen, her jaw dropped, her hands flew to her face and she spun away from the camera. He ducked out of the frame, as did she.",
      "\u201cEither they\u2019re having an affair or they\u2019re just very shy,\u201d Martin joked.",
      "But it didn't end there. The video went viral, and the internet got to work.",
      "The Associated Press could not immediately confirm the couple's identity.",
      "But internet sleuths allege he is the chief executive officer of a U.S.-based company, while she is the chief people officer \u2014 in other words, the head of human resources.",
      "A spokesman for the company did not respond when asked to confirm the identities of the people shown on camera. But he said in an email that a statement circulating online that was attributed to the chief executive was a \u201cfake from a clearly labeled parody account.\u201d The company later released a statement saying it had opened an investigation into the incident, but did not directly identify the employees.",
      "The woman didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on LinkedIn. The man's LinkedIn page appeared to be deactivated, and no other way of contacting him could be immediately found. A phone call to a number listed in an online directory under his name went straight to voicemail. Attempts to reach him through other numbers associated with his name in the directory were not successful.",
      "A representative for Coldplay said the band had no comment.",
      "It\u2019s easy to miss, but most concert venues have signs informing the audience that they could be filmed during the event. Look for them on the walls when you arrive and around the bar areas or toilets. It\u2019s common practice especially when bands like to use performances for music videos or concert films.",
      "The venue in this case, Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, also has a privacy policy online which states: \u201cWhen you visit our location or attend or participate in an event at our location, we may capture your image, voice and/or likeness, including through the use of CCTV cameras and/or when we film or photograph you in a public location.\u201d",
      "In the internet age, such videos \u2014 or ones taken on someone's smartphone \u2014 can quickly zip around the world.",
      "This video rocketed around social media, as people speculated about why the couple dodged the camera.",
      "Empathy for the pair and their families was mixed with plenty of snarky commentary and countless memes, with the fake statement from the chief executive generating a lot of additional vitriol. And news reports said that the CEO's LinkedIn account was disabled after it was flooded by a wave of comments.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unsettling how easily we can be identified with biometrics, how our faces are online, how social media can track us \u2014 and how the internet has gone from being a place of interaction, to a gigantic surveillance system,\" said Mary Angela Bock, an associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s School of Journalism and Media. \"We are being surveilled by our social media. They\u2019re tracking us in exchange for entertaining us.\u201d",

      "The five-member K-pop group 1VERSE is debuting Friday, with two North Korean defectors alongside members from the United States and Japan",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- With two out of five of its members North Korean defectors, the K-pop group 1VERSE is breaking new ground as it debuts its single album Friday.",
      "The band represents an unusual convergence of backgrounds: North Korea-born rapper Hyuk and singer Seok join Nathan from Arkansas, Kenny from Los Angeles, and Aito from Japan.",
      "While not the first K-pop act to include North Korean defectors \u2014 BE BOYS\u2019 Hak Seong debuted earlier this year \u2014 the diversity of the group's members add a rare dimension to the genre\u2019s growing global diversity.",
      "The group debuts Friday with their single album \u201cThe 1st Verse\u201d under Seoul-based label Singing Beetle. Their title track \u201cShattered\u201d features lyrics co-written by Hyuk and Kenny.",
      "\u201cWith members from different countries all coming together as 1VERSE, I just thought \u2018we can do this regardless of background\u2019 going forward,\u201d said Aito, the group\u2019s youngest member from Chiba, Japan.",
      "Hyuk, who lived in North Korea\u2019s North Hamgyong Province until age 12, defected to the South in 2013. His journey to K-pop stardom began while working in a factory in South Korea, where a chance encounter with the CEO of a music label eventually led to weekend rap lessons in Seoul.",
      "\u201cI went to university but then things went bad. It was when COVID was pretty severe, and a bad incident happened, so I had no choice but to work at a factory,\u201d he said.",
      "Initially skeptical, Hyuk thought the invitation to become a pop star might be a scam. He recalled thinking: \u201cI really have nothing right now, even if you rob me, not even dust would come out.\"",
      "After a year of meetings where the music executive consistently bought him meals and encouraged his training, Hyuk joined the agency in late 2021.",
      "Seok\u2019s path was similarly unconventional. A former soccer player who started playing at 8 years old in North Korea, he defected in 2019. He declined to provide additional details, citing safety concerns.",
      "After arriving in South Korea, he briefly played for a semi-professional team before pursuing physical education studies. During weekend soccer games he was approached about an idol training program.",
      "\u201cI was starting music for the first time, right? So I started with the mindset that if it doesn\u2019t work out, I can just stop and try something else,\u201d Seok said.",
      "Both members\u2019 experiences reflect harsh realities they left behind. Hyuk described spending eight to 10 hours daily collecting firewood as a child just to survive.",
      "\u201cWhere I lived, we had to collect firewood just to cook rice and survive day by day \u2014 it was essential,\u201d he recalled.",
      "Hyuk didn't have much access to music growing up. \u201cSince I lived struggling every day, I lived so busily that I wonder if I even had time to listen to music \u2014 I didn\u2019t have that luxury,\u201d he said.",
      "Seok had some exposure to K-pop in North Korea, listening occasionally to f(x)\u2018s \u201cLA chA TA\u201d and Super Junior songs despite it being illegal in North Korea to listen to South Korean music. \u201cI probably heard K-pop back in elementary school. But I couldn\u2019t listen often since it was illegal,\u201d he said.",
      "Experts and defectors say K-pop and other South Korean pop culture products have emerged as a challenge to North Korea\u2019s leadership as they steadily gained popularity among the public.",
      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has intensified campaigns since the pandemic to eliminate South Korean cultural influence.",
      "Nathan, from Arkansas, first encountered K-pop through his Texas-based cousins who were longtime fans. \u201cI would kind of just pretend to be a hater, like urgh, K-pop. And then I just so happened to come across EXO\u2019s \u2018Growl\u2019 music video on YouTube,\u201d he recalled.",
      "The group\u2019s diverse backgrounds are reflected in their training, which includes courses on global citizenship. \u201cWe want to be inclusive of everyone\u2019s history, everyone\u2019s current situations back home,\u201d Kenny explained.",
      "Seok expressed excitement about connecting with international fans, particularly in America. \u201cSince I came from North Korea, it\u2019s hard to see foreigners there. So I really wanted to see people from other countries,\u201d he said.",
      "The group has already gained traction online. Seok described filming emotional video diaries during difficult early training days, which fans responded to with supportive messages.",
      "\u201cI filmed that diary video with somewhat emotional, slightly teary feelings. And I uploaded it to TikTok or YouTube, and fans sent me comforting letters,\" he said. \u201cAs soon as I saw the first line, tears came out and I was really touched.\u201d",
      "Hyuk acknowledged the attention their North Korean background generates while emphasizing the group\u2019s collective identity.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very grateful that people are paying attention to us,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s okay as long as it doesn\u2019t lean too much to one side ... it\u2019s not just me but all our members are here too, it\u2019s a journey we\u2019re creating together.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe bullwhip is the iconic symbol of an iconic character of cinema history, Indiana Jones, and has been a highlight of this auction,\" Joe Maddalena, Heritage\u2019s executive vice president, said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "The $525,000 price includes the \u201cbuyers premium\u201d attached to all auction items for the house that sells it.",
      "Heritage said the nearly $15 million bid for the Rosebud sled puts it second only to the $32.5 million that Judy Garland's ruby slippers from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d fetched in December. Neither of those buyers were identified either.",

      "Long thought lost, the sled is one of three of the prop known to have survived. Dante stumbled on it when he was filming on the former RKO Pictures lot in 1984. He wasn\u2019t a collector, but knew the value of the sled and quietly preserved it for decades, putting it as an Easter egg into four of his own films.",
      "Dante's friend and mentor Steven Spielberg paid $60,500 for another of the sleds in 1982, and anonymous buyer paid $233,000 for the third in 1996.",

      "In Alaska, a public radio station general manager took a moment from a busy day warning her community about a possible tsunami for a special task \u2014 sending a text message to Sen. Lisa Murkowski urging her to vote against a measure to strip federal fund...",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Lauren Adams, general manager for KUCB public radio in Unalaska, Alaska, didn't have much time to reflect on Congress, 4,000 miles away, stripping federal funding for public media this week. She's been too busy working.",
      "Sirens blared in the Aleutian Islands community Wednesday warning of a potential tsunami, with a voice over public loudspeakers urging the community's 4,100 residents to seek higher ground immediately and tune into the radio \u2014 to Adams' station.",
      "At the same time in Washington, the Senate was voting on a measure that would eliminate nearly $1.1 billion that had already been appropriated for NPR and PBS \u2014 a process that didn't end until early Thursday morning. The House completed the process in time for President Donald Trump to sign it before a Friday deadline.",
      "Trump had called for the cuts, saying public media's news programming was biased against him and fellow Republicans, and threatened GOP members of Congress with primary challenges if they didn't fall in line.",
      "Adams, her news director, a reporter and an intern kept broadcasting and updating KUCB's social media feed until the danger passed. Then she made time for one more task \u2014 texting U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski and urging her to vote against the bill. Murkowski was one of two Republican senators, along with Susan Collins of Maine, to publicly dissent.",
      "\u201cI thought that it was such a telling story of why her constituents have a different relationship to public radio than maybe some other regions of the United States,\u201d Adams said.",
      "The federal money is appropriated to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which distributes it to NPR and PBS. Roughly 70% of the money goes directly to the 330 PBS and 246 NPR stations across the country, although that's only a shorthand way to describe its potential impact.",
      "The cuts are expected to weigh most heavily on smaller public media outlets away from big cities, and it's likely some won't survive. Katherine Maher, NPR's president and CEO, estimated as many as 80 NPR stations may face closure in the next year. Some stations are already fielding offers from commercial entities to buy their broadcast licenses, she said.",
      "\u201cMany of our stations which provide access to free unique local programming and emergency alerts will now be forced to make hard decisions in the weeks and months ahead,\u201d said Paula Kerger, PBS president and CEO. \u201cThere is nothing more American than PBS. Despite today's setback, we are determined to keep fighting to preserve the essential services we provide to the American public.\u201d",
      "The measure will cost PBS and NPR stations in Mississippi roughly $2 million, about 15% of the budget, said Royal Aills, executive director of Mississippi Public Broadcasting.",
      "Already, Mississippi Public Broadcasting has decided to eliminate a streaming channel that airs children's programming like \u201cCaillou\u201d and \u201cDaniel Tiger's Neighborhood\u201d to the state's youngsters 24 hours a day, said Taiwo Gaynor, the system's chief content officer.",
      "\u201cThis is important for families, to have access to content that they don't have to pay for,\u201d Gaynor said. \u201cThat is a sad thought, to think that we ... might not be able to provide that for a generation of children.\u201d",
      "Maine\u2019s public media system is looking at a hit of $2.5 million, or about 12% of its budget, for the next fiscal year, said Rick Schneider, president and chief executive officer of Maine Public. He said he\u2019s not ready to identify specific cuts, but the system is preparing to reinvent itself to make certain it continues serving the state\u2019s residents.",
      "Maine\u2019s rural residents rely heavily on public media for weather updates and disaster alerts, said Molly Curren Rowles, executive director of ACLU of Maine. Rowles said public media was a \u201clifeline\u201d to her growing up off the grid.",
      "NPR's Maher fears what the cuts might mean for the system's journalism, not just in rural areas where local news can be hard to come by, but in telling the rest of the country what is going on there. Less funding will also mean less support for popular television and radio programming, although it's too soon to tell which programs will be affected.",
      "NPR stations also use millions of dollars in federal money to pay music licensing fees. Now many will have to renegotiate these deals, which could mean less music, or a more limited variety of music, on outlets where music discovery is a big part of their identity. For example, Maher estimates that some 96% of all classical music broadcast in the United States is on NPR stations. \u201cThat is essentially taking an entire art form out of public access,\u201d she said.",
      "The affair transcends violins and piccolos. NPR received support Thursday from the heavy metal band Gwar, whose lead singer Blothar the Berserker posted a call on social media for fans to pay attention to what is going on with public media.",
      "Already, public media is seeing an increase in donations from reader and viewers to support its mission, and stations are actively sounding the alarm. In a plea to listeners on its website Thursday, Philadelphia's WXPN radio pointed to its legacy in helping people discover new music. \u201cThe most important thing you can do is support WXPN and the public media system in a way that is meaningful to you,\u201d the station urged on its website.",
      "But donations aren't going to fill the hole left by the loss in federal funding, Maher said. The public media leaders have already turned to lobbying Congress to restore some of the funding through the appropriations process for next year's budget. They don't know how much time they have; Maher said it would be inordinately costly, and perhaps prohibitive, to reopen a radio station that is forced to close.",
      "Public media isn't getting any help from states, either. At least five states have reduced their own outlays for public media this year, either for budget or political reasons.",
      "Gov. Ron DeSantis, for example, vetoed nearly $6 million that Florida lawmakers had set aside for public broadcasters the day before the state's budget took effect on July 1. \u201cDone in Florida,\u201d DeSantis responded on social media to a Trump post calling public broadcasting a \u201cmonstrosity\u201d that should be defunded.",
      "Back in Alaska, KMXT public radio station\u2019s general manager, Jared Griffin, called the Senate vote a \u201cdevastating gut punch.\u201d He estimated that the cuts would amount to 22% of KMXT\u2019s budget. Griffin said the station\u2019s board has already agreed on a plan to furlough staff members one day a month, and he\u2019s taking a 50% pay cut.",
      "The station covers Kodiak Island, home to one of the nation\u2019s largest U.S. Coast Guard bases.",
      "\u201cWe have to dip into our savings while we figure out what KMXT is going to look like over the next six months, Griffin said. \u201dAt least for the next year we\u2019ll be fine but we\u2019re probably going to have to look at leasing space in our building to other organizations to help fill that gap.\u201d",
      "Unalaska resident Nikki Whittern said KUCB plays a vital role in the community during emergencies like the tsunami warning.",
      "\u201cThey broadcast everything, and they make sure that everybody knows and everybody\u2019s safe,\u201d said Whittern, a bartender. She spoke while preparing to open the Norwegian Rat Saloon \u2014 known to local fishermen simply as \u201cthe Rat\u201d \u2014 on Thursday morning.",

      "Bands behaving badly? It's only rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.",
      "Members of alternative rock band Jane\u2019s Addiction filed dueling lawsuits Wednesday over singer Perry Farrell\u2019s onstage scuffle with guitarist Dave Navarro at a Boston concert last year, a fracas that prompted the cancellation of the rest of their reunion tour and a planned album.",
      "They join a long and storied tradition of bandmates suing one another, taking interpersonal and legal troubles from the recording studio to the courtroom. Here\u2019s a look at a few very famous cases.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: Navarro, drummer Stephen Perkins and bassist Eric Avery sued Farrell in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking at least $10 million, alleging that Farrell\u2019s behavior on their recent tour had ranged from erratic to out of control, culminating in an assault where Farrell punched Navarro both onstage and backstage.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: It hasn't been; it's just getting started. Farrell and his wife, Etty Lau Farrell, sued the three bandmates in the same court Wednesday, blaming them for the conflict and the violence.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: How much time do you have? The late, great Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys\u2019 leader, feuded with his cousin and bandmate Mike Love over songwriting credits dating back decades. Love had sued Wilson several times, beginning in the 1990s.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: Wilson often wasn't the victor \u2014 except in 2007, when U.S. District Judge Audrey Collins threw out one of Love's lawsuits against Wilson. In it, Love alleged that a free, 2004 promotional CD of re-recorded Beach Boys songs cost him millions of dollars and violated Love and Wilson\u2019s partnership.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: The sibling rivalry between Oasis brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher is well established. Their brawls not only led to the band\u2019s dissolution in 2009, before their 2025 reunion, but also a legal upset. In 2011, Liam sued Noel for saying Liam\u2019s hangover caused the cancellation of a 2009 festival performance. He said in a statement that the lawsuit was not about money, but that he wanted an apology and for Oasis fans \u201cto know the truth\u201d \u2014 that laryngitis prevented him from performing.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: The lawsuit was dropped.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: The post-breakup decades of Creedence Clearwater Revival were marked by so much legal and personal infighting that you might think CCR stands for Conflict, Clash, Repeat. In 1996, singer-songwriter-guitarist John Fogerty sued ex-bandmates Doug Clifford and Stu Cook for performing under the name Creedence Clearwater Revisited. That case settled in 2001, but the bandmates sued Fogerty in 2014, alleging he was violating the settlement by continuing to publicly slag off the Revisited name. And they said Fogerty himself was now illegally using Creedence Clearwater Revival in concert advertising. Fogerty sued back in 2015, saying Cook and Clifford weren\u2019t paying him proper songwriting royalties for their performances.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: A federal court merged the two cases, and the resulting hybrid was settled under confidential terms in 2017.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: Fleetwood Mac and feuds are practically synonymous. Breakups and divorces between members are essential to some of their best songs. The conflict resumed in the 2010s when the band kicked lead guitarist Lindsey Buckingham off their 2018 tour, and he sued. Buckingham claimed he was told five days after the group appeared at Radio City Music Hall that January that the band would tour without him. He says he would have been paid at least $12 million for his share of the proceeds.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: Later that year, Buckingham said they had settled the lawsuit.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: At some point, two key members of Journey stopped believin' in each other. And all over an Amex. Longtime guitarist Neal Schon sued longtime keyboardist Jonathan Cain in 2022, saying Cain was refusing to let him use the band's American Express card. A counterclaim came from Cain, who said that Schon was running up enormous personal charges on the band's account.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: A judge in 2024 appointed a custodian over the band's financial decisions, specifically empowered to settle disagreements between Schon and Cain.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: In 2023, Daryl Hall sued his longtime music partner John Oates, arguing that Oates' plan to sell off his share of a joint venture would violate the terms of a business agreement the Hall & Oates duo had forged long before. The move quickly prompted a judge to temporarily block the sale.",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: The lawsuit and arbitration are ongoing.",
      "WHAT HAPPENED: Their artistic partnership had been over for months, but the Beatles had to break out the barristers to break up their business. Paul McCartney went to London\u2019s High Court of Justice in 1970 to dissolve the Fab Four's 1967 contractual partnership, which included the Apple record label. McCartney above all wanted to get rid of manager Allen Klein, whom John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr wanted to keep as overseer of their business. \u201cThe only way for me to save The Beatles and Apple,\u201d McCartney told British GQ in 2020, \u201cwas to sue the band.\u201d",
      "HOW IT WAS RESOLVED: The court ruled in McCartney's favor and appointed a receiver to oversee their ventures in 1971. But negotiations and wrangling continued until a long-term solution that would become known as \u201cThe Beatles Agreement\u201d was signed by all four members in 1974.",

      "The 1950s and \u201960s pop singer Connie Francis died Thursday at 87",
      "Connie Francis was a giant of 1950s and '60s sugary-sweet pop, notching more than a dozen hits. In the months leading up to her death, announced Thursday, she experienced one more in \u201cPretty Little Baby,\u201d which has become a viral hit on TikTok six decades after its release.",
      "As of Thursday, more than 22.5 million TikTok videos have been created using the sound, often partnering videos of baby animals, toddlers, makeup tutorials and retro fashions. According to TikTok, those videos have amassed more than 45.5 billion views, globally. Celebrities like Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian and North West have used it, too, with West lip-syncing along to the track.",
      "Hooky, feel-good pop songs tend to do well on TikTok, and 1962's \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d is an exemplar of that phenomenon. Users gravitated toward the song's wholesome simplicity, sweet vocals, delicate organ and upstroke riffs. \u201cYou can ask the flowers / I sit for hours / Telling all the bluebirds / The bill and coo birds / Pretty little baby, I\u2019m so in love with you,\u201d Francis swoons on the verse that has picked up steam on the platform.",
      "And all of this has transpired in mere months: According to Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d was earning just over 17,000 on-demand audio streams in the U.S. during the week ending April 10. A month later, that number had climbed to 2.4 million. That\u2019s a growth of over 7,000%. The song has earned over 29 million streams this year so far.",
      "In one popular video, which garnered over 56 million views, a user posted about baby teething hacks for first-time moms. Another user, Amari Goins, posted a video, with over 112 million views, of her 2-year-old daughter singing along to the lyrics, noting that her toddler picked up the song because of how often they heard it on TikTok.",
      "Most recently, TikTok users have begun posting covers of \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d as part of a singing challenge, where they exaggerate Francis' performance with their own stylized vocal runs. Francis, who died at 87, herself joined TikTok as a result of her song's popularity, and her first two videos \u2014 which earned 16.3 million and 31.2 million views, respectively \u2014 furthered engagement. In her first video, posted in early June, she said she was \u201cflabbergasted and amazed\u201d at the song's resurgence.",
      "\u201cTo think that a song I recorded 63 years ago is captivating new generations of audiences is truly overwhelming for me,\u201d Francis said in that first post, which she followed with a clip of herself lip-syncing to the song.",
      "For decades, the song lived in relative obscurity \u2014 written by Don Stirling and Bill Nauman for Francis, it was never a single and was originally released in the U.K. as the B-side of her 1962 single \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be Warm This Winter.\u201d It appears on her album \u201cConnie Francis Sings \u2018Second Hand Love,\u2019\u201d released the same year. More than 60 years later, the song reached No. 20 on Billboard's Digital Song Sales chart in June 2025 and hit both the Hot 100\u2019s Bubbling Under chart and the Billboard Global 200.",
      "In Francis' last TikTok video, posted late last month, she thanked the \u201cmany wonderful artists\u201d who paid tribute to her, and all the users who sang along with her.",
      "Peter Lemongello Jr., a singer and performer who called Francis a friend, posted a TikTok in May where he sang the song to Francis, what he wrote on Facebook was \u201cone of the greatest and most exciting moments of my career so far.\u201d The video garnered over 15 million views.",
      "\u201cThere are no words to express this monumental loss,\u201d he wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday. \u201cI will be forever grateful to her for the help she gave me with my career.\u201d",
      "Ian Paget, a TikTok creator, posted a tearful video Thursday and said he hopes Francis and her family \u201chave felt that love from the younger crowd learning who she is.\u201d",
      "The TikTok popularity of \u201cPretty Little Baby\u201d prompted her label Republic/UMe Records to reissue versions Francis had sung in French, German, Italian, Spanish and Swedish in 1962. Bruce Resnikoff, president and CEO of UMe, wrote in a statement that the global catalog division was saddened but took \u201ccomfort in knowing how joyful and fulfilled she felt in these last few months, as a new generation discovered her music and celebrated her legacy.\u201d",
      "In May, as the song took off, Francis thanked TikTok and its users for \u201cthe wonderful, and oh so unexpected, reception\u201d in a Facebook post.",
      "As for her reaction to having a \u201cviral hit\u201d? She continued: \u201cClearly out of touch with present day music statistics terminology, my initial response was to ask: 'What\u2019s that?' Thank you everyone!\u201d",

      "Lin-Manuel Miranda is using the 10th anniversary Broadway performance of *Hamilton* to support nonprofits providing immigration services",
      "Lin-Manuel Miranda plans to use the 10th anniversary Broadway performance of his award-winning cultural phenomenon \u201cHamilton\u201d as a fundraiser for a coalition of nonprofits providing immigration services.",
      "The Aug. 6 performance of \u201cHamilton\u201d at Broadway\u2019s Richard Rodgers Theatre is expected to raise about $3 million for the Immigrants: We Get the Job Done Coalition, 14 nonprofits ranging from the Hispanic Federation and National Immigration Law Center to the Haitian Bridge Alliance and the Tahirih Justice Center. The donation will come from Miranda, the Miranda Family and Miranda Family Fund, and the \u201cHamilton\u201d cast.",
      "It seemed like a fitting tribute to \u201cHamilton\u201d and its inspiration, Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, Miranda told The Associated Press, though he recognizes that Hamilton wouldn\u2019t have called himself an immigrant.",
      "\u201cHis narrative in our country kind of mirrors that of an immigrant story,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cHe did not grow up here. He didn\u2019t come from England. He came from the Caribbean, escaping harsh circumstances. And he really helped shape this country.\u201d",
      "Miranda did exclusively reveal some plans for the special, invite-only \u201cHamilton\u201d anniversary show and the preshow reception that he will host. Fans already know the possibilities after the special \u201cHamilton\u201d medley at the Tonys in June. Even the audience will be \u201cstacked,\u201d he said, since every actor who has ever performed during the show's Broadway run will be invited to be in the audience to watch the show\u2019s current Broadway cast that night. \u201cWe\u2019re working on something special for the curtain call and another nice special thing after that,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cThat\u2019s about all I can say.\u201d",
      "The bulk of the invites have gone to winners selected from a Prizeo sweepstakes, where entrants donated at least $10 to the Immigrants coalition. A few dozen VIP packages, ranging from $2,500 to $10,000, will be available Thursday through the Hispanic Federation, with proceeds also going to the coalition.",
      "\u201cOne of America\u2019s greatest exports -- at least for me growing up -- was the immigration narrative,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cSo many people I know\u2026 came to this country from somewhere else seeking a better life and then helped make this country better by being here. And I believe that\u2019s one of the greatest promises, one of greatest things about the American experiment, and I\u2019ll continue to fight for that and support organizations that are helping that cause.\u201d",
      "And the organizations that will benefit from the donations generated by the \u201cHamilton\u201d 10th anniversary, better known as #Hamilten, say the donations and encouragement are sorely needed now.",
      "Since the start of his second term, President Donald Trump swiftly moved to make good on \u201cMass Deportation Now!\u201d promises from his campaign. His administration has encouraged U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain and deport people quickly, even to countries where they have never been, in order to rein in illegal immigration.",
      "Hispanic Federation President and CEO Frankie Miranda, no relation to Lin-Manuel Miranda, said he is heartened by the more than 125,000 people who have donated to the \u201cHamilton\u201d fundraiser. \u201cI think it is the beginning of what could be an incredible movement of philanthropy and individual donors basically saying, \u2018Enough is enough\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have seen it also in the different demonstrations of people around the country where they are expressing their concern and their frustration out in the streets.\u201d",
      "Hispanic Federation has already lost millions in federal funding, as the Trump administration cuts support for workplace development initiatives and environmental justice work, Frankie Miranda said. He has also seen some corporations withdraw their financial support because they fear reprisals from the Trump administration. \u201cWe need bold ideas like \u2018Hamilton\u2019 where everybody feels that they can stand behind it,\u201d he said.",
      "Aarti Kohli, executive director of the Asian Law Caucus, another coalition member, said the donations would help her group continue to provide community legal services to individuals, while also pursuing lawsuits like its challenge to the Trump executive order seeking to strip away birthright citizenship from some children born in the United States.",
      "\u201cAt this time, when so many people are afraid to speak out and support vulnerable communities, Lin-Manuel Miranda being willing to use the \u2018Hamilton\u2019 platform just shows real leadership and bravery,\u201d Kohli said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m hoping that more donors will step up and support our sector. We are the firewall between authoritarianism and democracy.\u201d",
      "Kica Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center, said her nonprofit plans to use the donations from the coalition to support its Defending Democracy initiative, which informs immigrants of their rights and uses the law as \u201ca bulwark against unconstitutional actions carried out by this administration.\u201d",
      "Matos sees it as a \u201cfull circle\u201d moment to use funding generated by \u201cthe story of one of our nation\u2019s Founding Fathers who himself was an indigent immigrant, who through his own grit, determination and his brilliance, worked his way up.\u201d \u201cHe was somebody who thought deeply about this new nation\u2019s democracy,\u201d she added. \u201cWhat better way to honor Hamilton and to express our gratitude for these resources?\u201d",
      "For Lin-Manuel Miranda, the fact that people remain fascinated by \u201cHamilton\u201d 10 years later also leaves him feeling grateful.",
      "And he remains surprised by the resonance of the line \u201cImmigrants: We get the job done,\u201d a line shared in the show by Hamilton and French military officer Marquis de Lafayette at the Battle of Yorktown.",
      "\u201cI thought it was no big deal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut from the moment it was performed on stage, the audience reaction was so joyous at just the utterance of that simple fact. It\u2019s one of the things that just heartens me and gives me hope. In these dark times, it still gets a big cheer.\u201d",
      "The cheering still requires the show to add extra measures of music to wait for the audience to calm down before continuing with the song \u201cYorktown.\u201d Miranda attributes it to the fact that so many Americans are only one or two generations away from an immigrant.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the same reason why that No Kings protest vastly outnumbered the military parade happening on the same day,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are still a lot of people who believe in basic decency and treating people who come here -- often from really tough situations -- with humanity.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The members of alternative rock band Jane\u2019s Addiction have filed dueling lawsuits after an onstage scuffle last year prompted the cancellation of the band's tour",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The members of alternative rock band Jane\u2019s Addiction filed dueling lawsuits Wednesday over singer Perry Farrell's onstage scuffle with guitarist Dave Navarro at a Boston concert last year, prompting the cancellation of the rest of their reunion tour and a planned album.",
      "Navarro, drummer Stephen Perkins and bassist Eric Avery sued Farrell in Los Angeles Superior Court seeking at least $10 million, alleging that Farrell's behavior on the tour had ranged from erratic to out-of-control, culminating in the assault, where Perry punched Navarro both on stage and backstage.",
      "\u201cWith a series of swift blows, he single-handedly destroyed the name, reputation, trademark, and viability of the Band and those who built it,\u201d their lawsuit says.",
      "Farrell and his wife, Etty Lau Farrell, sued the three bandmates in the same court Wednesday, blaming them for the conflict and the violence.",
      "\u201cNavarro, Avery and Perkins apparently decided,\u201d the lawsuit says, \u201cthat Jane\u2019s Addiction\u2019s decades of success should be jettisoned in pursuit of a yearslong bullying campaign against Farrell involving harassing him onstage during performances, including, among other tactics, trying to undermine him by playing their instruments at a high volume so that he could not hear himself sing.\u201d",
      "The Farrells said that Navarro and Avery actually assaulted them.",
      "Perry Farrell said he was \u201cblindsided\u201d when the other members canceled the remaining 15 shows of the tour and broke up the band without consulting him, costing all of them a great deal of money.",
      "And he said his bandmates defamed him by publicly saying after the fight that he had mental health problems.",
      "Jane's Addiction was an essential part of the Los Angeles music scene in the late 1980s with their combination of elements of punk, goth and psychedelic sounds and culture. They became a national phenomenon with hits including \u201cJane Says\u201d and \u201cBeen Caught Stealing,\u201d and through their founding of the Lollapalooza tour, whose first incarnations they headlined in 1991.",
      "The group broke up soon after but returned several times in various incarnations. The 2024 tour was the first time the original members had played together since 2010.",
      "Farrell missed all seven of the group's rehearsals in the run-up to the tour, his bandmate's lawsuit alleges, and his behavior during the early shows ranged from erratic to out-of-control.",
      "\u201cHe struggled night to night amid public concern for his well-being and apparent intoxication,\u201d their lawsuit says. \u201cPerry forgot lyrics, lost his place in songs he had sung since the 1980s, and mumbled rants as he drank from a wine bottle onstage.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit says Farrell was given many solutions to the volume problem, none of which he followed.",
      "Then on Sept. 13 at Leader Bank Pavilion in Boston in front of about 4,000 fans, videos partially captured Farrell lunging at Navarro and bumping Navarro with his shoulder before taking a swing at the guitarist with his right arm. Navarro is seen holding his right arm out to keep Farrell away before Farrell is dragged away.",
      "But Farrell's lawsuit says the \u201cvideo evidence is clear that the first altercation onstage during the Boston show was hardly one-sided.\u201d It says Navarro was deliberately playing loud to drown out the singer, and \"what followed was an inappropriate violent escalation by Navarro and Avery that was disproportionate to Farrell\u2019s minor body check of Navarro.\"",
      "Farrell alleges that when he was being restrained by a crew member, Avery punched him in the kidneys, and that both Avery and Navarro assaulted him and his wife backstage.",
      "Shortly after the fight, Farrell in a statement apologized to his bandmates, especially Navarro, for \u201cinexcusable behavior.\u201d",
      "Both lawsuits allege assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and breach of contract, among other claims.",
      "\u201cNow,\u201d Navarro, Perkins and Avery's lawsuit says, \u201cthe Band will never have their revival Tour, to celebrate a new album and 40+ years of deep, complex, chart-topping recordings. Instead, history will remember the Band as suffering a swift and painful death at the hands of Farrell\u2019s unprovoked anger and complete lack of self-control.\"",

      "Justin Timberlake had \u201cTrolls.\u201d Rihanna has \u201cSmurfs.\u201d Now, we patiently await a \u201cGummi Bears\u201d with the Biebs.",
      "But first we have \u201cSmurfs,\u201d which, like \u201cTrolls,\u201d gets as much mileage as it can from its pop singer-voice actor. Rihanna voices Smurfette and supplies a new song, giving a half-hearted injection of star power to an otherwise uninspired, modestly scaled, kiddo-friendly cartoon feature.",
      "\u201cSmurfs,\u201d directed by Chris Miller ( \u201cPuss in Boots,\u201d \u201cShrek the Third\u201d), cribs heavily from the \u201cTrolls\u201d playbook. Both feature brightly colored little forest creatures that like a good tune. In the opening of \u201cSmurfs,\u201d Papa Smurf (John Goodman) is DJing for a dancing Smurf Village.",
      "As the many Smurfs gyrate next to mushroom houses, you might find yourself wondering how we got here. And what, exactly, is a Smurf, anyway? It\u2019s been nearly 70 years since Belgian comic artist Peyo created \u201cLes Schtroumpfs,\u201d though most of those still familiar with the little blue fellas remember them from the 1980s Hanna-Barbera cartoons.",
      "The Smurfs have never really transcended their Saturday morning cartoon origins. Neither a pair of live-action hybrid movies in the early 2010s or a 2017 animated release have done much more than keep us vaguely aware of what a Phrygian cap is.",
      "And \u201cSmurfs\u201d is unlikely to change that. The best thing that can be said for the latest attempt to reboot the blue Belgian beings is that it maintains the light feel of a morning cartoon. Even with a brief SpongeBob SquarePants short running ahead of it, \u201cSmurfs\u201d \u2014 seemingly designed to be the least ambitious of all possible parent-child outings \u2014 passes in about 90 minutes.",
      "The pressing issue in Miller\u2019s film is that one Smurf, No Name Smurf (James Corden), lacks a defining feature. There are so many other labels already taken that all that\u2019s left for him are Clog Making Smurf and Shark Taming Smurf \u2014 and neither of those is promising, either.",
      "When No Name Smurf suddenly grows magical powers, he gets a boost in confidence but inadvertently sets off a dangerous chain reaction. The burst of magic reveals the location of Smurf Village and a long-hidden magical book that, if reunited with three others, confers world domination. (Fun fact: This is also what happens if you reunify all first editions of James Joyce\u2019s \u201cUlysses.\u201d)",
      "The outburst brings the attention of the evil wizard Razamel, brother of Gargamel. (Both are excellently voiced by JP Karliak.) And the Smurfs are cast into a chase through dimensions to rescue the kidnapped Papa Smurf and prevent Razamel from seizing the fourth book. The trip takes them through Paris, Munich, Australia and, briefly, Claymation.",
      "The zaniness is often forced. There are also Koosh ball-like creatures named Snooter Poots with a leader named Mama Poot (Natasha Lyonne). And if you were ever hoping to hear Rihanna sing, as a Smurf, from the seat of a kangaroo pouch, your movie has finally arrived.",
      "But any expectations of something more quickly dissipate, despite the fact that \u201cSmurfs\u201d was scripted by Pam Brady, the screenwriter of \u201cHot Rod\u201d and co-writer of \u201cTeam America: World Police.\u201d Most of the attempts at adult-winking gags are hackneyed jokes about Zoom, podcasting, spam filters and LinkedIn.",
      "You can almost feel IP-rights pressures animating the entire enterprise. See, there are other Smurf names out there. What about Corporate Mandate Smurf?",
      "\u201cSmurfs,\u201d a Paramount Pictures release, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for action, language and some rude humor. Running time: 92 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s 1997 all over again. It\u2019s so nostalgic,\u201d says Freddie Prinze Jr., who stars in both, this time around. Responds another returning star, Jennifer Love Hewitt: \u201cNostalgia is overrated.\u201d",
      "That line deserves a big laugh from a so-called \u201clegacy sequel\u201d that blends old and new to resurrect a franchise long dormant but isn\u2019t sure where it sits in 2025. A wink here, an eye-gouging there.",
      "By aping the structure of the original \u2014 maddeningly calling itself by its predecessor's name \u2014 the new version of \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer\u201d is both too tentative a step forward and yet too reliant on the past to fully break free of that gravitational pull.",
      "The new installment follows a group of post-high school friends (Madelyn Cline, Chase Sui Wonders, Jonah Hauer-King, Sarah Pidgeon and Tyriq Withers) who cause a fatal car wreck on July Fourth and swear to keep their involvement a secret. But a year later, someone wants them dead, offering the anniversary warning: \u201cI know what you did last summer.\u201d",
      "This is a franchise that got a bit lost in the shadow of the \u201cScream\u201d dynasty, but still helped make household names of such Gen X heroes as Prinze, Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe. A relaunch makes sense but it\u2019s pretty vapid stuff until the OGs arrive.",
      "In fact, you may find yourself rooting for the killer. The five youngsters who have grown up in Southport, North Carolina \u2014 \u201cthe Hamptons of the South\u201d \u2014 mostly live lives of nepo privilege, drinking from flasks, driving Volvos, munching on macarons and taking Adderall. One lives on a 156-foot (48-meter) yacht with three decks.",
      "The movie mostly muddles along like a TV special, only coming to life when Prinze and Hewitt arrive, asked by the hunted youngsters for guidance. After all, the duo survived the 1997 attacks. \u201cGet them before they get you,\u201d Hewitt's Julie advises.",
      "Director Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, who co-wrote the screenplay with Sam Lansky, mixes gruesome stabbings, harpoon impalings and corpses displayed on hooks like fish at the dock with jokes that needle everything from Nicole Kidman's cheesy AMC commercials to our fling with true-crime podcasts.",
      "The filmmakers make half-hearted attempts to explain the ripple effects from trauma but we're not here for generational pain; we're here for the slashy-slashy. There is one dream sequence with a surprise returning OG that's worth the ticket price alone.",
      "The tone is all over the place \u2014 whimpering victims one moment, horny the next. The police in Southport are nefarious \u2014 in a nod to \u201cJaws,\u201d they cover up the murders for fear of turning off tourism \u2014 but there's a \u201cScooby-Doo\u201d vibe here (even a mention) that seems less playful than idea-deprived. There are elements of spoof, too, like a vain woman who has just lost someone close in a grisly bloodbath but worries about her skin care.",
      "Look, we hate to break it to you, it's not going to end well for many of this privileged set, as they hunt whoever is hunting them. Coherence is also stabbed a lot because a clear motive for the mass murder is really hard to understand.",
      "No matter: We get the scene when a scared victim with a massive knife sticking out of her back shoots a harpoon gun at the hook killer, and that's why we came in the first place. We also get Hewitt screaming her catchphrase, mocking her attacker: \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d Well, what are you waiting for?",
      "\u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer,\u201d a Sony Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated R for \u201cbloody horror violence, language throughout, some sexual content and brief drug use.\u201d Running time: 111 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Romance novels have always spiced up quiet nights. Now, a genre that has sometimes been dismissed as a guilty pleasure is bringing readers and writers together through social media, book clubs and a growing number of romance-specific bookstores.",
      "At a recent launch party for Nora Dahlia's enemies-to-friends romance \u201cPick-Up\u201d at Lovestruck Books, a romance-dedicated store in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a crowd of women sipped cocktails from the bar-caf\u00e9 as they browsed the shelves.",
      "After Dahlia\u2019s reading, patrons stuck around to mingle, swap contact info and trade author recommendations.",
      "It was a particularly social event for a book talk. But the communal atmosphere is typical of events for romance fans.",

      "\u201cThey\u2019re educated on the genre in a real way,\u201d Dahlia said. \u201cMany of them started reading romance \u2014 Danielle Steel, V.C. Andrews, Jude Deveraux \u2014 as teenagers.\u201d",
      "At The Ripped Bodice bookstore in Brooklyn, New York, manager Katherine Zofri said romance fans who have connected online frequently come into the store to meet in person. Along with author events, the store hosts three different book clubs and a romance comedy night.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had a couple proposals here, we\u2019ve had a wedding here which was really fun,\u201d Zofri said.",
      "She said customers range \u201cfrom teenagers who are starting to really get into the romance genres to older folks who have been romance readers for their entire lives and remember way back when they were reading the Harlequins and romance wasn\u2019t as widely accepted.",
      "\"Now they\u2019re loving seeing how widely accepted romance has become.\u201d",

      "And the genre has evolved. \u201cThe romance genre is more diverse in every way including character identity and plot,\u201d she said.",
      "Lovestruck's owner, Rachel Kanter, called the boom \u201cincredible \u2014 and honestly, overdue. Romance has always been one of the most commercially successful genres, but for a long time it didn\u2019t get the respect or space it deserved in the literary world.\u201d",
      "Romance-specific bookstores, she says, \"are places where readers can feel joy, comfort, and connection \u2014 and where love is taken seriously as a literary theme.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe pandemic had pushed so many people toward reading for escape and comfort, and romance became a lifeline for a lot of folks,\u201d said Kanter.",
      "\u201cAt the same time, there was a wider cultural shift happening \u2014 people were rethinking what mattered, craving joy and softness, and looking to support indie businesses that reflected their values. Romance, with all its hope and heart, met that moment beautifully,\" she said.",
      "Romance has countless subgenres \u2014 hockey romance, Western romance, LGBTQ romance, even romance set on prison planets. But a common theme is their \u201cinherently hopeful storylines,\u201d says Elizabeth Michaelson Monaghan, a 52-year-old freelance writer and editor in New York who said she\u2019s read \u201chundreds\u201d of romance novels.",
      "\u201cRomance must have a happily-ever-after \u2014 or at least a happily-for-now. Romance writers and readers are very clear on this,\u201d she said.",
      "Romantic fiction that doesn\u2019t end that way? That\u2019s just a love story.",
      "Traits of the romance genre also include strong character descriptions, attraction, conflict, and a satisfying resolution and emotional growth. Expect plenty of steam \u2014 some authors deploy it explicitly, others are more tame.",
      "There\u2019s a long-standing culture of (mostly) women reading and sharing these books across generations.",

      "Romance novels, she said, are \u201ca lovely reminder that individualism and companionship can go together. These are basic bonds.\u201d",
      "Podcasts, too, have become a source for discovering what's trending. Andrea Martucci, creator and host of the romance-focused \u201cShelf Love\u201d podcast, said romance bookstores have become places of connection akin, in some ways, to churches \u2014 for the romantically devoted.",

      "She didn\u2019t have legal status, so she couldn\u2019t get health insurance and skipped routine exams, relying instead on home remedies and, at times, getting inhalers from Mexico. She insisted on using only her first name for fear of deportation.",
      "Things changed for Maria and many others in recent years when a handful of Democrat-led states opened up their health insurance programs to low-income immigrants regardless of their legal status. Maria and her husband signed up the day the program began last year.",
      "\u201cIt changed immensely, like from Earth to the heavens,\u201d Maria said in Spanish of Medi-Cal, California\u2019s Medicaid program. \u201cHaving the peace of mind of getting insurance leads me to getting sick less.\u201d",
      "At least seven states and the District of Columbia have offered coverage for immigrants since mostly 2020. But three of them have done an about-face, ending or limiting coverage for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who aren\u2019t in the U.S. legally in California, Illinois and Minnesota.",
      "The programs cost way more than officials had projected at a time when the states are facing multibillion-dollar deficits now and in the future. In Illinois, adult immigrants ages 42-64 without legal status have lost their health care to save an estimated $404 million. All adult immigrants in Minnesota no longer have access to the state program, saving nearly $57 million. In California, no one will automatically lose coverage, but new enrollments for adults will stop in 2026 to save more than $3 billion over several years.",
      "Cuts in all three states were backed by Democratic governors who once championed expanding health coverage to immigrants.",
      "The Trump administration this week shared the home addresses, ethnicities and personal data of all Medicaid recipients with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. Twenty states, including California, Illinois and Minnesota, have sued.",
      "Health care providers told The Associated Press that everything, especially the fear of being arrested or deported, is having a chilling effect on people seeking care. And states may have to spend more money down the road because immigrants will avoid preventive health care and end up needing to go to safety-net hospitals.",
      "\u201cI feel like they continue to squeeze you more and more to the point where you\u2019ll burst,\u201d Maria said, referencing all the uncertainties for people who are in the U.S. without legal permission.",
      "People who run free and community health clinics in California and Minnesota said patients who got on state Medicaid programs received knee replacements and heart procedures, and were diagnosed for serious conditions like late-stage cancer.",
      "CommunityHealth is one of the nation\u2019s largest free clinics, serving many uninsured and underinsured immigrants in the Chicago area who have no other options for treatment. That includes the people who lost coverage July 1 when Illinois ended its Health Benefits for Immigrants Adults Program, which served about 31,500 people ages 42-64.",
      "One of CommunityHealth\u2019s community outreach workers and care coordinator said Eastern European patients she works with started coming in with questions about what the change meant for them. She said many of the patients also don\u2019t speak English and don\u2019t have transportation to get to clinics that can treat them. The worker spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to protect patients\u2019 privacy.",
      "Health Finders Collective in Minnesota's rural Rice and Steele counties south of Minneapolis serves low-income and underinsured patients, including large populations of Latino immigrants and Somali refugees. Executive director Charlie Mandile said they\u2019re seeing patients rushing to squeeze in appointments and procedures before 19,000 people age 18 and older are kicked off of insurance at the end of the year.",
      "Free and community health clinics in all three states say they will keep serving patients regardless of insurance coverage \u2014 but that might get harder after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services decided this month to restrict federally qualified health centers from treating people without legal status.",
      "CommunityHealth CEO Stephanie Willding said she always worried about the stability of the program because it was fully state funded, \u201cbut truthfully, we thought that day was much, much further away.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are going to die. Some people are going to go untreated,\u201d Alicia Hardy, chief executive officer of CommuniCARE+OLE clinics in California, said of the state's Medicaid changes. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see the humanity in the decision-making that\u2019s happening right now.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Minnesota Department of Health said ending the state\u2019s program will decrease MinnesotaCare spending in the short term, but she acknowledged health care costs would rise elsewhere, including uncompensated care at hospitals.",
      "Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, a Republican, said the state's program was not sustainable.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about trying to be non-compassionate or not caring about people,\" she said. \"When we looked at the state budget, the dollars were not there to support what was passed and what was being spent.\u201d",
      "Demuth also noted that children will still have coverage, and adults lacking permanent legal status can buy private health insurance.",
      "Health care providers also are worried that preventable conditions will go unmanaged, and people will avoid care until they end up in emergency rooms \u2013 where care will be available under federal law.",
      "One of those safety-net public hospitals, Cook County Health in Chicago, treated about 8,000 patients from Illinois\u2019 program last year. Dr. Erik Mikaitis, the health system\u2019s CEO, said doing so brought in $111 million in revenue.",
      "But he anticipated other providers who billed through the program could close, he said, adding: \u201cThings can become unstable very quickly.\u201d",
      "State lawmakers said California\u2019s Medi-Cal changes stem from budget issues \u2014 a $12 billion deficit this year, with larger ones projected ahead. Democratic state leaders last month agreed to stop new enrollment starting in 2026 for all low-income adults without legal status. Those under 60 remaining on the program will have to pay a $30 monthly fee in 2027.",
      "States are also bracing for impact from federal policies. Cuts to Medicaid and other programs in the recently signed massive tax and spending bill include a 10% cut to the federal share of Medicaid expansion costs to states that offer health benefits to immigrants starting October 2027.",
      "California health officials estimate roughly 200,000 people will lose coverage after the first full year of restricted enrollment, though Gov. Gavin Newsom maintains that even with the rollbacks, California provides the most expansive health care coverage for poor adults.",
      "Every new bill requires a shift in Maria's monthly calculations to make ends meet. She believes many people won\u2019t be able to afford the $30-a-month premiums and will instead go back to self-medication or skip treatment altogether.",

Providers told the AP that, as immigration raids ramped up, their patients were requesting more virtual appointments, not showing up to routine doctor\u2019s visits and not picking up prescriptions for their chronic conditions.",
      "Maria has the option to keep her coverage. But she is weighing the health of her family against risking what they\u2019ve built in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult,\u201d Maria said of her decision to remain on the program. \u201cIf it comes to the point where my husband gets sick and his life is at risk, well then, obviously, we have to choose his life.\u201d",

Yet its own data shows the agency has resolved far fewer civil rights cases than in past years despite families filing more complaints.",

      "\u201cNot only are we reducing the backlog, but we are keeping up with the current amount with a reduced staff because we are doing it efficiently,\u201d McMahon said at a Senate budget hearing.",
      "By several measures, however, the output of the Office for Civil Rights appears to have fallen sharply in comparison with previous years. A public database of the office\u2019s resolution agreements \u2014 cases in which schools or universities voluntarily agreed to address civil rights concerns \u2014 suggests the office\u2019s work has slowed.",

During President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, the office averaged more than 800 resolutions a year, including 1,300 during his first year in office.",
      "Other internal data obtained by The Associated Press show a similar trend. Since Trump took office, the total number of resolved cases is down about 40% from the same time frame last year \u2014 including cases that were dismissed, mediated or reached a voluntary resolution. Compared with last year, there also has been a 70% decrease in the number of cases resolved through resolution agreements or action taken by a school to comply with federal law, the internal data shows.",
      "Meanwhile, new complaints have increased 9%. The total number of cases has now climbed beyond 25,000.",
      "An Education Department spokesperson said the Trump administration is fixing a broken system.",
      "\u201cWhen staff levels were at their peak, OCR\u2019s processes still proved to be ineffective, as evidenced by the chronic backlog of tens of thousands of cases that left students\u2019 discrimination claims languishing over many presidential administrations,\u201d spokesperson Julie Hartman said.",
      "Parents and advocates say they\u2019ve noticed a difference.",
      "Adrienne Hazel filed a complaint in April after her 20-year-old son Ricky, who has autism, was placed in a public school program without a certified teacher and was not given an individual learning plan. Hazel, of Southfield, Michigan, has not heard from the federal office after receiving an automatic reply when she filed the complaint.",
      "Things moved faster last year when Hazel filed a separate complaint for her son. The office notified Ricky\u2019s school, which Hazel says spurred the district to reach an agreement with her within about three months. This time, she said, it feels like she\u2019s on her own.",
      "\u201cThere has been zero response to this,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s basically going into a babysitting situation. He\u2019s not getting the things that he needs to grow into independence. And he\u2019ll just be aging without getting an education.\u201d",
      "Marcie Lipsitt, a special education advocate in Michigan who worked with Hazel, said such stories are common. She helps families file complaints but warns it could take at least a year before an investigation opens. Some schools have backtracked on previous agreements, she said, yet parents can\u2019t get a response from the federal office.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s horrible. I\u2019m watching children suffer like they\u2019ve never suffered,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no accountability.\u201d",
      "The fate of the Education Department itself is in question as the Trump administration moves ahead with a plan to wind down the agency. A Supreme Court decision Monday cleared the way for the agency to continue mass layoffs and outsource some functions to other agencies. McMahon previously suggested the civil rights work could be managed by the Justice Department.",
      "Still, McMahon said in June that the office was making headway after inheriting a backlog of 20,000 cases from the Biden administration. She told senators the office was catching up on the backlog and keeping up with new complaints.",
      "With half the staff, many question how that\u2019s possible. In a June court order pausing the termination of Office for Civil Rights employees, a federal judge in Boston said the branch is \u201ccurrently incapable of addressing the vast majority\u201d of complaints. More than 200 of the office\u2019s employees remain on leave while that case is decided.",
      "The Office for Civil Rights is responsible for enforcing civil rights laws across the nation\u2019s schools and is often a last resort for parents and students facing discrimination from schools. The office reviews complaints and, for those that meet certain criteria, opens investigations. Others are dismissed or move to a mediation process.",
      "Of the 65 resolution agreements reported this year, 57 were signed after Trump took office. Of those, the vast majority involve complaints of discrimination based on disability, with smaller numbers based on sex or race. Most of the sex discrimination findings deal with keeping transgender athletes out of women\u2019s sports, one of Trump\u2019s campaign promises.",
      "\"OCR will continue to meet its statutory responsibilities while driving to improve efficiency and resolve the longstanding backlog,\u201c Hartman said.",
      "Multiple workers in the office who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation said caseloads have grown too big to manage. In last year\u2019s budget request, the office said it was becoming difficult to keep up when investigative staff averaged 42 cases per person. Some estimates put the current caseload beyond 200.",
      "The employees said it means more cases will languish.",
      "Another parent in Michigan, Casie Clouse, hasn\u2019t heard from the department since she filed a complaint in May. Her son, Brady, who is blind in one eye and has a learning disability, wasn\u2019t getting the type of help his school promised, including access to teachers\u2019 notes and reduced coursework. Brady, 14, made no academic progress in eighth grade, and he\u2019s now heading to high school without the support he needs, his mother said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been so frustrating not to even have an update at all,\u201d said Clouse, of Ann Arbor. \u201cHe is going to go to high school and fail. I feel like my child will not get a high school diploma if he stays in Ann Arbor Public Schools.\u201d",

      "The removal of 21 children from a Los Angeles-area couple has put a spotlight on the practice of using surrogates to build a family",
      "The removal of 21 children from the custody of a Los Angeles-area couple has put a spotlight on the practice of using surrogates to build a family. Surrogacy has no federal regulation, leaving it up to states to set the rules if they choose to allow it.",
      "The kids \u2014 15 at the couple's mansion and six more living elsewhere \u2014 were taken by an LA County child welfare agency in May after the parents were accused of failing to intervene in the abuse of a baby by a nanny, police in Arcadia said.",
      "The children range in age from 2 months to 13 years, with most between 1 and 3, police said. The FBI won\u2019t comment but agents are investigating. Silvia Zhang, 38, and Guojun Xuan, 65, have not responded to emails seeking comment.",
      "Police believe Zhang gave birth to one or two of the children while the rest were born by surrogate. Some women who were paid surrogates for the couple now say they were unaware that the couple was accumulating a supersize family, raising questions about their intentions.",
      "\u201cWhat were they going to do with these children?\u201d said Deborah Wald, a lawyer in San Francisco whose expertise includes surrogacy law.",
      "Surrogacy is an agreement between parties to have a woman become pregnant, typically through an embryo transfer, and deliver a baby. The intended parent or parents might struggle with infertility. They also could be same-sex couples.",
      "There\u2019s no limit on how many children someone can have through surrogates or any other method, said Wald, who is not involved in the Arcadia case.",
      "She acknowledged that California is considered a \u201csurrogacy-friendly state\" because it has clear laws around the process.",
      "Both sides are required to have lawyers, and there must be a written, notarized contract before an embryo transfer, Wald said.",
      "\u201cThe legitimate surrogacy community in California is very distressed when things like this happen,\u201d Wald said of surrogates feeling deceived. \u201dWe\u2019ve worked very hard on legal and ethical standards. It hurts everyone when something like this happens.\u201d",
      "There are businesses that act as matchmakers, connecting surrogates to people who want to have children. State business records show a company called Mark Surrogacy Investment LLC had been registered at the Arcadia address of Zhang and Xuan.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if Zhang and Xuan set up the business solely to find surrogates for themselves. State records show the company terminated its business license in June.",
      "Wald said there are no special licensing requirements in California for businesses that match surrogates with intended parents.",
      "Wald said there should have been plenty of checks and balances in the process, noting the role of fertility clinics in handling embryos.",
      "\u201cThe first place typically is the matching program that matches the surrogate with an intended parent. But in this situation the intended parents were the matching program,\u201d Wald said. \u201cI am not familiar with any other prior case where that was true.\u201d",
      "Arcadia police said the six children who were not at the couple's home were found with family friends. The couple's house was \u201cset up for a school environment,\u201d Lt. Kollin Cieadlo said.",
      "Zhang and Xuan were accused of neglect and arrested in May. Charges were not formally pursued at that time in order for an abuse investigation to continue, and detectives now believe there were other instances of abuse, Cieadlo said.",
      "A 2-month-old infant with a traumatic head injury, allegedly at the hands of a nanny, remains in a hospital in stable condition, he said.",
      "California law requires child welfare agencies to prioritize placing children who cannot safely be with their parents in homes with extended family, and requires siblings to be kept together unless it would endanger the child to do so, said Leslie Heimov, the executive director of the Children\u2019s Law Center of California.",
      "The Children\u2019s Law Center has worked with some families with 10 to 12 children, Heimov said. A family with 20 children or more is \u201cunusual,\" she added.",
      "It\u2019s more complicated to find foster homes for larger families that can accommodate all the children\u2019s needs, especially for infants, Heimov said.",
      "In addition to expenses and limited space, it's hard to give infants the proper stimulation and care they need if they are in a home with many other children, she said.",
      "In cases involving many children, the state will sometimes get creative to make sure that siblings can maintain relationships with each other, like placing them in the same neighborhood, or placing them in different but related households, Heimov said.",
      "A case involving over 20 children conceived through surrogacy would \u201cpresent some legal questions,\u201d said Heimov. \u201cBut it would not change our advocacy \u2014 we want every child we represent to be in a loving, safe home.\"",

      "Swollen legs led to President Donald Trump being diagnosed with what\u2019s called chronic venous insufficiency",
      "Swollen legs led to President Donald Trump being diagnosed with what's called chronic venous insufficiency. It's a fairly common condition among older adults but requires a thorough checkup to rule out more serious causes of swelling in the legs. Here are some things to know.",
      "Chronic venous insufficiency, or CVI, happens when veins in the legs can't properly carry blood back to the heart. That can lead to blood pooling in the lower legs. In addition to swelling, usually around the feet and ankles, symptoms can include legs that are achy, heavy feeling or tingly, and varicose veins. Severe cases could trigger leg sores known as ulcers.",
      "Overcoming gravity to pump blood from the feet all the way up to the heart is a challenge, especially when someone is standing or sitting for long periods. So legs veins are lined with one-way valves that keep blood from sliding backward on that journey. Anything that damages those valves can lead to chronic venous insufficiency. Risk factors can include blood clots, vein inflammation known as phlebitis or being overweight.",
      "Doctors must rule out serious causes of leg swelling, such as heart problems, kidney disease or blood clots. Ultrasound exams of the leg veins can help confirm chronic venous insufficiency. According to the Cleveland Clinic, treatment can include wearing compression stockings, elevating the legs and achieving a healthy weight. Also exercise, especially walking, is recommended \u2014 because strong leg muscles can squeeze veins in a way that helps them pump blood. Medications and medical procedures are available for more advanced cases.",

      "Researchers report that eight healthy babies were born with the help of an experimental technique that uses DNA from three people to help mothers avoid passing rare diseases to their children",
      "LONDON -- Eight healthy babies were born in Britain with the help of an experimental technique that uses DNA from three people to help mothers avoid passing devastating rare diseases to their children, researchers reported Wednesday.",
      "Most DNA is found in the nucleus of our cells, and it's that genetic material \u2014 some inherited from mom, some from dad \u2014 that makes us who we are. But there's also some DNA outside of the cell's nucleus, in structures called mitochondria. Dangerous mutations there can cause a range of diseases in children that can lead to muscle weakness, seizures, developmental delays, major organ failure and death.",
      "Testing during the in vitro fertilization process can usually identify whether these mutations are present. But in rare cases, it's not clear.",
      "Researchers have been developing a technique that tries to avoid the problem by using the healthy mitochondria from a donor egg. They reported in 2023 that the first babies had been born using this method, where scientists take genetic material from the mother's egg or embryo, which is then transferred into a donor egg or embryo that has healthy mitochondria but the rest of its key DNA removed.",
      "The latest research \u201cmarks an important milestone,\u201d said Dr. Zev Williams, who directs the Columbia University Fertility Center and was not involved in the work. \u201cExpanding the range of reproductive options \u2026 will empower more couples to pursue safe and healthy pregnancies.\u201d",
      "Using this method means the embryo has DNA from three people \u2014 from the mother's egg, the father's sperm and the donor's mitochondria \u2014 and it required a 2016 U.K. law change to approve it. It is also allowed in Australia but not in many other countries, including the U.S.",
      "Experts at Britain\u2019s Newcastle University and Monash University in Australia reported in the New England Journal of Medicine Wednesday that they performed the new technique in fertilized embryos from 22 patients, which resulted in eight babies that appear to be free of mitochondrial diseases. One woman is still pregnant.",
      "One of the eight babies born had slightly higher than expected levels of abnormal mitochondria, said Robin Lovell-Badge, a stem cell and developmental genetics scientist at the Francis Crick Institute who was not involved in the research. He said it was still not considered a high enough level to cause disease, but should be monitored as the baby develops.",
      "Dr. Andy Greenfield, a reproductive health expert at the University of Oxford, called the work \u201ca triumph of scientific innovation,\u201d and said the method of exchanging mitochondria would only be used for a small number of women for whom other ways of avoiding passing on genetic diseases, like testing embryos at an early stage, was not effective.",
      "Lovell-Badge said the amount of DNA from the donor is insignificant, noting that any resulting child would have no traits from the woman who donated the healthy mitochondria. The genetic material from the donated egg makes up less than 1% of the baby born after this technique.",
      "\u201cIf you had a bone marrow transplant from a donor \u2026 you will have much more DNA from another person,\u201d he said.",
      "In the U.K., every couple seeking a baby born through donated mitochondria must be approved by the country\u2019s fertility regulator. As of this month, 35 patients have been authorized to undergo the technique.",
      "Critics have previously raised concerns, warning that it's impossible to know the impact these sorts of novel techniques might have on future generations.",
      "\u201cCurrently, pronuclear transfer is not permitted for clinical use in the U.S., largely due to regulatory restrictions on techniques that result in heritable changes to the embryo,\" Williams, of Columbia, said in an email. \u201dWhether that will change remains uncertain and will depend on evolving scientific, ethical, and policy discussions.\"",
      "For about a decade, Congress has included provisions in annual funding bills banning the Food and Drug Administration from accepting applications for clinical research involving techniques, \u201cin which a human embryo is intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic modification.\u201d",
      "But in countries where the technique is allowed, advocates say it could provide a promising alternative for some families.",
      "Liz Curtis, whose daughter Lily died of a mitochondrial disease in 2006, now works with other families affected by them. She said it was devastating to be told there was no treatment for her eight-month-old baby and that death was inevitable.",
      "She said the diagnosis \u201cturned our world upside down, and yet nobody could tell us very much about it, what it was or how it was going to affect Lily.\u201d Curtis later founded the Lily Foundation in her daughter\u2019s name to raise awareness and support research into the disease, including the latest work done at Newcastle University.",

      "Two university hospitals are pioneering new ways to expand access to the lifesaving heart transplants for adults and babies",
      "WASHINGTON -- Two university hospitals are pioneering new ways to expand lifesaving heart transplants for adults and babies \u2014 advances that could help recover would-be heart donations that too often go unused.",
      "The new research aims to overcome barriers for using organs from someone who dies when their heart stops. Called DCD, or donation after circulatory death, it involves a controversial recovery technique or the use of expensive machines.",
      "Surgeons at Duke and Vanderbilt universities reported Wednesday that they\u2019ve separately devised simpler approaches to retrieve those hearts. In the New England Journal of Medicine, they described successfully transplanting hearts to a 3-month-old infant at Duke and three men at Vanderbilt.",
      "\u201cThese DCD hearts work just as well as hearts from brain-dead donors,\u201d said Vanderbilt lead author Dr. Aaron M. Williams.",
      "Most transplanted hearts come from donors who are brain dead. In those situations, the body is left on a ventilator that keeps the heart beating until the organs are removed.",
      "Circulatory death occurs when someone has a nonsurvivable brain injury but because all brain function hasn\u2019t ceased, the family decides to withdraw life support and the heart stops. That means organs can spend a while without oxygen before being recovered, a time lag usually doable for kidneys and other organs but that can raise questions about the quality of hearts.",
      "To counter damage and determine whether DCD organs are usable, surgeons can pump blood and oxygen to the deceased donor\u2019s abdominal and chest organs \u2014 after clamping off access to the brain. But it\u2019s ethically controversial to artificially restore circulation even temporarily and some hospitals prohibit that technique, called normothermic regional perfusion, or NRP.",
      "Another option is to \u201creanimate\u201d DCD organs in a machine that pumps blood and nutrients on the way to the transplant hospital. The machines are expensive and complex, and Duke\u2019s Dr. Joseph Turek said the devices can\u2019t be used for young children\u2019s small hearts \u2014 the age group with the most dire need.",
      "Turek\u2019s team found a middle ground: Remove the heart and attach some tubes of oxygen and blood to briefly assess its ability to function \u2014 not in a machine but on a sterile table in the operating room.",
      "They practiced with piglets. Then came the real test. At another hospital, life support was about to be withdrawn from a 1-month-old whose family wanted to donate \u2014 and who would be a good match for a 3-month-old Duke patient in desperate need of a new heart. The other hospital didn\u2019t allow the controversial NRP recovery technique but let Turek\u2019s team test the experimental alternative.",
      "It took just five minutes to tell \u201cthe coronary arteries are filling well, it\u2019s pink, it\u2019s beating,\u201d Turek said. The team promptly put the little heart on ice and raced it back to Duke.",
      "Vanderbilt\u2019s system is even simpler: Infuse the heart with a nutrient-rich, cold preservative solution before removing it from the donor\u2019s body, similar to how hearts from brain-dead donors are handled.",
      "That \u201creplenishes the nutrients that are depleted during the dying process and helps protect it for transport,\u201d Williams explained, adding that Vanderbilt has performed about 25 such transplants so far. \u201cOur view is you don\u2019t necessarily need to reanimate the heart.\u201d",
      "There's a huge need for more transplantable hearts. Hundreds of thousands of adults suffer from advanced heart failure, yet many are never even offered a transplant because of the organ shortage.",
      "Every year about 700 children in the U.S. are added to the transplant list for a new heart and about 20% die waiting. Turek said infants are at particular risk.",
      "Last year, people whose lives ended via circulatory death made up 43% of the nation\u2019s deceased donors \u2014 but just 793 of the 4,572 heart transplants.",
      "That's why many specialists say finding ways to use more of those hearts is crucial. The new studies are small and early-stage but promising, said Brendan Parent of NYU Langone Health, who directs transplant ethics and policy research.",
      "\u201cInnovation to find ways to recover organs successfully after circulatory death are essential for reducing the organ shortage,\u201d he said.",

      "Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- For decades, proponents of psychedelic drugs have come to Washington with a provocative message: Illegal, mind-altering substances like LSD and ecstasy should be approved for Americans grappling with depression, trauma and other hard-to-treat conditions.",
      "A presidential administration finally seems to agree.",
      "\u201cThis line of therapeutics has tremendous advantage if given in a clinical setting and we are working very hard to make sure that happens within 12 months,\u201d Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently told members of Congress.",
      "His suggested timeline for green-lighting psychedelic therapy surprised even the most bullish supporters of the drugs. And it comes as psychedelics are making inroads in deep red states like Texas, where former Trump cabinet secretary and ex-governor Rick Perry has thrown his full support behind the effort.",
      "The administration's embrace of psychedelics has sparked both excitement as well as concern from those in the field, who worry the drugs might be discredited if they appear to be rushed onto the market or are too closely linked with Kennedy, who is known for controversial views on vaccines, antidepressants and fluoride.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m quite optimistic,\u201d says Rick Doblin, whose organization has pursed the medical use of MDMA (or ecstasy) since the 1980s. \u201cBut I\u2019m also worried that the message the public might get is \u2018Well, RFK likes psychedelics and now it\u2019s approved.\u2019\u201d",
      "Under President Joe Biden, the FDA rejected MDMA as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, citing flawed data and questionable research. Regulators called for a new study, likely taking several years. It was a major setback for Doblin and other advocates hoping to see the first U.S. approval of a psychedelic for medical use.",
      "But the agency appears ready to reconsider. FDA chief Marty Makary, who reports to Kennedy, has called the evaluation of MDMA and other psychedelics \u201ca top priority,\u201d announcing a slate of initiatives that could be used to accelerate their approval.",
      "One new program promises to expedite drugs that serve \u201cthe health interests of Americans,\u201d by slashing their review time from six months or more to as little as one month. Makary has also suggested greater flexibility on requirements for certain drugs, potentially waiving rigorous controlled studies that compare patients to a placebo group.",
      "That approach, considered essential for high-quality research, has long been a stumbling point for psychedelic studies, in which patients can almost always correctly guess whether they\u2019ve received the drug or a dummy pill.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and FDA also recently hired several new staffers with ties to the psychedelic movement.",
      "\u201cThese are all very promising signs that the administration is aware of the potential of psychedelics and is trying to make overtures that they\u2019re ready to approve them,\u201d said Greg Ferenstein, a fellow at the libertarian Reason Foundation, who also consults for psychedelic companies. \u201cWe didn\u2019t hear anything about that in the Biden administration\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for HHS did not respond to a request for comment.",

It was sold for medical use in France for several decades starting in the 1930s, but the drug can also cause dangerous irregular heart rhythms, which can be fatal if left untreated.",

Turkey's president reaffirmed his full backing for a controversial peace deal that envisions the establishment of two separate states.",
      "It\u2019s a proposal that the majority Greek Cypriots in the island\u2019s internationally recognized southern part reject out of hand.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to end an eight-year moratorium on formal peace negotiations.",
      "The meeting achieved little in the way of a return to fully fledged negotiations as Tatar insisted on recognition for the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state as a prerequisite. The meeting did, however, achieve some progress on a number of confidence-building measures such the exchange of cultural artifacts and the setting up of an advisory committee on civil society.",

      "That switch came after the last big push for a peace accord in the summer of 2017. It fell through on what Greek Cypriots said was a Turkish and Turkish Cypriot insistence on keeping a permanent Turkish troop presence on the island and enshrining military intervention rights for Turkey as part of any deal. Greek Cypriots also rejected a demand for blanket veto powers for the minority Turkish Cypriots on all government decisions.",
      "In the south where Greek Cypriots commemorated the invasion with solemn memorials to the war dead, Christodoulides said the international community gives no support to a two-state deal. He said Turkey\u2019s continuing \u201coccupation of European territory\u201d subverts its ambitions for closer European Union ties and undermines the role it wishes to play in the region.",

      "Congo and Rwanda-backed rebels have signed a declaration aiming for a permanent ceasefire in eastern Congo",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- Congo and Rwanda-backed rebels have signed a declaration of principles for a permanent ceasefire in eastern Congo, where ethnic tensions and quest for rich minerals have resulted in one of Africa\u2019s longest conflicts with thousands killed this year.",
      "The African Union called Saturday\u2019s signing, facilitated by Qatar, a \u201cmajor milestone\u201d in peace efforts. Qatari authorities said it paves the way for \u201ca comprehensive peace that addresses the deep-rooted causes of the conflict.\u201d",
      "But the ink has barely dried on the document signed in Qatar before both sides appeared to contradict each other in interpreting a major highlight of the declaration.",
      "Congolese government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said the declaration takes into account \u201cthe non-negotiable withdrawal\u201d of the rebels from seized territories, including the biggest city of Goma. The M23 rebels denied this, with a spokesman telling The Associated Press: \u201cWe are in Goma with the population and we are not going to get out.\u201d",
      "The declaration of principles was the first direct commitment by both sides since the rebels, supported by neighboring Rwanda, seized two key cities in eastern Congo in a major advance early this year.",
      "In it, both parties committed to \u201cbuilding trust\u201d through various measures, including an exchange of prisoners and detainees as well as restoring state authority in all parts of the country, including rebel-held areas. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has been mentioned as a key party in facilitating such release, said after the signing that it \u201cstands ready to help.\"",
      "The signing sets in motion negotiations for a final peace deal, to be signed no later than Aug. 18. It also reflects provisions of a U.S.-brokered peace deal signed between Congo and Rwanda on June 27.",
      "Both the U.S.-facilitated and Qatar-led peace talks are aligned, and the Congolese and Rwandan presidents are soon expected in Washington to finalize negotiations for ending the conflict.",
      "The conflict can be traced to the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide of 1994, when Hutu soldiers and militias killed between 500,000 and 1 million minority Tutsis as well as moderate Hutus and the Indigenous Twa. When Tutsi-led rebels stopped the genocide and ousted the Hutu government, nearly 2 million Hutus fled into neighboring Congo, fearing reprisals.",
      "Rwandan authorities accused the authorities in Kinshasa of sheltering those responsible for the mass killings among the civilian refugees, most of whom had returned when Rwanda first invaded Congo in 1996. But Kigali said the remaining Hutu fighters in eastern Congo are still a threat to Rwanda's Tutsi population, and wants them neutralized.",
      "At least 6 million people have been killed in the conflict since then, mostly characterized by on-and-off fighting but also famines and unchecked disease outbreaks.",
      "Analysts have said a lot of interests in the conflict in Congo are tied to the mostly untapped minerals in the east, estimated to be worth as much as $24 trillion by the U.S. Department of Commerce.",
      "The Trump administration has pushed to gain access to the minerals key to much of the world\u2019s technology. It is also to counter China, a key player in the region where the U.S. presence and influence have eroded. That is already playing out with KoBold Metals, a U.S. mining company that on Friday announced it has signed an agreement with Congo for \u201clarge-scale minerals exploration program\u201d in the east.",
      "Rwanda\u2019s interests are also tied to the conflict minerals, although it often says its involvement is to protect its territory and punish those connected to the 1994 genocide.",
      "A team of U.N. experts said in a report in December that Rwanda was benefitting from minerals \u201cfraudulently\u201d exported from areas under the control of the M23. Rwanda has denied it.",
      "Although the M23 has touted itself as a group independent of Rwanda and capable of governing territories under its control, it still relies heavily on Kigali. U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan troops in eastern Congo.",
      "The U.N. and rights groups have accused both sides of committing atrocities and possible war crimes since fighting escalated in January. It includes children being killed in summary executions, the rape and sexual abuse of thousands of children, attacks on hospitals, forced recruitments and disappearance of residents in rebel-held areas.",
      "\u201cWe cannot build peace without justice and reparation,\u201d Goma resident Amani Muisa said.",

      "The figure for fires was down from 294 hotspots on Saturday after authorities managed to extinguish the fire in several places, Kusumo said.",

      "The clashes between militias of the Druze religious minority and the Sunni Muslim clans killed hundreds and threatened to unravel Syria's already fragile postwar transition. Israel also launched dozens of airstrikes in the Druze-majority Sweida province, targeting government forces who had effectively sided with the Bedouins.",

      "Interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa, who has been perceived as more sympathetic to the Bedouins, had tried to appeal to the Druze community while remaining critical of the militias.

      "Among those killed in the weeklong fighting were dozens of Druze civilians slain in a series of targeted attacks in the city at the hands of Bedouin fighters and government forces. Videos surfaced online of fighters destroying portraits of Druze religious officials and notables in homes, and shaving the mustaches of elderly Druze, seen as an insult to culture and tradition. Druze militias in return attacked Bedouin-majority areas in the outskirts of the province, forcing families to flee to neighboring Daraa province.",

      "Syria's Druze largely celebrated the downfall of the Assad family that ended decades of tyrannical rule. While they had concerns about Al-Sharaa's de facto Islamist rule, a large number wanted to approach matters diplomatically. Al-Hijri and his supporters, though, have taken a more confrontational approach with Al-Sharaa, contrary to most other influential Druze figures. Critics also note al-Hijri's previous allegiance to Assad.",

      "\u201cOur farmers don't recall such a bad and hard year,\u201d Filipovic said. \u201cPeople here mostly do farming and use products for own needs, for their existence. This year has brought unseen hardship for them.\"",

      "In eastern Croatia, authorities declared emergency measures in several municipalities along the border with Hungary to deal with the effects of the drought. The country's vegetable growers have warned many could go out of business.",
      "Earlier in July, both Albania and Kosovo reported water shortages that affected also electricity production in Albania.",
      "Serbia's farmers have asked for financial help from the government, fearing poor yield, which could spike prices. Irrigation systems in the country are underdeveloped, leaving many farmers dependent on the weather.",
      "Jovica Jaksic, of the Independent Farmers\u2019 Association told the state RTS television that the damage to the corn is so big already that even if it rained for the rest of the summer, it wouldn't help.",
      "Scientists warn that climate change is exacerbating the frequency and intensity of heat and dryness in parts of Europe, making the region more vulnerable to health impacts and wildfires.",
      "The EU monitoring agency found that, in Europe and globally, 2024 was the hottest year on record and the continent experienced its second-highest number of \u201cheat stress\u201d days.",
      "In Serbia\u2019s northern neighbor Hungary, weather-damaged crops have dealt significant blows to the country\u2019s overall GDP. This has prompted Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n to announce the creation of a \u201cdrought task force\u201d to deal with the problem.",
      "Persistent droughts in the Great Hungarian Plain, in the country\u2019s southeast, have threatened desertification, a process where vegetation recedes due to high heat and low rainfall. The soil remains \u201ccritically dry,\u201d the country\u2019s meteorological service said on Thursday, warning of the negative effects on the crops.",

      "In one of the top Arctic birding destinations in the world, environmental and health challenges are threatening some of the seabirds that are part of Norway\u2019s unique coastal ecosystem",
      "VARD\u00d8, Norway -- In one of the top Arctic birding destinations in the world, environmental and health challenges are threatening some of the seabirds that are part of Norway's unique coastal ecosystem.",
      "The population of kittiwakes has decreased by 80% since the 1990s along the Scandinavian country's coast. The small seagull species, among others, is under siege from climate change, predation, local fisheries and the bird flu.",
      "So the town of Vard\u00f8, on the remote Vard\u00f8ya Island in the Barents Sea, has stepped up to help the migrating visitors.",
      "Three years ago, local fisherman Jan Vidar Hansen built a \u201cseagull hotel\u201d out of crates for kittiwakes and other seabirds to nest in safely. The hotel has the added bonus of limiting the spread of unwelcome smells, dirty nests and droppings that have become a nuisance for the island's human population.",
      "\u201cThe first year there was 55 nests. Last year it was 74, and this year we have 76,\u201d Vidar Hansen said. He hopes the local council will agree to build a bigger seagull hotel in the future.",
      "Seabirds have long been an important part of the identity of Vard\u00f8 \u2014 so much so that the local museum has an exhibition dedicated to them. The town is known for its birding tourism as much as its radar station, which provides critical data to the U.S. Strategic Command thanks to its location nearly 60 kilometers (37 miles) from Russia\u2019s military hub on the Kola Peninsula.",
      "Norway's northern coast is an ecologically diverse area due to its topography as well as the Gulf Stream, which brings warmer water up from the Gulf of Mexico and then mixes with the cold Arctic air and water. This warmer water keeps the Barents Sea free from ice even though it's north of the Arctic Circle, and brings tons of fish larvae and other biomass up the Norwegian coast.",
      "But the Gulf Stream is affected by climate change and is now bringing water that is too warm into the Barents Sea, changing the rich composition of the species there. It affects congregations of seabirds, marine mammals and, of course, many fish species.",
      "Fish that need colder water are being pushed further north, while others that require the mix of warmer and Arctic water \u2014 like the small schooling fish called capelin \u2014 are seeing their migration patterns disturbed.",
      "Capelin, for instance, are a major part of the diet for surface-feeding seabirds like kittiwakes, according to Tone Kristin Reiertsen, a researcher with the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research.",
      "When capelin either swim deeper into the sea to get to colder water, or migrate further north, seabirds cannot get to them, she said. That in turn impacts the success of seabirds' breeding because they depend on capelin to bring to their chicks.",
      "Boris Belchev, a bird guide and ranger on the nearby Horn\u00f8ya Island, says it's a frightening domino effect.",
      "\"I was seeing birds that usually eat fish on the tundra start eating berries because they don\u2019t have their normal food,\u201d he said.",
      "With fewer seabirds surviving, those who remain are easy targets for predators like white-tailed eagles, Reiertsen said. Plus, fisheries situated close to the coastal cliff nesting sites can disturb the dynamics of the colonies.",
      "And then there's the threat of bird flu. In 2023, a large outbreak killed some 25,000 kittiwakes alone along the northern Norwegian coast, Reiertsen said.",
      "\u201cIt felt like an apocalypse,\" she said.",
      "Vidar Hansen's seagull hotel in Vard\u00f8 is one of seven such kittiwake hotels along the Norwegian coast, Reiertsen said.",
      "\u201cIt's not an easy task to get the kittiwakes to move in to these hotels,\u201d she said with a laugh.",
      "But it's working. The small seagulls in recent years have migrated deeper into Vard\u00f8's center in search of protection from predators. There were roughly 300 kittiwakes nesting in various buildings in the town and now the population there is roughly 1,300, she added.",
      "Before the Vard\u00f8 hotel, there were \"many empty nests around the whole city,\u201d Vidar Hansen said.",
      "Reiertsen said kittiwakes and other seabirds are crucial to the region's ecology. Their droppings bring important nutrients into the sea, and further decreases in their population could be dangerous to the entire ecosystem.",
      "She said officials need to change their mindset from monitoring the problem to figuring out how to fix it. A potential idea, she added, could be limiting or prohibiting fisheries and boat traffic near nesting colonies.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have much time,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to act quickly.\u201d",
      "The seabirds are also key to Vard\u00f8's economy.",
      "Just a short boat ride away from Vard\u00f8 lies Horn\u00f8ya Island, a birdwatchers' paradise. Thousands of visitors flock to the uninhabited Horn\u00f8ya, which is home to some 100,000 seabirds nesting there during breeding season, including much-loved Atlantic puffins, common guillemots and razorbills.",
      "But the island's seabird population has also declined dramatically in recent years. There haven't been any recorded common guillemot chicks there since 2018, Belchev said.",
      "\u201cLast summer, I was shocked. \u2018What\u2019s going on here? Where are all the birds?\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "If Norway's government closes the island to the public, or birds stop nesting there and the birdwatchers stop coming, it could have a huge impact on Vard\u00f8ya Island.",
      "\u201cEvery small business in the town, it\u2019s depending on the tourists to come and visit the island and stay in the town and shop and use the gas station and use the small restaurants,\u201d Belchev said. __",

      "The Supreme Court\u2019s order for Bolsonaro to wear an ankle monitor, among other restrictions, came after Federal Police and prosecutors said Bolsonaro is a flight risk.

      "Part of that plot included a plan to kill Lula and a Supreme Court justice, the prosecution alleges. It also says that the Jan. 8 riot when Bolsonaro supporters ransacked top government buildings a week after Lula took office was an attempt to force military intervention and oust the new president.",
      "Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet says Bolsonaro\u2019s actions \u201cwere not limited to a passive stance of resistance to defeat, but were a conscious effort to create an environment conducive to violence and a coup.\u201d",

      "Japanese voters are casting ballots in a key parliamentary election",
      "TOKYO -- Japanese were voting Sunday for seats in the smaller of Japan's two parliamentary houses in a key election with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and his ruling coalition facing a possible defeat that could worsen the country's political instability.",
      "Voters were deciding half of the 248 seats in the upper house, the less powerful of the two chambers in Japan's Diet. Early results were expected Sunday night.",
      "Ishiba has set the bar low, wanting a simple majority of 125 seats, which means his Liberal Democratic Party and its Buddhist-backed junior coalition partner Komeito need to win 50 to add to the 75 seats they already have.",
      "That is a big retreat from the 141 seats they had pre-election, but media surveys predict big setbacks for Ishiba.",
      "A poor performance on Sunday would not immediately trigger a change of government because the upper house lacks the power to file no-confidence against a leader, but it would certainly deepen uncertainty over his fate and Japan\u2019s political stability. Ishiba would face calls from within the LDP party to step down or find another coalition partner.",
      "Soaring prices, lagging incomes and burdensome social security payments are the top issues for frustrated, cash-strapped voters. Stricter measures targeting foreign residents and visitors have also emerged as a key issue, with a surging right-wing populist party leading the campaign.",
      "Sunday's vote comes after Ishiba's coalition lost a majority in the October lower house election, stung by past corruption scandals, and his unpopular government has since been forced into making concessions to the opposition to get legislation through parliament. It has been unable to quickly deliver effective measures to mitigate rising prices, including Japan's traditional staple of rice, and dwindling wages.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has added to the pressure, complaining about a lack of progress in trade negotiations, and the lack of sales of U.S. autos and American-grown rice to Japan despite a shortfall in domestic stocks of the grain. A 25% tariff due to take effect Aug. 1 has been another blow for Ishiba.",
      "Ishiba has resisted any compromise before the election, but the prospect for a breakthrough after the election is just as unclear because the minority government would have difficulty forming a consensus with the opposition.",
      "Frustrated voters are rapidly turning to emerging populist parties. The eight main opposition groups, however, are too fractured to forge a common platform as a united front and gain voter support as a viable alternative.",
      "The emerging populist party Sanseito stands out with the toughest anti-foreigner stance with its \u201cJapanese First\u201d platform that proposes a new agency to centralize policies related to foreigners. The party\u2019s populist platform also includes anti-vaccine, anti-globalism and favors traditional gender roles.",
      "Conservative to centrist opposition groups, including the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, or CDPJ, the DPP, and Sanseito have gained significant ground at the Liberal Democrats\u2019 expense.",
      "The spread of xenophobic rhetoric in the election campaign and on social media has triggered protests by human rights activists and alarmed foreign residents.",

      "Born in St. Louis, Baker became a megastar in the 1930s, especially in France, where she moved in 1925 as she sought to flee racism and segregation in the United States.",
      "In addition to her stage fame, Baker also spied on the Nazis for the French Resistance and marched alongside Martin Luther King Jr. in Washington. She died in Paris in 1975.",
      "\u2018\u2019I feel moved and I feel happy, because this is part of a memory of my mother,\u201d her son Brian Baker told the Associated Press at the unveiling of the mural Saturday. He was one of 12 children Josephine Baker adopted from around the world that she called her \u2033rainbow tribe\u2033 and what her son called \u2019\u2019a little United Nations.\u2033",
      "The mural of Baker, meant to symbolize freedom and resistance, is among several painted in recent days in the neighborhood and organized by the association Paris Colors Ourq.",
      "The artist FKDL said he focuses on \u2018\u2019bringing women back into the urban landscape.\u201d",
      "\u201cJosephine Baker has always been, for me, a somewhat iconic figure of that era. Both wild and free-spirited, but also deeply connected to music, musicals, and dance,\u2033 he said. \u2019\u2019She was an extraordinary character, an incredible woman.\u201c",
      "Baker was the first Black woman inducted into France\u2019s Pantheon, joining such luminaries as philosopher Voltaire, scientist Marie Curie and writer Victor Hugo.",
      "\u2019\u2019My mother wouldn\u2019t have liked words like iconic, star, or celebrity. She would have said, no, no let\u2019s keep it simple,\u2033 her son said.",

      "China's stock market is buzzing over government promises to tackle price wars that have hurt profits and worsened global trade tensions",
      "BEIJING -- China\u2019s stock market is buzzing over government promises to tackle price wars that have hurt profits and worsened global trade tensions.",
      "The prevailing catchphrase is \u201canti-involution,\u201d and it reflects efforts to curb intense competition and overcapacity in industries like solar panels, steel, and electric vehicles.",
      "With rising trade barriers such as President Donald Trump's higher tariffs, and relatively weak domestic demand, manufacturers have been slashing prices, undermining their bottom lines and driving some out of business.",
      "The producer price index, which measures the price that factories receive for their goods, has fallen steadily for nearly three years in China in a prolonged bout of deflation. The long-running issue spilled over into global markets as low-priced Chinese exports worsen trade friction with key trading partners including the United States and Europe.",
      "In a series of recent statements, the Chinese government and industry associations have signaled they're getting serious about reining in cut-throat competition, known as invollution or \u201cneijuan\u201d in Chinese.",
      "The top 10 makers of glass for solar panels agreed on June 30 to shut kilns and cut production by 30%, an industry association said. The government has launched an auto safety inspection campaign, addressing concerns that automakers were skimping on quality to cut costs.",
      "It's unclear whether these efforts will succeed, but the sense that China may finally be tackling this chronic problem was enough to spark a rally in stocks in some of those under-pressure sectors.",
      "Shares of Liuzhou Iron & Steel Co. gained 10% on Friday and have risen more than 70% since June 30. Solar panel glass producer Changzhou Almaden Co. fell at the end of last week but is still up about 50%.",
      "More broadly, two exchange traded funds in solar panels and steel have risen about 10%, outpacing a 3.2% rise in the Shanghai Composite, China's leading market index.",
      "The performance of EV-maker stocks has been mixed, with Li Auto and Nio recording double-digit percentage gains while market leader BYD declined.",
      "Foreigners can't buy Chinese stocks directly but they are able to invest in about 2,700 stocks and 250 exchange traded funds through the Hong Kong exchange.",
      "The gains follow high-level government pronouncements against disorderly price wars. On June 29, the People's Daily newspaper, the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, ran a lengthy page 1 article on involution, saying they run counter to the party's goal of high quality economic development.",
      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping weighed in at a closed-door economic meeting, calling for better regulating competition and incentives by local governments to attract factory investments that are blamed for overinvestment in affected industries.",
      "The tougher talk began with a focus on automakers in late May, specifically around electric vehicle price wars that began more than three years ago.",
      "Analysts at investment bank UBS said the shift is good news for auto industry profits and company stocks.",
      "\u201cThough it\u2019s difficult to imagine a sudden U-turn of the industry from fierce competition to orderly consolidation, it\u2019s indeed possible to have near-term ceasefire of the price war,\u201d they wrote.",
      "After BYD launched another round of price cuts on May 23, some competitors, the main industry association and government all called for fair and sustainable competition.",
      "The EV battery industry, the cement association and major construction companies have issued statements echoing calls for an end to excess competition.",
      "The term involution, which suggests a spiraling inward and shrinking, was initially applied in China to students and young workers, who felt they were caught up in meaningless competition that led nowhere as the job market weakened and wages stagnated in recent years.",
      "At the industry level, it has come to mean sectors that have too many companies competing for a slice of the pie, leading to fierce price cutting to try to gain market share.",
      "The mismatch between production capacity \u2014 how much an industry can make \u2014 and actual demand for the product, reflects overcapacity that forces companies to compete for survival in a limited market space, said a recent article in the Communist Party magazine Qiushi.",
      "Some Chinese industries, especially steel and cement, have long suffered from overcapacity. A government push to promote green industries has fostered similar problems in that sector, including solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles.",
      "A flood of Chinese exports is leading to more trade barriers in Europe and the U.S. and in some emerging markets such as Mexico, Indonesia and India.",
      "Ultimately, economists say industries need to consolidate through company mergers and bankruptcies. But the process will take time. A major obstacle is provincial governments that want to protect local companies and jobs.",
      "Alicia Garc\u00eda-Herrero, the chief economist for Asia-Pacific at the Natixis investment bank, said that recent comments by top Chinese economic officials suggest they realize something needs to be done.",
      "\u201cHow much is action versus words, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do think it\u2019s a big problem for China.\u201d",

      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba\u2019s ruling coalition has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament",
      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba \u2019s ruling coalition failed Monday to secure a majority in the 248-seat upper house in a crucial parliamentary election, further shaking the stability of his government as Japan faces challenges such as rising prices and high U.S. tariffs.",
      "Ishiba\u2019s Liberal Democratic Party and its junior coalition partner Komeito, which needed to win 50 seats on top of the 75 seats they already have to retain their majority, won 47 seats. It was three seats short of a majority and a retreat of 19 seats from before the vote.",
      "The loss is another blow to Ishiba\u2019s coalition, making it a minority in both houses following its October defeat in the lower house election, and worsening Japan\u2019s political instability. It was the first time the LDP-led coalition has lost a majority in both houses of parliament since the party\u2019s formation in 1955.",
      "Despite the loss, Ishiba expressed determination to stay on and not create a political vacuum to tackle challenges such as U.S. tariff threats, but he could face calls from within his party to step down or find another coalition partner.",
      "\u201cI will fulfill my responsibility as head of the No. 1 party and work for the country,\u201d he said.",
      "Ishiba had set the bar low, wanting a simple majority of 125 seats, which means his LDP and its Buddhist-backed junior coalition partner Komeito needed to win 50 seats. Exit poll results released seconds after the ballots closed Sunday night mostly showed a major setback for Ishiba\u2019s coalition.",
      "The LDP alone won 39 seats, better than most exit poll projections of 32, and still the No. 1 party in the parliament, known as the Diet. But Ishiba said the coalition's poor showing was because his government\u2019s measures to combat price increases had yet to reach many people.",
      "\u201cIt's a tough situation. I take it humbly and sincerely,\u201d Ishiba told a live interview with NHK.",
      "The poor performance in the election will not immediately trigger a change of government because the upper house lacks the power to file a no-confidence motion against a leader, but it will certainly deepen uncertainty over his fate and Japan\u2019s political stability. Ishiba could face calls from within the LDP party to step down or find another coalition partner.",
      "Soaring prices, lagging incomes and burdensome social security payments are the top issues for frustrated, cash-strapped voters. Stricter measures targeting foreign residents and visitors also emerged as a key issue, with a surging right-wing populist party leading the campaign.",
      "Sunday's vote comes after Ishiba's coalition lost a majority in the October lower house election, stung by past corruption scandals, and his unpopular government has since been forced into making concessions to the opposition to get legislation through parliament. It has been unable to quickly deliver effective measures to mitigate rising prices, including Japan's traditional staple of rice, and dwindling wages.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has added to the pressure, complaining about a lack of progress in trade negotiations and the lack of sales of U.S. autos and American-grown rice to Japan despite a shortfall in domestic stocks of the grain. A 25% tariff due to take effect Aug. 1 has been another blow for Ishiba.",
      "Ishiba resisted any compromise before the election, but the prospect of a breakthrough after the election is just as unclear because the minority government would have difficulty forming a consensus with the opposition.",
      "Frustrated voters were rapidly turning to emerging populist parties. The eight main opposition groups, however, were too fractured to forge a common platform as a united front and gain voter support as a viable alternative.",
      "The emerging populist party Sanseito stands out with the toughest anti-foreigner stance, with its \u201cJapanese First\u201d platform that proposes a new agency to handle policies related to foreigners. The party\u2019s populist platform also includes anti-vaccine, anti-globalism and favors traditional gender roles.",
      "Conservative opposition groups, especially the DPP and Sanseito, gained significant ground at the Liberal Democrats\u2019 expense, while the centrist top opposition CDPJ was sluggish. The DPP quadrupled to 17 seats from four, according to interim results reported by Japanese media. Sanseito surged to 14 from just one.",
      "Sanseito leader, former local assembly member and a Self-Defense Force reserve personnel, told NHK said he is open to cooperate with the ruling bloc on conservative policies while waiting to gain more seats in the other house in a next election and form a multi-party coalition as in Europe.",
      "None of the opposition parties said that they were open to cooperating with the governing coalition.

      "Midway through summer, U.S. retailers are sweating a different season",
      "NEW YORK -- With summer in full swing in the United States, retail executives are sweating a different season. It\u2019s less than 22 weeks before Christmas, a time when businesses that make and sell consumer goods usually nail down their holiday orders and prices.",
      "But President Donald Trump's vacillating trade policies have complicated those end-of-year plans. Balsam Hill, which sells artificial trees and other decorations online, expects to publish fewer and thinner holiday catalogs because the featured products keep changing with the tariff rates the president sets, postpones and revises.",
      "\u201cThe uncertainty has led us to spend all our time trying to rejigger what we\u2019re ordering, where we\u2019re bringing it in, when it\u2019s going to get here,\u201d Mac Harman, CEO of Balsam Hill parent company Balsam Brands, said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know which items we\u2019re going to have to put in the catalog or not.\"",
      "Months of confusion over which foreign countries' goods may become more expensive to import has left a question mark over the holiday shopping season. U.S. retailers often begin planning for the winter holidays in January and typically finalize the bulk of their orders by the end of June. The seesawing tariffs already have factored into their calculations.",
      "The consequences for consumers? Stores may not have the specific gift items customers want come November and December. Some retail suppliers and buyers scaled back their holiday lines rather than risking a hefty tax bill or expensive imports going unsold. Businesses still are setting prices but say shoppers can expect many things to cost more, though by how much depends partly on whether Trump's latest round of \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs kicks in next month.",
      "The lack of clarity has been especially disruptive for the U.S. toy industry, which sources nearly 80% of its products from China. American toy makers usually ramp up production in April, a process delayed until late May this year after the president put a 145% tariff on Chinese goods, according to Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of the Toy Association, an industry trade group.",
      "The U.S. tariff rate may have dropped significantly from its spring high \u2014 a truce in the U.S.-China trade war is set to expire on Aug. 12 \u2014 but continues to shape the forthcoming holiday period. Manufacturing activity is way down from a year ago for small- and medium-sized U.S. toy companies, Ahearn said.",
      "The late start to factory work in China means holiday toys are only now arriving at U.S. warehouses, industry experts said. A big unknown is whether tariffs will keep stores from replenishing supplies of any breakout hit toys that emerge in September, said James Zahn, editor-in-chief of the trade publication Toy Book.",
      "In the retail world, planning for Christmas in July usually involves mapping out seasonal marketing and promotion strategies. Dean Smith, who co-owns independent toy stores JaZams in Princeton, New Jersey, and Lahaska, Pennsylvania, said he recently spent an hour and a half running through pricing scenarios with a Canadian distributor because the wholesale cost of some products increased by 20%.",
      "Increasing his own prices that much might turn off customers, Smith said, so he explored ways to \"maintain a reasonable margin without raising prices beyond what consumers would accept.\u201d He ordered a lower cost Crazy Forts building set so he would have the toy on hand and left out the kids' edition of the Anomia card game because he didn't think customers would pay what he would have to charge.",
      "\u201cIn the end, I had to eliminate half of the products that I normally buy,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Hilary Key, owner of The Toy Chest in Nashville, Indiana, said she tries to get new games and toys in early most years to see which ones she should stock up on for the winter holidays. This year, she abandoned her product testing for fear any delayed orders would incur high import taxes.",
      "Meanwhile, vendors of toys made in China and elsewhere bombarded Key with price increase notices. For example, Schylling, which makes Needoh, Care Bear collectibles and modern versions of nostalgic toys like My Little Pony, increased prices on orders by 20%, according to Key.",
      "All the price hikes are subject to change if the tariff situation changes again. Key worries her store won\u2019t have as compelling a product assortment as she prides herself on carrying.",
      "\u201cMy concern is not that I\u2019ll have nothing, because I can bring in more books. I can bring in more gifts, or I can bring in just things that are manufactured in other places,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to have the best stock for every developmental age, for every special need.\"",
      "The retail industry may have to keep taking a whack-a-mole approach to navigating the White House's latest tariff ultimatums and temporary reprieves. Last week, the president again reset the rates on imports from Brazil, the European Union, Mexico, and other major trading partners but said they would not take effect until Aug. 1.",
      "The brief pause should extend the window importers have to bring in seasonal merchandise at the current baseline tariff of 10%. The Port of Los Angeles had the busiest June in its 117-year history after companies raced to secure holiday shipments, and July imports look strong so far, according to Gene Seroka, the port's executive director.",
      "\u201cIn my view, we're seeing a peak season push right now to bring in goods ahead of potentially higher tariffs later this summer,\" Seroka said Monday.",
      "The pace of port activity so far this year reflects a \u201ctariff whipsaw effect\u201d \u2014 imports slowing when tariffs kick in and rebounding when they're paused, he said. \u201cFor us consumers, lower inventory levels, fewer selections and higher prices are likely as we head into the holidays.\u201d",
      "Smith, who co-owns the two JaZams stores with his partner, Joanne Farrugia, said they started placing holiday orders two months earlier than usual for \u201ccertain items that we felt were essential for us to have at particular pricing.\u201d They doubled their warehouse space to store the stockpile. But some shoppers are trying to get ahead of higher prices just like businesses are, he said.",
      "He's noticed customers snapping up items that will likely be popular during the holidays, like Jellycat plush toys and large stuffed unicorns and dogs. Any sales are welcome, but Smith and Farrugia are wary of having to restock at a higher cost.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to be as friendly as we can to the consumer and still have a product portfolio or profile that is gonna meet the needs of all of our various customers, which is getting more and more challenging by the day,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Balsam Brands' Harman said he's had to resign himself to not having as robust a selection of ornaments and frosted trees to sell as in years' past. Soon, it will be too late to import meaningful additions to his range of products.",
      "\u201cOur purpose as a company is to create joy together, and we\u2019re going to do our very best to do that this year,\" Harman said. \u201cWe\u2019re just not going to have a bunch of the items that consumers want this year, and that\u2019s not a position we want to be in.\"",

    "story": [
      "Newer airport screening machines that operate like medical CT scanners are better at spotting liquid explosives, but many airports still lack that expensive equipment",
      "Travelers celebrated the suggestion that American airports might soon ease restrictions on liquids in carry-on bags that create endless hassles at security checkpoints, but more than a third of all airports around the country still haven't upgraded their screening systems to reliably detect liquid explosives that could bring down a plane.",
      "It may be annoying to have to dump water and other drinks before going through security, but the challenge is to detect the difference between things like harmless hair gel and more sinister substances. The threat nearly materialized in an attack in 2006, when authorities in the United Kingdom arrested a group that was plotting to blow holes in airliners with a homemade mixture of chemicals in sports drink bottles.",
      "Security experts remain concerned about the vulnerabilities that were exposed by that plot.",
      "Comments this week by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem got travelers excited about the prospect of one day being able to fly with more than 3 ounces of their shampoos and gels and not having to throw out the beverage they just bought.",
      "\u201cThe liquids, I\u2019m questioning. So that may be the next big announcement, is what size your liquids need to be,\u201d Noem said. \u201cWe have put in place in TSA a multilayered screening process that allows us to change some of how we do security and screening so it\u2019s still as safe.\u201d",
      "A Transportation Security Administration spokesperson said Noem and the agency \u201care constantly looking for ways to enhance security, and improve the travel experience for the public.\u201d",
      "Any changes will come through the same official channels that TSA used to announce this month that travelers can keep their shoes on at checkpoints. That change offers relief from a rule adopted after \u201cshoe bomber\u201d Richard Reid\u2019s failed attempt to take down a flight from Paris to Miami in late 2001 with a small explosive device hidden in his footwear.",
      "The limits on liquids were triggered by the 2006 U.K. arrests. Three ringleaders were eventually convicted.",
      "Prosecutors told the jury in that case that authorities uncovered the plot after secretly searching the luggage of a man who was on their radar for security concerns after he returned from Pakistan and found the unusual combination of the Tang powdered soft drink and a large number of batteries, according to the BBC. That triggered the surveillance operation that eventually grew to include more than 200 officers.",
      "Agents discovered what appeared to be a bomb factory in a London apartment where odd devices were being constructed out of drink bottles. The plot didn't make sense until authorities discovered that the men were researching flight timetables and realized they were only trying to make an explosive big enough to rip a hole in a plane.",
      "The meaning of coded emails to contacts in Pakistan only became clear after the arrests, when authorities realized that the quantities of Calvin Klein aftershave being discussed in messages matched the amount of hydrogen peroxide the conspirators had purchased.",
      "Ever since then, the TSA and authorities in other countries have limited carry-on liquids and gels to 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) because officials believe that amount is too small to create an explosion capable of taking down a plane. The restriction covered all types of liquids, because X-ray machines at checkpoints couldn't differentiate between explosive and harmless ones.",
      "The United Kingdom was planning to ease its restrictions last year to allow people to carry up to 2 liters (about half a gallon) of liquid, but that was delayed because several major airports still didn't have the new scanners that use computed tomography, commonly known as a CT scan, to produce clearer images.",
      "The new machines allow screeners to switch between two-dimensional and three-dimensional images and turn them to see what may be lurking, said Johnny Jones, secretary treasurer of the chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees that represents TSA workers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a totally life-changing situation,\u201d said Jones, who has worked as a screener since the agency was created. \u201cIt\u2019s a difference of being able to see something that would have been hidden by something that you can now see clear as day with the new technology. It eliminates the guesswork.\u201d",
      "The problem is that only 255 of the 432 airports across the United States have new CT scanners installed, the interim head of the TSA told Congress this spring. The biggest airports got them first, but they are not expected to be everywhere until 2043.",
      "It's possible that a change in carry-on liquid policy could be implemented just at the biggest airports, but that could lead to confusion if travelers, are, say, allowed to bring full bottles on departure only to have them confiscated when they return.",
      "The scanners cost more than $2 million apiece, and they are so much bigger than the old X-ray machines that sometimes floors must be reinforced and checkpoints have to be redesigned.",
      "\u201cI think you need to hold off till we get more systems deployed. I think this one\u2019s a little too early,\u201d said Jeff Price, who teaches aviation security at Metropolitan State University of Denver and has co-authored books on the subject. \u201cThe keep your shoes on \u2014 I can get on board with that provided we continue to do random screenings. But the liquids, I think we\u2019re too early on that. There\u2019s other layers of security. Yeah, I know that. But not too many of them that prevent this type of attack.\u201d",
      "In the past the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security has highlighted vulnerabilities in TSA screening that can allow things to slip through undetected.",
      "A 2015 report found that TSA officers failed 95% of the time to detect weapons or explosive material carried by undercover inspectors.",
      "But Jones defended the work of the screeners he represents, noting that since the agency's creation, no plane has failed to reach its destination because of something that was missed.",
      "\u201cNothing large has been able to make it through our system since we\u2019ve taken over screening. We've protected the skies for 22 years,\u201d Jones said. \u201cEven if you have a slight miss, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything is going to happen on the plane.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, setting new regulations for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to assets like the U.S. dollar",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Friday signed into law new regulations for a type of cryptocurrency, a major milestone for an industry that has spent heavily to strengthen its legitimacy and political might.",
      "The GENIUS Act sets initial guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins, which are tied to assets like the U.S. dollar to reduce price volatility compared with other forms of cryptocurrency. It passed both the House and Senate with wide bipartisan margins.",
      "The new law is meant to bolster consumer confidence in the crypto industry, which has quickly become a major power player in Washington thanks to massive campaign donations and spending on lobbying. Its passage comes as Trump had repeatedly pledged to make the U.S. the \u201ccrypto capital of the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor years you were mocked and dismissed and counted out,\" Trump told crypto industry executives at a White House bill signing attended by about 200 people, including several top GOP lawmakers. \u201cThis signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit.\u201d",
      "The crypto industry has long complained it was unfairly targeted by former President Joe Biden's administration and spent heavily to help Trump win last year's election.",
      "The president lavished praise on crypto leaders during his speech Friday, saying \u201cnobody has gained the respect in such a short period of time.\u201d",
      "Trump said helping the cryptocurrency industry was \u201cgood for the dollar and it\u2019s good for the country.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why I backed you at an early stage,\u201d said Trump, who had previously been a skeptic of cryptocurrency before embracing it. His administration has taken several early steps to boost the crypto industry, including the Securities and Exchange Commission dropping several enforcement actions against large crypto companies.",
      "Trump then added a candid admission about the political calculus of his support for the crypto industry: \u201cAnd I also did it for the votes,\u201d he said, drawing laughter from the audience.",
      "The president also joked that lawmakers had named the GENIUS Act after him. The acronym stands for \u201cGuiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins.\u201d",
      "The use of stablecoins has grown dramatically in recent years. Circle, the U.S.-based issuer of one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this year and quickly saw its value soar amid heavy interest from crypto enthusiasts and investors. Stablecoin issuers make profits by collecting the interest on the assets they hold in reserve to back their stablecoins.",
      "A provision in the GENIUS Act bans members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins. But that prohibition does not extend to the president and his family, even as Trump builds a crypto empire from the White House. His family holds a significant stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that launched its own stablecoin earlier this year and received an early boost from an investment fund in the United Arab Emirates.",
      "The House also passed two other bills Thursday that are meant to help the crypto industry. One creates a new market structure for cryptocurrency, and the other bans the Federal Reserve from issuing a new digital currency. Both measures now go to the Senate.",

      "A federal judge has restored a Democrat to the Federal Trade Commission, ruling that President Donald Trump illegally fired her earlier this year in his efforts to exert control over independent agencies across the government.",
      "U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan ruled late Thursday that federal law protects FTC commissioners from being removed by the president without cause, citing a key 1935 U.S. Supreme Court decision involving the FTC.",
      "The decision allows Rebecca Kelly Slaughter to resume her duties as commissioner. The FTC website had been updated by Friday morning to show that Slaughter is among four sitting commissioners.",
      "Attorneys for the Trump administration almost immediately declared their intent to appeal, and the case could make its way to the Supreme Court. The conservative-led court already has narrowed the reach of the 90-year-old decision, known as Humphrey\u2019s Executor, and some justices have called for overturning it altogether.",
      "The high court also permitted Trump to fire the heads of other independent agencies. In May, the court allowed Trump to remove members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board, despite lower court rulings that Humphrey\u2019s Executor should protect them from arbitrary dismissal.",
      "The justices are currently weighing an emergency appeal from the administration to oust three Democratic members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Trump fired them in May, but a federal judge restored them to their positions a month later.",
      "The legal fight over the firings also could extend to the Federal Reserve and the prospect of Trump firing Fed chairman Jerome Powell. The justices suggested in May that Trump may not have the same freedom to upend the leadership of the Fed, describing it as \u201ca uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.\u201d",
      "In her opinion, AliKhan said she was required to abide by the Humphrey\u2019s Executor decision, in which the court rebuffed President Franklin Roosevelt and held that FTC commissioners could be removed only for cause, not at the president\u2019s whim.",
      "She said her ruling would uphold \u201cclearly established law that has been enacted by a coequal branch of government, reaffirmed by another coequal branch, and acquiesced to by thirteen executives over the course of ninety years.\u201d",
      "But the judge acknowledged that hers probably would not be the last word. \u201cDefendants are, of course, free to take their quarrels with Humphrey\u2019s Executor to the Supreme Court. This court has no illusions about where this case\u2019s journey leads,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Trump fired Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, the commission\u2019s two Democratic members in March. The FTC is a regulator created by Congress that enforces consumer protection measures and antitrust legislation. Its seats typically include three members of the president\u2019s party and two from the opposing party. The commissioners sued to reclaim their jobs, saying they\u2019d been dismissed illegally. Slaughter has four years left in her term as commissioner. Bedoya submitted his resignation in June, and AliKhan dismissed his claim as a result.",
      "\u201cAs the Court recognized today, the law is clear, and I look forward to getting back to work,\u201d Slaughter said in a statement Thursday.",
      "During a May court hearing in federal court in Washington, D.C., plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys warned against granting the president \u201cabsolute removal power over any executive officer,\u201d saying it would effectively eliminate an important check on his power.",
      "\u201cThat has never been the case in this country,\u201d said attorney Aaron Crowell. \u201cThat\u2019s not the law. That has never been the law.\u201d",
      "A politicized FTC also could favor powerful corporations while driving up prices for consumers, the lawyers for the fired commissioners said.",
      "But attorneys for the Trump administration argued that the FTC\u2019s role has expanded since the 1930s, and as such, its members should answer directly to the president.",
      "\u201cThe president should be able to remove someone who is actively blocking his policies, for example,\u201d Justice Department lawyer Emily Hall said during the hearing.",
      "AliKhan, who was nominated to the federal bench by President Joe Biden in 2023, noted the long line of presidents before Trump who didn\u2019t try to push the limits.",
      "Commissioners are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. They serve seven-year terms that are staggered to prevent multiple vacancies at once. They can be fired for displaying specific bad behaviors, including inefficiency, neglect of duty and malfeasance in office.",
      "Trump told Bedoya and Slaughter that he was dismissing them because their service on the commission was inconsistent with his administration\u2019s priorities, according to the lawsuit.",

      "HOUSTON -- Chevron has scored a critical ruling in Paris that has given it the go-ahead for a $53 billion acquisition of Hess and access to one of the biggest oil finds of the decade.",
      "Chevron said Friday that it completed its acquisition of Hess shortly after the ruling from the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris. Exxon had challenged Chevron\u2019s bid for Hess, one of three companies with access to the massive Stabroek Block oil field off the coast of Guyana.",
      "Guyana is a country of 791,000 people that is poised to become the world\u2019s fourth-largest offshore oil producer, placing it ahead of Qatar, the United States, Mexico and Norway. It has become a major producer in recent years.",
      "Oil giants Exxon Mobil, China\u2019s CNOOC, and Hess squared off in a heated competition for highly lucrative oil fields in northern South America.",
      "With Chevron getting the green light on Friday, it is now one of the major players in the Stabroek.",
      "\u201cWe disagree with the ICC panel\u2019s interpretation but respect the arbitration and dispute resolution process,\u201d Exxon Mobil said in a statement on Friday.",
      "Chevron announced its deal for Hess in October 2023, less than two weeks after Exxon Mobil said that it would acquire Pioneer Natural Resources for about $60 billion.",
      "Chevron said at the time that the acquisition of Hess would add a major oil field in Guyana as well as shale properties in the Bakken Formation in North Dakota.",
      "\u201cGiven the significant value we\u2019ve created in the development of the Guyana resource, we believed we had a clear duty to our investors to consider our preemption rights to protect the value we created through our innovation and hard work at a time when no one knew just how successful this venture would become,\u201d Exxon Mobil said Friday. \u201cWe welcome Chevron to the venture and look forward to continued industry-leading performance and value creation in Guyana for all parties involved.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Masai Ujiri is staying focused on his upcoming Giants of Africa Festival even as the longtime NBA executive navigates his recent departure from the Toronto Raptors",
      "NEW YORK -- Masai Ujiri's July is shaping up to be quite the rollercoaster ride. The recently-fired former Toronto Raptors executive is navigating his sudden departure from a franchise where he'd spent 13 seasons while also launching the second edition of his private foundation's Giants of Africa Festival \u2014 all within a one-month span.",
      "The humanitarian work, Ujiri pledged, will continue regardless of his employment status. The British-born NBA executive, raised in his father's native Nigeria, founded Giants of Africa in 2003 \u2014 back when he was just starting off as a scout and long before becoming the first African team president of a professional North American sports franchise.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an obligation for me,\u201d Ujiri said. \u201cIt\u2019s a passion.\u201d",
      "The foundation's ambitions have risen with his own success. Giants of Africa has reached thousands of campers across 18 countries. It has helped build more than three dozen courts on the continent. High-profile supporters include Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's The Archewell Foundation. 2023\u2019s inaugural Giants of Africa Festival united more than 250 boys and girls around a week of basketball clinics, life skills lessons and community building that culminated in a concert headlined by South African superstar Tyla. The goal? A \u201cborderless Africa\u201d as Ujiri likes to say.",
      "The festival returns to Kigali, Rwanda, on July 26 with a lineup featuring Nigerian pop singer Ayra Starr and WNBA great Candace Parker. Two-time NBA Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard \u2014 brought to Toronto by Ujiri for the team's championship-winning 2018-2019 season \u2014 will mentor campers and train underserved youth.",
      "Ujiri discussed the upcoming event, and his future, with The Associated Press. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "A: When we had the last festival, we really focused on \u2014 whether it was the basketball, the life skills, the coaching, the mentorship \u2014 we focused on culture. We focused on the whole ecosystem of how we feel kids need this opportunity to grow. It really inspired us to think about how we bring this to more countries.",
      "We\u2019re doing this incredible, incredible fashion show showing the print, the threads of Africa, and who we really are. It used to be weird where you\u2019d see somebody wearing cloth from Africa. Now it\u2019s part of the fashion. It\u2019s part of us. It\u2019s just like Afrobeats \u2014 it\u2019s part of life everywhere. Everybody wants to wear a boubou. You see a lot of fashion designers from all over the world using our prints. We want to showcase that and give these youth the opportunity to see that this is how they can also expand their minds.",
      "A: It's been unbelievable. With these camps, it started off as basketball development, but you've seen that really become something that has really grown even bigger. I saw Pascal (Siakam), I saw (Joel) Embiid, I saw all these guys as youth in camps. Seeing them as 15-, 16-year-old kids in camp, you can't even project. And that tells you how much talent we have on the continent. I always say Africa's biggest jewel is the talent of the youth. One out of every four people in the world are going to be Africans by the year 2050 and the median age is 20. We should be investing on the continent.",
      "A: I'm the prime example of that. I didn't play in the NBA. I didn't even play high-level college or high-level Europe. The entry point for me was a scout in the NBA. From then on lots of people helped me to create this path that I'm on still. I go back to Basketball Without Borders, when the NBA gave me the opportunity to be a director. That has led to me becoming an executive in the NBA. That's the example I want to give.",
      "That's why we have so many people coming to this festival to really show these kids \u2014 whether it's me or a journalist or a sports doctor or sports lawyer \u2014 there's so many careers. And the start is sports and doing it passionately and doing it well.",
      "A: When I first started, I was doing boys camps. Not every kid is going to make it to the NBA. So we started focusing on life skills. That was teaching respect, honesty, being on time. One of the big focuses was respect for women.",
      "So, I'm challenging these boys but I'm not challenging myself. I can't say \u201cwomen's empowerment\u201d and \u201crespect women\u201d and just do these camps for boys. So, we introduced the girls. And it's not 50 boys and 10 girls just for token. It's equality. They all have a basketball and they have the same court time. We can't just say it. We actually have to do it.",
      "A: Job, no job, wherever I am, whatever kind of job I'm doing, Giants of Africa is key. The focus will always be that just because I owe it to the youth of the continent. I owe it to the continent. My goal is not how big does Giants of Africa get. I look at it as: how big are these youth going to become? They'll go on to do other things. They could go on to become a president or become a governor or become president of a team. The hope is that this experience here will even make them reimagine many of the things that they want to do. So, Giants of Africa will never go anywhere.",

    "story": [
      "From crypto coins to bibles, overseas development deals to an upcoming line of cellphones, Trump family businesses have raked in hundreds of millions of dollars since his election",
      "WASHINGTON -- If one theme has emerged in President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, it's this: He's leveraged the power of his office for personal gain unlike anyone before in history.",
      "From crypto coins to bibles, overseas development deals to an upcoming line of cellphones, Trump family businesses have raked in hundreds of millions of dollars since his election, an unprecedented flood of often shadowy money from billionaires, foreign governments and cryptocurrency tycoons with interests before the federal government.",
      "\u201cHe is president and is supposed to be working in the public\u2019s interest,\u201d said James Thurber, an emeritus professor at American University, who has researched lobbying, campaign finance and political corruption for decades. \u201cInstead, he is helping his own personal interest to grow his wealth. It\u2019s totally not normal.\u201d",
      "The sums amassed by the Trump Organization, the collection of companies controlled by the president\u2019s children, are far greater than those collected by the family during the president\u2019s first term, when patronage of his hotels, resorts and golf courses was de rigueur to curry favor with the famously transactional commander-in-chief.",
      "The second time around, the Trump family\u2019s ambitions are far grander, stretching from cyberspace to far-flung regions across the globe. One of Trump\u2019s cryptocurrencies is conservatively estimated to have pulled in at least $320 million since January, while another received a $2 billion investment from a foreign government wealth fund. A third has sold at least $550 million in tokens.",
      "His sons have jetted across the Middle East to line up new development deals, while his daughter and son-in-law are working with the Albanian government to build a Mediterranean island resort. Even first lady Melania Trump has inked a $40 million documentary deal with Amazon, whose founder, Jeff Bezos, was a frequent target of Trump during his first presidency and whose companies contract extensively with the federal government.",
      "The dealmaking is a rejection of Trump\u2019s first-term pledge to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington and dwarfs the influence peddling efforts of former President Joe Biden\u2019s family, whom Trump and his allies attacked as the \u201cBiden Crime Family.\u201d",
      "While Democrats have condemned Trump for his overlapping roles as a beneficiary and president, he is not likely to face any immediate repercussions for such extensive conflicts-of-interest. Congress is controlled by fellow Republicans, and his administration is stocked with loyalists who have dismantled many guardrails of oversight. Last summer, the Supreme Court, with a conservative majority cemented by Trump, ruled that presidents have broad immunity from prosecution.",
      "Even in the rare cases where Trump\u2019s allies have urged caution, the president has ignored them. That\u2019s what happened when he accepted a $400 million \u201cbeautiful, big, magnificent, free airplane\u201d from the Qatari government. Trump said the Boeing 747 \u201cwould go directly\u201d to his presidential library upon leaving office.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Mount Everest of corruption\u201d said Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat.",
      "Since Richard Nixon resigned in disgrace, presidents have gone to great lengths to avoid the appearance of such conflicts.",
      "Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan kept assets in a \u201cblind trust,\u201d while George H.W. Bush used a \u201cdiversified trust,\u201d which blocked him from knowing what was in his portfolio. His son, George W. Bush, used a similar arrangement.",
      "Barack Obama was an exception, but his investments were mostly a bland mix of index funds and U.S. treasuries. During his first term, Trump even gave a nod toward ethics. He issued a moratorium on foreign deals. But instead of placing his assets in a blind trust like many of his predecessors, he handed the reins of the Trump Organization to his children, which kept his financial holdings close.",
      "This time, he has made no such gesture. His sons, Eric and Donald Jr., are again running the business while Trump is in office. And though the White House says he is not involved in its day-to-day decisions, the trust he has established continues to profit. He promotes his resorts, merchandise and the family\u2019s crypto ventures while residing in the White House, often from his account on Truth Social, the social media company he and his allies launched.",
      "He\u2019s also touted a line of Trump shoes, a Bible, which is made in China, and Trump guitars, one of which is a $1,500 Gibson Les Paul knockoff, featuring \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d fret inlays. Conservative groups and Republican committees have spent at least $25 million at Trump properties since 2015, with most of it coming from Trump\u2019s own political organization, campaign finance disclosures show.",
      "Yet, those ventures pale in comparison to his exploits in cryptocurrency, which offers perhaps the clearest example of the conflicts of interest that have come to dominate Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Trump was once a crypto skeptic who declared that cryptocurrencies were \u201cnot money,\u201d were based on \u201cthin air\u201d and seemed \u201clike a scam.\u201d By the time he was running again for president, however, he\u2019d become a proponent of the industry.",
      "\u201cThe difference now is he has realized that it can be his scam,\u201d said Hilary Allen, a law professor at American University who specializes in banking and cryptocurrencies.",
      "Trump has pledged to turn the U.S. into the \u201ccrypto capital of the world\u201d and promised to roll back oversight of the industry.",
      "Deregulation, of course, will help his own businesses. At the height of the campaign, Trump announced the launch of his own crypto coin and World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency firm that would be run by his sons and several business associates. Among those partners was Steve Witkoff, now one of Trump\u2019s top diplomatic envoys.",
      "The Trump Organization and World Liberty Financial declined to comment.",
      "But it was also rooted in his 2024 campaign. At a crypto event at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida in May 2024, he received assurances that industry figures would spend lavishly to get him reelected, The Associated Press previously reported.",
      "Asked recently at the White House if he'd consider having his family business step back from its crypto investments to avoid questions about conflicts of interest, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019ve created a very powerful industry. That\u2019s much more important than anything that we invest in.\"",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t care about investing. You know, I have kids and they invest in it, because they do believe in it,\" Trump added of crypto. \"But I\u2019m president, and what I did do there was build an industry that\u2019s very important. And, if we didn\u2019t have it, China would.\u201d",
      "Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman, reiterated that Trump's crypto boosterism isn't driven by self-interest.",
      "He \u201cis taking decisive action to establish regulatory clarity for digital financial technology and to secure America\u2019s position as the world\u2019s leader in the digital asset economy,\u201d Fields said.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration,\" Fields added, \"is fulfilling the president\u2019s promise to make the United States the crypto capital of the planet by driving innovation and economic opportunity for all Americans.\u201d",
      "Trump is soon expected to sign cryptocurrency legislation approved by Congress on Thursday. Among the provisions is a ban on members of Congress issuing their own brand of a particular type of cryptocurrency. The prohibition does not extend to the president.",
      "Fields said it was unfair to equate critics\u2019 charges of conflicts of interest against Trump with the president\u2019s own suggestions that Biden\u2019s family benefited financially while he was in office.",
      "He said Trump\u2019s policies haven\u2019t benefited the president personally and have nothing to do with his family\u2019s financial concerns \u2014 and said Trump entered the White House an already successful businessman who didn\u2019t need a political career to become rich.",
      "Even so, Trump\u2019s family is poised to benefit financially from the crypto industry\u2019s growing clout. It holds a majority ownership stake that entitles them to 75% of earnings from their first coin, released last September, according to World Liberty Financial\u2019s website.",
      "The coin, $WLFI, was not an immediate success. Then, after the president's election, sales took off.",
      "Days before his inauguration, Trump announced a new meme coin, $Trump, during the \u201cCrypto Ball,\u201d a Washington gala intended to showcase a regulatory sea change he vowed to usher in.",
      "\u201cTime to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!\u201d Trump posted to his X account. \u201cJoin my very special Trump Community. GET YOUR $TRUMP NOW.\u201d",
      "Often created as a joke with no real utility, meme coins are prone to wild price swings that often enrich a small group of insiders at the expense of less sophisticated investors. $Trump soared to over $70, but its price soon collapsed, losing money for many. It has hovered around $10 since March. Trump did well, though. By the end of April, the coin had earned over $320 million in fees, according to an analysis by the crypto tracking firm Chainalysis.",
      "A third cryptocurrency, a \u201cstablecoin\u201d called USD1, launched in April.",
      "There appear to be upsides for Trump\u2019s cryptocurrency investors and associates.",
      "Justin Sun, a Chinese-born crypto billionaire, has disclosed investing nearly $200 million in the Trumps' various crypto ventures. Amid this spree, the Trump administration announced it had paused a securities fraud case against him. In June, Sun announced he was taking his crypto company, Tron, public after securing financing through a deal brokered by Eric Trump. Last week, Sun posted on Twitter that he was purchasing an additional $100 million worth of Trump's meme coin.",
      "Sun is not the only one. Changpen Zhao, a convicted felon who founded the crypto exchange Binance, was part of a megadeal in which a United Arab Emirates-controlled wealth fund invested $2 billion in the Trump stablecoin, USD1, which it used to purchase a stake in Zhao\u2019s Binance.",
      "The deal gave outsized publicity to World Liberty Financial and instantly made the stablecoin one of the top in the market. It will also allow the Trump family and their business partners to reinvest the $2 billion and collect interest, estimated to be worth as much as $80 million a year.",
      "Soon after the purchase was announced, Trump granted the UAE greater access to U.S. artificial intelligence chips, which it had long sought. Binance and Zhao benefited, too.",
      "Binance is restricted in the U.S. and entered a settlement with the Biden administration that sent Zhao to jail in 2024 after he pleaded guilty to failing to maintain an anti-money-laundering program. Prosecutors said he looked the other way as criminals used his platform to move money connected to child sex abuse, drug trafficking and terrorism.",
      "In May, Trump\u2019s Securities and Exchange Commission dropped the final federal enforcement action against Binance. Zhao, who goes by CZ, is now seeking a pardon. The White House says no decision has been made on issuing such a grant of clemency.",
      "Trump announced several months ago a new promotion that would trade on his presidency: He was hosting a dinner at his Virginia golf club for the top 220 investors in his meme coin, $Trump, with a special White House tour for the top 25.",
      "That fueled a temporary rise in the coin's value. It also helped enrich the Trump Organization, which is entitled to collect fees when the coin is traded. A month later, Trump addressed attendees of the dinner, standing before a lectern with the presidential seal. The White House said at the time that it had nothing to do with the meme coin.",
      "For decades, campaign contributions and lobbying have been governed by laws that place limits on how much donors can give, require a degree of transparency and limit how politicians can spend the money they raise. Trump\u2019s venture into cryptocurrency effectively sidesteps these laws, legal and finance experts say.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot like the Trump Hotel from the first term, but what crypto has done is dispensed with the need for the hotel,\u201d said Allen, the law professor. \u201cBecause crypto assets can be made out of thin air, he has found a way of creating an unlimited supply of assets to offer to people who want to give.\u201d",

      "A new AP-NORC poll shows that while Republican elected officials are promoting their recently passed tax and spending bill as a win for working Americans, everyday Americans broadly see it as a win for the wealthy",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014",
      "Republican elected officials are promoting their recently passed tax and spending bill as a win for working Americans, but a new survey shows that Americans broadly see it as a win for the wealthy.",
      "About two-thirds of U.S. adults expect the new tax law will help the rich, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Most \u2014 about 6 in 10 \u2014 think it will do more to hurt than help low-income people. About half say it will do more harm than good for middle-class people and people like them.",
      "Republicans have already begun airing advertisements framing the legislation as a tax cut for all Americans, highlighting new deductions on tips and overtime income. But Democrats have been making the case that the wealthiest Americans will benefit from the legislation, citing cuts to Medicaid and food assistance programs.",
      "The new poll indicates that Republicans still have persuading to do. The high price tag may also be turning off some Americans. Trump's approval rating on government spending has fallen since the spring, according to the new survey, and about 6 in 10 U.S. adults across the political spectrum think the government is spending \u201ctoo much.\u201d",
      "Most people have heard at least something about the new law, according to the poll, which found that about two-thirds of U.S. adults have heard or read \u201ca lot\u201d or \u201csome\u201d about it.",
      "Those who know something about the legislation are more likely to believe it favors the wealthy, compared with people who have heard \u201conly a little\u201d or \u201cnothing at all.\"",
      "Anaiah Barrow, a 25-year-old single mom from North Carolina who doesn't identify with a political party, said she\u2019s concerned that the new law will hurt caregivers like her. Barrow -- who\u2019s juggling a job, taking care of two young children and pursuing a degree -- is concerned about losing access to day care and food stamps.",
      "\u201cIt has a really big effect,\u201d Barrow said of the recently passed legislation, which she has learned about on TikTok. \u201cIt may not be as a big now, but in the long run it\u2019s going to have that effect -- it\u2019s going to hit bad.\u201d",
      "Even many Republicans agree that the wealthy are likely to benefit from the tax and spending law. About half say the law will do more to help the wealthy. A similar percentage say this about middle-class people, while about 4 in 10 Republicans think it will do more to help than hurt low-income people.",
      "Lori Nichols, a 51-year-old caregiver for her elderly mother in Illinois, said the legislation has \u201cvery little for the older people and people that are on disability.\u201d Although Nichols is a Republican, she said she didn't vote in the 2024 presidential election and voted for Democrat Joe Biden in 2020.",
      "\u201cAs far as the tax part goes, it seems to me like (Trump\u2019s) just making the rich richer,\u201d Nichols said.",
      "Despite the overall sense that wealthy people will be the primary beneficiaries, Democrats and independents are much likelier than Republicans to think the law could harm them personally.",
      "Nathan Hay, a shift service manager at an international dealership that repairs trucks, said he thinks lower-income people might see a \u201cslight increase\u201d in taxes but still supports the bill. \u201cPersonally, it\u2019s not helping me a ton,\u201d Hay said, but he believes it will help small businesses, which have been a staple in his own life and his family\u2019s.",
      "About half of Republicans expect the legislation to do more to help \u201cpeople like you,\u201d compared with about 2 in 10 independents and just 6% of Democrats.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a tax accountant, but it sounds as if it would be more beneficial to (people) in the higher tax level,\u201d said Republican Geraldine Putnam, 87, a Trump voter who lives in the rural south.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not that I would want to take away the incentive to become more wealthy \u2014 that\u2019s the American dream,\u201d Putnam said.",
      "But she also thinks she'll end up paying more in taxes. \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing I'm sure he thinks is correct,\" she said of Trump. \"It\u2019s just the extreme method that he\u2019s using.\u201d",
      "The law's hefty price tag may be factoring into some Americans' assessments of the law. The poll found they are less likely to approve of how Trump is handling government spending since the spring.",

      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union approved on Friday a new raft of sanctions against Russia over its war on Ukraine, including a lower oil price cap, a ban on transactions with Nord Stream gas pipelines, and the targeting of more shadow fleet ships, the EU foreign policy chief said.",
      "\u201cThe message is clear: Europe will not back down in its support for Ukraine. The EU will keep raising the pressure until Russia ends its war,\u201d Kaja Kallas said in a statement.",
      "Kallas said the measures amount to \u201cone of its strongest sanctions packages against Russia to date\u201d linked to the war, now in its fourth year. It comes as European countries start to buy U.S. weapons for Ukraine to help the country better defend itself.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the new measures, describing them as a \u201ctimely and necessary\u201d step amid intensified Russian attacks.",
      "\u201cAll infrastructure of Russia\u2019s war must be blocked,\u201d Zelenskyy said, adding that Ukraine will synchronize its sanctions with the EU and introduce its own additional measures soon.",
      "The European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive branch, had proposed to lower the oil price cap from $60 to $45, which is lower than the market price to target Russia\u2019s vast energy revenues. The 27 member countries decided to set the price per barrel at just under $48.",
      "The EU had hoped to get major international powers in the Group of Seven countries involved in the price cap to broaden the impact, but conflict in the Middle East pushed up oil prices and the Trump administration could not be brought onboard.",
      "In 2023, Ukraine\u2019s Western allies limited sales of Russian oil to $60 per barrel but the price cap was largely symbolic as most of Moscow\u2019s crude \u2014 its main moneymaker \u2014 cost less than that. Still, the cap was there in case oil prices rose.",
      "Oil income is the linchpin of Russia\u2019s economy, allowing President Vladimir Putin to pour money into the armed forces without worsening inflation for everyday people and avoiding a currency collapse.",
      "A new import ban was also imposed in an attempt to close a loophole allowing Russia to indirectly export crude oil via a number of non-EU countries.",
      "The EU also targeted the Nord Stream pipelines between Russia and Germany to prevent Putin from generating any revenue from them in future, notably by discouraging would-be investors. Russian energy giant Rosneft's refinery in India was hit as well.",
      "The pipelines were built to carry Russian natural gas to Germany but are not in operation. They were targeted by sabotage in 2022, but the source of the underwater explosions has remained a major international mystery.",
      "On top of that, the new EU sanctions targeted Russia\u2019s banking sector, with the aim of limiting the Kremlin\u2019s ability to raise funds or carry out financial transactions. Two Chinese banks were added to the list.",
      "The EU has slapped several rounds of sanctions on Russia since Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine in February 24, 2022.",
      "More than 2,400 officials and \u201centities\u201d \u2014 often government agencies, banks, companies or organizations \u2014 have been hit with asset freezes and travel bans.",
      "But each round of sanctions is getting harder to agree, as measures targeting Russia bite the economies of the 27 member nations. Slovakia held up the latest package over concerns about proposals to stop Russian gas supplies, which it relies on.",
      "The last raft of EU sanctions, imposed on May 20, targeted almost 200 ships in Russia\u2019s sanction-busting shadow fleet of tankers. On Friday, 105 more ships were blocked from European ports, locks and from ship-to-ship transfers, bringing the total number of vessels now sanctioned to more than 400.",

      "HANOI, Vietnam -- Asian countries are offering to buy more U.S. liquefied natural gas in negotiations with the Trump administration as a way to alleviate tensions over U.S. trade deficits and forestall higher tariffs. Analysts warn that strategy could undermine those countries' long-term climate ambitions and energy security.",
      "Buying more U.S. LNG has topped the list of concessions Asian countries have offered in talks with Washington over President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on foreign goods. Vietnam's Prime Minister underlined the need to buy more of the super-chilled fuel in a government meeting, and the government signed a deal in May with an American company to develop a gas import hub. JERA, Japan\u2019s largest power generator, signed new 20-year contracts last month to purchase up to 5.5 million metric tons of U.S. gas annually starting around 2030.",
      "U.S. efforts to sell more LNG to Asia predate the Trump administration, but they've gained momentum with his intense push to win trade deals.",
      "Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, is natural gas cooled to a liquid form for easy storage and transport that is used as a fuel for transport, residential cooking and heating and industrial processes.",
      "Trump discussed cooperation on a $44 billion Alaska LNG project with South Korea, prompting a visit by officials to the site in June. The U.S. president has promoted the project as a way to supply gas from Alaska\u2019s vast North Slope to a liquefication plant at Nikiski in south-central Alaska, with an eye largely on exports to Asian countries while bypassing the Panama Canal Thailand has offered to commit to a long-term deal for American fuel and shown interest in the same Alaska project to build a nearly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would funnel gas from",
      "The Philippines is also considering importing gas from Alaska while India is mulling a plan to scrap import taxes on U.S. energy shipments to help narrow its trade surplus with Washington.",
      "\u201cTrump has put pressure on a seeming plethora of Asian trading partners to buy more U.S. LNG,\u201d said Tim Daiss, at the APAC Energy Consultancy, pointing out that Japan had agreed to buy more despite being so \u201cawash in the fuel\u201d that it was being forced to cancel projects and contracts to offload the excess to Asia's growing economies.",
      "\u201cNot good for Southeast Asia's sustainability goals,\u201d he said.",
      "Experts say LNG purchasing agreements can slow adoption of renewable energy in Asia.",
      "Locking into long-term deals could leave countries with outdated infrastructure as the world shifts rapidly toward cleaner energy sources like solar or wind that offer faster, more affordable ways to meet growing power demand, said Indra Overland, head of the Center for Energy Research at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs.",
      "Building pipelines, terminals, and even household gas stoves creates systems that are expensive and difficult to replace\u2014making it harder to switch to renewables later. \u201cAnd you\u2019re more likely then to get stuck for longer,\u201d he said.",
      "Energy companies that profit from gas or coal are powerful vested interests, swaying policy to favor their business models, he said.",
      "LNG burns cleaner than coal, but it\u2019s still a fossil fuel that emits greenhouse gases and contributes to climate change.",
      "Many LNG contracts include \u201ctake-or-pay\u201d clauses, obliging governments to pay even if they don\u2019t use the fuel. Christopher Doleman of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis warns that if renewable energy grows fast, reducing the need for LNG, countries may still have to pay for gas they no longer need.",
      "Pakistan is an example. Soaring LNG costs drove up electricity prices, pushing consumers to install rooftop solar panels. As demand for power drops and gas supply surges, the country is deferring LNG shipments and trying to resell excess fuel.",
      "Experts said that although countries are signaling a willingness to import more U.S. LNG, they're unlikely to import enough to have a meaningful impact on U.S. trade deficits.",
      "South Korea would need to import 121 million metric tons of LNG in a year \u2014 50% more than the total amount of LNG the U.S. exported globally last year and triple what South Korea imported, said Doleman. Vietnam \u2014 with a trade surplus with the U.S. twice the size of Korea\u2019s \u2014 would need to import 181 million metric tons annually, more than double what the U.S. exported last year.",
      "Other obstacles stand in the way. The Alaska LNG project is widely considered uneconomic. Both coal and renewable energy in Asia are so much cheaper that U.S. gas would need to cost less than half its current price to compete. Tariffs on Chinese steel could make building building gas pipelines and LNG terminals more expensive, while longstanding delays to build new gas turbines mean new gas power projects may not come online until 2032. Meanwhile, a global glut in LNG will likely drive prices lower, making it even harder for countries to justify locking into long-term deals with the United States at current higher prices.",
      "Committing to long-term U.S. LNG contracts could impact regional energy security at a time of growing geopolitical and market uncertainties, analysts said.",
      "A core concern is over the longterm stability of the U.S. as a trading partner, said Overland. \u201cThe U.S. is not a very predictable entity. And to rely on energy from there is a very risky proposition,\u201d he said.",
      "LNG only contributes to energy security when it\u2019s available and affordable, says Dario Kenner of Zero Carbon Analytics.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the bit that they leave out ... But it\u2019s pretty important,\u201d he said.",
      "This was the concern during the recent potential disruptions to fuel shipments through the Strait of Hormuz and earlier during the war in Ukraine, when LNG cargoes originally destined for Asia were rerouted to Europe. Despite having contracts, Asian countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were outbid by European buyers.",
      "\u201cEvents in Europe, which can seem very far away, can have an impact on availability and prices in Asia,\u201d Kenner said.",
      "Asian countries can improve their energy security and make progress toward cutting carbon emissions by building more renewable energy, he said, noting there is vast room for that given that only about 1% of Southeast Asia\u2019s solar and wind potential is being used.",
      "\u201cThere are genuine choices to meet rising electricity demand. It is not just having to build LNG,\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is granting two years of regulatory relief to coal-fired power plants, chemical manufacturers and other polluting industries as he seeks to reverse Biden-era regulations he considers overly burdensome.",
      "Trump issued a series of proclamations late Thursday exempting a range of industries that he calls vital to national security.",
      "The proclamations cover coal-fired power plants, taconite iron ore processing facilities used to make steel, and chemical manufacturers that help produce semiconductors and medical device sterilizers.",
      "The proclamations allow the facilities to comply with Environmental Protection Agency standards that were in place before rules imposed in recent years by President Joe Biden's administration, the White House said.",
      "Trump called the Biden-era rules expensive and, in some cases, unattainable. His actions will ensure that \u201ccritical industries can continue to operate uninterrupted to support national security without incurring substantial costs,'' the White House said in a fact sheet.",
      "Trump\u2019s EPA had earlier exempted dozens of coal-fired plants from air-pollution rules for the same reasons. The EPA also offered other industrial polluters a chance for exemptions from requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals such as mercury, arsenic and benzene. An electronic mailbox set up by the EPA allowed regulated companies to request a presidential exemption under the Clean Air Act to a host of Biden-era rules.",
      "Environmental groups have denounced the offer to grant exemptions, calling the new email address a \u201cpolluters\u2019 portal\u201d that could allow hundreds of companies to evade laws meant to protect the environment and public health. Mercury exposure can cause brain damage, especially in children. Fetuses are vulnerable to birth defects via exposure in a mother\u2019s womb.",
      "Within weeks of the EPA's offer, industry groups representing hundreds of chemical and petrochemical manufacturers began seeking the blanket exemptions from federal pollution requirements.",
      "The Clean Air Act enables the president to temporarily exempt industrial sites from new rules if the technology required to meet them is not widely available and if the continued activity is in the interest of national security.",
      "John Walke, clean air director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, said Trump\u2019s claims about technology problems and national security concerns were \u201cpretexts\u201d so he could help big corporations get richer.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump just signed a literal free pass for polluters,\u2033 Walke said. \u201cIf your family lives downwind of these plants, this is going to mean more toxic chemicals in the air you breathe.\u201d",
      "In April, the EPA granted nearly 70 coal-fired power plants a two-year exemption from federal requirements to reduce emissions of toxic chemicals. A list posted on the agency\u2019s website lists 47 power providers \u2014 which operate at least 66 coal-fired plants \u2014 that are receiving exemptions from the Biden-era rules.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans in March to roll back dozens of key environmental rules on everything from clean air to clean water and climate change. Zeldin called the planned rollbacks the \u201cmost consequential day of deregulation in American history.\"",

The AP review included the agency\u2019s own prior assessments as well as a wide range of other research.",
      "In a related development, the EPA said Thursday it will give utility companies an additional year to inspect and report on contamination from toxic coal ash landfills across the country.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A top Federal Reserve official said late Thursday that the central bank should cut its key interest rate later this month, carving out a different view than that of Chair Jerome Powell, who has been harshly criticized by the White House for delaying rate cuts.",
      "Christopher Waller, a member of the Fed's governing board, said in a speech in New York City that the economy is showing signs of weakening, with consumer spending slowing and job gains cooling. The Fed should reduce borrowing costs to shore up spending and growth before the job market weakens further, Waller said.",
      "\u201cThe economy is still growing, but its momentum has slowed significantly,\u201d he said, adding that the slowdown threatens the Fed\u2019s goal of maximum employment.",
      "At the same time, President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs are likely to only lift inflation temporarily and aren't a reason to postpone rate cuts, Waller said.",
      "\u201cTariffs have boosted, and will continue to boost, inflation a bit above the (Fed's) 2% objective this year,\u201d Waller said, but policymakers should \u201clook through tariff effects and focus on underlying inflation,\u201d which he said is nearing the 2% goal.",
      "Waller has been mentioned as a potential replacement for Powell when the current chair\u2019s term expires in May 2026, or perhaps earlier if Trump takes the unprecedented step of firing Powell. Trump has threatened to fire Powell this year but on Wednesday said it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d he would take such a step.",
      "For his part, Powell has said the Fed wants to see the impact of the duties on prices and the economy before making any moves.",
      "Waller, a Trump appointee, has previously said that he would support a rate cut in July. Michelle Bowman, also a Trump appointee, has also spoken in favor of a cut.",
      "Minutes to the Fed's June 17-18 meeting said that only \u201ca couple\u201d of the 19 members of the central bank's interest-rate setting committee supported a cut in July.",
      "Other participants \u2014 the minutes didn't say how many \u2014 said that the Fed should keep rates unchanged this year, since inflation remains above 2%. Consumer prices rose 2.7% in June from a year ago, the fastest pace in four months.",
      "Other potential replacements for Powell have also publicly expressed support for cutting rates soon, including Kevin Warsh, a former member of the Fed's board who stepped down in 2011. Warsh, currently a fellow at the Hoover Institution, said on Fox News' \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d earlier this week that he supported rate cuts.",
      "\u201cThe president\u2019s right to be frustrated with Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve,\u201d Warsh said.",

    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has hinted at possible changes to TSA's liquid restrictions",
      "NEW YORK -- When limits on liquids were introduced at TSA checkpoints across the country in 2006, bins overflowed with bottled water, toothpaste, shaving cream and so much more. Nearly two decades later, travelers are much more accustomed to the \u201c3-1-1\u201d regulations\" governing the size of the liquids they're flying with, but scenes of passengers guzzling a beverage before putting their bags through the screening machines are still common.",
      "That's why Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sent ripples through the traveling public when she said earlier this week that changes might be afoot when it comes to the TSA's current liquid limits.",
      "\u201cThe liquids, I\u2019m questioning. So that may be the next big announcement, is what size your liquids need to be,\u201d Noem told a conference in Washington.",
      "Will travelers be able to carry bigger bottles? Multiple 1-quart bags of liquids? Those details haven't been rolled out. But coming on top of her announcement earlier this month that travelers could keep their shoes on at TSA checkpoints, it seems a much different security experience for American air travelers might be emerging.",
      "Airline travel changed dramatically after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Before that, airlines were responsible for security and would often contract it out to private firms, said Henry Harteveldt, an airline industry analyst with Atmosphere Research Group. Travelers often didn't need to show their ID at security checkpoints \u2014 and people without boarding passes, such as family members or friends, could go to the gate in some locations.",
      "\u201cIt was much more casual. And clearly it was ineffective, because 9/11 occurred,\u201d Hartevelt said.",
      "That's when the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration were born, with the mandate of preventing more terrorist attacks.",
      "The liquid limits, however, didn\u2019t kick in until 2006, after authorities foiled a plot that used liquid explosives smuggled aboard carry-on luggage. The TSA then very briefly banned all liquids in carry-on luggage. That ban lasted about six weeks, but strained airlines\u2019 baggage systems as more and more travelers turned to checked bags to pack toiletries.",
      "At the time the 3.4-ounce limit was implemented, the FBI and other laboratories had found that tiny amounts of substances small enough to fit into a quart-size bag couldn\u2019t blow up an airliner.",
      "When the ban was eventually lifted in September 2006, consumers and businesses alike had to learn how to adapt to the 3-1-1 rule \u2014 leading to more demand for smaller, travel size bottles of anything from shampoo to toothpaste, as well as clear, \u201cTSA approved\u201d toiletry bags that are still seen on store shelves today.",
      "The rule was also adopted in many countries around the world starting later that year.",
      "Keith Jeffries, a former TSA director at Los Angeles International Airport and now vice president of K2 Security Screening Group, says whatever comes next needs to be clear for passengers. And he knows whereof he speaks.",
      "Jeffries was working for TSA in Albuquerque, New Mexico, when the liquids rules came down overnight. Signage had to be changed to let passengers know of the new regulations. Barrels overflowing with toothpaste, shaving cream and shampoo had to be emptied every half hour. Jeffries remembers seeing a pair of shoes sitting in one of the barrels.",
      "When he asked why, a TSA staffer said there was gel in the soles. \u201cI said, 'Please tell me I don\u2019t have a passenger back there walking in the sterile area barefoot. And he says, 'No, sir, they still have their socks on,'\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how chaotic it was.\u201d",
      "Any move to simplify the screening process and cut down on the time it takes for passengers to navigate checkpoints would be a welcome change for everyone, Harteveldt says. Because it isn\u2019t just about convenience; those lines before the security checkpoints are the most at risk to a potential threat.",
      "The fact that the TSA felt confident enough to change its shoe policy earlier this month may not save too much time from an individual traveler\u2019s perspective, Harteveldt notes \u2014 but marks a \u201cbig step forward\u201d toward cutting down the average length of the security process when you think about the number of people going through U.S. airports each day. Relaxing current liquid restrictions could aid that effort.",
      "Still, questions remain. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is what the secretary is going to announce about liquids,\u201d Harteveldt said. \u201cWill they remove the liquid ban altogether \u2014 and can we go back to bringing full-sized of toiletries and other items with us? Will they allow people to bring more than one bag of toiletries and liquids? And importantly, will they relax the limit on (the) quart-size bag itself?\u2019\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also possible that the changes the TSA makes, whatever they are, only start at a handful of airports that have the technology to do so. Over the years, airports worldwide have adopted some aspects of security screenings faster or differently than others.",
      "But travelers could be confused if they\u2019re able to bring a full-size bottle of shampoo or lotion when flying out of one airport, for example, but not on their return trip home.",
      "\u201cThe devil is going to be in the details,\u201d Harteveldt said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the rollout plan will be absolutely critical.\u201d",
      "Harveldt says a more streamlined process could make travelers less stressed, but others \u2014 including flight attendants and pilots who are in the skies more frequently \u2014 may object and question whether airport security is being compromised. Still, Harveldt says he doesn\u2019t believe the TSA would make this change if the agency \u201cdidn\u2019t feel it was authentically, truly safe.\"",
      "If shoe regulations disappear and liquid restrictions are eased, the effects could ripple into the TSA PreCheck program, in which passengers submit information like their fingerprints and the agency prescreens them for any red flags. By giving the agency this information, the traveler then gets some benefits not available to other travelers \u2014 a special line to go through and the ability to keep their computers in their bags and their shoes on, for example.",
      "But if those benefits become more widely available to all passengers, will fewer people sign up for PreCheck?",
      "\u201cWhat is the impact on now both shoes and liquids going to have on TSA PreCheck enrollment? That is the million-dollar question,\" Jeffries said. \u201cAnd if I was still with TSA, I would be watching that closely over the next 12 to 18 months.\u201d",
      "While the prospect of increasing the current liquid limit could be a welcome change for many U.S. travelers, some experts say that the tech isn\u2019t available in enough airports yet. Current X-ray machines used at most airports today have a difficult time distinguishing between different types of liquids, says Jeffrey Price, a professor of aviation at Metropolitan State University of Denver.",
      "That\u2019s key, he explains, in determining whether something is harmless or potentially explosive.",
      "While newer computed tomography scanners are better and have begun making their way to airports, Price said in commentary published last week that it could take \u201canother decade or more\u201d before the newer machines are deployed at all U.S. airports.",
      "\u201cThis is an issue that needs to be studied much more carefully than the policy to leave your shoes on,\u201d he said in an email Thursday.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday said the agency's renovation of two of its buildings is in compliance with plans approved by a local commission, disputing a White House suggestion that they may have violated the law by deviating from those plans.",
      "The letter is the lastest salvo in an escalating battle between the Federal Reserve, an independent agency charged with fighting inflation and seeking maximum employment, and the Trump administration. President Donald Trump has for months criticized Powell and the Fed for not lowering its key interest rate, which the president says would boost borrowing and accelerate the economy.",
      "Powell has said he wants to see how the economy responds to Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs, which could raise inflation and slow growth, before making any moves.",
      "Trump has even threatened to fire Powell, though he has since backed away and said Wednesday it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that he would take the unprecedented step of doing so. Firing the Fed chair could cause chaos in the financial markets. Several executives of Wall Street banks have said this week that the Fed's independence from day-to-day politics is crucial.",
      "Still, the Trump administration has seized on ballooning costs for the Fed's renovation of two century-old buildings to argue that Powell has mismanaged the project. The president can't fire the Fed chair because of a policy disagreement, but he could do so \u201cfor cause,\u201d which is widely seen as some kind of malfeasance or neglect.",
      "Last week, the president's top budget adviser, Russell Vought, wrote Powell a letter that said Trump is \u201cextremely troubled\u201d by Powell's management of the project, which has risen in cost to about $2.5 billion, up from the Fed's initial estimate of $1.9 billion.",
      "Vought's letter also noted that Powell, in testimony before the Senate last month, said that the Fed removed some amenities that critics called ostentatious from its plans. Those plans had been approved by the National Capital Planning Commission in 2021.",
      "Vought said in his letter that if the renovation plans had changed, they were no longer \u201cin compliance with the approved plan\" and may violate the National Capital Planning Act.",
      "Powell responded Thursday that since the Fed\u2019s plans were approved by the NCPC in September 2021, it has made only \u201ca small number of design changes to scale back or eliminate certain elements\u201d and added that the changes weren\u2019t significant enough to \u201cwarrant... further review.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe project is proceeding in accordance with the plan that the NCPC approved,\u201d Powell wrote.",
      "The changes were intended \u201cto simplify construction and reduce the likelihood of further delays and cost increases,\u201d Powell said in his letter.",
      "Powell also defended the cost of the renovation: \u201cBoth buildings were in need of significant structural repairs,\u201d including \u201cthe removal of asbestos and lead contamination,\u201d as well as the \u201ccomplete replacement of antiquated systems such as electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilation and air conditioning, as well as fire detection and suppression systems,\u201d he wrote.",

      "Netflix on Thursday announced another quarter of steady growth built upon its video streaming service\u2019s more than 300 million subscribers",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Netflix on Thursday announced another quarter of steady growth as the video streaming service's more than 300 million subscribers have become increasingly attractive to advertisers.",
      "It\u2019s a familiar script that Netflix has followed for the past three years to widen its lead in video streaming while delivering financial results that have usually easily exceeded the analyst projections that steer investors.",
      "While Netflix's profit eclipsed Wall Street\u2019s expectations by a wide margin in the April-June quarter, its revenue came in right around the bar set by analysts. The Los Gatos, California, company earned $3.1 billion, or $7.19 per share, a 46% increase from the same time last year. Revenue rose 16% to $11.08 billion. Management also slightly raised its revenue forecast for the entire year, citing a belief that its programming lineup will reel in more subscribers in the second half than the first.",
      "Netflix\u2019s shares slipped 1% in extended trading, indicating investors expected an even more robust performance. But that is a minor stumble, given Netflix's stock price has soared 43% this year. The stock's strong run began during the second half of 2022 when the company introduced a low-priced version of its service with commercial interruptions as an antidote to an abrupt downturn in subscribers.",
      "The video streaming service is also faring well in Hollywood, as evidenced by the 120 Emmy nominations showered upon its programs earlier this week \u2013 second only to Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019s HBO Max. In the past quarter, Netflix hailed \u201cSirens,\u201d \u201cGinny & Georgia\u201d and \u201cThe Four Seasons\u201d as being among its most watched programming.",
      "The popularity of Netflix\u2019s scripted programming combined with weekly World Wrestling Entertainment spectacles, high-profile boxing matches and periodic National Football League games have enabled its service to retain subscribers while its prices rise, including on the cheapest tier.",
      "Netflix stopped providing quarterly updates on its total subscribers at the beginning of this year, but the company\u2019s revenue growth leaves no doubt that the number has grown from the 302 million reported at the end of 2024.",
      "It\u2019s gradually turning into an advertising magnet, too.",
      "Although Netflix still isn\u2019t selling enough commercials to require a disclosure of its advertising revenue, management continues to highlight the growth in its results. Netflix said its ad revenue for this year is on pace to double from last year.",

      "They were all over the Dunluce Links again Sunday, those passionate supporters of Rory McIlroy cheering on their favorite son in the final act of his homecoming \u2014 whether they were watching him or not.",
      "The big disappointment for McIlroy was that he couldn\u2019t deliver what they craved.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been an awesome week,\u201d McIlroy said after shooting 2-under 69 to tie for seventh at the British Open. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten everything I wanted out of this week apart from a claret jug, and that\u2019s just because one person was just a little bit better than the rest of us.\u201d",
      "That might be an understatement.",
      "Scheffler, the world No. 1, won by four shots to capture his fourth major title. He was seven strokes clear of McIlroy and playing on a different level in this pretty corner of Northern Ireland.",

      "\u201cHe\u2019s an incredible player,\u201d he said of Scheffler. \u201cHe\u2019s been dominant this week. Honestly, he\u2019s been dominant for the last couple years. He is the bar that we\u2019re all trying to get to.\u201d",

      "\u201cI know I wasn\u2019t the fan favorite today,\u201d he said, grinning, in his post-round speech on No. 18, \u201cbut I did hear a lot of USA and Dallas, Texas chants.\u201d",
      "Scheffler might have won two majors this year and asserted himself as the game\u2019s dominant player. Yet, for many, 2025 still belongs to McIlroy after his dramatic win at the Masters in April to complete the career Grand Slam.",
      "Fans came in droves this week to celebrate McIlroy\u2019s achievements, and produced some of the loudest roars he has ever heard on a golf course.",
      "If McIlroy didn\u2019t quite deliver, then Royal Portrush \u2014 where he shot 61 as a 16-year-old for the course record \u2014 certainly did, gaining widespread rave reviews.",
      "When the Open returned to Portrush in 2019 for the first time in 68 years, McIlroy was so emotional he hit his opening drive out-of-bounds, shot 79 and missed the cut.",
      "He made amends six years later.",
      "\u201cI feel so thankful and just so lucky that I get to do this in front of this crowd,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cHopefully I\u2019ll have one or two Opens left here, if the R&A decide to keep coming back \u2014 probably one while I\u2019m still competitive and another one while I\u2019m more gray than I already am.\u201d",

      "A double at No. 10 ended his hopes.",

      "\u201cI tried as best as I could to keep my emotions in check, especially walking up the last there and that reception,\u201d McIlroy said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Venus Williams is back on the tennis scene, ready to compete for the first time in more than a year, and while she smiled or laughed frequently Sunday while discussing her return at the DC Open, there was something that would make her even happier: if her younger sister Serena were along for the ride.",
      "\u201cI keep saying to my team: The only thing that would make this better is if she was here. Like, we always did everything together, so of course I miss her,\u201d Venus said when asked about a recent video on social media that showed Serena swinging a racket. \u201cBut if she comes back, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll let y\u2019all know.\u201d",
      "That, of course, was said with a wide grin. Serena, 43, hasn't played since the 2022 U.S. Open, when she declared she was \u201cevolving\u201d away from the sport she dominated for stretches on the way to 23 Grand Slam singles titles and an additional 14 in doubles with Venus.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what she\u2019s going to do. I don\u2019t ask those questions,\" Venus said a day before the hard-court tournament in the nation's capital begins. \"I think we always hit the ball, because that\u2019s who we are. We\u2019re always hitting.\u201d",
      "She said it was during a recent practice session of hers that Serena showed up and joined in for about 15 or 20 minutes.",
      "\u201cShe can take six months off and she clocks it clean,\u201d Venus said. \u201cYou can\u2019t teach that kind of talent. She\u2019s just so good.\u201d",
      "They both were the best around at one point.",
      "Both reached No. 1 in the rankings. Venus, who turned 45 last month, won seven major singles championships, two at the U.S. Open and five at Wimbledon.",
      "Her last tournament was in March 2024 at the Miami Open, where she exited in the first round. It's been so long that the official WTA Tour website lists her as \u201cinactive.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is very special for me to come back and play tennis,\u201d Venus said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a surprise for the fans \u2014 and a surprise in general, as I hold my cards tight.\u201d",
      "Sure does.",
      "It came as a bit of a shock to the tennis world when her appearance in Washington via a wild-card invitation was announced a week ago.",
      "Her team had reached out to DC Open chairman Mark Ein via text in April to gauge whether he'd be open to having Venus at an event she last entered in 2022. He said he needed two seconds to reply: \u201cOf course.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s such an icon of the sport \u2014 and, importantly, both on and off the court,\u201d Ein said in an interview. \u201cSo anytime you can have her engaged and have the spotlight on her and everything she\u2019s done and continues to do, it\u2019s hugely positive.\u201d",
      "What did she miss the most while away from the tour?",
      "\u201cAll the times that I had and, of course, the adrenaline, all those things,\u201d Venus said. \u201cJust the pure fun of playing the game, the fun of the challenge, overcoming \u2014 when you play, you overcome so many challenges: your opponents, the conditions, a lot of times you have to overcome yourself. Those things are very exciting.\u201d",
      "When asked why she's getting back on court, Venus offered a simple response: \u201cWhy not?\u201d",

      "PORTRUSH, Northern Ireland -- Scottie Scheffler began his bid for the third leg of the career Grand Slam on Sunday, taking a four-shot lead into the final round of the British Open at Royal Portrush.",
      "The start was ideal. From the first cut of rough, Scheffler hit his approach to the right side of the green on the slope. The ball trickled back and then rolled down to 10 inches from the cup for a tap-in birdie.",
      "Scheffler already won the PGA Championship by five shots this year. He won the Masters last year by four shots and the Masters in 2022 by three shots. No one has ever won each of their first four major titles by three shots or more.",
      "This was an extraordinary test because of the cheers, not all of them for him. There was pure adulation for Rory McIlroy playing before a home crowd in Northern Ireland. He was six shots behind, needing his greatest closing round in a major and help from Scheffler.",
      "McIlroy already is the Masters champion, the sixth player to win the career slam, and he has been in a far more relaxed mood before adoring fans.",
      "There was more admiration for Scheffler, though one fan along the first fairway got some laughs when he yelled out, \u201cGo Rory!\u201d as Scheffler walked by.",
      "Scheffler was paired with Li Haotong of China, who also hit a brilliant opening shot to 4 feet for birdie but then dropped a shot on the next. Li already has the highest finish by a Chinese player in a major, tying for third at Royal Birkdale in the 2017 British Open.",

At some point, you just want to play the game, so the goal is to remove some of the noise that happens off the court.\u201d",
      "After reading about Moonshot in a tech publication a few weeks ago, Rawlinson reached out to Ramalingam about a partnership.",
      "It was a quick connection.",
      "\u201cIt was really clear there was a values alignment,\u201d Ramalingam said. \u201cSome of that stems from some of our shared experiences as women of color in spaces where so often our voices are underrepresented, and the desire to actually do something about it and not just sit there.",
      "\u201cFor far too long, I saw women like me, people of color, be overrepresented as targets and underrepresented in the solution,\u201d she said.",

      "China's Ministry of State Security says it is cracking down on alleged smuggling of rare earths materials that it says threaten national security",
      "BANGKOK -- China's state security agency says it is cracking down on alleged smuggling of rare earths minerals that it says threaten national security, just weeks after Beijing and Washington agreed to make it easier for American firms to obtain from China those materials, which are critical for manufacturing and computer chip production.",
      "In a report published Friday in the state-run newspaper Global Times, the Ministry of State Security said foreign \u201cespionage and intelligence agencies\u201d were colluding to steal rare earths-related goods by repackaging and relabeling rare metals to hide their Chinese origin.",
      "In some cases the minerals were falsely declared as non-controlled items, mislabeled as such things as \u201csolder paste,\u201d mixed into other materials like ceramic tiles, or hidden in plastic mannequins or bottled water, it said.",
      "It referred only to an unnamed \u201ccertain country\u201d that it said lacked the capacity to make and refine its own rare earths.",
      "Investigations had found Chinese criminals were involved, exploiting shipping and delivery channels to evade controls on exports of the materials used in many high-tech applications including electric vehicle batteries, it said.",
      "The crackdown followed a report by Reuters earlier this month detailing how rare earths were being transshipped to the U.S. via Thailand and Mexico.",
      "China is the main source for many strategically vital rare earths and it has moved to slow exports of such minerals in retaliation for steep import duties President Donald Trump has imposed on Chinese goods since he returned to the White House and launched his crusade to overturn a global trading system he says is unfair to the United States and its workers.",
      "That followed an earlier series of restrictions by Beijing on exports of such materials as gallium, germanium, antimony and tungsten in response to trade friction with the administration of then-President Joe Biden.",
      "In April, Beijing imposed permitting requirements on seven rare earth elements, under a Chinese law that applies to all exports, not just those bound for the U.S. market.",
      "With the permitting process taking 45 days, the new requirement caused a pause in shipments, threatening to disrupt production of cars, robots, wind turbines and other high-tech products in the U.S. and around the world. The U.S., meanwhile, added to restrictions on exports of advanced technologies to China.",
      "Rare earths have remained at the center of China-U.S. talks aimed at staving off huge tariff increases that were postponed in May to allow time for negotiations on a broader trade agreement. The deadline for reaching a deal is Aug. 12.",
      "An agreement announced in late June did not remove China\u2019s permitting requirement on rare earths, but Beijing agreed to flexibility in dialing up or down the approval process as needed.",
      "Computer chips are another key bone of contention.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry said Friday that it had taken note of a decision by the Trump administration to lift restrictions on exports of key semiconductors used in artificial intelligence made by Nvidia and its rival Advanced Micro Devices.",
      "In April, the Trump administration announced it would restrict sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips to China \u2014 as well as MI308 chips from AMD.",
      "But Commerce Ministry spokesman Wang Wentao said restoring healthy trade ties will require more action by Washington.",
      "U.S. export controls on Ascend chips made by Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies have hurt the interests of Chinese companies, Wang told reporters in Beijing.",
      "\u201cWe hope that the United States and China will meet each other halfway and correct their wrong practices through equal consultation, create a good environment for mutually beneficial cooperation between enterprises of both sides, and jointly maintain the stability of the global semiconductor production and supply chain,\u201d he said.",

      "TALLINN, Estonia -- A snappy tune by a blogger that mockingly laments his poor internet connection in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don has gotten over a half-million views on Instagram in two weeks.",
      "\u201cHow to say you\u2019re from Rostov without saying a word? Show one bar of cellphone service,\" Pavel Osipyan raps while walking around the city, smartphone in hand. \"We have internet until 12 o'clock, and recently there\u2019s been no connection at all. No need to be angry, just get used to it already.\u201d",
      "The complaints by Osipyan \u2014 unable to pay electronically for groceries, or having to use paper maps while driving \u2014 aren't isolated to Rostov-on-Don, which borders Ukraine and, as home to Russia's Southern Military District, is targeted frequently by drones.",
      "In the last two months, cellphone internet shutdowns, which officials say are needed to foil Ukrainian drones, have hit dozens of Russian regions \u2014 from those near the fighting to parts of Siberia and even the Far East. Some Wi-Fi outages also have been reported.",
      "Russians contacted by The Associated Press talked about card payments not going through, taxi and ride-sharing apps not working properly, ATMs that sometimes fail.",
      "Experts point to the unprecedented nature of the measures and warn of far-reaching consequences in a country where the Kremlin already has significantly curtailed online freedom.",
      "Such shutdowns in the name of security legitimize them to the public and open the door for authorities abusing the restrictions, said Anastasiya Zhyrmont, policy manager for Eastern Europe and Central Asia at the Access Now digital rights group.",
      "Experts say the trend began in May, when Russia celebrated the 80th anniversary of the defeat of the Nazi Germany in World War II and foreign dignitaries flocked to Moscow for a big military parade.",
      "The capital suffered severe disruptions of cellphone connectivity to the internet for days, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed those were deliberate restrictions due to regular Ukrainian drone attacks. Asked how long they'd last, he replied, \"This will be done as needed.\u201d",
      "Russia has restricted smartphone connectivity before, with isolated instances during protests, as well as in regions bordering Ukraine.",
      "Shutdowns in the capital, however, sent a signal to authorities across the vast country that it\u2019s a useful tool, said lawyer Sarkis Darbinyan, founder of Russian internet freedom group Roskomsvoboda.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s \"Operation Spiderweb\u201d in early June, in which drones launched from containers on trucks attacked airfields deep inside Russia, made officials all the more eager to take action, Darbinyan said.",
      "\u201cThey got really scared that drones now may appear, like a jack-in-the-box, in any Russian regions,\u201d he told AP.",
      "By mid-July, deliberate shutdowns spread to most of the country, according to Na Svyazi \u2014 Russian for \u201cstaying connected\u201d \u2014 an activist group tracking internet availability.",
      "On Tuesday, the group reported cellphone internet shutdowns in 73 of over 80 regions. In 41 of them, there were reports of broadband network outages as well, while restrictions on broadband internet occurred in six regions, while cellphone connections were fine.",
      "Some regional officials confirmed that cellphone internet was restricted for security reasons. Nizhny Novgorod Gov. Gleb Nikitin said this month the measure will stay in place in the region east of Moscow for \u201cas long as the threat remains.\u201d",
      "Asked Thursday whether such mass shutdowns were justified, Peskov said \u201ceverything that has to do with ensuring the safety of citizens, everything is justified and everything is a priority.\u201d",
      "Russians from affected regions say the outages can last for hours or days; patterns also are hard to discern, with service working in one part of a city but vanishing elsewhere.",
      "In Voronezh, near Ukraine and frequently targeted by drones, one resident said she felt like she was in \u201ca cave\u201d in early July with no cellphone internet or Wi-Fi in her home. The woman, who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity because of security concerns, said she was only able to get online at work the next day.",
      "Cellphone internet in the southwestern city of Samara \"goes out at the most unpredictable moments,\u201d said Natalia, who also spoke on condition that her last name be withheld for safety reasons. Her home Wi-Fi recently also has slowed to a near halt around 11 p.m., staying that way for a few hours, she said.",
      "Connectivity has improved recently in the Siberian city of Omsk, said Viktor Shkurenko, who owns retail stores and other businesses there. But cellphone internet service was out in his office for an entire week. A few of his smaller stores that rely on cellphone networks suffered disruptions, but nothing critical, he said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t feel any super strong discomfort,\" said Grigori Khromov of Nizhny Novgorod, Russia\u2019s fifth-largest city where regular and widespread shutdowns were reported. \"I have an office job and I work either at home or in the office and have either wire internet or Wi-Fi.\u201d",
      "In rural areas, small towns and villages, where cellphone internet often is the only way to get online, the situation was harder to gauge.",
      "Pharmacies in such areas have struggled, Russian media reported and the Independent Pharmacies Association confirmed to AP. Viktoria Presnyakova, head of the association, said in a statement that prescriptions must be logged in special software, but that becomes impossible without an internet connection for weeks.",
      "A social media user in the Belgorod region bordering Ukraine complained on Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov\u2019s social media page that without cellphone internet and a working alarm system, village residents have to bang on a rail to warn neighbors of an attack. The authorities promised to look into improving connectivity in the area.",
      "Authorities elsewhere also announced steps to minimize disruptions by opening Wi-Fi spots. They also are reportedly planning to establish an agency to coordinate the shutdowns, according to Izvestia, a Kremlin-backed newspaper that cited unidentified government sources. Peskov said he was unaware of the plan.",
      "Russian and Ukrainian drones use cellphone internet networks to operate, so shutdowns are one way authorities try to counter the attacks, said Kateryna Stepanenko, a Russia analyst at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War.",
      "But it's also part of the Kremlin's long-term effort to rein in the internet. Authorities have actively censored online content in the last decade, blocking thousands of websites of independent media, opposition groups and human rights organizations.",
      "After Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the government blocked major social media like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, as well as encrypted messenger platform Signal and a few other messaging apps.",
      "Access to YouTube \u2014 wildly popular in Russia \u2014 was disrupted last year in what experts called deliberate throttling by the authorities. The Kremlin blamed YouTube owner Google for not properly maintaining its hardware in Russia.",
      "State internet watchdogs routinely block virtual private network services that help circumvent the restrictions, and there are plans to introduce a national messenger app, expected to replace foreign ones.",
      "Along with the shutdowns, these are part of a larger campaign \u201cto establish control over the internet, which is something the Kremlin had failed to do 20 years prior on the same level that China did,\u201d said the ISW's Stepanenko.",
      "Access Now's Zhyrmont says it's \u201cvery disturbing\u201d that Russians have gotten used to living with growing internet restrictions, including shutdowns.",
      "\u201cThis shouldn't be modern reality,\u201d she said.",

      "An advisory board convened by OpenAI says it should continue to be controlled by a nonprofit because the artificial intelligence technology it is developing is \u201ctoo consequential\u201d to be governed by a corporation alone",
      "OpenAI should continue to be controlled by a nonprofit because the artificial intelligence technology it is developing is \u201ctoo consequential\u201d to be governed by a corporation alone.",
      "That is the message from an advisory board convened by OpenAI to give it recommendations about its nonprofit structure \u2014 delivered in a report released Thursday, along with a sweeping vision for democratizing AI and reforming philanthropy.",
      "\u201cWe think it\u2019s too important to entrust to any one sector, the private sector or even the government sector,\u201d said Daniel Zingale, the convener of OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit commission and a former adviser to three California governors. \u201cThe nonprofit model allows for what we call a common sector,\u201d that facilitates democratic participation.",
      "The recommendations are not binding on OpenAI, but the advisory commission, which includes the labor organizer Dolores Huerta, offers a framework that may be used to judge OpenAI in the future, whether or not they adopt it.",
      "In the commission's view, communities that are already feeling the impacts of AI technologies should have input on how they are developed, including how data about them is used. But there are currently few avenues for people to influence tech companies who control much of the development of AI.",
      "OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, started in 2015 as a nonprofit research laboratory and has since incorporated a for-profit company with a valuation that has grown to $300 billion. The company has tried to change its structure since the nonprofit board ousted its CEO Sam Altman in Nov. 2023. He was reinstated days later and continues to lead OpenAI.",
      "It has run into hurdles escaping its nonprofit roots, including scrutiny from the attorney generals in California and Delaware, who have oversight of nonprofits, and a lawsuit by Elon Musk, an early donor to and founder of OpenAI.",
      "Most recently, OpenAI has said it will turn its for-profit company into a public benefit corporation, which must balance the interests of shareholders and its mission. Its nonprofit will hold shares in that new corporation, but OpenAI has not said how much.",
      "Zingale said Huerta told the commission their challenge was to help make sure AI is a blessing and not a curse. To grapple with those stakes, they envision a nonprofit with an expansive mandate to help everyone participate in the development and trajectory of AI.",
      "\u201cThe measure of this nonprofit will be in what it builds, who it includes, and how faithfully it endures to mission and impact,\" they wrote.",
      "The commission toured California communities and solicited feedback online. They heard that many were inspired by OpenAI\u2019s mission to create artificial intelligence to benefit humanity and ensure those benefits are felt widely and evenly.",
      "But, Zingale said many people feel they are in the dark about how it\u2019s happening.",
      "\u201cThey know this is profoundly important what\u2019s happening in this \u2018Age of Intelligence,\u2019 but they want to understand better what it is, how it\u2019s developed, where are the important choices being made and who\u2019s making them?\u201d he said.",
      "Zingale said the commission chose early on not to interact with Altman in any way in order to maintain their independence, though they quote him in their report. However, they did speak with the company\u2019s senior engineers, who they said, \u201centered our space with humility, seriousness, and a genuine desire to understand how their work might translate into democratic legitimacy.\u201d",
      "The commission proposed OpenAI immediately provide significant resources to the nonprofit for use in the public interest. For context, the nonprofit reported $23 million in assets in 2023, the most recent year that its tax filing is available.",
      "The commission recommend focusing on closing gaps in economic opportunity, investing in AI literacy and creating an organization that is accessible to and governed by everyday people.",
      "\u201cFor OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit to fulfill its mandate, it should commit to more than just doing good - it should commit to being known, seen, and shaped by the people it claims to serve,\u201d they wrote.",
      "The commission suggested opening a rapid response fund to help reduce economic strains now. Zingale said they specifically recommended funding theater, art and health.",
      "\u201cWe're trying to make the point that they need to dedicate some of their resources to human to human activities,\u201d he said.",
      "The commission also recommended setting up a requirement that a human lead the nonprofit, which Zingale said is a serious recommendation and \u201ca sign of the times.\"",

      "Wednesday\u2019s magnitude 7.3 earthquake off Alaska\u2019s Aleutian Islands chain struck in a region that has experienced a handful of powerful quakes within the last five years",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- Wednesday\u2019s magnitude 7.3 earthquake off Alaska's Aleutian Islands chain struck in a region that has experienced a handful of powerful quakes within the last five years \u2014 including one that shook communities almost exactly two years earlier.",
      "Officials said Thursday they had received no reports of injuries or major damage from the latest event, which triggered a tsunami warning that lasted about an hour before being downgraded and prompted communities along a 700-mile (1,127-km) stretch of Alaska\u2019s southern coast to urge people to move to higher ground. The official maximum wave height at Sand Point, a community 55 miles (88 kilometers) north of the epicenter, was about 3.9 inches (10 centimeters), said Kara Sterling, a lead duty scientist at the National Tsunami Warning Center. It occurred at low tide.",
      "The earthquake struck at 12:37 p.m. local time, prompting the center's tsunami warning.",
      "There are a number of ways people in warning areas can receive notifications, including the sounding of sirens in communities that have them, listening to weather radio or public radio broadcasts, following official accounts on social media, or via push alerts on cellphones. In some places, local officials have relayed warnings door to door, said Jeremy Zidek, a spokesperson with the state's emergency management division.",
      "Public safety departments in King Cove and Unalaska sent alerts urging those in coastal areas or those that could see inundation to seek higher ground.",
      "The warning issued by the center was downgraded to an advisory before being canceled around 2:45 p.m.",
      "Alaska is the most earthquake-prone state in the U.S. and one of the most seismically active regions in the world, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The state experiences a magnitude 7 earthquake almost annually, and the second-largest earthquake ever recorded was centered about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Anchorage, the agency said. That 1964 magnitude 9.2 earthquake \u2014 and the tsunami it triggered \u2014 killed about 130 people.",
      "The Aleutian arc is no stranger to earthquakes, but the activity in the region where Wednesday's earthquake struck has gotten scientists' attention. The area, within a few hundred miles of the earthquake, has \u201clit up\u201d since 2020, with Wednesday's earthquake marking the fifth exceeding magnitude 7.0 since 2020, said state seismologist Michael West.",
      "\u201cI would not call this an isolated earthquake. It appears to be part of a larger sequence spanning the last several years,\" he said. But West added: \u201cThere's no reason to be alarmist about this.\u201d",
      "Some communities have buildings designated on higher ground as meetup points during tsunami warnings, such as a school, while others might simply urge residents to retreat up a hillside, Zidek said.",
      "\u201cThat area of Alaska, most areas of Alaska, it gets steep real quick,\u201d he said.",
      "Sometimes, the only warning one might have is the shaking ground, Zidek said. \u201cIf it shakes violently for 20 seconds or more, that is your warning sign, and you should head to higher ground if you\u2019re in a coastal area,\u201d he said.",
      "Zidek and West said people should continue to heed warnings. West said he worries about a \u201cburnout effect\u201d among residents in the region, some of whom have evacuated numerous times since 2018 in response to larger earthquakes that have not caused significant damage.",
      "West said he is reminded of a magnitude 8.6 earthquake in 1946 \u2014 west of the location of Wednesday's quake \u2014 that generated a deadly tsunami and led to the creation of a U.S. tsunami warning system. The death toll included more than 150 people in Hawaii, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "\u201cThis area is capable of trans-Pacific tsunamis, and I feel like maybe the best way to stay vigilant ... is maybe to look into our deeper history beyond just the last five years,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "San Jose\u2019s mayor is using AI tools like ChatGPT to streamline city operations and improve services for its 1 million residents",
      "Before the mayor of San Jose, California, arrives at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new business, his aides ask ChatGPT to help draft some talking points.",
      "\u201cElected officials do a tremendous amount of public speaking,\u201d said Mayor Matt Mahan, whose recent itinerary has taken him from new restaurant and semiconductor startup openings to a festival of lowriding car culture.",
      "Other politicians might be skittish admitting a chatbot co-wrote their speech or that it helped draft a $5.6 billion budget for the new fiscal year, but Mahan is trying to lead by example, pushing a growing number of the nearly 7,000 government workers running Silicon Valley's biggest city to embrace artificial intelligence technology.",
      "Mahan said adopting AI tools will eliminate drudge work and help the city better serve its roughly 1 million residents.",
      "He\u2019s hardly the only public or private sector executive directing an AI-or-bust strategy, though in some cases, workers have found that the costly technology can add hassles or mistakes.",
      "\u201cThe idea is to try things, be really transparent, look for problems, flag them, share them across different government agencies, and then work with vendors and internal teams to problem solve,\u201d Mahan said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s always bumpy with new technologies.\u201d",
      "By next year, the city intends to have 1,000, or about 15%, of its workers trained to use AI tools for a variety of tasks, including pothole complaint response, bus routing and using vehicle-tracking surveillance cameras to solve crimes.",
      "One of San Jose's early adopters was Andrea Arjona Amador, who leads electric mobility programs at the city\u2019s transportation department. She has already used ChatGPT to secure a $12 million grant for electric vehicle chargers.",
      "Arjona Amador set up a customized \u201cAI agent\u201d to review the correspondence she was receiving about various grant proposals and asked it to help organize the incoming information, including due dates. Then, she had it help draft the 20-page document.",
      "So far, San Jose has spent more than $35,000 to purchase 89 ChatGPT licenses -- at $400 per account -- for city workers to use.",
      "\u201cThe way it used to work, before I started using this, we spent a lot of evenings and weekends trying to get grants to the finish line,\u201d she said. The Trump administration later rescinded the funding, so she pitched a similar proposal to a regional funder not tied to the federal government.",
      "Arjona Amador, who learned Spanish and French before she learned English, also created another customized chatbot to edit the tone and language of her professional writings.",
      "With close relationships to some of the tech industry's biggest players, including San Francisco-based OpenAI and Mountain View-based Google, the mayors of the Bay Area's biggest cities are helping to promote the type of AI adoption that the tech industry is striving for, while also promising guidelines and standards to avoid the technology's harms.",
      "San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie announced a plan Monday to give nearly 30,000 city workers, including nurses and social workers, access to Microsoft\u2019s Copilot chatbot, which is based on the same technology that powers ChatGPT. San Francisco's plan says it comes with \u201crobust privacy and bias safeguards, and clear guidelines to ensure technology enhances \u2014 not replaces \u2014 human judgment.\u201d",
      "San Jose has similar guidelines and hasn't yet reported any major mishaps with its pilot projects. Such problems have attracted attention elsewhere because of the technology's propensity to spew false information, known as hallucinations.",
      "ChatGPT's digital fingerprints were found on an error-filled document published in May by U.S. Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr.'s \"Make America Healthy Again\" commission.",
      "In Fresno, California, a school official was forced to resign after saying she was too trusting of an AI chatbot that fabricated information in a document.",
      "While some government agencies have been secretive about when they turn to chatbots for help, Mahan is open about his ChatGPT-written background memos that he turns to when making speeches.",
      "\u201cHistorically, that would have taken hours of phone calls and reading, and you just never would have been able to get those insights,\" he said. \"You can knock out these tasks at a similar or better level of quality in a lot less time.\u201d",
      "He added, however, that \"you still need a human being in the loop. You can\u2019t just kind of press a couple of buttons and trust the output. You still have to do some independent verification. You have to have logic and common sense and ask questions.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, when OpenAI introduced a new pilot product called Operator, it promised a new kind of tool that went beyond a chatbot's capabilities. Instead of just analyzing documents and producing passages of text, it could also access a computer system and schedule calendars or perform tasks on a person's behalf. Developing and selling such \u201cAI agents\" is now a key focus for the tech industry.",
      "More than an hour's drive east of Silicon Valley, where the Bay Area merges into Central Valley farm country, Jamil Niazi, director of information technology at the city of Stockton, had big visions for what he could do with such an agent.",
      "Perhaps the parks and recreation department could let an AI agent help residents book a public park or swimming pool for a birthday party. Or residents could find out how crowded the pool was before packing their swim clothes.",
      "Six months later, however, after completing a proof-of-concept phase, the city didn't buy a full license for the technology due to the cost.",
      "The market research group Gartner recently predicted that over 40% of \u201cagentic AI\u201d projects will be canceled before the end of 2027, \u201cdue to escalating costs, unclear business value or inadequate risk controls.\u201d",
      "San Jose's mayor remains bullish about the potential for these AI tools to help workers \u201cin the bowels of bureaucracy\u201d to rapidly speed up their digital paperwork.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just an amazing amount of bureaucracy that large organizations have to have,\u201d Mahan said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s finance, accounting, HR or grant writing, those are the kinds of roles where we think our employees can be 20 (to) 50% more productive -- quickly.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014",
      "The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP\u2019s text archives.",

      "DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK, Calif. -- When the running gets hard in this desert dubbed \u201chell on Earth,\u201d Danny Westergaard tells himself: \u201cSlow and steady\u201d or \u201csmooth as butter.\u201d",
      "For 18 years, Westergaard, 66, has braved the scorching summer heat of California\u2019s Death Valley in an ultramarathon billed as the world\u2019s toughest. Last week, 99 runners from across the globe embarked on a grueling 135 mile (217.26 kilometer) competition from the lowest point below sea level of North America to the trailhead of the highest peak in the contiguous U.S. They had 48 hours to do it. Few have completed the competition as many times as Westergaard, though finishing is not a given.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just become like a summer ritual and a family reunion,\" he said. \u201cI feel at home when I\u2019m here. It\u2019s my tribe.\u201d",
      "For the 37th year, the Badwater 135 Ultramarathon challenged athletes to withstand stretches of this dry, searing desert. The race takes place in July, when temperatures have soared into the 130s F (54.44s C). Even as a place of extremes, Death Valley is not immune to global warming. Seven of its hottest summers have occurred in the past 10 years, according to the National Park Service. And if planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current pace, more places could experience its broiling temperatures.",
      "Over two days, Westergaard would trek up and down mountain ranges, past sand dunes and salt flats, through quaint towns and vast desertscapes amid temperatures as high as 117 F (47.22 C). He tried to smile throughout, even when he felt miserable.",
      "\u201cIt just lifts you up,\u201d he said of smiling so others smile back.",
      "At 8 p.m., the first wave of runners take off. Westergaard jogs up a ramp into the pale light of dusk. It\u2019s 113 F (45 C), and it feels like a blow dryer to the face.",
      "Leap frogging in a van behind him is his cheer squad and support crew \u2013 Jennifer Drain, his smiley cousin back for the 17th year, and daughters Meagan, who has attended before, and Madison, a first timer. The crew, who playfully call Westergaard \"wiener dog,\u201d are hauling everything he needs: food, ice, water, electrolytes.",
      "This heat can kill. Soaring body temperatures can lead to organ failure and strain the heart, especially for people with heart disease, and cause heat stroke. To prevent that they keep him cool. They spray mist on him and pour ice into his hat and a bandana wrapped around his neck. His drinking water is ice cold.",
      "A few hours in, Meagan asks her dad if he\u2019s peed. \u201cLong stream,\" he responded of his amount of urine. Staying hydrated is critical. As he sweats, he\u2019s losing liquids that can critically stress kidneys if not replenished. Dehydration can cause organs to fail from lack of blood, oxygen and nutrients, leading to seizures and death.",
      "No runners have died doing the competition, but heat-related issues are common, said Megan Dell, the race's medical director. Stomach issues can lead to vomiting and dehydration. Hyponatremia \u2014 which happens when your blood's sodium is too low \u2014 has sent runners to the hospital.",
      "Westergaard has learned to embrace the rollercoaster. One moment he feels like Superman \u2014 the next he could be throwing up on the side of the road, questioning if he\u2019ll make it. \u201cYou just suck it up, just like in life, and get through the lows, and it always gets better.\u201d",
      "The runners dash toward mile 50.8 (81.75 kilometers), the critical cut off point they must get to by 10 a.m. or be eliminated. The sun is peaking over the mountains, casting a warm glow over dune fields. It\u2019s 85 F (29.44 C).",
      "\u201cLiving the dream, ey?\u201d Westergaard said with a smile, his perky strut now a droopy shuffle.",
      "He pours water on his face and arms and munches some watermelon. Madison paces behind him as they crack jokes. \u201cGet er done! Junior wiener in training!\u201d Meagan yelled.",
      "Westergaard makes it to the cut off point before 9 a.m. It\u2019s 90 F (32.2 C).",
      "Mile 56 (90.12 kilometers): After moving for 14 hours straight, Westergaard rests and eats some avocado toast. \u201cGreat! Let\u2019s motor!\u201d he said after 10 minutes sitting on a chair.",
      "Miles later, he begins his descent into \u201cthe oven\u201d that is Panamint Valley, usually the hottest part of the race during the hottest part of the day. It\u2019s 96 F (35.56 C) and the heat sizzles from above and below. Westergaard runs on the white line on the road because it\u2019s cooler. In hotter years, the asphalt got so hot the bottoms of his shoes felt sticky on the ground.",
      "Westergaard trains year round to acclimate to the heat. As he gets older, he doesn't tolerate heat as well and has slowed down. His two-hour sauna sessions are now one, and he runs a few times a week instead of daily.",
      "\u201cI'm just out there longer,\u201d he said, \u201cbut still getting it done.\u201d",
      "Tony Wolf, kinesiology professor at the University of Georgia, said aging adults generally have reduced heart function compared to younger adults. When combined with the cardiovascular demand of exercise and heat stress, it can cause difficulties.",
      "There isn\u2019t much research about how the bodies of fit older adults, including competitive athletes, regulate internal temperature. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a ton of people in their 60s and older who are doing those kinds of events,\u201d said Wolf.",
      "Studies focused on adults before and after a training program found that exercise improved heart function and thermoregulation. That could suggest that the heart and thermoregulation impairments linked to aging are largely mitigated by lifelong fitness, Wolf said.",
      "The runners are spread out now, their flashing lights twinkling in the distance. This night is the toughest for Westergaard as sleep deprivation sets in. He zigzags on the road, barely awake. The runners ahead of him look like they're running toward him.",
      "In past years, his hallucinations have included people luring him to rest on couches that were actually bushes. Another time, he struck up a conversation with a kid skateboarding by him with a dog. And once, he watched for hours as a guy swung off the edge of the crescent moon, waving down at him.",
      "\u201cIt was just clear as day,\u201d Westergaard said of the hallucination.",
      "At 3:10 a.m. at mile 98 (157.72 kilometers), he sleeps for 15 minutes under the moonlight.",
      "\u201cNo one really quite understands\u201d why he does this, said Madison.",
      "At 11:50 a.m. and around mile 123 (197.95 kilometers), Westergaard shuffles through the town of Lone Pine. Mount Whitney, the tallest peak in the continental U.S., soars some 14,500 feet (4,420 meters) into the blue sky.",
      "A crowd claps and cheers as he runs by.",
      "\u201cGo Danny, go!\u201d yelled a man.",
      "It's 92 F (33.33 C) as he approaches the final 4,750 foot (1,447.8 meters) mountain ascent to the finish line. Westergaard is walking at a snail's pace and says he\u2019s falling asleep. But his smile hasn\u2019t waned.",
      "\u201cWe've come a long way,\u201d Westergaard said, Madison pacing behind and spraying him.",
      "\u201cLong way for a burger!\u201d she responded. They giggle while thinking about the veggie burger they'll buy upon finishing.",
      "Then he does, crossing the finish line with his crew at exactly 45 hours and 29 minutes.",
      "It was his most special Badwater 135 race by far, he says misty eyed, having Meagan and Madison at his side.",

    "story": [
      "A coalition of philanthropic funders will spend $1 billion over 15 years to help develop artificial intelligence tools to help spur economic mobility",
      "A coalition of funders, including the Gates Foundation and Ballmer Group, will spend $1 billion over 15 years to help develop artificial intelligence tools for public defenders, parole officers, social workers and others who help Americans in precarious situations.",
      "The funders announced Thursday that they will create a new entity, NextLadder Ventures, to offer grants and investments to nonprofits and for-profits to develop tools for those who often manage huge caseloads with few resources.",
      "\u201cThe solutions that we\u2019re investing in, the hundreds of entrepreneurs that are going to bring forward solutions that incorporate leading edge technologies, are going to do it by coming alongside people who are living through some of the struggles in the economy,\u201d said Brian Hooks, CEO of Stand Together, a nonprofit started by Kansas-based billionaire Charles Koch.",
      "The other funders include hedge fund founder John Overdeck and Valhalla Foundation, which was started by Inuit cofounder Steve Cook and his wife Signe Ostby. Ballmer Group is the philanthropy of former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and his wife Connie. The funders declined to reveal the exact financial commitments made by each of the contributors.",
      "The point of investing in these AI tools is to spur economic mobility, a focus all the funders share, they said. The funders believe there are many ideas for how AI technologies could help match people with resources after a disaster or an eviction, for example, or help a parole officer close out more cases for people who have met all of the criteria but are waiting for the paperwork to be processed.",
      "\u201cAs we traded notes on where we were making investments and where we saw broader gaps in the sector, it was readily apparent that there was a real opportunity to come together as a group of cofunders and cofounders to establish a new kind of investment organization,\u201d said Kevin Bromer, who leads the technology and data strategy at Ballmer Group. He will also serve as a member on NextLadder's board, which will include three independent board members and representatives from the other funders.",
      "NextLadder will be led by Ryan Rippel, who previously directed the Gates Foundation's economic mobility portfolio. The funder group has not yet determined if NextLadder will incorporate as a nonprofit or a for profit organization but said any returns they make from investments will go back into funding new initiatives.",
      "NextLadder will partner with AI company Anthropic, which will offer technical expertise and access to its technologies to the nonprofits and companies it invests in. Anthropic has committed around $1.5 million annually to the partnership, said Elizabeth Kelly, its head of beneficial deployments, which is a team that focuses on giving back to society.",
      "\u201cWe want to hand-hold grantees through their use of Claude with the same care and commitment we provide to our largest enterprise customers,\u201d Kelly said, referencing Anthropic's large language model.",
      "Hooks, of Stand Together, said philanthropy can reduce the riskiness of these types of investments and offer organizations more time to prove out their ideas.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re successful, this will be the first capital to demonstrate what\u2019s possible,\u201d Hooks said.",
      "Researchers like those at the Active Learning Network for Accountability and Performance in humanitarian action have studied some of the risks associated with using AI tools when interacting with sensitive populations or handling high-stakes interactions, for example, in humanitarian contexts.",
      "They recommend assessing whether AI is the best tool to solve the problem and, crucially, if it works reliably and accurately enough in high-risk settings. They also recommend assessing tools for bias, considering privacy protections and weighing the cost of potential dependence on a specific provider.",
      "The National Institute of Standards and Technology also emphasizes that trustworthy AI systems should be accountable to users and that it should be possible to explain or trace how a tool arrived at a certain conclusion or decision.",
      "Hooks emphasized that any AI tools NextLadder invests in will be shaped by the needs and feedback of these frontline workers. Tools that don't work for them, won't succeed, he said. Even with the potential risks of AI tools, he said it's imperative that groups that are struggling to move up the economic ladder have access to new technologies.",
      "\u201cThe idea that we would deprive those who are struggling in our country from the benefits of the leading edge solutions is unacceptable,\u201d Hooks said.",

      "The Trump administration has revoked $4 billion in federal funding for California's long-delayed high speed rail project",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- The Trump administration revoked federal funding for California's high-speed rail project on Wednesday, intensifying uncertainty about how the state will make good on its long-delayed promise of building a bullet train to shuttle riders between San Francisco and Los Angeles.",
      "The U.S. Transportation Department announced it was pulling back $4 billion in funding for the project, weeks after signaling it would do so. Overall, a little less than a quarter of the project's funding has come from the federal government. The rest has come from the state, mainly through a voter-approved bond and money from its cap-and-trade program.",
      "President Donald Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy both have slammed the project as a \u201ctrain to nowhere.\"",
      "\u201cThe Railroad we were promised still does not exist, and never will,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"This project was Severely Overpriced, Overregulated, and NEVER DELIVERED.\u201d",
      "The loss marks the latest blow to California by the Trump administration, which has blocked a first-in-the-nation rule to phase out the sale of new gas-powered cars, launched investigations into university admission policies and threatened to pull funding over transgender girls being allowed to compete in girls sports.",
      "It also comes as rail project leaders are seeking private investment to help pay for its estimated price tag of more than $100 billion.",
      "Voters first approved the project in 2008 and it was supposed to be operating this decade. But cost estimates have consistently grown and its timeline pushed back.",
      "State officials are now focused on building a 119-mile (192-kilometer) stretch connecting the Central Valley cities of Bakersfield and Merced that is set to be operating by 2033. The California High Speed Rail Authority is slated to release a report this summer to state lawmakers with an updated funding plan and timeline for the project.",
      "Authority officials wrote in a letter earlier this month that the Trump administration made up its mind about revoking funding before thoroughly reviewing the project. They noted that more than 50 structures have already been built, including underpasses, viaducts and bridges to separate the rail line from roadways for safety.",
      "\u201cCanceling these grants without cause isn\u2019t just wrong \u2014 it\u2019s illegal,\u201d authority CEO Ian Choudri said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThese are legally binding agreements, and the Authority has met every obligation, as confirmed by repeated federal reviews, as recently as February 2025.\"",
      "The authority has asked potential private investors to express their interest by the end of the month.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state will keep \u201call options on the table\u201d to fight the revocation of federal funds.",
      "\u201cTrump wants to hand China the future and abandon the Central Valley. We won\u2019t let him,\" he said in a statement.",
      "The state has \u201cno viable plan\u201d to complete even the Central Valley segment, said Drew Feeley, acting administrator of the transportation department's Federal Railroad Administration, in a report released last month. He called the project a \u201cstory of broken promises\u201d and a waste of taxpayer dollars.",
      "California Democrats also have criticized project spending. Democratic Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan said at a budget hearing earlier this year that her constituents \u201coverwhelmingly believe\u201d high-speed rail spending \u201chas been irresponsible.\u201d",
      "Newsom plans to extend the state's cap-and-trade program, a key funding source for the project which is set to expire at the end of 2030, through 2045.",
      "The program sets a declining limit on the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions large emitters can release. Those polluters can buy allowances from the state needed to pollute, and about 45% of that money goes into what's known as the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, according to the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee, a group of experts that reviews the program.",
      "The fund helps pay for climate and transportation projects, including high-speed rail.",
      "The bullet train project receives 25% of the money from the fund, which ends up being a little less or a little more than $1 billion annually, depending on the year. Newsom in May proposed guaranteeing $1 billion a year for the project from the fund, but lawmakers have not agreed to that.",

      "Cleaning your electronic devices is essential for hygiene and performance",
      "LONDON -- Smartphones, laptops, headphones and other electronic devices are essential for work and play in our daily lives. But all that time spent typing, scrolling or listening also means our devices gradually accumulate grime that needs to be cleaned off.",
      "You might not give much thought to cleaning your devices but there are reasons you should, says Logitech, which makes keyboards, webcams and other computer peripherals.",
      "\u201cRegular cleaning and proper maintenance not only keeps your gadgets looking pristine, and wins you hygiene points, it also helps them perform better and last longer,\u201d the company says. \u201cIn the case of devices like earbuds, the accumulated bacteria and debris may even cause health issues or discomfort.\u201d",
      "Here are some pointers on cleaning your tech:",
      "Always check if the manufacturer has any specific guidelines for cleaning.",
      "Assemble some basic equipment and material for cleaning, which should include a soft and lint-free cleaning cloth, like a microfiber cloth; cotton swabs; a soft-bristled brush like a toothbrush, paintbrush or makeup brush; compressed air and isopropyl alcohol.",
      "Isopropyl, or rubbing alcohol, is a non-toxic cleaning solvent that\u2019s antiseptic and antibacterial. It's popular for cleaning electronics because it doesn\u2019t leave any residue and dries quickly. But you might want to wear gloves to avoid skin irritation. Drip some of it on a cloth instead of pouring it directly onto your device. Also heed some of the more specific warnings below.",
      "Water and mild soap can be useful for cleaning dirty surfaces, but isopropyl alcohol is recommended for cleaning the internals of a device, said Alex Diaz-Kokaisl, senior technical writer at electronics repair company iFixit.",
      "\u201cWhile there isn\u2019t a hard-and-fast rule for cleaning electronics, we generally use high-concentration isopropyl alcohol (more than 90%) because it evaporates quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe faster a liquid evaporates, the less likely it is to affect any components that conduct electricity.\u201d",
      "For whatever device you're cleaning, disconnect or power it off first. Remove any cases, plugs, covers and accessories.",
      "When using a computer, the keyboard and mouse are the parts that are touched most often and therefore need the most frequent cleaning. And all those crevices between a keyboard's keys are sure to catch crumbs.",
      "To remove any loose debris, iFixit's official in-house cleaning guide recommends using a can of compressed air. Run the spray back and forth across the keys to blow out any bits. If possible, hold the keyboard upside down so the debris falls out.",
      "If you don\u2019t have compressed air, Logitech suggests using a hair dryer on the cold air setting. Some social media users also recommend a handheld balloon pump.",
      "Next, dampen a cleaning cloth with water and gently wipe down the keyboard and mouse.",
      "Logitech says you can also use rubbing alcohol but recommends you test it first on an inconspicuous spot to make sure it doesn't cause discoloration or scrub the lettering off the keys.",
      "Anti-bacterial baby wipes can also work on devices like a mouse, Diaz-Kokaisl said.",
      "\u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be enough liquid to seep through cracks in the shell, and their residue typically evaporates faster than just using soap and water,\u201d he said.",
      "For laptop screens or external monitors, use a dry microfiber cloth to gently wipe away fingerprint smudges.",
      "If there are more stubborn spots \u2014 like food stains or sneezy spatters \u2014 dampen the cloth with distilled water or a 50/50 solution of distilled water and vinegar.",
      "Computer maker Lenovo says the \u201cgentle acidity of vinegar can help break down oils and fingerprints.\u201d Avoid using household glass cleaners, which can contain ammonia that could damage the screen. The same goes for paper towels, which can scratch the screen. HP also warns against using rubbing alcohol.",
      "A lot of people listen to music or podcasts through their earbuds, but that also means they'll need regular cleaning to remove any earwax, natural skin oils or other grungy buildup.",
      "If the earbuds have silicon tips, remove them. Cleaning procedures vary depending on your brand and model. Logitech and Bose recommend using soapy water. But Sony warns against water or wet wipes because they can speed deterioration, and, instead, advises using a dry cloth.",
      "Use a cotton swab to wipe the earbud nozzles clean.",
      "Owners of Apple AirPods need to follow a much more elaborate procedure to clean the mesh. You'll need a child's toothbrush, two small cups, a paper towel, distilled water, as well as micellar water \u2014 typically used as a facial cleanser.",
      "Pour some micellar water into a cup, dip the toothbrush, brush the AirPod's various mesh parts, and then blot them dry with the paper. Repeat twice. Then repeat that procedure but using the distilled water to rinse off the micellar water. Finally, let the AirPods dry for at least two hours.",
      "To clean the rest of the AirPod's body, use a damp cloth. And don't forget about the charging case. Apple recommends brushing out any debris and then wiping with a dry cloth. If needed, dampen it with isopropyl alcohol.",
      "What about over-the-ear headphones? Bose says you should wipe them down at least once a week, especially after working out, to remove any dirt and bacteria hiding in the nooks and crannies. Remove the pads and use a cloth dampened with soapy water to clean them.",
      "Apple has issued specific instructions on its website for cleaning various iPhone models. Samsung has posted similar guidelines for its Galaxy lineup.",
      "They both advise using a soft, lint-free cloth, such as a lens cleaning cloth, to gently wipe the outside of the phone. Apple warns against using any cleaning products, which could erode the oil-repellent coating that most iPhones come with.",
      "Both companies say it\u2019s OK to use disinfectants such as rubbing alcohol to gently clean the exterior, but avoid bleach or hydrogen peroxide.",

      "Astronomers have discovered the earliest seeds of rocky planets forming around a baby sun-like star",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Astronomers have discovered the earliest seeds of rocky planets forming in the gas around a baby sun-like star, providing a precious peek into the dawn of our own solar system.",
      "It\u2019s an unprecedented snapshot of \u201ctime zero,\u201d scientists reported Wednesday, when new worlds begin to gel.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve captured a direct glimpse of the hot region where rocky planets like Earth are born around young protostars,\" said Leiden Observatory\u2019s Melissa McClure from the Netherlands, who led the international research team. \u201cFor the first time, we can conclusively say that the first steps of planet formation are happening right now.\u201d",
      "The observations offer a unique glimpse into the inner workings of an emerging planetary system, said the University of Chicago\u2019s Fred Ciesla, who was not involved in the study appearing in the journal Nature.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the things we\u2019ve been waiting for. Astronomers have been thinking about how planetary systems form for a long period of time,\" Ciesla said. \u201cThere's a rich opportunity here.\u201d",
      "NASA\u2019s Webb Space Telescope and the European Southern Observatory in Chile teamed up to unveil these early nuggets of planetary formation around the young star known as HOPS-315. It\u2019s a yellow dwarf in the making like the sun, yet much younger at 100,000 to 200,000 years old and some 1,370 light-years away. A single light-year is 6 trillion miles.",
      "In a cosmic first, McClure and her team stared deep into the gas disk around the baby star and detected solid specks condensing \u2014 signs of early planet formation. A gap in the outer part of the disk gave allowed them to gaze inside, thanks to the way the star tilts toward Earth.",
      "They detected silicon monoxide gas as well as crystalline silicate minerals, the ingredients for what\u2019s believed to be the first solid materials to form in our solar system more than 4.5 billion years ago.

      "At Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, a half-dozen workers are making what appear to be gray billiard balls",
      "OAK RIDGE, Tenn. -- Near signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today\u2019s power plants use.",
      "The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production.",
      "President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030.",
      "But just like cars won\u2019t run without gas, those plants won\u2019t run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump.",
      "In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby.",
      "\u201cThis is a unique time,\u201d said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory\u2019s principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy\u2019s subsidiary TRISO-X. \u201cThe momentum is incredible.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity.",
      "X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel \u2014 inside what's known as \u201cpebbles.\u201d Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor.",
      "At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade.",
      "Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up \u2014 one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said.",
      "At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings \u2014 like candy dipping \u2014 that make them look like very tiny BBs.",
      "X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it\u2019s strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV.",
      "The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times. X-energy also plans to make fuel products for other advanced reactor designs.",
      "The national laboratory lends X-energy its expertise, research and high-tech equipment for analysis and will evaluate samples, as will some universities. Other samples are archived. Idaho National Laboratory received a batch for its advanced test reactor, Brown said.",
      "Critics of building more nuclear reactors say they\u2019re too expensive and riskier than other low-carbon energy sources.",
      "\u201cWithout a substantial decrease in construction costs, it\u2019s not worth the avoided greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d said David Kemp, a Cato Institute policy analyst.",
      "Kemp said Trump's 25-year quadrupling goal is unrealistic because it would mean building nuclear reactors faster than ever. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two, at a Georgia nuclear plant, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.",
      "Many next-generation reactors will use high-assay low-enriched uranium. It's fuel that's enriched to a higher level than traditional large nuclear reactors use, allowing the newer reactors to run longer and more efficiently, sit on smaller footprints and produce less waste, according to the Department of Energy.",
      "There\u2019s little of it made in the United States right now.",
      "Only Russia and China currently have the infrastructure to make large amounts of high-assay low-enriched uranium. In the United States, Centrus Energy produced the nation\u2019s first 20 kilograms of high-assay low-enriched uranium in more than 70 years in late 2023, to show it can produce limited quantities for commercial reactors.",
      "A big takeaway from Trump's executive orders is the need to \u201camp up\u201d domestic production of nuclear fuel to reduce dependence on foreign sources and enable in the long term expansion of American nuclear energy, according to the Energy Department.",
      "At the Nuclear Energy Institute trade association, Benjamin Holtzman, director of new nuclear, said he thinks the fuel will be ready for a new generation of U.S. nuclear reactors needed to meet the growing demand for electricity \u2014 if the right actions are taken now.",
      "X-energy CEO J. Clay Sell said he hopes to help solve the fuel problem so it doesn\u2019t hold back new reactor development. The Energy Department has awarded funding to X-energy. Amazon invested in X-energy too, and they\u2019re collaborating to bring more than 5 gigawatts of new U.S. power projects online by 2039.",
      "X-energy is the only one with an application before the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to license a new fabrication facility to transform enriched uranium into fuel products for nuclear reactors. Another applicant has asked to amend an existing license to make fuel for advanced reactors, according to the NRC. About five additional companies have told the NRC they are interested in making fuel for advanced reactors.",
      "X-energy's pilot lab at the National Laboratory started in 2016. The company now has 100 acres in Oak Ridge and growing for its nuclear fuel production complex.",
      "The first factory could be operational by late 2027 or early 2028, capable at full operation of assembling enough fuel orbs to power 11 of its new-age reactors; a second by late 2029, with a capacity four times greater, said TRISO-X President Joel Duling.",
      "\u201cI've been through two or three \u2018nuclear renaissances,\u2019\" Duling said. \u201cThis isn't a renaissance. This is a game-changer.\u201d",

      "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says export controls on advanced chips require companies to adapt",
      "BEIJING -- The head of Nvidia downplayed his role in getting the U.S. government to lift a ban on selling an advanced computer chip in China and said it will take time to ramp up production once orders for the AI-processor come in.",
      "CEO Jensen Huang, speaking Wednesday in the Chinese capital Beijing, was upbeat about the prospects for the H20 chip, which was designed to meet U.S. restrictions on technology exports to China but nonetheless blocked in April.",
      "He met U.S. President Donald Trump before his trip and his company announced this week it had received assurances that sales to China would be approved.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I changed his mind,\u201d Huang told a cluster of journalists, many of whom asked for his autograph or to take selfies with him.",
      "A carefully organized press conference at a luxury hotel descended into a crowd scene when Huang arrived in his trademark leather jacket and started taking questions randomly in his characteristic casual style.",
      "Export controls and tariffs were something companies must adapt to in a world he said was reconfiguring itself. He described his role as informing governments in the U.S. and elsewhere of the nature and unintended consequences of their policies.",
      "The decision to lift the ban on the H20 chip was entirely in the hands of the American and Chinese governments and whatever trade talks they had, he said.",
      "\u201cWe can only influence them, inform them, do our best to provide them with facts,\u201d Huang said. \u201cAnd then beyond that is out of our control.\u201d",
      "Nvidia said in April that sales restrictions on its chip in China on national security grounds would cost the company $5.5 billion. The White House also blocked a chip from Advanced Micro Devices. Both companies say the Commerce Department is now moving forward with license applications to export them to China.",
      "Huang said his company would likely be able to recover some of its losses but it's unclear how much. That will depend on how many H20 orders are received and how quickly Nvidia can meet the demand.",
      "\u201cI think that H20 is going to be very successful here,\u201d he said, noting the chip's memory bandwidth makes it a good fit for the AI models being developed by Chinese companies such as DeepSeek and Alibaba.",
      "Huang also touted the release of a new RTX Pro graphics chip that he said would power the development of humanoid robots. He described robotic systems with teams of robots working alongside people as the next wave in AI.",
      "\u201cBecause there\u2019s so much robotics innovation going on and so much smart factory work being done here and the supply chain is so vast, RTX Pro is perfect,\u201d he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Some dolphins in Australia have a special technique to flush fish from the seafloor. They hunt with a sponge on their beak, like a clown nose.",
      "Using the sponge to protect from sharp rocks, the dolphins swim with their beaks covered, shoveling through rubble at the bottom of sandy channels and stirring up barred sandperch for a meal.",
      "But this behavior \u2014 passed down through generations \u2014 is trickier than it looks, according to new research published Tuesday in the journal Royal Society Open Science.",
      "Hunting with a sponge on their face interferes with bottlenose dolphins\u2019 finely tuned sense of echolocation, of emitting sounds and listening for echoes to navigate.",
      "\u201cIt has a muffling effect in the way that a mask might,\u201d said co-author Ellen Rose Jacobs, a marine biologist at the University of Aarhus in Denmark. \u201cEverything looks a little bit weird, but you can still learn how to compensate.\"",
      "Jacobs used an underwater microphone to confirm that the \u201csponging\u201d dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia, were still using echolocation clicks to guide them. Then she modeled the extent of the sound wave distortion from the sponges.",
      "For those wild dolphins that have mastered foraging with nose sponges, scientists say it's a very efficient way to catch fish. The wild marine sponges vary from the size of a softball to a cantaloupe.",
      "Sponge hunting is \u201clike hunting when you\u2019re blindfolded \u2014 you\u2019ve got to be very good, very well-trained to pull it off,\" said Mauricio Cantor, a marine biologist at Oregon State University, who was not involved in the study.",
      "That difficulty may explain why it's rare \u2014 with only about 5% of the dolphin population studied by the researchers in Shark Bay doing it. That\u2019s about 30 dolphins total, said Jacobs.",
      "\u201cIt takes them many years to learn this special hunting skill \u2014 not everybody sticks with it,\u201d said marine ecologist Boris Worm at Dalhousie University in Canada, who was not involved in the study.",

    "summary": "On \"This Week,\" Mayor Karen Bass detailed the impacts of ICE raids on Los Angeles and the country.",
    "story": [
      "Bass said there are fewer people in previously busy areas of Los Angeles.",
      "As President Donald Trump marks six months into his second term, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told ABC News\u2019 \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz that the administration's immigration crackdown has not only sparked protests, but fear among the city's residents.",
      "\u201cLos Angeles is a city of immigrants -- 3.8 million people, and about 50% of our population is Latino. And so when the raids started, fear spread,\u201d Bass said.",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids started in Los Angeles early June, prompting demonstrations that at times turned violent. While Trump\u2019s deportation push was initially said to be centered around undocumented immigrants with criminal records, an ABC News analysis of new data shows that in recent weeks, the Trump administration has arrested an increasing number of migrants with no criminal convictions.",
      "Since then, farmers, business owners and immigrant advocacy groups have, like the mayor, said that many residents have been afraid to leave their homes for fear of deportation, affecting the workforce, food supply and the culture of the city. Bass said that the restaurant the interview took place in, located in the predominantly Latino Boyle Heights neighborhood of east Los Angeles, was typically bustling. But now, it \u2014 and the neighborhood overall \u2014 can feel like a ghost town.",
      "\u201cIt's not just the deportation. It's the fear that sets in when raids occur, when people are snatched off the street,\u201d Bass said. \"Even people who are here legally, even people who are U.S. Citizens, have been detained. Immigrants who have their papers and were showing up for their annual immigration appointment were detained when they showed up doing exactly what they were supposed to be doing.\"",
      "She criticized ICE for agents for executing enforcement operations without their affiliation being prominently displayed.",
      "\u201cMasked men in unmarked cars, no license plate, no real uniforms, jumping out of cars with rifles, and snatching people off the street, leading a lot of people to think maybe kidnappings were taking place,\" Bass said. \"How do you have masked men who then say, 'Well, we are federal officials,' with no identification?\u201d",
      "Raddatz noted that administration says those agents do that because \"there have been threats... [and] doxing.\"",
      "\"We have a Los Angeles police department that has to deal with crime in this city every single day. And they're not masked. They stay here,\" Bass said. \"The masked men parachute in, stay here for a while, and leave. And so you enter a profession like policing, like law enforcement? I'm sorry, I don't think you have a right to have a mask and snatch people off the street.\"",
      "Bass also touched on the continued presence of federal troops in the city. In response to those protests in early June, Trump deployed the National Guard and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles after protesters clashed with police. Some protestors threw rocks, fireworks and other objects at police, according to reports, before the arrival of federal troops.",
      "Trump signed a memorandum in June saying the National Guard was deployed to address lawlessness in Los Angeles. The California National Guard's 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team posted on X that its objective was to protect federal protesters and personnel.",
      "In her interview with ABC News, Bass denounced the violence as \u201cterrible,\u201d but said it did not \"warrant military intervention.\"",
      "\u201cIt did not warrant the Marines coming into our city with basically no real mission, but just to show a force,\u201d Bass said.",
      "While the number of National Guard members in the city has been cut roughly in half, Bass said that their objective has not changed since they first arrived \u2014 and argued they're presence is still not necessary.",
      "\u201cIf you drive by our two federal buildings, you will see them standing out there. But there's nothing going on in those federal buildings. So in my opinion, we are misusing taxpayers' dollars, and we are misusing our troops,\u201d she said.",
      "While she disagreed strongly with the Trump administration\u2019s immigration agenda, Bass said she appreciated the help the administration gave Los Angeles during the massive January wildfires.",
      "\u201cWell, I will heap praise on the administration for the first six months in Los Angeles with the fires. If you ask me, is there anything that they have done good in terms of immigration? I don't know. I don't think so,\u201d she said. \"I think that the viewpoint has been punitive, has been let's make it as miserable as possible so that these people don't come.\"",
      "Bass said that she is still willing to \u201cwork\u201d with the White House, noting both the Olympics and World Cup coming to the city over the next few years.",
      "\"How does this end?\" Raddatz asked. \"How do you see the next six months, the next two years for immigrants in your city?\"\u201cWell, I am just hoping that this reign of terror ends. I'm hoping that the military leaves, because they were never needed here to begin with. I'm hoping that we can get back to normal. I'm hoping that the next time I come to this restaurant, that it will be filled, because people won't be afraid to come here,\u201d Bass said.",

      "The driver, identified by police as 29-year-old Fernando Ramirez, was attacked by bystanders after the crash early Saturday in east Hollywood and paramedics later found that he had been shot.

He was on parole at the time of Saturday\u2019s crash, but it\u2019s unclear whether it was in connection with the 2019 attack or another case.",
      "Ramirez has had at least 11 criminal cases ranging from misdemeanors to felonies, KNBC reported. In January 2022, he was charged with felony domestic battery and entered a not guilty plea. That case remains open.",
      "A line of people \u2014 mostly women \u2014 were waiting to enter the Vermont Hollywood event venue around 2 a.m. when they were struck by a Nissan Versa that also hit a food vending cart and valet stand, Fire Capt. Adam VanGerpen said Saturday.",
      "At least 36 people were treated for injuries including fractures and lacerations, police said Sunday without providing updates on their conditions.",
      "It was not immediately clear if Ramirez was shot before or after the crash or why he drove into the crowd.",

      "A person of interest, identified as Miguel Mora, a 21-year-old undocumented immigrant with an extensive criminal past, was taken into custody after arriving at a Bronx hospital with gunshot wounds to the groin and leg, Tisch said. It was unknown if Mora had an attorney.",

      "SEATTLE -- After a Seattle immigration judge dismissed the deportation case against a Colombian man \u2014 exposing him to expedited removal \u2014 three people sat with him in the back of the courtroom, taking his car keys for safe-keeping, helping him memorize phone numbers and gathering the names of family members who needed to be notified.",
      "When Judge Brett Parchert asked why they were doing that in court, the volunteers said Immigration and Custom Enforcement officers were outside the door, waiting to take the man into custody, so this was their only chance to help him get his things in order. \"ICE is in the waiting room?\" the judge asked.",
      "As the mass deportation campaign of President Donald Trump focuses on cities and states led by Democrats and unleashes fear among asylum-seekers and immigrants, their legal defenders sued this week, seeking class-action protections against the arrests outside immigration court hearings.

      "The Northwest Immigrant Rights Project was inundated by so many community members wanting to help that they made a volunteer training video, created \u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d sheets in several languages and started a Google sheet where people sign up for shifts, said Stephanie Gai, a staff attorney with the Seattle-based legal services non-profit.",

      "Volunteers and legal aid groups have long provided free legal orientation in immigration court but the arrests have posed new challenges. Since May, the government has been asking judges to dismiss deportation cases.",
      "Once the judge agrees, ICE officials arrest them in the hallways and put them in fast-track deportation proceedings, no matter which legal immigration pathway they may have been pursuing. Once in custody, it's often harder to find or afford a lawyer. Immigration judges are executive branch employees, and while some have resisted Homeland Security lawyers' dismissal orders in some cases, many are granted.",
      "Masked ICE agents grabbed the Colombian man and led him into the hallway. A volunteer took his backpack to give to his family as he was taken away. Other cases on the day's docket involved immigrants who didn't show up. Parchert granted \u201cremoval in absentia\u201d orders, enabling ICE to arrest them later.",

Lander\u2019s wife, attorney Meg Barnette, had just joined him in walking migrants from a courtroom to the elevator.",

A judge had not dismissed the husband\u2019s case, giving him until October to find a lawyer. But that didn\u2019t stop ICE agents from handcuffing him and taking him away as soon as he stepped out of court. The news sparked an outcry by immigration advocates, city officials and a congressman. At a news conference, she gave only her first name and asked that her daughter\u2019s be withheld.",

      "Trump's timing, allies say, also reflects the far more disciplined approach by him and his political operation, which are determined for Republicans to gain seats in both the Senate and the House.",
      "Here's what's happening in some key Senate races:",
      "Democrats have long dreamed of winning statewide office in this ruby red state. Could a nasty GOP primary be their ticket?",
      "National Republicans and GOP Senate strategists are ringing alarm bells amid concerns that state Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is facing a bevy of personal and ethical questions, could prevail over Sen. John Cornyn for the nomination.",
      "They fear Paxton would be a disastrous general election candidate, forcing Republicans to invest tens of millions of dollars they believe would be better spent in other states.",
      "Texans for a Conservative Majority, a super political action committee supporting Cornyn, a onetime Trump critic, began airing television ads this past week promoting his support for Trump's package of tax breaks and spending cuts.",
      "Don't expect the upbeat tone from the pro-Cornyn super PAC to hold long. Paxton was acquitted after a Republican-led impeachment trial in 2023 over allegations of bribery and abuse of office, which also exposed an extramarital affair. His wife, Angela, filed for divorce on July 10, referring to \u201crecent discoveries\u201d in announcing her decision to end her marriage of 38 years \u201con biblical grounds.\u201d",
      "\u201cKen Paxton has embarrassed himself, his family, and we look forward to exposing just how bad he\u2019s embarrassed our state in the coming months,\" said Aaron Whitehead, the super PAC's executive director. Trump adviser Chris LaCivita, who comanaged Trump's 2024 campaign, is advising the group.",
      "But Cornyn has had a cool relationship with Trump over the years, while Paxton is a longtime Trump ally. And Paxton raised more than three times as much as Cornyn in the second quarter, $2.9 million compared with $804,000, according to Federal Elections Commission reports.",
      "Rep. Wesley Hunt is also weighing a run.",
      "Will Trump be persuaded to endorse or will he choose to steer clear?",
      "The surprise retirement announcement by two-term Sen. Thom Tillis has set off a frenzied search for a replacement in a state widely seen as Democrats\u2019 top pickup opportunity. He had repeatedly clashed with Trump, including over Medicaid changes in the tax cut bill, leading the president to threaten to back a primary challenger.",
      "All eyes are now on Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law, who is mulling whether to run in her home state as other potential candidates stand by.",
      "A familiar national Republican face as co-chair of the Republican National Committee during Trump's 2024 campaign, Lara Trump is now a Fox News Channel host. She also had been a visible surrogate during previous campaigns, often promoting her North Carolina roots and the fact that she named her daughter Carolina.",
      "Having a Trump on the ballot could boost a party that has struggled to motivate its most fervent base when Donald Trump is not running. But Lara Trump currently lives in Florida and has so far sounded muted on the prospect of a Senate run.",
      "Other potential contenders include RNC chair Michael Whatley, who led North Carolina\u2019s GOP before taking the national reins and is considered a strong fundraiser and Trump loyalist, and first-term Reps. Pat Harrigan and Brad Knott. While Lara Trump and Whatley are better known nationally, Harrigan is a West Point graduate and Knott is a former federal prosecutor.",
      "Democrats are waiting on a decision from former two-term Gov. Roy Cooper, who is seen as a formidable candidate by both parties in a state Trump carried by just 3.2 percentage points last year. Former Rep. Wiley Nickel has entered the race, but it\u2019s unclear what he would do if Cooper ran.",
      "Republicans see Georgia and the seat held by Democrat Jon Ossoff as one of their best pickup opportunities. But the party remains in search of a well-known challenger after failing to persuade term-limited Gov. Brian Kemp to run.",
      "A growing potential field includes Reps. Buddy Carter, Mike Collins and Rich McCormick, Insurance Commissioner John King and Derek Dooley, a former University of Tennessee football coach. The president is still meeting with possible candidates and is expected by many to wait to weigh in until his team has fully screened them and assessed their chances and after his budget priorities make their way through Congress.",
      "Ossoff took in more than $10 million in the second quarter of the year, according to federal filings, after raising $11 million from January through March. He ended June with more than $15.5 million cash on hand.",
      "That money will matter in what is sure to be an expensive general election. The Senate races in 2020, when Ossoff and Raphael Warnock narrowly won and flipped control to Democrats, cost more than $900 million combined.",
      "Republicans hope the retirement of Democratic Sen. Gary Peters and a crowded, expensive Democratic primary will help them capture a seat that has eluded them for more than three decades. Here, too, all eyes are on Trump.",
      "Republicans are rallying around former Rep. Mike Rogers, who came within 20,000 votes in 2024 against then-Rep. Elissa Slotkin and had Trump's endorsement. Rogers now appears to have momentum behind him, with the support of Thune, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and former Trump campaign veterans LaCivita and Tony Fabrizio.",
      "But other Republicans could complicate things. Rep. Bill Huizenga has said he is waiting for guidance from the president on whether he should run.",
      "\u201cWhen people are asking why haven\u2019t you announced or what are you going to do, it\u2019s like, look, I want to get the man\u2019s input, all right?\u201d Huizenga told reporters last month. A spokesperson for Huizenga added that the congressman has spoken to Trump on the phone multiple times and has yet to be told not to run.",
      "Still, White House officials have on more than one occasion encouraged Huizenga to stay in the House, according to one person familiar with the conversations who was not authorized to publicly discuss the private discussions and spoke only on condition of anonymity.",
      "Democrats have their own messy primary, with state Sen. Mallory McMorrow up against Rep. Haley Stevens, state Rep. Joe Tate, and former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed.",
      "They were pleased to see that, even without any declared challengers, Rogers\u2019 main campaign account raised just $745,000 during the second quarter, lagging Huizenga and several Democrats. (He brought in another nearly $779,000 through a separate joint fundraising committee.) McMorrow, by comparison, raised more than $2.1 million.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy has faced scrutiny from his party, in no small part for his 2021 vote to convict Trump after the president's second impeachment. Will Trump seek retribution against the two-term senator or ultimately back him?",
      "Though Cassidy already faces two primary challengers, Louisiana is a reliably Republican state, which Trump won last year by 22 percentage points. Democrats are hoping a strong contender \u2014 potentially former Gov. John Bel Edwards, who has attracted Republican votes in the past \u2014 might mount a competitive challenge.",
      "Republicans are awaiting word on whether Rep. Julia Letlow will run. In May, Gov. Jeff Landry and Trump privately discussed the two-term congresswoman entering the race.",
      "Letlow and Landry appeared together at a congressional fundraiser for her in Lafayette, outside her northeast Louisiana district, on June 30, fueling speculation about her plans.",
      "The governor\u2019s discussion with Trump of a new challenger to Cassidy reflects the Trump base's unease with Cassidy, not simply over the impeachment vote, but also Cassidy's concerns about installing Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the nation's health secretary. Cassidy ultimately backed Kennedy, a move some saw as an effort to ease tensions.",
      "Among Cassidy's Republican challengers so far are state Treasurer John Fleming and state Sen. Blake Miguez. Letlow, serving in the seat her husband held before he died of COVID-19, is considered a rising star in the Louisiana GOP.",
      "Two-term Republican Sen. Joni Ernst has not said whether she plans to seek a third term.",
      "Ernst would be expected to win in the state Trump carried by 13 percentage points last year. But she has come under some criticism from Iowa Republicans, including for saying she needed to hear more from Trump's pick for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, before committing to support his nomination amid allegations of sexual assault that Hegseth denied.",
      "The senator, a combat veteran and sexual assault survivor, eventually voted to confirm him.",
      "Though a final decision awaits, Ernst has named a 2026 campaign manager and has scheduled her annual Iowa fundraiser for October.",

      "The National Comedy Center has begun hosting regular \"Memory Cafes,\u201d inviting people with conditions like dementia and Alzheimer's through the western New York museum to share laughs and connection",
      "JAMESTOWN, N.Y. -- Side by side on a sofa inside the National Comedy Center, Gail and Mario Cirasunda chuckled at a clip from the 1980s sitcom \u201cFamily Ties\u201d that was playing on a TV screen. The show\u2019s oldest daughter, Mallory, was introducing her unconventional artist boyfriend Nick to her bewildered television family.",
      "\u201cI think our daughter brought him home once. Maybe two of our daughters!\u201d Gail said with a laugh over coffee and donuts later.",
      "\u201cFive daughters, two sons,\u201d her husband Mario, 85, chimed in. \u201cSometimes I\u2019d wonder,\u201d he smiled, shaking his head at the memories of the couple's own family antics over their 59-year marriage.",
      "Moments like this are what brought the Cirasundas to the comedy museum in western New York and the memory cafe taking place inside. The monthly events invite people with Alzheimer\u2019s, dementia, or other memory loss, and their caregivers, to spend time at the interactive museum. For visitors like Mario, who has dementia, and his wife, the scenes and artifacts from funny shows and comedians have a way of triggering shared laughs and connection, and, as comedy center staff have found, memories.",
      "Gail, 78, treasures the moments when Mario \u2014 who still vividly recalls his childhood route to school and the names of old friends \u2014 also recollects experiences from their shared life. A 1965 blind date after Mario got out of the Navy led to seven children, 24 grandchildren, eight great-grandchildren, careers and moves. However, memories made over a lifetime together have become increasingly elusive over the past several years, since about the time Mario started to get lost driving and forget whether he likes a particular food.",
      "At a recent memory cafe, the Cirasundas, from suburban Buffalo, and others spent the morning walking through the museum that was inspired by \u201cI Love Lucy\u201d star Lucille Ball in her hometown of Jamestown.",
      "Gail kept a guiding hand on her husband's elbow as they smiled through Johnny Carson bits from \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d in the center's late night studio, browsed standup comic George Carlin's personal notes and comedian Bob Hope artifacts, and laughed out loud at a display of classic comedy props like the banana peel and pie in the face.",
      "During a break in the museum's restaurant, the \u201cFamily Ties\u201d video evoked scenes from real life.",
      "\u201cThe moments are precious because he might not remember it,\u201d Gail explained, \u201cbut when you\u2019re there talking about it, you\u2019re remembering. Five minutes later, it\u2019s gone \u2014 but you had that moment.\u201d",
      "The Alzheimer\u2019s Association estimates 7.2 million Americans over the age of 65 are living with Alzheimer\u2019s dementia, and an even higher number of people care for an impacted friend or family member.",
      "Memory cafes have emerged around the world in recent years as a way to connect and support individuals and caregivers, and provide information and resources. Many of the more than 600 cafes regularly running in the U.S. \u2014 often meeting in libraries and community centers \u2014 bring in speakers and engage participants with physical activity, music and art, all of which are good for the brain, experts say.",
      "The National Comedy Center held its first one earlier this year. It seemed a natural fit after staff heard from patrons about the museum's impact on their loved ones.",
      "Spokesman Gary Hahn sees the center as a kind of time machine, with exhibits memorializing comedy from Vaudeville to viral memes that can transport visitors back, no matter their age. Even before the formal memory cafes began, a visitor told the center's staff that his wife with dementia seldom spoke \u2014 but would become more verbal while walking through the museum and laughing alongside him.",
      "\u201cThere was a stimulation of the part of the brain, whether it\u2019s because of the nostalgia or the comedy, that had an impact on her,\u201d said Journey Gunderson, the center's executive director.",
      "Shelia Kennison, an author and psychology professor at Oklahoma State University, said humor positively affects physiology in many ways.",
      "\u201cIt takes most of your brain to process what\u2019s being said or being shown to you and then to find the humor, and then once that happens, it sets off this cascade of brain activity and physiological changes that affects the whole body,\" said Kennison, who studies how humor is involved in cognition, memory and overall wellbeing. \"So it really is a whole brain workout and a whole body workout when you get that really funny joke that makes you laugh and slap your knee and rock back and forth.\u201d",
      "Laughter has always been important to Gail and Mario Cirasunda, whose children often gave their father Peter Sellers' \u201cPink Panther\u201d movies as gifts so they could see him laugh.",
      "\u201cKeep a sense of humor in your marriage,\u201d Gail's boss told her before she got married. Even through the challenges, she said, she's followed the advice.",

      "KERRVILLE, Texas -- Officials in a Texas hill country community pummeled by deadly flooding July 4 said Saturday that just three people remain missing, down from nearly 100, after people who had previously been reported missing have since been accounted for.",
      "The reduction in the number of people on the missing list came as the search for victims entered its third week. It was a significant drop from the more than 160 people officials previously said were unaccounted for in Kerr County alone.",
      "\u201cThis remarkable progress reflects countless hours of coordinated search and rescue operations, careful investigative work, and an unwavering commitment to bringing clarity and hope to families during an unimaginably difficult time,\u201d Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice in a statement.",
      "The death toll in Kerr County, 107, held steady for much of this week even as the intensive search continued.",
      "The Flash floods killed at least 135 people in Texas over the holiday weekend, with most deaths along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio.",
      "Just before daybreak on July 4, the destructive, fast-moving waters rose 26 feet (8 meters) on the Guadalupe, washing away homes and vehicles.",
      "The floods laid waste to the Hill Country, a popular tourist destination where campers seek out spots along the river amid the rolling landscape. It is naturally prone to flash flooding because its dry, dirt-packed soil cannot soak up heavy rain.",
      "Vacation cabins, youth camps campgrounds fill the riverbanks and hills of Kerr County, including Camp Mystic, a century-old Christian summer camp for girls. Located in a low-lying area of a region known as \u201cflash flood alley,\u201d Camp Mystic lost at least 27 campers and counselors.",
      "The flooding was far more severe than the 100-year event envisioned by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, experts said, and it moved so quickly in the middle of the night that it caught many off guard in a county that lacked a warning system.",
      "In Kerrville, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of Austin, local officials have come under scrutiny over whether residents were adequately warned about the rising waters.",
      "President Donald Trump and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott have pushed back aggressively against questions about how well local authorities responded to forecasts of heavy rain and the first reports of flash flooding.",
      "Crews have been searching for victims using helicopters, boats and drones. Earlier efforts were hampered by rain forecasts, leading some crews to hold off or stop because of worries about more flooding.",

      "GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. -- Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs toured the destruction left by a wildfire along the Grand Canyon's North Rim, on Saturday, surveying what she described as devastating damage.",
      "The governor, who has called for an investigation into how the blaze was handled, sought to gather information ahead of meetings with federal officials next week, looked intently out the window as the Black Hawk helicopter she was riding snaked over the Grand Canyon.",
      "White smoke emerged from the North Rim, and most of the Grand Canyon Lodge was reduced to a bare skeleton, though some of the building appeared intact from overhead. Some surrounding trees were no more than charred toothpicks on the ashen land, and whiffs of smoky air passed through the helicopter.",
      "The wildfire was sparked by a lightning strike July 4. Four days later the National Park Service said it was being allowed to burn as part of a \u201cconfine and contain\u201d strategy that the Grand Canyon National Park has leaned on for decades to clear dense vegetation, minimize future risk and make the ecosystem more resilient.",
      "But a week after ignition, blustery winds, hot temperatures and lower humidity quickly intensified the flames, prompting officials to shift to aggressive suppression and order evacuations. The blaze has charred more than 18 square miles (46 square kilometers), and as of Saturday it was 8% contained, according to fire information officer Stefan La-Sky.",
      "No injuries have been reported, but the Dragon Bravo fire on the canyon\u2019s less-frequented North Rim destroyed more than 70 structures, including a visitors' center, historic cabins and the nearly century-old Grand Canyon Lodge.",
      "After touching ground, Hobbs visited the incident command post. Lined with trailers and dotted with yurts and tents, the fire camp currently houses more than 800 personnel who have come from various federal, state and local entities and independent contractors to help fire suppression efforts. The camp functions similar to a tiny town.",
      "The governor shook hands with members of the crew in the mess hall and met with officials including those from Grand Canyon National Park, the Department of Interior and the National Park Service as well as the incident commander. She said she was encouraged to hear that mitigation is a priority for the federal government.",
      "\u201cThis is federal jurisdiction, but fire doesn\u2019t know that boundary, and we all have to work together,\u201d Hobbs said.",
      "The governor has called for an investigation into why the park service did not immediately put out the flames during the hottest and driest period of summer. Members of the state's congressional delegation also have raised questions.",
      "Hobbs said she is not second-guessing the initial response. She said after the fire is managed, she is seeking answers to what went into the decision-making and whether there were missteps.",
      "The park service has defended its actions.",
      "Hobbs is set to meet this week with leadership in the U.S. Forest Service and the U.S. Department of the Interior about their decisions in managing the wildfire this upcoming week.",
      "She said in a video statement Wednesday that she has not seen any indication that a lack of federal resources are to blame for the spread of the blaze.",

      "The Trump administration has imposed new restrictions on flights from Mexico and threatened to end a longstanding partnership between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico",
      "The Trump administration imposed new restrictions Saturday on flights from Mexico and threatened to end a longstanding partnership between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico in response to limits the Mexican government placed on passenger and cargo flights into Mexico City several years ago.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Mexico's actions to force airlines to move out of the main Benito Juarez International Airport to the newer Felipe Angeles International Airport more than 30 miles (48.28 kilometers) away violated a trade agreement between the two countries and gave domestic airlines an unfair advantage. Mexico is the top foreign destination for Americans with more than 40 million passengers flying there last year.",
      "\"Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg deliberately allowed Mexico to break our bilateral aviation agreement,\u201d Duffy said, referring to the previous president and his transportation secretary. \u201cThat ends today. Let these actions serve as a warning to any country who thinks it can take advantage of the U.S., our carriers, and our market. America First means fighting for the fundamental principle of fairness.\u201d",
      "All Mexican passenger, cargo and charter airlines will now be required to submit their schedules to the Transportation Department and seek government approval of their flights until Duffy is satisfied with the way Mexico is treating U.S. airlines.",
      "It's not immediately clear how Duffy's actions might affect the broader trade war with Mexico and negotiations over tariffs. A spokesperson for Mexico\u2019s President Claudia Sheinbaum didn\u2019t reply immediately to a request for comment. Sheinbaum didn\u2019t mention the new restrictions during either of her two speaking events on Saturday.",
      "Delta and Aeromexico have been fighting the Transportation Department's efforts to end their partnership that began in 2016 since early last year. The airlines have argued that it's not fair to punish them for the Mexican government's actions, and they said ending their agreement would jeopardize nearly two dozen routes and $800 million in benefits to both countries' economies that come from tourism spending and jobs.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s tentative proposal to terminate its approval of the strategic and pro-competitive partnership between Delta and Aeromexico would cause significant harm to consumers traveling between the U.S. and Mexico, as well as U.S. jobs, communities, and transborder competition,\" Delta said in a statement.",
      "Aeromexico\u2019s press office said it was reviewing the order and intended to present a joint response with Delta in the coming days.",
      "But the order terminating approval of the agreement between the airlines wouldn't take effect until October, and the airlines are likely to continue fighting that decision.",
      "The airlines said in a previous filing fighting the order that it believes the loss of direct flights would prompt over 140,000 American tourists and nearly 90,000 Mexican tourists not to visit the other country and hurt the economies of both countries with the loss of their spending.",

      "BEAVERTON, Ore. -- Parents at a preschool in a Portland suburb are reeling after immigration officers arrested a father in front of the school during morning drop-off hours, breaking his car window to detain him in front of children, families and staffers.",
      "\u201cI feel like a day care, which is where young children are taken care of, should be a safe place,\u201d Natalie Berning said after dropping off her daughter at the Montessori in Beaverton on Friday morning. \u201cNot only is it traumatizing for the family, it\u2019s traumatizing for all the other children as well.\u201d",
      "Mahdi Khanbabazadeh, a 38-year-old chiropractor and citizen of Iran, was initially pulled over by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, while driving his child to the school Tuesday. After asking if he could drop off the child first, he continued driving and called his wife to tell her what happened, according to his wife, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to privacy concerns for her and her young child.",
      "His wife rushed to the school, took their child from his car and brought him inside. Khanbabazadeh stayed in the vehicle in the parking lot and asked if he could move somewhere not on school grounds out of consideration for the children and families, his wife said. He pulled out of the lot and onto the street and began to open the car door to step out when agents broke the window and took him into custody, according to his wife.",
      "Kellie Burns, who has two children attending the preschool, said her husband was there and heard the glass shatter.",
      "\u201cMore than anything we want to express how unnecessarily violent and inhumane this was,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone felt helpless. Everyone was scared.\u201d",
      "ICE said it detained Khanbabazadeh because he overstayed his visa, which his wife disputes.",
      "\u201cOfficers attempted to arrest Khanbabazadeh during a traffic stop when he requested permission to drop his child off at daycare,\u201d ICE said in a statement. \u201cOfficers allowed him to proceed to the daycare parking lot where he stopped cooperating, resisted arrest and refused to exit his vehicle, resulting in ICE officers making entry by breaking one of the windows to complete the arrest.\u201d",
      "Immigration officials have dramatically ramped up arrests across the country since May. Shortly after President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration lifted restrictions on making immigration arrests at schools, health care facilities and places of worship, stirring fears about going to places once considered safe spaces.",
      "After U.S. military strikes on Iran in June, officials trumpeted immigration arrests of Iranians, some of whom settled in the United States long ago.",
      "Khanbabazadeh's wife said he has always maintained lawful status. After he arrived on a valid student visa and they subsequently married, she said, they submitted all required paperwork to adjust his status and were waiting for a final decision following their green card interview months ago.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Moving at the \u201cspeed of Trump\u201d is one of the White House's favorite phrases, meant to convey the administration's attempts to bring big changes to government at breakneck speed. But when it comes to presidential travel, Donald Trump's pace in the opening months of his second term is comparable to Joe Biden's.",
      "At his six-month mark in office through Saturday, Trump had made 49 trips to 14 states and seven foreign countries, with a heavy focus on weekend golf trips and sporting events.",
      "That's not far off from Biden, who made 45 trips to 17 states and three foreign countries in his first six months in 2021, which overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic. The Democrat made lots of weekend trips home to Delaware, where he went to church and usually did not golf. He also had more political and official trips than did his Republican successor.",
      "Trump\u2019s second-term travel is also less prolific than his first so far, at least in terms of visiting different parts of the United States. In 2017, he made 48 trips to 21 states and eight foreign countries between Jan. 20 and July 20.",
      "The White House has said Trump is most effective while in the Oval Office, working the phones, signing executive orders and meeting with foreign leaders and U.S. elected officials.",
      "It says Trump has met with 25 foreign leaders at the White House, including multiple visits by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, and signed 165 executive orders while holding six Cabinet meetings \u2014 totals that far outpace Biden's.",
      "White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement that Trump\u2019s \u201ctravel reflects his America First agenda -\u2013 he is meeting the American people where they are and representing their best interests.\u201d",
      "The president, Rogers said, \u201cwill continue working around the clock to deliver the best deals for the American people from the Oval Office, throughout the country, and around the world.\u201d",
      "A look at where Trump has gone so far:",
      "When Trump hits the road, it's most often to his properties for weekend trips built around golf in Palm Beach, Florida; Bedminster, New Jersey; or Sterling, Virginia, near Washington's Dulles International Airport and close enough to motorcade from the White House.",
      "The president has logged 14 Florida trips, 13 to Virginia and eight to New Jersey. After summer arrived, he has favored Bedminster or day trips to Sterling over steamy Mar-a-Lago in Florida.",
      "Biden headed to his home in Wilmington, Delaware, many weekends early in his term. He sometimes went to a golf club, but attended Mass nearly every weekend.",
      "Biden also traveled often to showcase policy achievements or to promote his initiatives, such as his visit to Smith Flooring in Chester, Pennsylvania, a small business he described as benefiting from the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package.",
      "Much of Trump's non-golf domestic travel has been built around sporting events. The president went to the Super Bowl in New Orleans and to Florida for the Daytona 500. He attended UFC fights in Miami and Newark, New Jersey, the NCAA wrestling championships in Philadelphia and the FIFA Club World Cup final in East Rutherford, New Jersey.",
      "Trump has held only three major political rallies since returning to the White House.",
      "He marked his first 100 days in office in suburban Detroit, went to Pittsburgh to trumpet an agreement between U.S. Steel and Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel and to Des Moines, Iowa, to kick off the start of America's 250th birthday celebration. The president gave an economy-focused speech at a Las Vegas casino during his second term's opening weekend, and was in to Oxon Hill, Maryland, just outside Washington, to address the Conservative Political Action Conference in February.",
      "In addition to policy-focused travel, Biden did more early political trips. He participated in a CNN town hall in Wisconsin, marked the 11th anniversary of the Obama administration's signature health care law in Columbus, Ohio, and spotlighted his first 100 days in office by addressing a socially distanced, drive-in rally in Atlanta.",
      "Trump gave more commencement addresses, speaking at the University of Alabama and the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, New York. Biden spoke at the Coast Guard commencement in Connecticut in his opening months of his term, when COVID-19 limited many such ceremonies.",
      "One area where Trump has outpaced Biden is on travel overseas. He was to Rome for Pope Francis' funeral and had a swing through Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, before going to Canada for the meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations and a NATO summit in the Netherlands.",
      "Biden did not travel overseas in 2021 until the G7 that June, when he went to the United Kingdom, Belgium and Switzerland, again at a time when the pandemic was raging.",
      "Trump's second term started out with visits to western North Carolina and Southern California, both hit by natural disasters that occurred while Biden was president. Trump also visited Texas after recent devastating floods.",
      "But Trump did not tour parts of Missouri and Kentucky that were ravaged by tornadoes. He did not travel to areas hit by strong storms that sparked deadly flooding from other parts of Texas and Oklahoma to Indiana and Pennsylvania. He did not see the widespread aftermath of spring tornadoes, including in Mississippi and Arkansas.",
      "Biden made a February 2021 trip to tour storm damage in Houston. He did not travel to all natural disaster sites during his first six months, either, but went to Florida after a building collapse in Surfside killed 98 people.",
      "When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu became the first foreign leader to visit the White House during Trump's second term in early February, the president proclaimed, \u201cI love Israel. I will visit there. And I\u2019ll visit Gaza.\u201d His Middle East swing in May omitted both places.",
      "Trump also suggested that his government-slashing guru Elon Musk would be checking out Fort Knox in Kentucky to ensure that U.S. gold reserves were still there, and the president said he might join him. With Musk having left the Trump administration and engaging in a nasty public feud with Trump, that now seems highly unlikely.",
      "The president said recently he would like to visit Africa \u201cat some point.\" He was less committal about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's invitation to visit a September summit of countries known as the Quad, made up of the U.S., India, Japan and Australia.",
      "Trump is heading to Scotland next week and will visit two areas where he has golf properties. He will be in England for an official visit in the fall. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, while at the White House in February, presented Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting the president to his country for an unprecedented second state visit.",
      "\u201cThis has never happened before,\u201d Starmer said. Trump accepted the invitation right then.",

      "Whether or not an agency has such a unit would likely depend on the size of the department and its location.",
      "There are thousands of police departments in the U.S., and the majority of them are under 50 people, according to Lomax. Smaller departments might not have sufficient personnel, money or equipment to have their own explosives team.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, depending on location, they may use the county sheriff\u2019s department in certain locations or the state police in other locations,\u201d Lomax said.",
      "The team from the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department would likely be deployed to smaller cities in the county to help with such incidents as suspicious packages or even to educate the community about what to look out for.",
      "A certified bomb technician would need to have a certification from the FBI, most likely from its Hazardous Devices School in Huntsville, Alabama, Lomax said.",
      "That training includes threat assessment and puts participants in \u201ctrue-to-life training settings,\u201d according to a video on the FBI's website.",
      "For advanced training, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has a national center at the same location, according to Lomax. There is also regional training.",
      "\u201cIt's very dangerous, and therefore it demands higher, more advanced training, more advanced equipment,\" Lomax said.",
      "For arson investigations, officials may go to the National Fire Academy in Maryland or participate in fire investigations training through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to Lomax. There are also local academies that offer more basic arson investigation courses.",
      "The people on these teams likely were already officers, troopers or deputies and then later took the specialized training, Lomax said.",
      "Explosives training involving actual explosive devices can be very dangerous because there can be many unknowns, according to Lomax.",
      "Everything from the amount of moisture in the air that day to how long the material has been on the shelf could impact an exercise.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many different variables that make that type of training extremely, extremely dangerous and hazardous,\u201d Lomax said.",
      "He referenced a 2022 incident in which five bomb technicians were injured by the detonation of an explosive device during a training exercise in Pennsylvania conducted by the FBI\u2019s Philadelphia field office.",
      "And in 2021, there was a catastrophic explosion in Los Angeles as homemade fireworks were being destroyed by a bomb squad. It injured 17 people and damaged dozens of homes, businesses and vehicles.",

    "story": [
      "Authorities are investigating a Southern California couple after their infant child was taken to a hospital with a traumatic head injury and 21 children were discovered in their custody",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A woman who almost served as a surrogate for a Southern California couple now under investigation by authorities said she backed out after the couple asked her if any of her friends would like to carry a child for them too.",
      "The request as well as conflicting information she was getting left the woman, Esperanza, unnerved and she decided not to sign a surrogacy contract with Silvia Zhang, who offered her $60,000. Esperanza spoke to The Associated Press on the condition that her last name not be used because she has not shared her surrogacy experience publicly.",
      "Zhang, 38, and her husband, Guojun Xuan, 65, are now the target of an investigation by local and federal authorities after their infant child was taken to the hospital with a traumatic head injury in May. Authorities have since taken 21 children from the couple's custody, many of whom were born by surrogate, said Lt. Kollin Cieadlo of the Arcadia Police Department, near Los Angeles.",
      "Surrogacy is an agreement between parties for a woman to become pregnant, typically through an embryo transfer, and deliver a baby for the intended person or couple to raise.",
      "The children range in age from 2 months to 13 years, with most between 1 and 3.",
      "Esperanza is one of at least eight women who say they were aggressively pursued by the couple to serve as surrogates. The women, many of whom were first-time surrogates, say they were given misleading or incomplete information about the couple's family situation and intentions. Some, like Esperanza, did not move forward with carrying a child for the couple. Another who did, Kayla Elliott, is now trying to get custody of a baby she birthed in March for the couple.",
      "Arcadia police say the FBI is involved in the investigation over whether the couple misled surrogates around the country. The FBI has not confirmed its investigation. Elliott said she was interviewed by the FBI at the end of May.",
      "Elliott worked through a business called Mark Surrogacy, according to the contract she signed and shared with the AP. California state records show a company called Mark Surrogacy Investments LLC registered at the company's Arcadia home until this June. Elliot's contract listed an El Monte address for the company. An AP reporter visited that location Thursday and did not find anyone who recognized the names of the couple or Mark Surrogacy.",
      "Zhang did not respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment. Lawyers for Mark Surrogacy did not respond to emails seeking comment, nor did a fertility clinic involved in the embryo transfer.",
      "In social media posts, other women who say they served as surrogates for Zhang and Xuan outlined suspicious actions including the couple not fulfilling payment obligations and weren't present for the children's births. Many women contacted by the AP did not respond or said they would only speak after securing an attorney.",
      "Zhang and Xuan were arrested in May after a hospital reported that their 2-month-old infant had a traumatic head injury, the result of a nanny at the home violently shaking the baby, according to Arcadia police.",
      "Arcadia police did not file charges at the time, in order to finish a full investigation, Cieadlo said, and detectives were looking into possible child abuse charges and anticipated presenting a case in a few weeks.",
      "The couple told police that they \u201cwanted a large family\" and produced what appeared to be legitimate birth certificates, including some from outside California, that list Zhang as the mother of the children, Cieadlo said. Xuan was listed as the father on at least some of the birth certificates, Cieadlo said.",
      "Esperanza's dealings with Zhang began in 2023. She had posted in a Facebook group for people interested in surrogacy and received a message from Zhang.",
      "Zhang said she and her partner already had an 8-year-old daughter in China but were having fertility issues. Zhang said she was working with a surrogate who was already pregnant but that she wanted \u201ctwins,\" so she was pursuing a second surrogate. But Esperanza said things started to feel amiss after Zhang asked if she had any friends who also wanted to be surrogates.",
      "\u201cShe said that she\u2019s a realtor in Arcadia and that\u2019s how she has a lot of money and was able to afford a lot of surrogates at the time,\u201d Esperanza said.",
      "Esperanza backed out of the surrogacy after the lawyer for the couple abruptly hung up on her while discussing the contract. She said the document said the couple would implant two embryos instead of one and the section requiring background information on the couple was cut out. The couple became angry when she decided not to move forward.",
      "Esperanza showed text messages to the AP that showed Zhang offering $3,000 more if she agreed to keep going, and another $2,000 bonus after a fetal heartbeat is detected.",
      "Elliott gave birth to a baby girl in March. She chose to be a surrogate because she \u201creally wanted to give somebody a family.\u201d",
      "The Texas woman began the process when Mark Surrogacy reached out to her directly on Facebook. She signed a contract listing Xuan and Zhang as the intended parents. The contract said Elliott would receive $65,000 in a series of payments by the end of her 16th gestational week.",
      "Elliott became wary when early in the pregnancy she flew to California to meet the couple and only Xuan showed up. As the process went on, Elliott had almost no direct contact with the Xuan and Zhang, which is uncommon in surrogacy. Most of the messaging was through texts and emails with representatives from the agency, who discouraged her from reaching out to Zhang.",
      "\u201cThe agency was always like, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re very busy people,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "When she learned that the couple had at least two other surrogates having babies for them, she was told by the agency \u201cthey just want a big family.\"",
      "Elliott flew to California for the embryo transfer, which was done at Western Fertility Institute in Los Angeles. The clinic declined to comment on the investigation.",
      "Neither parent were there for Elliott's labor or delivery, and only Zhang showed up a few hours after the baby was born. The woman \u201cdidn\u2019t seem very connected with the child ... she kind of barely looked at her,\" Elliott said.",
      "After handing Elliott $2,000 in cash and giving three of her family members in the room $200 each, the woman left with the baby girl.",
      "Now, Elliott wants custody of the girl and says she just hopes all the babies are safe. When the news first broke about the couple, she confronted Zhang on the phone and over text.",
      "In text messages Elliott showed to the AP, Zhang wrote: \u201cAll the babies really important in our life.\u201d",

      "The search for victims of deadly flooding in Texas Hill Country is headed into its third week as officials try to pin down exactly how many people remain missing",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- The search for victims of deadly flooding in Texas Hill Country is headed into its third week as officials try to pin down exactly how many people remain missing and lawmakers prepare to discuss authorities' initial response and providing better warning systems.",
      "Flash floods killed at least 135 people in Texas over the Fourth of July holiday weekend, with most deaths along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) northwest of San Antonio. The Hill Country is naturally prone to flash flooding because its dry, dirt-packed soil cannot soak up heavy rain.",
      "The Texas Legislature is scheduled to convene Monday for a special session. Gov. Greg Abbott initially called lawmakers back to the Texas State Capitol in Austin for other reasons, but he and legislative leaders have added flooding-related issues to the agenda.",
      "State officials had been saying about 160 people were unaccounted for after the flooding in Kerr County alone, but they now say about 100 remain missing in Kerr and other counties.",
      "Kerr County officials said the number of missing people decreased as victims were recovered, contact was made with people who were found safe, and some reports were found to be unsubstantiated or falsified. Also, they said, the missing list fluctuates as reports come into a hotline.",
      "The floods laid waste to the Hill Country. Vacation cabins, youth camps campgrounds fill the riverbanks and hills of Kerr County, and Camp Mystic, a century-old Christian summer camp for girls in a low-lying area along the Guadalupe. At least 27 of its campers and counselors died.",
      "Abbott called the special session hoping legislators would pass a measure to regulate a booming business in THC products after he vetoed a bill that would have banned them. And since the flooding, President Donald Trump has told the Republicans who control state government to redraw congressional districts to help the GOP's chances of retaining a U.S. House majority in next year's midterm elections.",
      "Abbott said lawmakers would also review authorities' handling of the flooding and consider improving warning systems for Hill Country residents. Kerr County does not have a warning system because state and local agencies missed opportunities over the past decade to finance one.",
      "Trump and Abbott have pushed back aggressively against questions about how well local authorities responded to forecasts of heavy rain and the first reports of flash flooding. The president called a reporter \u201cevil\u201d for raising such issues and said he thought \u201ceveryone did an incredible job under the circumstances.\u201d Abbott dismissed a question about who was to blame for the deaths as \u201cthe word choice of losers\u201d and used an analogy that began: \u201cEvery football team makes mistakes.\u201d",
      "\"The way winners talk is not to point fingers,\u201d he concluded.",
      "Abbott has designated bills dealing with early warning systems and emergency communications as priorities for the Legislature's special session, scheduled to last 30 days.",
      "The House and Senate have formed special committees on flooding and disaster preparedness, and they're planning a July 31 visit to Kerrville, the seat of hardest-hit Kerr County, to hear comments from residents.",
      "The committees are scheduled to begin with a joint hearing Wednesday to consider the state's response to the fatal floods; planning for floods; infrastructure for managing floods; and communications among first responders.",
      "One bill already introduced by Republican Rep. Don McLaughlin would require the state's top public health official to set building standards for youth camps in 100-year floodplains \u2014 which FEMA defines as a high-risk area with a 1% chance of flooding in any given year.",
      "During a recent news conference, Republican state Rep. Drew Darby, a member of the House's committee, said lawmakers cannot bring back flood victims or undo the flooding.",
      "\u201cBut what we can do is learn from it,\" he said.",

    "summary": "He opened such popular NYC institutions as The Odeon, Balthazar and Pastis. But a 2016 stroke, which caused immobility and affected his speech, led to a suicide attempt two years later. He has now penned an irreverent memoir, \"I Regret Almost Everything.\"",
    "story": [
      "Restaurateur Keith McNally hates New Year's Eve \u2013 he doesn't like being told to have a good time. \"I don't like to be forced to enjoy myself,\" he said.",
      "The \"least hospitable man in hospitality,\" as he calls himself, is not a big smiler, either. \"Inside,\" he explained.",
      "It doesn't seem to have hurt. Over 40 years, he's opened some of New York City's most popular restaurants, among them The Odeon, Balthazar, and Pastis \u2013 institutions almost as well-known as some of the bold-face names that frequent them. But McNally himself has never been much of a publicity hound, even less so after suffering a stroke in 2016. \"Naturally I'm a bit embarrassed to be on TV talking like this\u2014who wouldn't be?\" he said. \"But it's good for me to do it, because it gets me free of my embarrassment. Actually, I'm embarrassed talking about embarrassment!\"",
      "But the British-born McNally has largely overcome his embarrassment in a new memoir, \"I Regret Almost Everything.\" \u00a0\"The drawback for me with most memoirs [is], if you're not embarrassed by what you write, you've probably not spoken the truth,\" he said. \"If you don't cringe over every word, it's not the truth.\"",
      "The hardest part to write, he said, was about his suicide attempt, \"because my kids. I didn't want to leave them at all.\"",
      "That suicide attempt was two years after his stroke. He was found by his younger son, George. \"He was supposed to not find me,\" McNally said. \"Like most teenagers he would sleep until noon. But that day he woke up early, at 8:00 o'clock.\"",
      "\"You expected him to be sleeping later, he woke up early, he saw you?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, the bastard just woke up early and saved my life!\" he laughed.",
      "McNally might joke about it now, but the father of five was suffering with an immobile right arm (he was right-handed), back pain, and aphasia (which causes his slurred speech), and his second marriage was falling apart. But as he writes, some sobering words from a doctor made him reflect: \"He said that children who lose a parent to suicide were far more likely to kill themselves than the children of parents who don't. That stopped me in my tracks.\"",
      "Because he had such trouble communicating verbally after his stroke, McNally began using social media. \"I was so embarrassed by my speech and the way I looked, I didn't go to my restaurants for one year,\" he said. \"I was ashamed. But eventually I realized, nothing to be ashamed about. So, not only did I admit it wasn't a bad thing, but I went in on Instagram.\"",
      "McNally went viral in 2022 with a post criticizing former late-night host James Corden for allegedly being rude to the waitstaff at Balthazar. But now, McNally confesses in his book he isn't so sure calling out Corden was fair. He wrote: \"For someone who's hyperconscious of humiliation since suffering a stroke, it now seems monstrous that I didn't consider the humiliation I was subjecting Corden to. I felt like I'd hit the jackpot of a slot machine and thousands of gold coins were spilling out in front of me. That night I ended up with over 90,000 followers. I was intoxicated with self-righteousness.\"",
      "\"Uh-huh, it's true,\" McNally said. \"But afterwards, I felt really bad.\"",
      "Corden later apologized. But the 73-year-old McNally has continued creating a stir online. Take this recent post he wrote about his friend, ABC News' Diane Sawyer, describing a weeklong affair the two had in the 1970s. The story made news \u2026 except that it was completely made up.",
      "I said, \"Some people say, 'Listen, Keith, you know, it's really not cool for you to be sharing this.' And so, did you enjoy that back-and-forth with them?\"",
      "\"Yes. Yeah, I'm afraid, I did, yeah,\" he laughed.",
      "\"And I wonder, do you think that the stroke \u2013 I don't know, is that, does that \u2026\"",
      "\"Say what you think,\" said McNally.",
      "\"Well, is it that you feel a little trapped inside of yourself?\"",
      "\"No,\" he replied. \"I've always been a little like this inside. But since my stroke, and now on the outside.\"",
      "McNally grew up in the East End of London, one of four children born to Jack, a dockworker, and Joyce, a house and office cleaner. The family had little money. \"I got angry inside at my parents,\" he said, \"because we had no books in the house, no pictures on the walls. But they couldn't help it. They were working class who grew up with nothing.\"",
      "McNally says he didn't eat in a restaurant until he was 17. \"Most of the time, when we were on a holiday, we would go to the restaurant, they would look the prices outside, and then she'd go, 'Not for us.'\"",
      "And yet, when McNally moved to New York City in 1975 as an aspiring filmmaker, he made ends meet by working in restaurants. \"I didn't eat asparagus until I came here,\" he said. \"And the next day, I went to the doctor because the smell of my \u2026\"",
      "\"That was so pungent from eating the asparagus?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, I thought I was sick! So, I went to the doctor. He said, 'What'd you eat last night?'\" McNally laughed.",
      "\"You know what? You gotta put that in the paperback,\" I said.",
      "In 1980, McNally opened his own restaurant, The Odeon, in the neighborhood of Tribeca, in what had been a no-man's land. An immediate sensation, it established certain McNally \"musts,\" such as the importance of having a hamburger on the menu. \"I don't like hamburgers much myself,\" he said. \"But it's a sign of snobbery not to have a hamburgers.\"",
      "McNally prides himself on putting his staff above even his diners. Some of his employees have been with him for over 30 years. And ever since returning to work post-stroke, McNally has come to appreciate how they feel about him. \"I had to talk to my staff and was really nervous,\" he said. \"They were really kind. In the end, kindness is really essential.\"",
      "I asked, \"The stroke lifted the veil on what they thought of you?\"",
      "\"Yeah, yeah,\" McNally laughed. \"They made me feel good.\"",

      "There was a time when everything worked. ...\u00a0 I'd been happily married and the owner of eight successful Manhattan restaurants, including Balthazar in SoHo. In 2004, the New York Times had called me \"The Restaurateur Who Invented Downtown.\" I had everything going for me. And then on November 26, 2016, the clock stopped.",
      "I was living in London. One Saturday morning I coaxed my youngest children, George and Alice, into seeing a Caravaggio exhibition with me at the National Gallery. George was thirteen, Alice eleven. While looking at a painting of Jesus being betrayed by Judas, The Taking of Christ, I sensed my body beginning to show signs of betraying me: a strange metallic tingling started to pinch my fingertips. It was an odd feeling, but as it stopped after five or six seconds, I didn't give it another thought. Soon afterward, to the relief of my children, we left the museum.",
      "Two hours later, when I was back home by myself, the metallic feeling returned. Only this time it was in earnest. Within seconds the horrific tingling shot up my left arm and, like some malignant jellyfish, clasped itself onto my face. Terrified, I phoned Alina, who rushed back with the kids and instantly called an ambulance. George, fists clenched, was panic-stricken as medics examined my convulsing body. Within minutes I was being hoisted into the waiting ambulance. Alina, George and Alice looked on.",
      "I woke up several hours later in Charing Cross Hospital. The first thing the doctor told me was that I'd had a stroke. The second thing was that my brain would never be the same again. Perhaps his bluntness was necessary for legal reasons, but from where I stood\u2014or lay\u2014it was a brutal awakening.",
      "After the doctor left, I tried wriggling my arms and legs to check that I wasn't paralyzed. I wasn't, thank God. To test my memory, I wrote the alphabet on the back of the nurse's chart. I then tried saying the letters aloud, but here there was a problem. The words wouldn't conform to my efforts. They exited my mouth in such a slurred and disorderly way that I sounded like a stage drunk. But this was a small price to pay for my stroke. My first stroke, that is. Because the next day the artillery arrived and gave me such a hammering that in one fell swoop I lost the use of my right hand, right arm and right leg. And my slurred speech, perhaps in fright, went AWOL. Overnight I was confined to a wheelchair and deprived of language.",
      "So much for The Restaurateur Who Invented Downtown.",
      "* * *",
      "I shared a ward with five other men whose ages ranged from forty to eighty. At night, with words inaccessible to me, I'd listen in awe to them talking. Speech suddenly seemed like a divine accomplishment. Even everyday words had an element of poetry to them.",
      "I dreaded the moment when the men would stop talking and I'd be left with my own thoughts. Sleepless, half-paralyzed and unable to speak, I felt buried alive. More than anything, I wished the stroke had killed me.",
      "Bereft of speech and right side unusable, I wondered how my relationship with Alina might change. And with George and Alice also. All children exaggerate their father's strength. Most sense it ebbing away imperceptibly over twenty or so years. Generally, a father's decline appears natural, tolerable even. It wasn't going to be like that for my children.",
      "My new life seemed ungraspable. It existed, but was outside of me.",
      "On my second day in the hospital, Alina arranged for George and Alice to visit. An hour before they were due, I became so ashamed of them seeing me disabled that I canceled the visit. The next day I could hold out no longer.",
      "Hospitals are a great leveler. Like soldiers at war, patients lose all distinctiveness. As they entered the ward, George and Alice failed to recognize me. I was lying at the end of a row of identical beds, assimilating into the world of the sick and dying. Although it had only been three days since I last saw them, they looked years younger. They stood by the door, small eyes darting from one sick man to the next, searching for some identifiable sign of their father. After a few seconds they rushed to my bed.",
      "Alice seemed happy to see me, but George looked angry and said less than usual. He'd behaved in a similar way a year earlier after watching me lose a match in a squash tournament. Back then, I found his anger confusing. Now it made sense.",
      "Alina put on a brave face but was so shell-shocked she said little. I managed to gurgle out a few words, and in between the long silences the heavy breathing of the man in the next bed entered uncomfortably into our space. Alina told the children I was going to regain my voice and would soon be walking out of the hospital.",
      "Neither responded.",
      "When the three of them left, I wept for the first time in twenty years.",

    "title": "Bridget Everett on how she ended up as \"Somebody Somewhere\"",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bridget-everett-on-how-she-ended-up-as-somebody-somewhere/",
    "published": "Sun, 20 Jul 2025 09:55:11 -0400",
    "summary": "The actress and cabaret star put her hometown of Manhattan, Kansas, on the map with the award-winning HBO series about a Midwestern woman returning home and working through grief. She returned to Manhattan, to talk about her surreal journey.",
    "story": [
      "Bridget Everett will try to tell you she's not a celebrity in Manhattan, Kansas, but don't believe her. She did grow up here, one of six kids, so there's that. \"I just love that it still feels like small-town America,\" she said. \"I come back quite a bit and I visit the same spots.\"",
      "But it was when her HBO show \"Somebody Somewhere\" was set here in Manhattan, that Everett became a bon fide local legend.",
      "The show follows Sam Miller (played by Everett), who moves back to her hometown in her 40s, trying to figure out herself, and life, after the death of her sister. Everett was a writer, producer, and lead actor in the semi-autobiographical series. \"I was like, 'Is anybody going to watch this? This is not a cool show!'\" she said. \"You know, like, it's about friendship. I'm not a top model, you know? I don't want to speak for anybody else in the cast! But I think that's exactly kind of why it works.\"",
      "Unlike her character on the show, who returns home to Manhattan, Kansas, Everett stayed in Manhattan, New York, for years, working mostly as a waitress and using, believe or not, karaoke as her main creative outlet.",
      "\"My way of connecting with people is through singing,\" she said. \"It kind of always has been, and it's easier for me to unlock and kind of be who I really want to be when I'm singing.",
      "Those karaoke performances led to her own, now-legendary cabaret shows at the famed Joe's Pub in New York. Everett's performances are sort of unlike anything you've seen, and so risqu\u00e9 we can't show you much of it here on \"Sunday Morning.\"",
      "Everett said, \"What's interesting to me is, like, learning about people, and why am I up there with no bra and a low-cut thing with everything flying around? It's part of who I am, and I also kind of do it to understand myself, honestly. I like to talk about my family in this way because my family and I don't talk about it. I don't see a mental health care professional!\"",
      "And that's the amazing part: Everett's cabaret shows somehow end up being, in part anyway, a meditation on life and grief, including saying goodbye to her father, as well as the loss of her mother, sister, and her beloved dog, Poppy, whom she called the love of her life. \"For a while I felt a little bit of shame saying that, because romantic love is kind of what most people aspire to,\" Everett said. \"My life is driven in a different way. She just taught me how to love, and she just cracked my heart open in a way that, like, no other person could.\"",
      "In fact, it was this side of Everett that HBO and the show's creators wanted to highlight \u2013 the way we can feel both strong and broken, hopeless and hopeful, all in the same moment.",
      "Everett, who writes and performs multiple original songs on the show, says she got her love of music from her mother, Freddie. She also got her sense of humor from her mom, as well as her siblings, including Brock, Brian and Brad, who had given Bridget a piece of feedback: that her acting was improving. \"I was being honest,\" Brad said. \"Her acting, especially towards the end, I thought, was authentic. I even teared up on some of that, which is difficult to do when you know your sibling [is] acting. So, you need to separate who you know, and then see her in a character. And have it move you? I think it's a great compliment to her.\"",
      "\"Thank you,\" said Bridget. \"You could have just said that in a text.\"",
      "The HBO show features a number of Everett's actual friends and collaborators from New York, including Murray Hill, Mary Catherine Garrison, and, in a star turn, the just Emmy-nominated Jeff Hiller as her best friend, Joel.",
      "Though HBO chose not to renew \"Somebody Somewhere\" for a fourth season, it did win a prestigious Peabody Award, and also picked up an Emmy nomination this season for writing for a comedy series.",
      "Everett says the whole thing feels a little surreal: the journey from being somebody somewhere, to somebody who is right where she's supposed to be.",
      "\"Nothing will ever match this, and it couldn't, but that's okay,\" she said. \"A lot of people don't get the opportunity to have a TV show, to live a life beyond their wildest dreams. And then to get to do it with the people I love? It's why it's taken so long for me to move on and kind of let go. But now I'm just trying to celebrate that I got to do it at all.\"",

      "The summer when Sally Samuelson was eight, her brother Ellis graduated from high school and a few days later, he and his best friends, Heck Stevens and Ben Klosterman, drove up the coast in Heck's '64 Rambler American. They promised to be back in a week. Sally was the only one who went outside to see them off. She waved a dishrag and dabbed at pretend tears, then one or two real ones. \"Bye, little Pips!\" Ellis yelled from the back seat\u2014he called her Pipsqueak, with variations. \"See you in the funny papers!\"",
      "Ellis had thick, curly yellow hair long enough to tuck behind his ears and he wore a baseball cap to keep it there. He'd lately grown incredibly tall and skinny; his pants rode so low on his hip bones, they seemed about to slip off. Sally's sister, Katie, who was fourteen, called him El Greck after they saw El Greco's Christ on the Cross at the Getty; even their parents confirmed the resemblance.",
      "His last two years in high school, Ellis had a girlfriend named Carla, who was also tall and blond and liked to show off her stomach. In front of Ellis, she would say hi to Sally. Sometimes Ellis would come into Sally's room when she was drawing on the floor; he'd sit by her and talk about his last baseball game or his weird calculus teacher, and sometimes he'd wonder how much he liked Carla and if she was even nice. Sally somehow knew not to say what she thought. Anyway, Ellis spent most of his time playing ball with Ben and Heck. For their trip, they packed Heck's old Rambler with sleeping bags, the small smelly tent the Samuelson kids used on camping trips, and a cooler full of sodas. After ten days, when Ellis hadn't come back, Heck showed up at the Samuelsons' front door with the tent. Sally answered his knock.",
      "\"Ellis decided to stay away for a few more days,\" he said.",
      "\"Stay where?\" Sally's mother said from behind her.",
      "\"With some girl he met,\" said Heck. \"Not sure where, exactly.\"",
      "\"Well, where did they meet?\"",
      "\"On a beach around Santa Cruz.\"",
      "That was all her mother could get out of Heck. \"Some girl has snagged Ellis,\" she told Sally's father when he came home from work.",
      "\"Good for her,\" he said.",
      "\"How can you say that, Phil?\" her mother cried. \"El's such an innocent. What if she's trouble?\"",
      "Hinky, their Manchester terrier, cocked her head at one parent, then the other; she followed conversations\u2014they'd tested her by standing in a circle and tossing the conversation back and forth. Hinky shifted her attention to each speaker in turn.",
      "\"What if he doesn't come back in time for his job?\"",
      "Ellis was supposed to be a counselor at the day camp he'd attended since first grade.",
      "\"Let's worry about that when the time comes,\" Sally's father said.",
      "The camp's start date came and went.",

      "Joan Liang's life in America began in Palo Alto, where she lived in the attic of a two-story home on Azalea Street. Joan did chores for the widow who owned the house in exchange for reduced rent; she never could have afforded such a nice neighborhood otherwise. She lived in that attic until she was married, and she was married for only six weeks before she stabbed her husband. Joan was twenty-five and had lived in the United States for two years. The year was 1977.",
      "Joan had not thought she would stab her husband. It had been an accident (sort of). Afterward she was disappointed that marriage had not turned out as she'd imagined. She had thought it would be wonderful. It had been, actually. Until it wasn't.",
      "Though later, Joan would wonder why she'd ever thought marriage would be so special. As a child in Taiwan, most of the married women Joan encountered were melancholy, if not outright miserable; throughout her childhood, Joan's own mother had on occasion risen from the kitchen table without warning to cry with showy force into her hands.",
      "\"You've ruined everything!\" Mei would shriek if any of the children came near, and so they soon learned to keep away, which only worsened Mei's despondency. At least every other Saturday, Joan's father, Wen-Bao, spent the night across town in Shilin, where he kept a two-bedroom apartment for his mistress. Joan's mother was haunted by the two bedrooms; it drove her nuts, Mei said, to think of so much empty space.",
      "\"Can you imagine,\" Mei would remark, legs crossed as she sat before her vanity, \"how much lust a man must carry inside, to furnish such a large place for one woman? When all six of us are crowded in the same square footage? Do you understand the scope of his betrayal?\" At this point Joan's brothers usually wandered off; they were bored by this conversation, which repeated itself every few months. Only Joan would remain at her mother's feet, where she watched Mei sit with perfect posture before her mirror and pluck white strands from her hairline.",
      "After moving to California, Joan established the routine of calling her parents every Sunday evening Taipei time, during which Wen-Bao, if he'd visited his mistress that weekend, would have already returned home. On these calls, Joan's parents performed the same interrogation: how her studies at Stanford were proceeding, if there was any chance to graduate early from her master's program so that she might begin to earn money. Money was key. Joan had three brothers, each of whom by various rights (older, male) should have been sent abroad before her. Two had been disqualified by their academics, whereas the top candidate, Alfred, had been surprised by \"issues\" (his girlfriend was pregnant), and so at the last minute Joan was sent instead.",

Inside the ring, the eleven members of the First Thing crew sprawled out on foam mats as Terry Tucker, fifty-four, led them through an arduous medley of scissor kicks and side-to-sides, knees-to-your-ears and upside-down bicycle. It was August in Austin, the average age inside the ring was forty-nine, and though it would be hours before a single speck of perspiration would appear on Terry's left temple, his charges were sopping.",
      "Sopping except for Bob Alexander. Bob was lanky and spry, a semi-affable curmudgeon. At sixty-eight, he was the oldest of the First Thingers and among the fittest, too, though on this morning he was only going through the motions. Preoccupying Bob was the anonymous note that had been placed under the windshield wiper of his Audi sometime the night before.",

A few days before, a short article on the tenth anniversary of the disappearance had run in the Statesman, so of course the kooks and grifters were coming out of the woodwork now.",
      "No one had ever shown up at his house before, though, and it was this, combined with the note's puzzling content, which meant that as soon as Bob left the gym, he would take the folded paper, stowed in his glove compartment, to Austin Police headquarters, a time-suck in building form, where, if he had to guess, he'd rehash the story of his missing nephew, Nathaniel Rothstein, without coming any closer to finding him.",

    "summary": "Felix Baumgartner made global headlines in 2012 when he jumped from the stratosphere and parachuted down to a landing in New Mexico.",
    "story": [
      "Felix Baumgartner, the daredevil who made a record-breaking parachute jump from the stratosphere in 2012, died Thursday in a paragliding accident in Italy, a local mayor confirmed. Firefighters who responded to the scene said they found a paraglider that had crashed into the side of a swimming pool in the city of Porto Sant Elpidio, on central Italy's eastern coast.",
      "\"Our community is deeply affected by the tragic disappearance of Felix Baumgartner, a figure of global prominence, a symbol of courage and passion for extreme flight,\" the town's mayor, Massimiliano Ciarpella, said on Facebook. Ciarpella told The Associated Press that the extreme athlete had been in the area on vacation.",
      "Witnesses told The Associated Press they heard a loud boom as the paraglider spun out of control. Mirella Ivanov, 30, told AP she was in the area with her two young children when they saw the paraglider lose control.",
      "\"Everything was normal, then it started to spin like a top,\" Ivanov said Friday. \"It went down and we heard a roar. In fact, I turned around because I thought it crashed on the rocks.\"",
      "Baumgartner, 56, made global headlines in 2012 when he was lifted into the stratosphere, about 24 miles up, in a capsule carried by a helium balloon, and then parachuted down to a landing in New Mexico. During the jump, he broke the record for fastest free fall, descending at about 843.6 mph and becoming the first human to break the sound barrier without the assistance of a vehicle.",
      "Originally from Austria, Baumgartner began skydiving at age 16 and further honed his skills in the Austrian military, according to his personal website. In 1988, he teamed up with Red Bull, which sponsored the stratosphere jump under the Stratos project and many other daring feats.",
      "The training and planning for the 2012 Stratos jump took five years. Among the records Baumgartner would break that day was highest jump, which had been held by Air Force Capt. Joe Kittinger since 1960, when he leapt from an open-air gondola basket that rose to 102,000 feet. Kittinger would go on to train Baumgartner for the record-breaking Stratos jump. (Baumgartner's height record was broken two years later.)",
      "In addition to skydiving, Baumgartner was an accomplished BASE jumper, breaking two records in 1999: highest BASE jump and lowest BASE jump. The low jump, which he took from one of the hands of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, was only 95 feet. The high jump was taken from the 88th floor of the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, although that record has since been broken and is currently held by the late Valery Rozov, who jumped from Cho Oyu in 2016.",
      "Baumgartner was also a helicopter pilot and was part of Red Bull's aerial acrobatics team.",
      "\"Ever since I was a child, I have always wanted to jump out of a plane,\" Baumgartner told Red Bull in an interview after becoming a licensed helicopter pilot.",
      "\"For Red Bull Stratos, we had a very long list of 'what ifs,' in other words eventualities that could happen and how we would deal with them in an emergency. The list kept getting longer and longer. I was only afraid of the things that were not on the list. The things we had not thought of,\" he told Red Bull, adding: \"To this day, I abort missions if the conditions are not right.\"",
      "While Baumgartner's stunts inspired millions, his political views were known to cause controversy. On social media, he mocked climate activists and others who sought to limit the effects of climate change, and voiced opposition to LGBTQ rights, according to the AFP news agency. He also once suggested Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n should receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-immigration policies.",

    "summary": "Lyricists Alan and Marilyn Bergman were among the most successful and prolific partnerships of their time. Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson, Tony Bennett and many others performed their material.",
    "story": [
      "Oscar-winning lyricist Alan Bergman, who worked with his wife,\u00a0Marilyn, in a partnership that produced hits such as \"The Way We Were,\" \"It Might Be You\" and \"How Do You Keep the Music Playing?,\" has died, his family announced. He was 99.",
      "The family's spokesman, Ken Sunshine, said the legendary lyricist died late Thursday night at his Los Angeles home with his daughter, writer and film producer Julie Bergman, present.",
      "\"Bergman suffered from respiratory issues in recent months, but continued to write songs till the very end,\" Sunshine said in a statement.",
      "The Bergmans married in 1958 and remained together until Marilyn's\u00a0death in 2022. With collaborators ranging from Marvin Hamlisch and Quincy Jones to Michel Legrand and Cy Coleman, they were among the most successful and prolific partnerships of their time, providing words and occasional music for hundreds of songs, including movie themes that became as famous as the films themselves.",
      "Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson, Tony Bennett and many other artists performed their material, and Barbra Streisand became a frequent collaborator and close friend.",
      "Blending Tin Pan Alley sentiment and contemporary pop, the Bergmans crafted lyrics known by millions, many of whom would not have recognized the writers had they walked right past them. Among their most famous works: the Streisand-Neil Diamond duet \"You Don't Bring Me Flowers,\" the well-named Sinatra favorite \"Nice 'n' Easy\" and the topical themes to the 1970s sitcoms \"Maude\" and \"Good Times.\"",
      "Their film compositions included Ray Charles' \"In the Heat of the Night\" from the movie of the same name, Noel Harrison's \"The Windmills of Your Mind\" from \"The Thomas Crown Affair,\" and Stephen Bishop's \"It Might Be You\" from \"Tootsie.\"",
      "The whole world seemed to sing and cry along to \"The Way We Were,\" an instant favorite recorded by Streisand for the 1973 romantic drama of the same name that co-starred Streisand and Robert Redford. Set to Hamlisch's tender, bittersweet melody, it was essentially a song about itself \u2014 a nostalgic ballad about nostalgia, an indelible ode to the uncertainty of the past, starting with one of history's most famous opening stanzas: \"Memories / light the corners of my mind / misty watercolor memories / of the way we were.\"",
      "\"The Way We Were\" was the top-selling song of 1974 and brought the Bergmans one of their three Oscars, the others coming for \"Windmills of Your Mind\" and the soundtrack to \"Yentl,\" the Streisand-directed movie from 1983. At times, the Academy Awards could be mistaken for a Bergman showcase. In 1983, three of the nominees for best song featured lyrics by the Bergmans, who received 16 nominations in all.",
      "The Bergmans also won two Grammys, four Emmys, were presented numerous lifetime achievement honors and received tributes from individual artists, including Streisand's 2011 album of Bergman songs, \"What Matters Most.\" On \"Lyrically, Alan Bergman,\" Bergman handled the vocals himself. Although best known for their movie work, the Bergmans also wrote the Broadway musical \"Ballroom\" and provided lyrics for the symphony \"Visions of America.\"",
      "Their very lives seemed to rhyme. They didn't meet until they were adults, but were born in the same Brooklyn hospital, four years apart; raised in the same Brooklyn neighborhood, attended the same children's concerts at Carnegie Hall and moved to California in the same year, 1950. They were introduced in Los Angeles while working for the same composer, but at different times of the day. Their actual courtship was in part a story of music. Fred Astaire was Marilyn's favorite singer at the time and Alan Bergman co-wrote a song, \"That Face,\" which Astaire agreed to record. Acetate in hand, Bergman rushed home to tell Marilyn the news, then proposed.",
      "Bergman had wanted to be a songwriter since he was a boy. He majored in music and theater at the University of North Carolina and received a master's from the University of California, Los Angeles, where he befriended Johnny Mercer and became a protege. He and Marilyn at first wrote children's songs together, and broke through commercially in the late 1950s with the calypso hit \"Yellowbird.\" Their friendship with Streisand began soon after, when they visited her backstage during one of her early New York club appearances. \"Do you know how wonderful you are?\" was how Marilyn Bergman greeted the young singer.",
      "The Bergmans worked so closely together that they often found themselves coming up with the same word at the same time. Alan likened their partnership to housework: one washes, one dries, the title of a song they eventually devised for a Hamlisch melody. Bergman was reluctant to name a favorite song, but cited \"A Love Like Ours\" as among their most personal: \"When love like ours arrives / We guard it with our lives / Whatever goes astray / When a rainy day comes around / A love like ours will keep us safe and sound.\"",
      "Alan Bergman is survived by his daughter and granddaughter, Emily Sender, whom Sunshine said just completed a master's degree in global food studies.",

      "Francis was a top performer of the pre-Beatles era, rarely off the charts from 1957-64. Able to appeal to both young people and adults, she had more than a dozen top 20 hits, starting with \"Who's Sorry Now?\" and including the No. 1 songs \"Don't Break the Heart That Loves You\" and \"The Heart Has a Mind of Its Own.\" Like other teen favorites of her time, she also starred in several films, including \"Where the Boys Are\" and \"Follow the Boys.\"",
      "The dark-haired singer was just 17 when she signed a contract with MGM Records following appearances on several TV variety shows. Her earliest recordings attracted little attention, but then she released her version of \"Who's Sorry Now?\" an old ballad by Ted Snyder, Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby.",
      "It, too, had little success initially until Dick Clark played it on his \"American Bandstand\" show in 1958. Francis followed with such teen hits as \"Stupid Cupid,\" \"Everybody's Somebody's Fool,\" and \"Lipstick on Your Collar.\" Her records became hits worldwide as she re-recorded versions of her original songs in Italian and Spanish among other languages. Her concerts around the country quickly sold out.",
      "Decades after recording \"Pretty Little Baby\" in the 1960s, the song gained popularity on social media in 2025, being featured in videos on TikTok and Instagram. Francis told the New York Times the song went unnoticed when it was originally released.",
      "\"It's a cute song,\" Francis said. \"I couldn't imagine that it has the effect that it has worldwide on people \u2014 it's hard to believe. I wanted something for the B-side of a single and I chose something that wouldn't give my A-side any competition. I don't even know the name of the record that I put it on. But I think it has a ring of innocence in this chaotic time and it connects with people.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a romance bloomed with fellow teen idol Bobby Darin, who had volunteered to write songs for her. But when her father heard rumors that the pair were planning a wedding he stormed into a rehearsal and pulled a gun on Darin, ending their relationship and seeming to set on Francis on a pained and traumatic path.",
      "She chronicled some of it in her autobiography, \"Who's Sorry Now?\"",
      "\"My personal life is a regret from A to Z,\" she told The Associated Press in 1984, the year the book came out. \"I realized I had allowed my father to exert too much influence over me.\"",
      "Her father, George Franconero, was a roofing contractor from New Jersey who played the accordion, and he had his daughter learn the instrument as soon as she began to show an aptitude for music. When she was 4, he began booking singing dates for her, going on to become her manager.",
      "Although her acting career had faded by the mid-1960s, Francis was still popular on the concert circuit when she appeared at the Westbury Music Center in Westbury, New York, in 1974. She had returned to her hotel room and was asleep when a man broke in and raped her at knifepoint. He was never captured.",
      "Francis sued the hotel, alleging its security was faulty, and a jury awarded her $2.5 million in 1976. The two sides then settled out of court for $1,475,000 as an appeal was pending. She said the attack destroyed her marriage and put her through years of emotional turmoil.",
      "She suffered tragedy in 1981 when her brother George was shot to death as he was leaving his New Jersey home. Later in the decade, her father had her committed to a psychiatric hospital, where she was diagnosed as manic-depressive. At one point she attempted suicide by swallowing dozens of sleeping tablets. After three days in a coma, she recovered.",
      "She was married four times and would say that only her third husband, Joseph Garzilli, was worth the trouble. The other marriages each lasted less than a year.",
      "Concetta Rosemarie Franconero was born on Dec. 12, 1937, in Newark, New Jersey. She was just 3 when her father presented her with a child-size accordion. The next year she began singing and playing the instrument at various public events.",
      "At age 9 she began appearing on television programs, including \"Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts\" and \"The Perry Como Show.\" It was Godfrey who suggested she shorten her last name.",
      "Clark featured her repeatedly on \"American Bandstand,\" and she said in later years that without his support she would have abandoned her music career.",

      "An off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot indicted for trying to shut off a passenger jet's engines mid-flight in 2023 recalled the scary moment he slipped out of reality after eating \"magic mushrooms.\"",
      "Former airline captain Joseph Emerson said he takes full responsibility for the night in October 2023 that changed his life.",
      "\"I had no intention of crashing an actual airplane. I wanted to wake up. I was convinced I wasn't going home to my wife and kids,\" he said in an interview that aired on \"CBS Mornings\" on Thursday.",
      "At the time, Emerson said he had been grieving the death of his best friend and first turned to alcohol before experimenting with the psychedelic drug. Two days after trying so-called 'magic mushrooms' for the first time, he boarded Alaska Air Flight 2059 as a passenger from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco. It was a full flight, with 83 other passengers and crew on board, so he was given the cockpit jump seat behind the pilot and first officer.",
      "\"Most consequential three seconds of my life\"",
      "Suddenly, he said he felt a sense of \"all-out panic and fear\" on the plane as the drugs altered his perception of reality.",
      "\"You're not going home. You need to wake up. That's when I acted. I pulled the handles that were in front of my face,\" Emerson recalled thinking as he pulled the handles that cut off fuel to the engines in the event of a fire.",
      "While in the apparent dissociative state, Emerson said he didn't realize the serious consequences of his actions.",
      "\"I mean, in the dream, in that dissociative state, I thought they were going to wake me up. It didn't wake me up, right? I was in reality. I know that now. You know, it's the most consequential three seconds of my life,\" Emerson said.",
      "The flight was diverted and landed safely in Portland, Oregon, where Emerson was arrested. He's set to be arraigned next month on a federal charge of interfering with a flight crew, and faces a host of state charges including 83 misdemeanor counts of recklessly endangering another person and one felony count of first-degree endangering aircraft.",
      "The case reignited the conversation about barriers facing pilots when it comes to their mental health.",
      "Pilots' mental health",
      "Disclosing mental health issues can lead to a pilot being grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration, putting their ability to work at risk for an extended period of time, possibly lasting years. A 2022 study published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine estimated 56% of pilots avoid seeking medical care due to fear of losing their certification to fly.",
      "\"I came to an understanding, or a misunderstanding, that I needed to be perfect on paper. I needed to show up and appear perfect, no matter what else was going on for me,\" Emerson said.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board has since held a first of its kind pilot mental health forum to review existing pilot mental health rules. The FAA also launched a review of policies \u2013 both calling for changes to address barriers to care.",
      "\"We need to have a system that allows people to be more forthcoming and to have treatment for issues that shouldn't keep you out of the cockpit,\" then-FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker said months after the incident, in December 2023.",
      "The FAA review committee made 24 recommendations.",
      "Illinois Rep. Sean Casten and Minnesota Rep. Pete Stauber are leading an effort in Congress to enact reforms within two years, introducing the bipartisan\u00a0Mental Health in Aviation Act\u00a0to help pilots and air traffic controllers get access to mental health care and hire additional medical examiners.",
      "\"The goal really simply is to make our skies safer and make our pilots safer. That's it,\" Casten told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "The bill would also require the FAA to annually review and update the process related to mental health-related special issuance of medical certificates to pilots and air traffic controllers, set aside 13.74 million dollars a year for the next three years to hire additional certified Aviation Medical Examiners, and authorize a three year $4.5 million dollar public information campaign aimed at destigmatizing mental health care among pilots and air traffic controllers.",
      "\"Our pilots and air traffic controllers are not going to lose their job when they ask for help. We in this country must recognize that that's strength. And they're not to be punished. We're going to help them, process them, and get them back into cockpits,\" Stauber added.",
      "The bill maintains the FAA's rigorous process for determining a pilot is safe to resume flying but aims to cut red tape and increase transparency. It has unanimously passed the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last month and has the backing of the largest pilot unions. The bill has advanced to the House of Representatives for consideration. The FAA declined to comment on the bill.",
      "Emerson says he's been sober since the incident. He and his wife have started a nonprofit, Clear Skies Ahead, aimed at improving pilot health and wellness.",

    "story": [
      "Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont this week signed legislation requiring the state to keep fluoride at existing levels. But Florida and Utah have banned adding fluoride to drinking water, and other states may follow, as the decades-old practice of adding it to public drinking is facing renewed attacks, including from the federal government.",
      "Arkansas state Sen. Bryan King, a cattle and poultry farmer in Fayetteville, told CBS News he has \"concerns\" about adding fluoride to water.",
      "Since 2011, when the state mandated most public drinking water to include fluoride,  King has thrown his anti-fluoride voice behind a handful of bills seeking to repeal that mandate.",
      "Fluoride is a natural mineral. It strengthens teeth and fights dental decay. It's been added to the U.S.'s public drinking supply since the 1940s.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump signed a landmark bill to regulate cryptocurrency on Friday, hailing the \"exciting new frontier\" for the technology one day after the bill passed the House.",
      "The legislation, called the GENIUS Act, is the first major law governing digital currency, and establishes a regulatory framework for the $250 billion stablecoin market. Stablecoins are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency since their value is pegged to other assets, like the dollar. The bill passed the House on Thursday with the support of 206 Republicans and 102 Democrats.",
      "\"We worked hard. It's a very important act, the GENIUS Act. They named it after me,\" the president joked in the East Room of the White House. \"I want to thank you. This is a hell of an act.\"",
      "Members of Congress and top executives from Robinhood, Tether, Gemini and other crypto and financial firms were in attendance for the signing ceremony.",
      "The fate of the GENIUS Act was in question earlier this week when a dozen conservatives stymied a procedural vote. A compromise was ultimately reached, and the holdouts allowed the legislation to proceed. The president on Friday suggested that he spoke to the holdouts individually on the phone to persuade them, after House Speaker Mike Johnson told him there were a dozen Republicans opposing the bill.",
      "\"The good news is, I call up, 'Hello, Jim, how are you?' 'Sir, you have my vote.' Boom. 'Sir, you have my vote.' I really just, they just want a little love,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, it's always the same 12 people.\"",
      "David Sacks, the venture capitalist-turned Mr. Trump's AI and crypto czar, said the president \"stepped in and saved this bill.\" Mr. Trump also said Vice President JD Vance had been on the phone late at night, helping push the legislation through.",
      "What is the GENIUS Act?",
      "The GENIUS Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) establishes guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins. The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the GENIUS Act signed into law, banks, nonbanks and credit unions can dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "\"Just as I promised last year, the GENIUS Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stablecoins,\" Mr. Trump said. \"This could be, perhaps, the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the Internet itself. A lot of people are saying that.\"",
      "The president said the GENIUS Act provides banks and other financial institutions a framework for issuing crypto assets backed \"one-for-one\" with real U.S. dollars and Treasury bills, \"strengthening the dollar\" and allowing the entire U.S. financial system to be eligible for a \"21st-century upgrade.\"",
      "Lawmakers also approved two other cryptocurrency bills, capping what Republicans dubbed \"Crypto Week\" in Congress. The Clarity Act will regulate digital commodities beyond stablecoins, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing any retail central bank digital currency directly to Americans. The legislation is seen by the Trump administration and the crypto community as a way of bringing digital currency into the mainstream financial system.",
      "\"Let me say, the entire crypto community, for years, you were mocked and dismissed and counted out,\" the president said. \"You were counted out as little as a year and a half ago. But this signing is a massive validation.\"",
      "The Trump family's crypto investments have increased their wealth in recent months as the administration alters its regulatory approach to digital currency. The White House has insisted there is no conflict of interest, and the president's assets are in a trust managed by his children. Key crypto figures who were present Friday, including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, backed Mr. Trump's campaign last year.",
      "The president on Friday also touted his decision to pardon Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the internet marketplace Silk Road who was sentenced to life in prison in 2015.",
      "The GENIUS Act wasn't the only bill that had House Republicans wringing their hands this week. The chamber also approved a request from the president to claw back about $9 billion in funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting in a late-night vote, signing off on changes the Senate made to the bill, known as a rescissions package, earlier this week.",
      "Passage of the funding cuts was held up this week over Democratic efforts to force the release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Ultimately, the package passed the House along party lines, with two Republicans joining Democrats to vote against it. The bill claws back about $8 billion for foreign assistance efforts, including by the the U.S. Agency for International Development, and about $1 billion for public radio and television stations. The president is expected to sign it soon.",
      "\"REPUBLICANS HAVE TRIED DOING THIS FOR 40 YEARS, AND FAILED\u2026.BUT NO MORE,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to cutting funding to the corporation that oversees federal funds for NPR and PBS. \"THIS IS BIG!!!\"",
      "Friday's signing ceremony for the GENIUS Act took place against the backdrop of increased focus on the Epstein case. On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury material related to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in federal custody in 2019. Mr. Trump has faced increasing pressure to disclose more information about the case after the Justice Department said no further documents would be released following a review of the evidence.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 20:12:32 -0400",
    "summary": "Consumers face both rising premiums and falling subsidies next year in Obamacare plans.",
    "story": [
      "Most of the 24 million people in Affordable Care Act health plans face a potential one-two punch next year \u2014 double-digit premium increases along with a sharp drop in the federal subsidies that most consumers depend on to buy the coverage, also known as Obamacare.",
      "Insurers want higher premiums to cover the usual culprits \u2014 rising medical and labor costs and usage \u2014 but are tacking on extra percentage point increases in their 2026 rate proposals to cover effects of policy changes advanced by the Trump administration and the Republican-controlled Congress. One key factor built into their filings with state insurance departments: uncertainty over whether Congress allows more generous, COVID-era ACA tax subsidies to expire at the end of December.",
      "\"The out-of-pocket change for individuals will be immense, and many won't actually be able to make ends meet and pay premiums, so they will go uninsured,\" said JoAnn Volk, co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University.",
      "Especially if the higher subsidies expire, insurance premiums will be among the first financial pains felt by health care consumers after policy priorities put forward by President Trump and the GOP. Many other changes \u2014 such as additional paperwork requirements and spending cuts to Medicaid \u2014 won't occur for at least another year. But spiking ACA premiums, as the nation heads into key midterm elections, invites political pushback. Some on Capitol Hill are exploring ways to temper the subsidy reductions.",
      "\"I am hearing on both sides \u2014 more from Republicans, but from both the House and Senate\" \u2014 that they are looking for levers they can pull, said Pennsylvania-based insurance broker Joshua Brooker, who follows legislative actions as part of his job and sits on several insurance advisory groups.",
      "In initial filings, insurers nationally are seeking a median rate increase \u2014 meaning half of the proposed increases are lower and half higher \u2014 of 15%, according to an analysis for the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker covering 19 states and the District of Columbia. KFF is a national health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "That's up sharply from the last few years. For the 2025 plan year, for example, KFF found that the median proposed increase was 7%.",
      "Health insurers \"are doing everything in their power to shield consumers from the rising costs of care and the uncertainty in the market driven by recent policy changes,\" wrote Chris Bond, a spokesperson for AHIP, the industry's lobbying group. The emailed response also called on lawmakers \"to take action to extend the health care tax credits to prevent skyrocketing cost increases for millions of Americans in 2026.\"",
      "Neither the White House nor the Department of Health and Human Services responded to requests for comment.",
      "These are initial numbers and insurance commissioners in some states may alter requests before approval.",
      "Still, \"it's the biggest increase we've seen in over five years,\" said analysis co-author Cynthia Cox, a KFF vice president and director of its Program on the ACA.",
      "Premiums will vary based on where consumers live, the type of plan they choose, and their insurer.",
      "For example, Maryland insurers have requested increases ranging from 8.1% to 18.7% for the upcoming plan year, according to an analysis of a smaller set of insurers by Georgetown University researchers. A much larger swing is seen in New York, where one carrier is asking for less than a 1% increase, while another wants 66%. Maryland rate filings indicated the average statewide increase would shrink to 7.9% from 17.1% \u2014 if the ACA's enhanced tax credits are extended.",
      "Most insurers are asking for 10% to 20% increases, the KFF report says, with several factors driving those increases. For instance, insurers say underlying medical costs \u2014 including the use of expensive obesity drugs \u2014 will add about 8% to premiums for next year. And most insurers are also adding 4% above what they would have charged had the enhanced tax credits been renewed.",
      "But rising premiums are just part of the picture.",
      "A bigger potential change for consumers' pocketbooks hinges on whether Congress decides to extend more generous tax credits first put in place during President Joe Biden's term as part of the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021, then extended through the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.",
      "Those laws raised the subsidy amounts people could receive based on their household income and local premium costs and removed a cap that had barred higher earners from even partial subsidy assistance. Higher earners could still qualify for some subsidy but first had to chip in 8.5% of their household income toward the premiums.",
      "Across the board, but especially among lower-income policyholders, bigger subsidies helped fuel record enrollment in ACA plans.",
      "But they're also costly.",
      "A permanent extension could cost $335 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Such an extension was left out of the policy law Mr. Trump signed on July 4 that he called the \"One Big, Beautiful Bill.\" Without action, the extra subsidies will expire at the end of this year, after which the tax credits will revert to less generous pre-pandemic levels.",
      "That means two things: Most enrollees will be on the hook to pay a larger share of their premiums as assistance from federal tax credits declines. Secondly, people whose household income exceeds four times the federal poverty level \u2014 $84,600 for a couple or $128,600 for a family of four this year \u2014 won't get any subsidies at all.",
      "If the subsidies expire, policy experts estimate, the average amount people pay for coverage could rise by an average of more than 75%. In some states, ACA premiums could double.",
      "\"There will be sticker shock,\" said Josh Schultz, strategic engagement manager at Softheon, a New York consulting firm that provides enrollment, billing, and other services to about 200 health insurers, many of which are bracing for enrollment losses.",
      "And enrollment could fall sharply. The Wakely Consulting Group estimates that the combination of expiring tax credits, the Trump law's new paperwork, and other requirements will result in ACA enrollment dropping by as much as 57%.",
      "According to KFF, insurers added premium increases of around 4% just to cover the expiration of the enhanced tax credits, which they fear will lead to lower enrollment. That would further raise costs, insurers say, because people who are less healthy are more likely to grit their teeth and reenroll, leaving insurers with a smaller, but sicker, pool of members.",
      "Less common in the filings submitted so far, but noticeable, are increases pegged to Trump administration tariffs, Cox said.",
      "\"What they are assuming is tariffs will drive drug costs up significantly, with some saying that can have around a 3-percentage-point increase\" in premiums as a result, she said.",
      "Consumers will learn their new premium prices only late in the fall, or when open enrollment for the ACA begins on Nov. 1 and they can start shopping around.",
      "Congress could still act, and discussions are ongoing, said insurance broker Brooker.",
      "Some lawmakers, he said, are consulting with the CBO about the fiscal and coverage effects of various scenarios that don't extend the subsidies as they currently exist but may offer a middle ground. One possibility involves allowing subsidies for families earning as much as five or six times the poverty level, he said.",
      "But any such effort will draw pushback.",
      "Some conservative think tanks, such as the Paragon Health Institute, say the more generous subsides led people to fudge their incomes to qualify and led to other types of fraud, such as brokers signing people up for ACA plans without authorization.",
      "But others note that many consumers \u2014 Democratic and Republican \u2014 have come to rely on the additional assistance. Not extending it could be risky politically. In 2024, 56% of ACA enrollees lived in Republican congressional districts, and 76% were in states won by Mr. Trump.",
      "Allowing the enhanced subsidies to expire could also reshape the market.",
      "Brooker said some people may drop coverage. Others will shift to plans with lower premiums but higher deductibles. One provision of Mr. Trump's new tax law allows people enrolled in either \"bronze\" or \"catastrophic\"-level ACA plans, which are usually the cheapest, to qualify for health savings accounts, which allow people to set aside money, tax-free, to cover health care costs.",
      "\"Naturally, if rates do start going up the way we anticipate, there will be a migration to lower-cost options,\" Brooker said.",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

      "The fee is effective in the current federal fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1, 2024, and ends on Sept. 30, 2025, according to the text of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. For subsequent years, the amount will be adjusted for inflation, the law states.",
      "The fee applies to visitors who come to the U.S. on nonimmigrant visas, such as foreign students attending American universities or workers who receive temporary work visas such as\u00a0the H-1B, which is often used by companies to hire foreign engineers or other skilled workers.",
      "In 2023, the U.S. issued more than 10 million nonimmigrant visas, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the U.S. State Department.",
      "Visa holders subjected to the fee may later be reimbursed as long as they comply with their visa's restrictions, such as leaving the U.S. within five days of the visa's expiration, according to the new law. However, the law doesn't specify how visa holders may apply for reimbursement of the fee, nor how the fee will be collected.",
      "\"The visa integrity fee requires cross-agency coordination before implementation,\" a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill provides the necessary policies and resources to restore integrity in our nation's immigration system,\" it added.",
      "Given that fee isn't yet set up to be collected, it's unclear whether the visa integrity fee will be retroactive. The Department of Homeland Security didn't immediately respond to a question about whether the fee would be collected retroactively.",
      "Fee for asylum seekers",
      "The new fee will add to the hurdles facing immigrants, according to the American Immigration Council, a nonpartisan think tank focused on immigration issues. It noted the new bill also includes additional new charges, including a new $100 fee for people applying for asylum.",
      "\"These fees, many of which are authorized to be layered on top of existing fees, are largely mandatory, effectively putting legal pathways out of reach for thousands of people,\" the group\u00a0said\u00a0in a July 14 statement.",
      "For instance, student visa applicants already must pay an $185 application fee and a $350 fee for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program. The additional $250 fee will bring their total cost to $785.",

But higher-income Americans are more likely to see a bigger relative boost than lower-income households, their analysis found.",
      "The new law extends the tax cuts in President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, with many of those provisions otherwise slated to expire at year-end. But the legislation also adds a bevy of new tax breaks, ranging from eliminating taxes on overtime and tips to lifting the state and local taxes deduction from $10,000 to $40,000.",
      "About $6 of every $10 in tax breaks will go to the top 20% of households, or people who earn incomes of about $217,000 or more, the Tax Policy Center analysis found.",

      "Steward Health Care, an embattled hospital chain that has been the focus of federal scrutiny, has filed new court papers blaming the company's financial woes on its founding chief executive. The company alleges that the ex-CEO and three former colleagues misappropriated hundreds of millions of dollars and drove the chain into bankruptcy.",
      "Steward accuses its founder Ralph de la Torre and three others\u00a0 \u2014 Michael Callum, James Karam, and Sanjay Shetty \u2014 of defrauding the company of more than $245 million.",
      "\"Through their greed and bad faith misconduct, [these former insiders] operated Steward with the aim of enriching themselves at the expense of the Company, its creditors, and the patients and communities that Steward served,\" the new filing alleges. \"These insiders pilfered Steward's assets for their own material gain, while leaving the Company and its hospitals perpetually undercapitalized and insolvent.\"",
      "Once the nation's largest for-profit hospital chain, Steward operated hospitals in Massachusetts, Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania and other states. CBS News found that de la Torre pushed for the company's expansion. By working with a real estate investment firm, Medical Properties Trust, de la Torre helped purchase new medical properties, sell off the real estate, and force the hospitals into costly lease-back arrangements.",
      "A CBS News investigation that spanned nearly two years documented allegations of\u00a0 how private equity investors and de la Torre followed this formula, extracting hundreds of millions of dollars in dividends from the real estate sales, while health care workers and patients struggled to get the life-saving supplies they needed as a result.",
      "Records reviewed by CBS News showed Steward hospitals around the country left a trail of unpaid bills, at times risking a shortage of potentially life-saving supplies. That included a case in a Massachusetts hospital where medical staff says a device that could have stopped the bleeding in a new mother's liver was repossessed by the manufacturer weeks earlier. After being transferred to another hospital, the young woman died just hours after giving birth to her first daughter.",
      "Last August, after filing for bankruptcy, the company sold off six Massachusetts hospitals. The sale of the final two facilities in the state left about 1,200 workers jobless, according to state officials. In a 2024 interview with CBS News, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey did not hold back in her assessment of the conduct of Steward executives.",
      "\"I'm disgusted. It's selfish. It's greed,\" she said.",
      "At the time of the patient's death, a spokesperson for Steward told CBS News company executives always put patients first and said they \"deny that any other considerations were placed ahead of that guiding principle.\"",
      "In an earlier statement, the spokesperson said Steward \"has actively and meaningfully invested\" in its hospital system since its formation, including in Massachusetts, where it took over hospitals that were \"failing\" and \"about to close.\"",
      "De la Torre also defended the company's actions.",
      "\"Steward Health Care has done everything in its power to operate successfully in a highly challenging health care environment,\" de la Torre said in a company statement in 2024.",
      "This week's complaint lists three major transactions that de la Torre and executives allegedly profited from while leaving Steward hospitals struggling for funds to operate.",
      "In January 2021, de la Torre allegedly took a $111 million dividend payout while the company was struggling financially. The former CEO also pocketed $81.5 million according to the complaint. The court filing also lists the former executives who benefited: Callum, who as vice president for physician services at Steward received $10.3 million. Shetty, then-president of Steward Health Care System received $1.8 million and Karam, who remains a member of Steward's board, received $728,456.",
      "The complaint also claims Steward Health Care International, the international arm of Steward that's majority-owned by de la Torre, received $4.3 million of the dividend payout.",
      "Later that year, Steward claims de la Torre overpaid by $200 million for five Miami-based hospitals acquired from Tenet Healthcare Corporation. The complaint alleges the former CEO pushed for the $1.1 billion deal based on his \"personal desire to build a hospital empire in the Miami area, rather than on any independent financial analysis.\"",
      "According to the complaint, de la Torre then sold assets related to Steward's Medicare Advantage business to a company called CareMax in 2022.",
      "Steward, through its physicians organization, allegedly received $60.5 million in cash, while the bulk of the proceeds \u2014 almost $134 million in stock of CareMax \u2014 ultimately went to a holding company that was majority-owned by de la Torre, Callum, Shetty and Karam. The complaint alleges de la Torre and named board members \"sold valuable\" assets and \"diverted the proceeds to themselves\" while the company went insolvent.",
      "\"De la Torre, Callum, and Karam were grossly negligent and breached their duties of care, loyalty, and good faith,\" according to the filing.",
      "CareMax filed for bankruptcy in February.",
      "While Steward's hospitals were struggling, CBS News previously reported on de la Torre's lavish personal spending, including the purchase of a $30 million yacht in 2021, a multimillion-dollar Texas horse ranch in 2022, and two corporate jets valued at $95 million.",
      "Steward Health Care is now being run by a court-appointed administrator and is trying to claw back funds from its former leaders to pay off its creditors.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday is signing the Genius Act, the first major federal law governing cryptocurrencies.",
      "The law establishes federal regulations for \"stablecoins,\" which are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency because their value is pegged to fixed assets, like the dollar.",
      "The Genius Act passed in the House on Thursday by a 308-122 vote after being approved\u00a0in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support. The measure is part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "\"For the first time in history, Congress has passed bipartisan digital assets legislation through both the Senate and the House. The Genius Act marks a major milestone in securing America's leadership in payments innovation while protecting consumers and strengthening our national security,\" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement Thursday following the bill's passage by Congress.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backed the passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What will the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) established guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the Genius Act passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaited approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks were already considering how they could integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 15:30:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Content promoting extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery is available to young TikTok users, breaching the social media platform's policies.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were easily found with a simple search on TikTok and available to a user under the age of 18, in violation of the platform's own policies, CBS News has found.",
      "CBS News created a TikTok account for a hypothetical 15-year-old female user in the United States and found that, at the very least, hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were searchable and watchable on the platform using the account.",
      "Once the CBS News account interacted with a handful of these videos, similar content was then recommended to the account on TikTok's \"For You\" feed.",
      "Searchable videos ranged from content with captions such as, \"nothing feels better than an empty stomach,\" to \"what I eat in a day\" videos promoting restrictive, 500-calorie-per-day diets. Guidelines published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggest that girls between the ages of 14 and 18 ingest between 1,800 and 2,400 calories per day.",
      "Many of the videos promoted thin body types as aspirational targets and included the hashtag \"harsh motivation\" to push extreme weight loss advice.",
      "Some of those videos included messages or slogans such as \"skinny is a status symbol\" and \"every time you say no to food, you say yes to skinny.\"",
      "TikTok's community guidelines say the platform only allows users over the age of 18 to see content promoting restrictive, low-calorie diets, including videos promoting medications for weight loss or idealizing certain body types. The Chinese-owned platform also says it bans users under the age of 18 from viewing videos that promote cosmetic surgery without warning of the risks, such as before-and-after images, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery.",
      "But CBS News found a range of videos by entering basic search terms on the platform, such as \"skinny,\" \"thin,\" and \"low cal,\" that promoted thin bodies as ideal, while also pushing harmful weight management behaviors. One such video showed an image of a scale with a weight of 39.9 kg (88 pounds) alongside a caption saying \"weight loss\" and the hashtag \"ed,\" which is a common abbreviation for \"eating disorder.\"",
      "Another graphic video with the caption \"ana gives you wings\" showed a series of models with protruding collar bones and spines. The term \"ana\" is an abbreviation for the eating disorder anorexia.",
      "Responding to CBS News' research, a TikTok spokesperson said Thursday that it was \"based on a very limited sample size and does not reflect the experience of the vast majority of our community.\"",
      "\"TikTok does not allow content that promotes disordered eating or extreme weight loss behaviours, and we work with health experts to provide in-app support resources where needed,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson pointed to a study published in May by the University of Southern California, which found that a majority of the eating disorder content on TikTok is discussion among users about recovery from such conditions.",
      "The same study noted, however, the platform's \"dual role in both challenging harmful cultural norms and potentially perpetuating them,\" regarding body image perceptions and eating disorders.",
      "\"We know that this isn't a one-off error on TikTok's part and that children are coming across this content on a scale,\" said Gareth Hill, a spokesperson for the Molly Russell foundation, a charity in the United Kingdom that works to prevent young people from committing self-harm.",
      "\"The question for TikTok is, if this is not representative, then why has this account [created by CBS News], which is a child's account, been shown this content in the first place, and then why is it continuing to get recommended to it?\"",
      "CBS News also found a wide variety of videos available to the under-18 user promoting the weight loss drug Ozempic and various forms of cosmetic surgery. That included videos that showed up on the recommended \"For You\" feed, which promotes cosmetic surgeries such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and liposuction.",
      "In one case, a user talking about their waist reduction surgery included a voiceover saying: \"I would rather die hot than live ugly.\"",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment specifically on CBS News' findings regarding cosmetic surgeries being promoted to underage users.",
      "TikTok says it has taken a range of measures over the past several months to address criticism regarding the availability of extreme weight loss content on the platform. In early June, the platform suspended search results for the viral hashtag #SkinnyTok, after drawing criticism from health experts and European regulators. The hashtag had been associated primarily with videos promoting extreme weight loss, calorie restriction and negative body talk, often presented as wellness advice.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson also told CBS News on Thursday that searches for words or phrases such as #Anorexia would lead users to relevant assistance, including localized eating disorder helplines, where they can access further information and support.",
      "\"I think we're understanding more and more about how this content shows up and so even when you ban a particular hashtag, for example, it's not long until something similar jumps up in its place,\" Doreen Marshall, who leads the American nonprofit National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA], told CBS News.",
      "\"This is going to be an evolving landscape both for creating content guidelines, but also for the platforms themselves and, you know, while some progress has been made, there's clearly more that can be done,\" Marshall said.",
      "TikTok is not the only social media platform that has faced criticism for the accessibility of extreme weight loss content.",
      "In 2022, 60 Minutes reported on a leaked internal document from Meta that showed the company was aware, through its own research, of content on its Instagram platform promoting extreme weight loss and fueling eating disorders in young people.",
      "At the time, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined 60 Minutes' request for an interview but its global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said, \"We want teens to be safe online\" and that Instagram doesn't \"allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders.\"",
      "Last year, 60 Minutes reported that the Google-owned YouTube video platform, which is hugely popular among teenagers, was also serving up extreme weight loss and eating disorder content to children.",

    "summary": "President Trump floated the idea of firing Jerome Powell \u2014 whom he first appointed Federal Reserve chair \u2014 earlier this week, after years of on-and-off criticism over interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump asked about the idea of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in a meeting with lawmakers this week, CBS News has reported, a legally untested move that follows years of on-and-off criticism of the Fed leader leveled by Mr. Trump.",
      "The president's gripes with his handpicked Fed chair \u2014 whom he has called a \"numbskull,\" a \"Trump Hater\" and a \"stubborn mule\" \u2014 have largely focused on the central bank's decision to keep interest rates relatively high so far this year, part of an inflation-fighting campaign. Mr. Trump has also taken aim at Powell's handling of a Federal Reserve office renovation project.",
      "Mr. Trump asked a group of House Republicans if he should fire Powell during a Tuesday night Oval Office meeting, sources told CBS News earlier this week. The president told reporters a day later it's \"highly unlikely\" he'll fire Powell, though he confirmed he spoke to lawmakers about \"the concept of firing him,\" and \"almost all of them said I should.\"",
      "Who is Jerome Powell, and who appointed him?",
      "Powell is the chair of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.",
      "Powell was first nominated as Fed chair by Mr. Trump during his first term, replacing Obama appointee Janet Yellen, and the Senate confirmed him in an 84-13 vote. Former President Joe Biden nominated him to a second term, keeping him in office until May 2026.",
      "\"He's strong, he's committed, he's smart,\" Mr. Trump said in a speech announcing his decision to nominate Powell in 2017, praising Powell's reputation as a \"consensus-builder.\"",
      "Last month, though, Mr. Trump said he initially nominated Powell because he \"listened to someone that I shouldn't have listened to, and Biden shouldn't have reappointed him.\"",
      "Before becoming chair, Powell had served on the central bank's Board of Governors since 2012, when he was initially nominated by former President Barack Obama.",
      "Powell has switched between government and private-sector jobs for much of his career. He worked in investment banking in the 1980s and 1990s, interrupted by a stint as former President George H.W. Bush's undersecretary of the Treasury. For almost 20 years starting in the 1990s, he was a partner at the Carlyle Group investment firm, according to his Fed biography.",
      "A Georgetown-educated lawyer, Powell does not have a Ph.D. in economics, unlike some other former Fed chairs.",
      "Does Jerome Powell have a designated term length?",
      "Federal Reserve chairs serve for four-year terms, so Powell's stint as chair will end in May 2026.",
      "Members of the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors, however, serve for 14 years, and Powell's term as a board member ends in January 2028. Yellen resigned from the board after her term as Fed chair ended, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has encouraged Powell to follow suit, though Powell's plans are unclear.",
      "The chair and board members are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "What does the Federal Reserve do?",
      "The Federal Reserve is the United States' central bank. Made up of 12 regional Federal Reserve banks and a D.C.-based Board of Governors, its responsibilities include regulating the U.S. banking system, serving as a \"lender of last resort\" to banks and running an instant payment system.",
      "But one of the Federal Reserve's highest-profile responsibilities is its role in setting monetary policy. Through its 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, which includes Powell, the Fed works independently of elected officials to influence the supply of money in the U.S. economy and the interest rates at which it's lent out, with an eye toward keeping unemployment low and prices stable.",
      "Those two goals \u2014 maximizing employment and minimizing inflation \u2014 are known as the Fed's \"dual mandate.\" But they're in conflict with each other. If the Fed lowers interest rates, it can boost economic growth, but it also runs the risk of overheating the economy and pushing up inflation. And if interest rates are hiked, inflation tends to cool off, but the economy slows down.",
      "The interest rate that the Fed targets is called the Federal Funds Rate, which is what banks charge to lend money to each other overnight. But other interest rates \u2014 from mortgage rates to yields for U.S. government bonds \u2014 tend to follow closely with the Federal Funds Rate, so the Fed's decisions impact borrowing costs for average American consumers and businesses.",
      "Picking the right balance isn't easy, and the Fed often faces criticism for its choices.",
      "Under Powell, the Fed dropped its target interest rate to near 0% at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, with the goal of averting an economic catastrophe. But after the economy recovered and inflation soared, the central bank in 2023 hiked interest rates to their highest point in decades, aiming to get inflation under control. The Fed has taken a cautious path since then, cutting rates slightly last year as inflation fell but keeping them steady so far this year.",
      "Last month, the Fed's rate-setting committee said it may cut rates later this year, but there are concerns that inflation \u2014 which is still above the Fed's 2%-per-year target \u2014 could worsen. Powell has also suggested the Fed is concerned Mr. Trump's tariffs could increase inflation.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,\" Powell said last month.",
      "Why is Trump unhappy with the Fed and Jerome Powell?",
      "Mr. Trump is unhappy with the Fed's decision to leave rates stable. For months, the president has pushed the central bank to slash rates immediately, calling Powell \"Mr. Too Late.\"",
      "The president argued last month that inflation is already low enough to start cutting rates.",
      "\"If he was concerned about Inflation or anything else, then all he has to do is bring the Rate down, so we can benefit on Interest Costs, and raise it in the future when and if these 'other elements' happen (which I doubt they will!),\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "He's not the first president to criticize the Fed for high interest rates, which make everything from car loans to mortgages more expensive and can put a damper on the economic growth that tends to make or break presidents' popularity. But Mr. Trump has been unusually vocal.",
      "In a mid-June post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump called Powell a \"Total and Complete Moron\" and urged the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee to \"override\" him. While Powell is just one of 12 votes on the committee, the chair traditionally has an outsize role in its decisions. The last few decisions to leave interest rates stable have been unanimous.",
      "Mr. Trump had similar issues with Powell during his first term, saying during an earlier interest rate-hiking campaign in 2018 that he was \"not even a little bit happy with my selection\" of Powell. When the Fed cut rates in 2020, Mr. Trump called Powell his \"most improved player.\"",
      "Meanwhile, members of the Trump administration have pressured Powell over a yearslong renovation to the Fed's headquarters complex. In a letter to the central banker, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought called some of the features \"ostentatious,\" and alleged that Powell may have misled Congress about the project's scope or made changes to the plans without getting permission from the right federal bodies.",
      "Mr. Trump has also criticized Powell over the renovations. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he's \"highly unlikely\" to fire Powell \"unless he has to leave for fraud.\" At other points, Mr. Trump has suggested Powell should resign over the project.",
      "Powell said last year he would not resign as chair if asked to do so.",
      "Powell defended the Fed's handling of the project in a letter to Vought and denied allegations that it was overly lavish, saying the Fed has \"taken great care to ensure the project is carefully overseen.\" He also said the project has been \"subject to budget approval\" by board members annually. Powell added the Fed has only \"made a small number of design changes to scale back or eliminate certain elements,\" so no further government review is needed.",
      "The Fed typically operates with a high degree of independence over its own budget, and legally has the power to buy and remodel office spaces in Washington, D.C., as it sees fit.",
      "Is the Fed independent from the rest of the government? And can Trump fire Powell?",
      "The structure of the Fed \u2014 with board members and chairs who serve across multiple administrations \u2014 allows it to make decisions without direct input from politicians.",
      "Whether the president can fire Powell before his term ends is legally untested. Federal law says members of the Federal Reserve board can only be removed by the president before their terms end \"for cause,\" and the Supreme Court found in 1935 that Congress is allowed to limit the grounds on which the president can fire members of independent federal boards.",
      "In May, the high court did allow Mr. Trump to fire members of federal labor boards, but it exempted the Federal Reserve, which it called a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "Any attempt to fire Powell before his term ends could also roil financial markets, analysts and lawmakers from both parties have warned. Mr. Trump acknowledged this risk Wednesday, telling Just The News in an interview, \"They say it would disrupt the market if I did.\"",
      "At some points in the Federal Reserve's 112-year history, including during World War II, the central bank has been more beholden to the needs of the Treasury. But the Fed has operated more independently since 1951, when a public disagreement between the Fed and the Truman administration led the Treasury to agree to let the central bank set interest rates on its own.",
      "There's nothing preventing the president from publicly expressing his views about the Fed, though, as several of Mr. Trump's predecessors have. During his campaign last year, Mr. Trump said he should have \"at least [a] say\" in the moves made by the central bank.",
      "\"In my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve, or the chairman,\" Mr. Trump said in an August 2024 press briefing.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in April that Mr. Trump \"has the right to express his displeasure with the Fed, and he has the right to say he believes interest rates should be lower.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Jul 2025 21:09:00 -0400",
    "summary": "FDA regulators said Juul's studies show its e-cigarettes are less harmful for adult smokers, who can benefit from switching completely to vaping.",
    "story": [
      "Vaping brand Juul is allowed to keep its electronic cigarettes on the market, the Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday.",
      "FDA regulators said Juul's studies show its e-cigarettes are less harmful for adult smokers, who can benefit from switching completely to vaping.",
      "The decision comes after the brand has struggled for years after being widely blamed for sparking the teen vaping trend.",
      "The FDA decision applies to both tobacco- and menthol-flavored versions of the reusable product, which works with nicotine-filled cartridges sold in two different strengths. Juul previously discontinued several fruit and candy flavors that helped drive its popularity but were favored by teens.",
      "Juul will be one of only two U.S. companies authorized to sell menthol-flavored vapes, which many adults prefer to tobacco flavor.",
      "\"This is an important milestone for the company and I think we made a scientifically sound case for the role that menthol can play in e-vapor,\" Juul CEO K.C. Crosthwaite told The Associated Press.",
      "Critic calls decision \"a big step in the wrong direction\"",
      "Parents, politicians and anti-tobacco groups are certain to oppose the FDA's decision. They have argued for years that Juul products should be permanently banned due to their role in triggering a yearslong spike in underage vaping.",
      "\"It is a big step in the wrong direction to authorize sales of the product that was responsible for this public health crisis in the first place,\" Yolonda Richardson, CEO of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in a statement.",
      "Juul was once valued at more than $13 billion, and its small, sleek e-cigarettes revolutionized the image and technology of the vaping industry. But the company has since been forced to slash hundreds of jobs and pay billions to settle lawsuits over its role in the rise of youth vaping.",
      "The FDA had ordered the company to remove its products from the market in June 2022. But then the agency abruptly reversed course days later and agreed to reopen its scientific review of Juul's application after the company pushed back in court.",
      "At the time, the FDA had raised concerns over \"potentially harmful chemicals\" in Juul's e-cigarettes and \"insufficient and conflicting data\" it said the company had submitted.",
      "Juul said regulators had overlooked thousands of pages of scientific data critical to its submission.",
      "Authorized, not endorsed by the FDA",
      "Thursday's announcement is not an approval or endorsement, and the FDA reiterated that people who do not smoke should not use Juul or any other e-cigarettes. The FDA determination indicates that smokers who switch completely to Juul can reduce their exposure to deadly carcinogens and other chemicals found in traditional cigarettes.",
      "The FDA decision applies to Juul's original system, which is now roughly a decade old. Crosthwaite said the company hopes to win authorization for its next-generation device and is also considering applying to the FDA for more flavors.",
      "\"It's critically important that American adults who use tobacco have regulated options,\" Crosthwaite said.",
      "In recent years, the FDA has authorized a handful of e-cigarettes to help adult smokers cut back on cigarettes. Juul's main competitors, Vuse and Njoy, each previously received FDA permission to remain on the market. Njoy sells the only other menthol-flavored e-cigarettes authorized by the FDA.",
      "To meet FDA requirements, companies must show that their products benefit public health. In practice, that means proving that adult smokers who use them are likely to quit or reduce their smoking, while teens are unlikely to get hooked on them.",
      "Juul's journey, from launch to lawsuits",
      "The brainchild of two Stanford University students, Juul launched in 2015 and within two years rocketed to the top of the vaping market.",
      "Juul quickly outpaced older brands with its high-nicotine, fruity-flavored cartridges, sold in mango, mint and creme brul\u00e9e. The company's small, discrete devices provided a more potent, user-friendly alternative to older, bulkier devices.",
      "But the company's rise was fueled by underage use, and e-cigarettes quickly became ubiquitous in U.S. schools. In 2019, the company was pressured into halting all advertising and eliminating most of its flavors, leaving only tobacco and menthol-flavored options.",
      "By then, the company was already the target of multiple investigations and lawsuits by federal, state and local officials, as well as class-action attorneys.",
      "In 2022, the company paid $1.7 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits brought by families of Juul users, school districts, city governments and Native American tribes. The company separately agreed to pay $1.1 billion to settle lawsuits or investigations from most U.S. states.",
      "Juul is no longer the top-selling e-cigarette brand and now trails Vuse, which is sold by tobacco giant Reynolds American, which also makes Camel and Newport cigarettes.",
      "Teens have shifted away from Juul amid a wider drop in vaping, according to the latest federal figures. The FDA reported last year that teen vaping dropped to a 10-year low, after stepped-up enforcement against unauthorized brands imported from China, such as Elf Bar.",
      "Unlike Juul, disposable e-cigarettes like Elf Bar still come in fruit and candy flavors, despite efforts by regulators to block their use.",

    "summary": "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested that changes might be coming to the rules limiting liquids in carry on-bags.",
    "story": [
      "Air travelers may soon see another change when passing through security checkpoints at airports, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggesting there may be changes to current TSA restrictions on liquids in carry-on bags.",
      "The potential change in policies around carrying liquids on flights comes after Noem on July 8 said passengers at airports no longer have to remove their shoes during regular TSA security checks. That change went into effect immediately.",
      "Speaking at a conference hosted Wednesday by publication The Hill, Noem said she's questioning \"everything TSA does\" and spoke of possible changes to the amount of liquids travelers can tote in their carry-on baggage. Under current TSA guidance, travelers can carry liquids in travel-sized containers of 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) or less per item in their carry-on bag.",
      "\"The liquids, I'm questioning. So that may be the next big announcement is what size your liquids need to be,\" Noem said. \"We have put in place in TSA a multilayered screening process that allows us to change some of how we do security and screening so it's still as safe.\"",
      "She gave no details about precisely what those changes might be or how quickly travelers could expect to see them.",
      "Travelers generally must empty or throw away their water bottles before going through a TSA checkpoint, or else pack containers with more than 3.4 ounces of liquid in their checked baggage. There are exceptions for medications and baby formula.",
      "The TSA has been exploring the liquids issue for years, former TSA Administrator John Pistole told CBS News' Kris Van Cleave earlier this month. The TSA has been installing new computed tomography, or CT, checkpoint scanners at airports, which generates a 3-D image of a bag's content and which can automatically detect other potential security hazards.",
      "When were liquids restricted on planes?",
      "The rules for liquids on flights were a response to a 2006 incident in which authorities foiled a plot to used liquid explosives smuggled aboard carry-on luggage to blow up planes.",
      "Ever since the guidelines were adopted, TSA checkpoints have been the scene of travelers quickly guzzling water, digging through luggage to find and discard a too-large tube of hair gel, and chucking jars of everything from jam to coffee that didn't meet the size requirement.",
      "The regulations also triggered myriad discussions \u2014 sometimes arguments \u2014 over what constitutes a liquid. Yogurt? Peanut butter? Jam and jelly? All are currently restricted to containers no bigger than 3.4 ounces as detailed on an extensive list that TSA maintains on its website titled \"What can I bring?\"",
      "Noem also laid out her vision for the future of airport travel during the talk Wednesday.",
      "\"Hopefully, the future of an airport, where I'm looking to go is that you walk in the door with your carry-on suitcase, you walk through a scanner and go right to your plane,\" she said. \"It takes you one minute.\"",

    "summary": "A top White House budget official said President Trump is \"troubled\" by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's management, as Mr. Trump pressures him over interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "A top Trump administration official accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of leading an \"ostentatious\" office renovation project that may be \"violating the law,\" a new broadside against the central bank chief as President Trump tangles with him over interest rates.",
      "\"The President is extremely troubled by your management of the Federal Reserve System,\" Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought wrote in a July 10 letter.",
      "The letter came after months of criticism from Mr. Trump over the Fed's decision not to slash interest rates. Economists say lowering rates may accelerate economic growth, but it also runs the risk of causing inflation to spike. That has led the Fed's interest rate-setting committee \u2014 which Powell chairs \u2014 to keep rates steady so far this year after cutting rates slightly last year.",
      "Mr. Trump has called on Powell to resign from his post, and last month, the president called Powell a \"numbskull\" over his interest rate decisions and said \"maybe\" he'll try to fire Powell \u2014 though federal law states the Fed chair can only be fired \"for cause,\" which typically refers to firings due to specific misconduct or performance issues. In the past, Mr. Trump had said he doesn't plan on trying to fire Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends next year.",
      "Vought's letter took aim at Powell and the central bank over its yearslong office renovation project in Washington, D.C. The letter said plans for the project \"called for rooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more.\" Vought also asked whether the Fed has made changes to its plans without seeking approval from a government commission that oversees D.C.-area federal building projects.",
      "In testimony to the Senate last month, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project \"misleading and inaccurate.\" He told lawmakers there isn't any new marble aside from what's necessary to replace broken old marble, and said there are no \"special elevators,\" new water features or rooftop gardens.",
      "\"All of the sort of inflammatory things that the media carried are either not in the current plan or just inaccurate,\" Powell said.",
      "Vought's letter argued that comment to the Senate \"appears to reveal that the project is out of compliance with the approved plan,\" suggesting the Fed may have run afoul of a law requiring D.C.-area projects be approved by the National Capital Planning Commission. In a post on X, the Office of Management and Budget alleged Powell \"slipped up and revealed he might...be violating the law.\" The Fed's renovation plans were reviewed by the commission several years ago.",
      "Powell defended the Fed's handling of the project in a letter Thursday responding to Vought, saying the Fed has \"taken great care to ensure the project is carefully overseen.\" He also said the project has been \"subject to budget approval\" by board members annually.",
      "The Fed chair said the Fed generally isn't subject to the National Capital Planning Commission's approval, but it did work with the agency \"voluntarily\" in 2020 and 2021. Since then, Powell said, the central bank has only \"made a small number of design changes to scale back or eliminate certain elements,\" so no further review by the commission is needed.",
      "The Fed typically operates with a much higher degree of independence than most other government institutions. Federal law gives the Fed the power to make decisions about acquiring and remodeling buildings in Washington to serve as its office spaces.",
      "The Fed has previously acknowledged\u00a0that the price tag for its office renovations had jumped due to \"significant increases in raw materials costs,\" along with higher labor costs.",
      "On its website, the Fed says the two headquarters buildings that are getting overhauled \"have not been comprehensively renovated since their construction in the 1930s.\" The central bank said there are no private elevators or new VIP dining rooms \u2014 instead, the project will refurbish old elevators and conference rooms, including ones that are sometimes \"used for mealtime meetings.\" It also said plans for new water features were scrapped, though existing fountains will be repaired, and the garden terrace is actually a \"ground-level front lawn.\"",
      "On July 2, Bill Pulte, the Trump-nominated head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, accused Powell of \"deceptive\" testimony to the Senate about the office project.",
      "When asked about the allegation in a recent Cabinet meeting, Mr. Trump said: \"Then he [Powell] should resign immediately. We should get somebody in it that's going to lower interest rates.\"",

    "summary": "The GENIUS Act is the first major crypto legislation ever passed by Congress.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House on Thursday passed a landmark piece of legislation to regulate cryptocurrency after its fate appeared in limbo when right-wing Republicans staged a rebellion that brought the floor to a standstill.",
      "The bill, known as the\u00a0GENIUS Act, is the first major crypto legislation ever passed by Congress. It now heads to President Trump's desk.",
      "It passed in a bipartisan vote of 308 to 122, with 206 Republicans and 102 Democrats supporting it.",
      "On Tuesday, a dozen conservatives sank a procedural vote to advance three crypto bills, including the GENIUS Act, which establishes a regulatory framework for the $250 billion market for\u00a0stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, abruptly canceled the remaining floor votes and the holdouts went to the White House to meet Mr. Trump, who later announced that they \"have all agreed\" to fall in line.",
      "But drama unfolded during Wednesday's procedural vote when a few holdouts initially voted against moving forward before dropping their opposition, which was short-lived. The next procedural vote to set up debate on the spate of bills was held open for nearly 10 hours as the holdouts sought to merge a broader market structure bill with legislation to ban a central bank digital currency.",
      "Republican Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, who leads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said holdouts had made a deal with Mr. Trump to package the two digital asset measures.",
      "The plan ran into opposition from those who wrote the legislation and upended what House Republicans had termed \"crypto week.\"",
      "House Republicans had originally wanted the GENIUS Act to be married with the CLARITY Act, a broader bill that would set rules for when a digital asset is considered a commodity or security. Combining the crypto bills would have sent the legislation back to the Senate and slowed the process. Mr. Trump had pressed Congress to quickly pass the GENIUS Act as a standalone bill, saying it would make the U.S. a leader in digital assets.",
      "This week, conservatives pushed to tie the CLARITY Act with the controversial Anti-Central Bank Digital Currency Surveillance State Act, which would prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency. Conservatives said the Senate's stablecoin bill and the broader market structure legislation were insufficient because it would allow for a central bank digital currency, which they opposed.",
      "\"We feel like we need to be dealing with all this at once,\" said Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, who helped stall the bill.",
      "A deal was ultimately made late Wednesday to\u00a0tie the ban on a central bank digital currency with the must-pass annual defense reauthorization bill, and holdouts again flipped their votes to allow the legislative process to move on.",
      "The Senate\u00a0approved the bipartisan stablecoin bill last month after experiencing hiccups caused by a Democratic revolt over concerns about the Trump family's business ventures involving crypto and the potential that they could make the president vulnerable to foreign influence.",
      "The Trump family's crypto investments have increased their wealth by billions\u00a0of dollars in recent months as the administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole. The White House has denied that there are any conflicts of interest and said Mr. Trump's assets are in a trust managed by his children.",
      "Democratic critics were also worried that the legislation did not contain strong enough provisions to protect consumers, the financial system and national security.",
      "It's faced similar criticism from House Democrats.",
      "\"By passing this bill, Congress will be telling the world that Congress is OK with corruption, OK with foreign companies buying influence,\" Rep. Maxine Waters of California, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said Thursday.",
      "Democrats who back the legislation have argued that regulations are long overdue, even if the measure is imperfect.",
      "\"The question is, do you want some rules of the road or no rules of the road?\" Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey said during floor debate.",

Forty-four percent said they are worried about inflation, while 34% indicated they are worried about a recession or stock market downturn.",

      "The park's emphasis on storytelling and attention to detail is still evident today in theme parks across the world.",
      "Disneyland now ranks as the world's second-most visited theme park, closely behind Magic Kingdom at Disney World in Florida, which opened in 1971. According to the Themed Entertainment Association, Disneyland drew more than 17 million people in 2023, bouncing back from an unprecedented 13-month closure during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The park was built on what was once orange groves in Anaheim, just outside Los Angeles. It opened on July 17, 1955 \u2014 a year that also saw Ray Kroc start his first McDonald's restaurant and Jim Henson introduce his original version of Kermit the Frog.",
      "Disneyland's first day was famously a disaster, all broadcast on a live television special. The park opened just a year after its groundbreaking and simply wasn't ready for its big day.",
      "Attractions broke down, there weren't enough restrooms, food and drinks were in short supply, traffic backed up for miles and the shoes of the first guests sank into freshly paved asphalt.",
      "Among the original rides still around today are the Mad Tea Party, Peter Pan's Flight and Jungle Cruise.",
      "The cost to get in that first year was $1 for adults and 50 cents for children, although tickets for most rides were an additional 10 to 50 cents.",
      "Today, a one-day ticket starts at more than $100 and on some days can double that.",
      "Over the years, the park has hosted U.S. presidents, kings and queens, and countless celebrities. A few even got their start at Disneyland \u2014 actor Kevin Costner was a skipper on the Jungle Cruise and comedian Steve Martin worked at a magic shop where he learned about being a performer.",

      "The resort in Anaheim now includes Disney California Adventure and Downtown Disney, a shopping and entertainment district.",
      "While Disneyland still features many of the touches Walt Disney oversaw himself, the original park is ever-evolving, sometimes to the dismay of its loyal fans. In 2019, the park unveiled Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, an attraction that transports visitors to the Star Wars universe, with \"movie-accurate starships, fan-favorite characters roaming the land and an immersive audioscape, world,\" according to the Disneyland Resort website.",
      "Some of the moves have been made to keep up with a changing society, while others have been made to introduce more thrilling attractions with the latest technology to keep up with competitors.",

    "published": "Thu, 17 Jul 2025 11:56:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump threatens to raise tariffs, claiming the European Union won't buy U.S. cars or food \u2014 but 2024 trade data shows otherwise.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. and European Union have just weeks to reach a new trade deal before President Trump plans to impose a 30% tariff on most imports from the 27 EU member countries starting Aug. 1.",
      "The EU negotiates trade policy as a single entity and was the U.S.'s top goods trading partner in 2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. In 2024, the U.S. imported around $606 billion in goods from the EU and exported around $370 billion worth of products to it.",
      "EU leaders have warned they're prepared to impose higher tariffs on hundreds of U.S. imports unless a deal can be reached in the coming weeks. Economists say the dispute could drive up consumer prices on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "Mr. Trump has defended tariffs as necessary to protect American workers, pointing to the trade imbalance on goods and higher EU tariffs as evidence the bloc has treated the U.S unfairly for years.",
      "The president has also repeatedly said the European Union does not buy American cars or agricultural products. However, trade data from 2024 shows that's inaccurate. While the U.S. has imported more cars and agricultural products from Europe in recent years than it exports there, the EU remains a significant market for these American products.",
      "Here's a breakdown of the data.",
      "EU is the U.S.'s fourth largest buyer of agricultural products",
      "President Trump has repeatedly suggested Europe does not buy agricultural goods from U.S. farmers and producers.",
      "\"The European Union is, in many ways, nastier than China, OK?,\" President Trump said at an event May 12. \"They sell us their agricultural products. We sell them virtually none. They don't take our products.\"",
      "But according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the EU was the fourth-largest buyer of American agricultural products in 2024, purchasing a record $12.8 billion in these goods. Top exports to the EU included oilseeds like sunflower and sesame seeds, nuts and processed nut products like peanut butter, and soybeans.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. imported $36 billion in agricultural products from the EU in 2024 \u2014 buying billions of dollars worth of European wine, animal products, and grains and feeds.",
      "The White House has not responded to a request for clarification on the president's claim.",
      "Before Mr. Trump raised tariffs to a baseline of 10% in April, the EU maintained a higher average tariff on foreign agricultural products than the United States. In 2023, the EU average tariff on foreign agricultural goods was 10.8%, compared to the U.S. rate of 5%.",
      "Certain American food products are also less available in Europe because of consumer preferences and regulations, as the EU bans some American food products that contain certain additives they have deemed unsafe for human consumption.",
      "EU buys more than 160,000 American vehicles each year",
      "Another frequent target of President Trump's criticism is the EU's trade imbalance on cars.",
      "\"They sell us 13 million cars. We sell them none,\" Mr. Trump claimed at an event in May.",
      "It is true that the United States imports far more European vehicles than the number of American-made vehicles it exports to the EU, but the EU does buy some American cars.",
      "In 2024, the EU imported about 165,000 American vehicles, valued at roughly $8.8 billion at current exchange rates, according to a report by the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. By comparison, the same data shows the U.S. imported about 750,000 vehicles from the EU in 2024, worth $43 billion.",
      "A post shared by CBS News Confirmed (@cbsnewsconfirmed)",
      "Both trading partners have long imposed tariffs on foreign vehicles. The EU charges a 10% tariff on U.S. passenger cars, while the U.S. charged 2.5% on EU passenger cars until Mr. Trump raised the tariff on all foreign vehicles to 25%. The U.S. has also maintained a 25% tariff on EU pickup trucks since the 1960s.",
      "Apart from tariffs, industry analysts say U.S. cars are less competitive in the EU market for a number of other reasons, including that the member nations tend to have higher fuel economy standards, higher gas costs, and their buyers tend to prefer smaller cars.",
      "Other major products include pharmaceuticals and crude oil",
      "Though Mr. Trump often focuses on cars, they're not the biggest sector. Biological products and medication are actually the top commodities the U.S. imports from the EU, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. This is driven partly by some American pharmaceutical companies maintaining manufacturing facilities in EU countries with lower corporate tax rates like Ireland.",
      "In recent weeks, President Trump has floated tariff rates as high as 200% on foreign-made pharmaceuticals unless companies onshore manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "On the export side, the top U.S. exports to the EU include oil and natural gas, airplanes, and immunological products like blood plasma.",
      "Over the weekend, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the EU still hopes to reach a new agreement with the U.S.",
      "\"We have always been clear that we prefer a negotiated solution,\" von der Leyen said, adding, \"We will continue to prepare countermeasures so we are fully prepared.\"",

      "That's according to a new\u00a0survey from the National Retail Federation (NRF), which indicates that students and their parents are getting an early start on shopping this year, hunting for deals as they navigate\u00a0economic uncertainty. More than half of consumers surveyed, 51%, cited concerns over tariffs as the reason why they were starting school shopping earlier this year.",
      "\"Consumers are being mindful of the potential impacts of tariffs and inflation on back-to-school items, and have turned to early shopping, discount stores and summer sales for savings on school essentials,\" Katherine Cullen, NRF vice president of industry and consumer insights, said in a statement.",
      "The price of school supplies and books has already reached an all-time high, data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Saint Louis\u00a0shows. However, consumers worry that the cost of items could go up even more once the full brunt of President Trump's tariffs take effect.",
      "Mr. Trump recently announced on Truth Social that he would\u00a0place steep tariffs\u00a0on over 20 countries, starting on Aug. 1. The levies could directly impact the cost of apparel and other\u00a0back-to-school items\u00a0like electronics that are imported from abroad.",
      "In its report, the NRF predicts families will spend a total of $128.2 billion on supplies this year, up from $125.4 billion last year.

    "summary": "The ruling targets a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule that would have removed medical debt from 15 million credit reports.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge has blocked a rule issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in January that would have removed unpaid medical debt from the credit reports of about 15 million consumers.",
      "The ruling, issued Friday by Judge Sean Jordan of the U.S. District Court of Texas' Eastern District, orders that the rule be vacated because of the court's finding that the CFPB exceeded its authority under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. After the CFPB issued the rule in January, the Cornerstone Credit Union League and the Consumer Data Industry Association, a trade group for the credit reporting industry, had filed a lawsuit to halt it.",
      "The court's decision could impact the roughly 15 million people who carry a total of about $49 billion in medical debt on their credit reports, a burden that can influence whether lenders decide whether to extend loans like mortgages or auto loans to consumers. At the time when the CFPB issued the rule, the agency noted that medical debt is a poor predictor of whether a consumer will make good on other types of loans.",
      "\"It doesn't show whether they are likely to pay their mortgage or other debts because there are a lot of inaccuracies and they have a lot of disputes,\" Julie Margetta Morgan, former associate director of research, monitoring and regulations at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The CFPB's rule had been hailed by consumer advocates for helping to protect consumers who can get tangled up in complicated issues around medical debt, such as problems with insurance reimbursements, denials and other snafus.",
      "\"By pulling back on this rule, the court has eliminated the CFPB's ability to provide that kind of relief to people and give this certainty that they can work with their health care provider to make sure the bills they are paying are accurate, without being hounded by a debt collector,\" added Margetta Morgan, who currently serves as the president of The Century Foundation, a left-leaning policy think tank.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "What does the ruling say about medical debt and credit reports?",
      "Jordan ruled that the \"medical debt rule exceeds the [CFBP]'s statutory authority by violating the plain text\" of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA, a 1970 law that oversees credit reporting.",
      "\"The rule exceeded the CFPB's statutory authority because FCRA explicitly allows credit reporting agencies to report, and creditors to obtain and use, information about medical debt that is properly coded to obscure the name of the provider and the nature of the services provided,\" Dan Smith, CEO of the Consumer Data Industry Association, said in a July 11\u00a0statement.",
      "Had the CFPB rule gone into effect?",
      "No, the rule hadn't yet gone into effect, according to Jordan's ruling.",
      "While the rule was slated to take effect about 60 days after it was published, the CFPB asked for a three-month delay after the Trump administration put new leadership at its helm, the decision noted. That request was granted by the court as the lawsuit to block the rule moved forward.",
      "Could the court decision be appealed?",
      "It's unclear. While the CFPB could appeal in theory, the agency is now essentially in a state of limbo.",
      "In February, President Trump appointed White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought as acting director of the CFPB. Days after his appointment, Vought issued a memo to CFPB staff that directed employees not to issue any proposed or formal rules, stop pending investigations and not open new investigations, among other actions.",
      "What steps are available to consumers with medical debt?",
      "According to the CFPB, 20% of Americans has at least one medical debt collection account on their credit reports, while and over half of the collections on credit reports are for medical debt.",
      "In some states, consumers can rely on government protections to help them with medical debt and their credit reports, Morgan noted. Colorado and New York both enacted laws in 2023 that provide some protections for consumers who have medical debt, for instance.",
      "And last year, Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, the three national credit reporting agencies, said that they were removing medical collections debt under $500 from U.S. consumer credit reports.",
      "\"From my experience reading these accounts from consumers, there are a lot of flaws in our medical billing and reporting system, and it lands in the consumer's lap and they are supposed to try to figure out how to deal with it,\" Morgan said. \"I would make sure the bills you receive are accurate,\" as well as check whether your insurer is paying the correct amount, she added.",

    "summary": "Republicans and MAGA remain solidly behind Trump.",
    "story": [
      "After six months that included a string of achievements on President Trump's legislative goals, views of his second term are increasingly defined by the difference between his political base, which likes what it sees, and the rest of the country, which has growing doubt.",
      "On the economic front, it comes from continued calls to focus more on prices, rather than tariffs, which most Americans oppose. And now, there's the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which at least initially, most believe will help the wealthy.",
      "On matters of deportation, differences hinge on who, and how many, Americans see as being targeted, as well as the use of detention facilities. Here again, the Republican and MAGA political base remain overwhelmingly approving of it all, but the rest of the American public has become less so.",
      "(On another matter, by comparison, most say the case of Jeffrey Epstein is not very important in their evaluations of the president, and in particular, the president's MAGA base remains overwhelmingly approving of his job performance, especially on immigration.)",
      "Most now say the administration is not prioritizing dangerous criminals for deportation and also is deporting more people than they thought it would.",
      "The program had majority support earlier in the term, but today it does not, moving along with that perception of who is being deported.",
      "Meanwhile, most disapprove of the way the administration is using detention facilities.",
      "Approval of the deportation program has slipped over these months to become slightly net-negative now, with support becoming more exclusively drawn from Republicans and MAGA identifiers.",
      "Hispanic Americans, along with Americans overall, say Hispanic people are being targeted more than others for searches, and those who think so say that's unfair.",
      "As a result, Hispanic approval of the deportation program and of Mr. Trump more generally is lower today than it was earlier in the term. (For broader context, too, during the 2024 election, Mr. Trump made gains with Hispanic voters and started his term with approval from half of Hispanics. Today he has one-third.)",
      "This, despite widespread public views that Mr. Trump's policies have reduced border crossings.",
      "That suggests that Mr. Trump's declining marks on immigration generally are more connected to his deportation program than activity at the border, these days.",
      "And on balance, it's an example of how a policy pendulum can swing in American politics: in the first year of Joe Biden's presidency, most Americans said he and Democrats were not being tough enough on immigration. Today, most Americans say Mr. Trump and the Republicans are being too tough.",
      "Half the country (again, largely outside that political base) now says the president is focusing too much on deportation.",
      "Economics, tariffs and \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\"",
      "What do people want Mr. Trump to focus on? That part isn't news: it's still prices, as it's been throughout the term. Seven in 10 say the administration isn't doing enough to try to lower them.",
      "Inflation and prices are important to most in how they evaluate Mr. Trump overall.",
      "Nearly two-thirds now disapprove of how Mr. Trump is handling inflation, the highest disapproval for him on that yet.",
      "And for the first time, a plurality says the administration is focusing too much on cutting spending.",
      "More broadly, and after having campaigned heavily on immigration and inflation, most Americans still say Mr. Trump is doing what he promised in the campaign. However, fewer say that now than did near the beginning of his term, with the difference being in part, fewer independents and fewer Democrats thinking so. Republicans largely say it's consistent.",
      "On the debate, such as it is, around interest rates, Americans are split in their general desire for the economy \u2014 whether the bigger priority should be to keep interest rates where they are to control inflation, or lower them to make borrowing money easier.",
      "Amid the discussion surrounding Mr. Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a large majority say the Fed should act independently from the president.",
      "But there's a caveat to all this, as many admit they don't know a lot about what the Fed does.",
      "Powell gets mixed confidence, with Democrats expressing more confidence in him than Republicans, perhaps another example of how partisanship may stand in for more technical economic viewpoints.",
      "Six in 10 disapprove of the One Big Beautiful Bill legislation. Views of it today are similar to what they were before the bill was passed: Most think it will hurt poor people and help the wealthy. Fewer believe it will help the middle or working class.",
      "With so many Americans saying they don't know a lot of the bill's specifics, the initial response to it appears very partisan, opening up what may be a months-long fight to define and sell it.",
      "And so Mr. Trump's overall approval also continues to slide as it has consistently, if incrementally, since the start of his term. It's now closer to where it spent a lot of time in his first term, in the low 40s, with similar structure underneath of negative sentiment beyond that strong approval from the base.",
      "Most MAGA back Trump on Epstein matter",
      "For all the week's punditry, the matter over the Epstein files isn't affecting Mr. Trump's overall approval among his MAGA base. For one thing, Republicans and MAGA like his handling of immigration, especially, and say they gauge him on that more.",
      "The Epstein case doesn't compare on importance. Few Republicans, including MAGA, say issues surrounding the Epstein case matter \"a lot\" to how they evaluate Mr. Trump's presidency.",
      "That said, there is some relative dissatisfaction within the GOP, including in the MAGA base, with how the administration is handling it.",
      "Americans do want the files released \u2014 that includes Democrats, Republicans, MAGA in particular, across a wide range of groups.",
      "Americans overwhelmingly suspect that the files contain damaging information about powerful and wealthy people.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,343 U.S. adults interviewed between July 16-18, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote. The margin of error is \u00b12.5 points.",

      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "We begin with a new CBS poll. Six months into President Trump's second administration, 42 percent of Americans approve of the job he's doing as president, down three points from a month ago, and down even more from February, when a majority approved of his job performance.",
      "For a closer look at the numbers, we're joined by elections and surveys, executive director Anthony Salvanto.",
      "Anthony, good to have you here.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the two big issues the president ran on, immigration and the economy, why have his approval ratings ticked down?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, let me start with immigration, because you're right, that is a big reason he won, deportation, in particular.",
      "The deportation program started with majority approval. And since then, it's declined gradually and then a little more over the last month. But the reason for why it has is pretty compelling, and that is a majority now says they think the administration is trying to deport more people than they'd expected it to.",
      "And then it's the who. They no longer \u2013 a majority no longer thinks that the administration is just trying to prioritize dangerous criminals, that that has expanded. And when they think those things, they're less approving of it overall.",
      "So, another component of this too, which is that you get a majority who doesn't approve of the way in which the administration is using the detention centers as well. So all of that is in the mix. The other part of this, though, is that Donald Trump's handling of immigration more broadly is also down.",
      "And that's happening at the same time that Americans say, because they are, that border crossings have gone down. So, within that gauge on immigration, you see how much the deportation program is really driving things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we have seen and CBS obtained data that the number one issue in terms of convictions for traffic violations and then immigration.",
      "You looked in your polling at the supporters of the president. How are they feeling?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Very, very strongly behind him and especially on this immigration issue and especially on deportation.",
      "And that's an important point, right? His base is still with him. What you see in this dynamic is increasingly a base that really likes what it sees and everybody else with growing doubts. The other part of this is, on the deportation program in particular, we have seen declines among Hispanic Americans, and here again, the why.",
      "Hispanic Americans and Americans overall believe that they, Hispanics, are being targeted or sought after for more searches for deportation compared to other groups. Earlier in the president's term, he had much more overall approval from Hispanics. He had made gains during the election, people will recall, importantly among Hispanics, and now that has fallen off.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president just had this big legislative win with the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill. This was tax. This was spending. A lot of these changes haven't taken hold yet. But what is the perception of it?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: So let's benchmark this. He's got majority disapproval on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's interesting.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: And the why there is, and this is at least initially, as we say, it's that more people think that it will help the wealthy and not help them in particular.",
      "And here we get into focus, because people say the administration is not focused enough on lowering prices and is focused too much on tariffs, which a majority opposes. It's a \u2013 here, there's that juxtaposition of what they expected, what they want to focus on, and what they see as being focused on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president has been talking about firing the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell. We know the Supreme Court said back in May, they signaled here, he doesn't really have the authority to do it without cause.",
      "But we know the Fed's job is to manage employment, manage price stability, and they're supposed to be politically independent, so that there is an interference with the economy. Have you ever polled before on whether there should be \u2013 that the president should really be able to do this?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: We haven't. Most people say they think the Fed should act independently from the president's guidance.",
      "But on that larger point about the way institutions work, we have sometimes asked questions in this administration about things like, who should have the power of the purse? Who should have the final say on spending? We have asked about things like pushing back against judges who rule against the administration.",
      "All of these things, for context, are new. Now, this obviously isn't the first president to try to expand executive power. And that has a long history in politics and in polling. But some of these institutional arrangements and public views of them are certainly new for us here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have a reason to ask, in other words.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's fascinating.",
      "Anthony Salvanto, thank you.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For more on the Trump administration's economic policy, we go now to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.",
      "Welcome back to Face the Nation, Mr. Secretary.",
      "HOWARD LUTNICK (U.S. Commerce Secretary): Great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you heard in our polling some of the perceptions of the economy; 61 percent of Americans believe the administration is putting too much focus on tariffs; 70 percent say the administration is not doing enough to lower prices. And 60 percent oppose new tariffs on imported goods.",
      "This is a centerpiece to your policy plan. How do you reverse public opposition?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Oh, they're going to love the deals that President Trump and I are doing. I mean, they're just going to love them.",
      "The president figured out the right answer and sent letters to these countries, said, this is going to fix the trade deficit. This will go a long way to fixing the trade deficit. And that's gotten these countries to the table. And they're going to open their markets, or they're going to pay the tariff.",
      "And if they open their markets, the opportunity for Americans to export, to grow their business, farmers, ranchers, fishermen, this is going to be \u2013 the next two weeks are going to be weeks for the record books. President Trump is going to deliver for the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Next two weeks for the record books, because you have that August 1 deadline.",
      "But President Trump sent letters to most of the major trading partners announcing higher tariff rates effective August 1. That could hit countries accounting for three-quarters of U.S. imports. Let's talk about Canada, one of the big ones. Their prime minister said this past week there's not a lot of evidence they can get a trade deal with the U.S. that avoids tariffs.",
      "Is your message to Canada, Mr. Secretary, that no matter what they offer at the negotiating table, free trade is gone, there will be a tariff in place?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: No, see, that's silly.",
      "We have a plan called USMCA, U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement. Virtually 75 percent of all goods coming from Mexico and Canada already come in tariff- free. The president said, look, unless you stop this fentanyl and close the border, we're just going to keep tariffs on the other 25 percent. And that's what he has on.",
      "So don't be confused about it. The president understands that we need to open the markets. Canada is not open to us. They need to open their market. Unless they're willing to open their market, they're going to pay a tariff. That's a simple message the president has. It's fair trade. It's reciprocal trade.",
      "Why should we have our country be wide open while theirs is closed? This is an 80-year wrong that President Trump is trying to fix. And our businesses are going to really, really enjoy it. I think the president's going to open between $300 billion and $400 billion of opportunity for Americans.",
      "That's 1.5 percent \u2013 up to 1.5 percent GDP growth because the president's going to open all these markets up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: You saw it with Vietnam. You saw it with Indonesia. You're going to watch all these other countries decide, if they want to do business with America, let's just open our market up to America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: That's opportunity that President Trump is bringing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we saw framework announcements with those countries you just mentioned.",
      "But back on what the Canadian prime minister, the man you're negotiating with, said, he's assuming there's going to be a tariff here. There's already this baseline 10 percent tariff that we are seeing from the administration. Is that set in stone or is it going to go to like 15 or 20 percent?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Well, I think what you have got is, you should assume that the small countries, the Latin American countries, the Caribbean countries, many countries in Africa, they will have a baseline tariff of 10 percent.",
      "And then the bigger economies will either open themselves up or they will pay a fair tariff to America for not opening themselves up and treating America unfairly. So what the president's view is and what he's instructed me to do is say, look, if you're willing to open yourself up and really open your economy to American business to ranchers, fishermen, farmers and businesses, then, of course, we will make a better deal with you.",
      "But if you're going to keep your tariffs and your tariff barriers holding us down, then, of course, it seems fair that you should pay a tariff to do business with the greatest customer on Earth, the American consumer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so just quickly, are you going to renegotiate that free trade deal the USMCA?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Oh, I think the president is absolutely going to renegotiate USMCA.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: But that's a year from today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Today, of course, 75 percent comes in free.",
      "But, of course, should you expect us to renegotiate it? It makes perfect sense for the president to renegotiate it. He wants to protect American jobs. He doesn't want cars built in Canada or Mexico, when they could be built in Michigan or \u2013 and Ohio.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: It's just better for American workers. The president's got the American workers' back. That's why they elected him. That's why the stock market's at all-time highs. They understand the president actually understands business and is doing it the right way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, OK, let me ask you about Europe.",
      "Boeing airplanes, Kentucky bourbon, these are some of the things that the Europeans are looking to target if we get into a trade war as retaliation by them.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We're not \u2013 they're not going to do it. They're just not going to do it. We are\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just met with the European trade negotiator. He came out kind of downbeat. You disagree? You think we are going to get a deal with the European Union?",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: I was on the phone with the European trade negotiators this morning about a half-hour ago. So there's plenty of room.",
      "Look, the president and the European Union, these are the two biggest trading partners in the world talking to each other. We will get a deal done. I am confident we will get a deal done, OK? And it will be great for America because the president has the back of America.",
      "So I think all these key countries will figure out it is better to open their markets to the United States of America than to pay a significant tariff. And Donald Trump has made that point clear. No one has protected America the way Donald Trump has protected America. It is so fun to work for him, because I have him behind me saying the right things for America.",
      "And I get to do those negotiations with all these countries. And you are going to see the best set of trade deals you have ever seen for America and for the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that August 1 deadline with the E.U. a hard deadline? Are you going to get a deal, since you were just on the phone?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: I can't hear anything.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you \u2013 can you hear me, Mr. Secretary? It looks like your shot just froze up on my end.",
      "It looks like our remote shot with the secretary is frozen, so we're going to take a commercial break, try to fix it and try to finish a conversation on the other side of this.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, an update on an important story.",
      "The Hamas-ran Gaza Health Ministry says at least 67 people were killed while waiting for aid from United Nations trucks today. Our CBS Gaza team spoke with eyewitnesses who say that Israeli tanks were behind the hills and, as thousands of people searching for food approached, the tanks opened fire. The IDF tells us that the troops did so to remove \u2013 quote \u2013 \"an immediate threat\" in the area and that the reported number of deaths does not match their initial review.",
      "We will continue to track that as we track the hopes for a hostage deal and cease-fire.",
      "But, right now, we want to go back to the commerce secretary, who I believe can hear me now?",
      "Mr. Secretary?",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: I can hear you now. Yes, I can hear you now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. All right.",
      "But to pick up where we left off before the technical issues, August 1, is it a hard deadline with the E.U. or is that going to slide?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: No, no, that's a hard deadline.",
      "So, on August 1, the new tariff rates will come in. But nothing stops countries from talking to us after August 1, but they're going to start paying the tariffs on August 1. Now, remember, the world is paying 10 percent right now, and China's paying 30 percent. So that's right now. And that's why we're running at about plus-$30 billion a month for the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: You got to remember, this is going to pay off our deficit. This is going to make America stronger.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We are finally protecting America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you will have that income if you keep them in place. But if you're negotiating them away, then they won't be there. So that is contradictory to me.",
      "But I want\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Nothing \u2013 nothing is getting \u2013 no, no, no, no, no, no, no.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're not negotiating the tariffs away?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Nothing is getting negotiated away. We have a 10 percent on the world.",
      "No, no, 10 percent is definitely going to stay. Many countries will pay higher, like Vietnam and Indonesia, right? They're 19 and 20 percent. Most countries will pay higher. The small countries are likely to be 10 percent, but the bigger countries are likely to pay higher. That's just the way it's going to be because we can't have these \u2013 $1 trillion trade deficit.",
      "It's just wrong for America and Donald Trump is going to fix it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And American corporations are just going to swallow that and not pass that price increase on to consumers? What is your projection?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: What, what's so interesting is that you're worried about the importers. How about the people who build and employ Americans\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, I'm asking about people who go to the store to buy.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: \u2026 people who make cars here, people who manufacture here? They don't pay a tariff. They don't pay a tariff at all.",
      "So President Trump says it all the time. Build in America, you don't pay a tariff. The idea that these importers are more important than the people who employ Americans, I think it's just a wrong way of thinking about it. Americans deserve to be employed here and have the best jobs in the world. And that's what Donald Trump is trying to deliver.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I was asking you about consumer prices, what people will pay when they go to the store.",
      "But in \u2013 since you don't want to answer\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Oh, I think they will be low. I think they will be low, shockingly low.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Seriously.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Consumer Price Index doesn't currently reflect that, though, that the trend is towards higher.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Well, it just went up. What did it go up, a tenth-of-a-percent?",
      "Look, the dollar has declined\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Two-tenths on the core.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: \u2026 more than 10 percent, right? So the dollar declining sort of softens tariffs completely. These are small numbers. You're going to see inflation is not going to change.",
      "Remember, inflation is an expectation of rates continuing to grow. Tariffs are just going to reset the price level for imports, for certain imports from certain countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: But everybody is building in America. And, remember, Donald Trump announced over $11 trillion of building in America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: All that building in America, the construction jobs here, but then, when those products come on the shelves, they come on much cheaper. Energy is cheaper. I think you're going to see inflation stay right where it is.",
      "And Jerome Powell, who's held these rates up way too high, way too high, you're going to see him cut rates. The Fed's going to cut rates. Mortgages are going to be cheaper. And America's going to be so much better off under Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are reports that the treasury secretary has talked the president out of his threat to fire the Fed chair, since the Fed's already expected on a consensus basis to be lowering rates.",
      "Are you telling us tonight \u2013 or today that he's not under threat, that he will keep his job?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: The president is an amazingly transparent person. When he thinks something, he says it.",
      "So he says, look, this guy's doing the worst job. We have interest rates the same as Gabon. Europe, all of Europe, the 27 countries of Europe, they're in the 2's, and we're in the 4's. That means your mortgage, everybody who is watching, their mortgage is two points higher than it should be.",
      "So the Fed should be cutting rates. And Donald Trump's going to try to figure out how to get there\u2026",

      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Whether he decides \u2013 but whether he decides to let Jerome Powell stay in the job or not, I will leave that to Donald Trump.",
      "I think the guy's doing the worst job. He's costing us, you and me and the American people, more than $500 billion. I think he's costing us $700 billion a year by keeping rates too high. It's just wrong. I don't know why he's torturing America this way. Our rates should be lower.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He doesn't unilaterally set those rates.",
      "But we have to leave it there. We are out of time. Mr. Secretary, thank you for joining us and sticking through the technical \u2013 technical issues we had.",
      "We turn now to the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Jim Himes. He joins us from Connecticut.",
      "Good morning to you, Congressman. You are on the Financial Services Committee, so let's pick up right there.",
      "The Supreme Court indicated the president of the United States does not have the authority to fire the Fed chair unless there is cause. It sounds like the White House is trying to build a case that they have cause. If they go ahead with it, what happens?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-Connecticut): Yes.",
      "Well, you know, Margaret, the last question you asked the secretary shows what a con man he is. And I just listened to his whole thing. And if you're over the age of 5, you have dealt with hucksters and con men. Everything's going to be great in two weeks. By August 1, we're going to have a deal. The American people are going to be so happy.",
      "Complete failure to understand the facts, right? He said that tariffs are paid by foreign countries. Tariffs are not paid by foreign countries. He said Jay Powell is torturing the American people.",
      "Margaret, you didn't have the time, but if you had had a minute, you would have said, wait a minute. There's a Federal Open Market Committee that is comprised of seven Fed governors and all of the heads of the Central Bank offices around the country. That committee, comprised of people who have been appointed by Democratic and Republican presidents, set the interest rates, right?",
      "So this notion that Jay Powell is unilaterally stopping a decline in interest rates, which, by the way, in the face of \u2013 in the face \u2013 for those of \u2013 those folks who know a little bit about economics, in the face of upticking inflation, which we're seeing, would be absolutely bananas.",
      "So what you just saw was a master class by a huckster and a con man who uses words like torture that are very, very dangerous words, not just for the economy, but for the physical safety of people like Jay Powell.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, just to be clear, that's why I said it's not the chairman's unilateral decision, for exactly the reason you raised, that there is a committee that makes the decision.",
      "The inflation rate for the CPI was 2.7 percent. If you strip out food \u2013 energy and food, which is more volatile, it is up two-tenths of a percent, so the economic data is what we are pointing to there, not opinion on pricing.",
      "But is there congressional pushback that can be done? I mean, what happens if there's a tweet that says the Fed chair is gone?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, interestingly, inside the White House \u2013 and I don't know who it is \u2013 my guess is, it's maybe the treasury secretary \u2013 is saying \u2013 and this is a very difficult thing to say to a person like Donald Trump \u2013 that, if you fire the Fed chair, either illegally, which they're happy to do, or because you trump up some baloney- like charge associated with a renovation of the headquarters, there is going to be a massive market reaction, because you cannot lie to the capital markets.",
      "We saw this the day after Liberation Day, before we all were familiarized with the TACO trade. The day after Liberation Day, the stock and the bond markets took a nosedive. So my guess is that somebody saying to the president, because he doesn't care if he follows the law or not \u2013 and the law is very clear that he can't fire the Fed chair \u2013 but somebody is saying to the president, the economic instability that gets caused when the cornerstone of the global economy and capital markets all of a sudden has a politically driven interest rate policy\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: \u2026 I think that's the one thing that's holding them off.",

      "We are continuing our conversation now with Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes, who is the ranking member on the Intelligence Committee.",
      "Congressman, I want to pick up on that topic.",
      "Just a statement of fact here. A bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee investigation found that the U.S. intelligence community's assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 election was correct, they deemed it to be so on a bipartisan basis. I'm saying that because today, and yesterday, the director of the intelligence community, Tulsi Gabbard, has said that she is referring for prosecution former American officials she accused of treasonist conspiracy, a year's long coo against President Trump because they assessed Russia had tried to influence the election. This is weeks after the CIA director issued a report critiquing the tradecraft that went into that 2016 assessment.",
      "Is there any legal basis for any kind of prosecution here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-CT): None. Absolutely none, Margaret. What you saw from the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was not just a lie, but a very dangerous lie. Because when you start throwing around language like sedition and treason, somebody's going to get hurt.",
      "Now, you pointed out that the Senate committee, then led by Marco Rubio, a Republican and now secretary of state, found unanimously that Russia medaled in the election to try to assist Donald Trump. John Durham, special council appointed by Donald Trump, investigated this, fund that the Senate report was correct.",
      "Now, what Tulsi is doing, it's a little slight of hand but it's worth focusing on. She is saying that the Intelligence Committee early on said that the Russians could not use cyber tools to mess with the voting infrastructure, the machines that tally our votes. That was true then and it is true now. Though the Russians tried to break into a couple of states', you know, election technical infrastructure, they didn't do it. But it is well known and well established that the Russians hacked into the DNC and undertook any number of influence operations, including buying reams of Facebook ads, to discredit Hillary Clinton. That is not in contention, right?",
      "And what is horrifying about this whole lie out of Gabbard is, number one, it puts people at risk. And right now, you know, the mouth breathers on MAGA online are just going out of their minds based on a lie. And, number two, the intelligence community is full of very, very good people who do their jobs every single day and now they're watching their leader do something that each and every one of them knows is dishonest and it is a really, really bad thing for the safety and security of the American people when that dynamic is \u2013 is \u2013 is out there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That Senate report is online. The findings are \u2013 are there. But I understand your distinction there. It's an important one in influence verses physical hacking.",
      "You are \u2013",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: But, by the way, Margaret, if I may.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: If I may. You asked about the referral.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Here's the test. This is Epstein all over again. Criminal referrals. We're going to prosecute Barack Obama. You know, treasonist and seditious. Here's the thing. And I hope that four, five, six weeks from now. Don't take it from this Democrat. Four or five, six weeks from now, let's see if this administration, Tulsi Gabbard accusing a former president of treason, let's see if they bring charges. They won't. They won't, because there's not a judge in the land, not a single judge, who will treat this with anything other than laughter that will be heard from the Atlantic to the Pacific in this country.",
      "So, the test of this is, four, five, six weeks from now, is the DOJ bringing charges.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: And the answer to that is no. And now we're going to be in Epstein world. We're like, wait a minute, treasonist conspiracy by a former president. Why isn't the Department of Justice bringing charges? And the answer to that question is that it is a lie.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "On the other topic I want to ask you about, as a Democrat, \"The New York Times,\" the DNC \u2013 is reporting the DNC's examination of what went wrong in the last election is going to steer clear the decisions made by the Biden turned Harris campaign.",
      "You were very direct early on in calling for then President Biden to drop out of this race. You don't parse your words normally. Do you actually think it is possible for your party to self-diagnose problems without looking at the presidential race itself in terms of the candidates?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Look, we \u2013 we \u2013 we need to acknowledge, and every \u2013 and all of America saw it on the night of the disastrous debate in the July before the election, that Joe Biden was not going to win the election. That was not just evident in the debate, it was evident in the polling that his people were keeping from him. OK, so that is a fact.",
      "Now, Democrats are a big tent party. We go from Joe Manchin, who's practically a Republican, to AOC, we is a Democratic socialist. So, we always have a struggle in coming up with sort of one set of policies, one set of messaging. And it's particularly hard to do when we don't have a presidential candidate. You know, a presidential candidate, of course, attracts the attention, is sort of the one person who must run nationwide and speak for the party as a whole. Right now we're having a lot of conversations with a lot of different views. And I understand that's enormously frustrating to Democrats who are so upset over the result of the election.",
      "But, you know, other than fight back with the tools that we have right now, we've got to be introspective about what we have done wrong that resulted in a dramatic win by Donald Trump in 2020.*",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: There's an awful lot of rage in the Democratic Party. And my message to my Democratic friends is, fine, I get the rage, believe me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: I was in the chamber on January 6, 2021, and worried for my own life. But the thing to do right now is to be introspective and ask yourself \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: What can we do better to appeal to more people, including those people that we have lost time and time again in elections?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Fifteen months out from the mid-term races.",
      "Congressman Jim Himes, thank you.",
      "We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mass deportation was one of President Trump's biggest campaign promises. Six months into his administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has deported nearly 150,000 people thus far.",
      "And with the recent passage of Trump's tax and border bill, the agency will be getting an unprecedented infusion of funds, becoming the highest funded law enforcement agency in this country.",
      "Our immigration and politics reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez spoke with the acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, this Friday. And he began by asking whether the new money will help the administration meet its goal of one million deportations per year.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "TODD LYONS (Acting Director, ICE): I definitely think it's possible. One thing, though, that ICE is historically known for our mission is, we detain to remove. We don't detain punitively. So, people do hear that increase in the bed space, but it's not for the long term. There's no reason for someone to linger in a detention facility after they've been lawfully ordered by an immigration judge. We want to insure that they can get back to their home country safely and quickly.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: More than a dozen individuals are facing charges for that violent attack against an ICE facility in Texas. The Department of Homeland Security, as you know, has also reported a sharp increase in attacks against your agents. What do you think is behind that?",
      "TODD LYONS: I think the sharp increase in the rhetoric, especially from a lot of elected officials that are shaming, if you will, or speaking out against ICE law enforcement mission is what's really increasing these attacks on officers. In that, unfortunately, the Alvarado incident down in Prairieland, that is one that's really taking it to the next level. Just the increase is amazing. The fact that, like you said, 830 percent increase from last year assaults on officers.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Do you think the increase in attacks against ICE officers is connected to the broader increase in ICE arrests across the country? Because you're seeing more arrests, you're seeing more attacks too.",
      "TODD LYONS: I think we're seeing both. I think because we are more visible in the community. You know, there was \u2013 recently people had talked about the amount of support that ICE had under President Obama. Well, during those times, we did make more custodial arrests, those arrests like you would \u2013",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: In jails.",
      "TODD LYONS: In the jails, right? We weren't really out there. We just don't see that now with a lot of the sanctuary policies and just a lot of \u2013 a lot of lack of cooperation. So, you are seeing us out more.",
      "And I think there is more attention. Kind of like you said, the immigration missions, one of the forefront of this administration. So, there is a lot of scrutiny and \u2013 and publicity to it.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: What do you say, Director, to the criticism that law enforcement officials, including ICE officers, should be identifying themselves and that the use of masks could be potentially dangerous, including because it could lead to imposters posing as ICE agents?",
      "TODD LYONS: Yes, and that's one of our biggest concerns. And I've said it publicly before, I'm not a proponent of the masks. However, if that's a tool that the men and women of ICE t hat keep themselves and their families safe, then I will allow it.",
      "I do kind of push back on the criticism that they don't identify themselves. Men and women of ICE and our DOJ partners and local law enforcement do help us. They are identified on their vests. You can see the HIS, ERO, federal police officer, FBI, on the back of the vest. So, I \u2013 I would push back on the notion that we aren't identifying themselves.",
      "Now, what I would advocate for, and I've said this many times, is I know a lot of elected officials have put forward legislation or proposed legislation about banning of the masks, things like that. I would also want, you know, elected officials to help us hold those people accountable that do docks (ph) or threat an ICE officer or agent or their family.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: So, you will continue to allow ICE officers to wear masks during operations?",
      "TODD LYONS: I will.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Do you know how many of the individuals arrested by ICE are people here illegally but who also have serious criminal records?",
      "TODD LYONS: ICE is always focused on the worst of the worst. One difference you'll see now is, under this administration, we have opened up the whole aperture of the immigration portfolio. Meaning that, if you're here illegally and ICE goes out and arrests someone that is released from a sanctuary jurisdiction, are wanted in their home country, and you \u2013 an ICE officer finds others individuals with them who are in the country illegally, we're going to take them as well.",
      "One thing, though, that I'd like to highlight is the fact that foreign criminal records are in U.S. data systems. So, when we do go out and, say, arrest someone that has an Interpol red notice because they're wanted in their home country, they're still a criminal. But under the American judicial standard (ph), they don't have an American criminal history. But that doesn't mean they don't have a criminal history in their home country.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: If your agents encounter anyone who is here illegally, irrespective of whether or not they have a criminal record, that person will be taken into custody?",
      "TODD LYONS: If they're here in the United States illegally, yes, they will. I \u2013",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Those so-called \"collateral arrests.\"",
      "TODD LYONS: Correct.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: We just, as you mentioned, rode along with border \u2013 not Border Patrol, but ICE agents in Maryland, and we saw the agents arresting sex offenders, suspected gang members, the individuals that the president has promised to deport from the country. He often talks about getting rid of the worse of the worse who are in the country illegally.",
      "But we have also seen ICE arrest day laborers outside of Home Depots, in some cases farm workers, people attending their court hearings in immigration court. Is the policy still to prioritize the arrests and deportation of people who are here illegally but also are violent offenders?",
      "TODD LYONS: Yes, ICE Is going to focus on the worst of the worst. And that's what we do need to focus our limited resources on. That's one thing I've always said from the start.",
      "What's, again, frustrating for me is the fact that we would love to focus on these criminal aliens that are inside a jail facility, right? A local law enforcement agency, state agency, already deemed that person a public safety threat and arrested them and they're in detention. I'd much rather focus all of our limited resources on that to take them into custody. But we \u2013 we do have to go out into the community and make those arrests. And that's where you are seeing those increase of if we encounter someone say that is here in the country illegally, we will take them into custody.",
      "In regards to the work site, like you mentioned. One thing that I'd really like to highlight, especially what kicked off June 6th in L.A., is the fact that when you see ICE doing these work raids, like the marijuana grow farm, you \u2013 we are going there with criminal search warrants or criminal arrest warrants. Not only are we focused on those individuals that are, you know, working here illegally, we're focused on these American companies that are actually exploiting these laborers. These people that came here for a better life. You know, either, you know, forced labor, child trafficking, you know, a lot of these work site cases just isn't a victimless crime of someone here working illegally. And that's why we're going there with these criminal warrants to focus on these American businesses that are trying to make an extra dollar on the backs of these people that came here for a better life.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: So, you are planning on holding accountable the employers, the companies that are hiring people who are here illegally, not just the workers?",
      "TODD LYONS: One hundred percent.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Because that has been a concern.",
      "TODD LYONS: It is.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Our colleague, Margaret Brennan, recently obtained ICE data showing that only a small percentage of the convicted criminals that ICE has deported over the past six months had convictions for violent offenses. For example, fewer than 1 percent had homicide convictions. What do you make of the data?",
      "TODD LYONS: We can't look at it just based on violence or the propensity of violence in that crime. What I looked at is, someone has committed a crime in the United States. Now, if you look at someone that's just been arrested, say for DUI, well, some people might say that's only a misdemeanor. We may have prevented vehicular homicide down the road for someone who's a habitual traffic offender. I can't look at the largest scale of what a specific crimes are \u2013 are. you know, whether it's a rape, a homicide. Of course, you want to get those worse of the worse. But if someone's committed a crime here in the United States and been let back into the community and are here illegally, we need to focus on that.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, glad you can hear me.",
      "We are looking at immigration issues six months in. You have had such a first-hand experience out in L.A. given the deployment of U.S. troops. The president ordered the early release of nearly half of the National Guard from L.A. Have they departed yet? What are the remaining ones doing?",
      "KAREN BASS: Well, I believe they've departed, but they were never needed in the first place. And the remaining ones are doing what they were doing all along, which is essentially protecting two federal buildings, one of which in Westwood, where there never has been a big protest against the immigration raids. This is just such an incredible misuse of not only taxpayers' money, but of the young people who are in the National Guard, who have had to leave their families, their jobs, and their education for this deployment that is completely unnecessary.",
      "Four thousand troops, my understanding is most of the time has been spent in complete boredom, playing video games, and essentially waiting around because, again, 4,000 deploy and about 200 actually used.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The White House, of course, argues they deployed them because there was interference with the operations of law enforcement and carrying out some of the roundups.",
      "There are still enforcement actions by ICE taking place. You have talked about your objections, as you've described them, to masked men, unmarked cars drawing guns, snatching people off the street.",
      "KAREN BASS: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've filed a Freedom of Information requests to, quote, \"know who these masked men are.\"",
      "Why, though, is their identity important to you? Do you plan to prosecute them?",
      "KAREN BASS: Well, no. Let me just explain, because you have people who are literally walking down the street, sitting at bus stops, are individual vendors selling fruit on the street. These masked men pull up in unmarked cars and jump out of the cars with rifles and detain people. So, for the average citizen, it looks like it's a violent kidnapping. So, you should never have that. They don't identify themselves. And, furthermore, to your previous guest, how on earth do they know that they're a threat when they're just chasing random people through parking lots, at Home Depots, going to car washes and rounding up people. It's difficult to get your car washed in Los Angeles now because most of the car washes, the employees won't come to work out of fear that a raid will take place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the acting director says that his agents, some of them fear that their families will be retaliated against, and that's why they are covering their faces, that they do wear markings for the agencies that they work with.",
      "KAREN BASS: So \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you respond?",
      "KAREN BASS: Well \u2013 well, first of all, let me just tell you that the masked men are not from Los Angeles. And so, how their families could be retaliated against? And then what is that to say to local law enforcement, the Los Angeles Police Department, none of whom are ever masked, who always identify themselves, and even hand someone a business card. So, that makes absolutely no sense at all.",
      "And I don't know, but I have a hard time believing that the woman selling pineapples on the corner will going to attack an ICE agent.",
      "And then when he says that there is identification, the problem is, many of these men are in plain clothes with vests on that say \"police.\" It looks like something that they could have gotten online. I think it's really important to point out the extreme nature of the randomness. And, you know, Homan has said, he's mentioned a number of criteria for why they stop people. One of the points of criteria is physical appearance. Los Angeles has 3.8 million people and about 50 percent of our population is Latino. So, I guess that means 50 percent of Los Angeles could be possible suspects in an immigration raid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Tom Homan has \u2013",
      "KAREN BASS: It's ridiculous.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tom Homan has said, physical description cannot be the sole factor for reasonable suspicion. But things like location, occupation, physical appearance add up, particularly if a person runs away or if there's a tattoo or something. You don't seem to believe that.",
      "KAREN BASS: Location, sitting at a \u2013 well, location, sitting at a bus stop, walking down the street, selling fruit, no, I do dispute that, absolutely. And, you know, again, the National Guard should have never been deployed in the first place. We did not ask for them. This is the federal seizure of power from a governor deploying the National Guard when the National Guard were not even needed.",
      "We had protests at the end of the violent \u2013 at the end of the peaceful protest. There absolutely was \u2013 was some violence and some looting and vandalism. We brought that completely under control.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "KAREN BASS: The troops have never been involved in crowd control, never involved in the protest. They have been guarding a building. Our police department and our sheriff's department are the ones that brought the protests when it devolved into violence under control. We never needed the National Guard in the first place. This is a political stunt, a terrible misuse of taxpayers' dollars.",

      "KAREN BASS: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you still don't have a permanent fire chief in that role. Isn't that a problem? Are you prepared?",
      "KAREN BASS: No. No, I don't think that that's a problem at all. Our interim fire chief has 40 years of experience. In fact, he had just recently retired.",
      "I called him in out of retirement during the fires. He was doing the emergency operations center. So, he stepped in, didn't miss a beat by taking over the fire department. And we are prepared. We do know that it's fire season.",

      "KAREN BASS: No. No, I'm sorry. No, we're doing a national search. And he is certainly open to apply. But the nation's second largest city needs to make sure that we search the nation for the best talent. And I'm sure that there will be people in the department that apply. But we want to cast the net wide. We did the same type of search for our police chief.",

      "President Trump on Sunday pushed the Washington Commanders NFL team to return to its previous name, which was scrapped five years ago because it included a word that many view as a slur against Native Americans.",
      "The president also threatened to block a complicated deal for the Commanders to return to a stadium in Washington, D.C., unless they return to the name \"Washington Redskins.\"",
      "\"The Washington \"Whatever's\" should IMMEDIATELY change their name back to the Washington Redskins Football Team. There is a big clamoring for this,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Hours later, Mr. Trump said he \"may put a restriction on them that if they don't change the name back to the original 'Washington Redskins,' and get rid of the ridiculous moniker, 'Washington Commanders,' I won't make a deal for them to build a Stadium in Washington.\"",
      "The Commanders hope to build a new stadium in Washington, D.C., at the site of RFK Stadium \u2014 returning to the capital city almost 30 years after the team decamped to Maryland. The deal is complicated: The stadium sits on federal land, but Congress in January granted the city control over the land for 99 years, clearing the way for the property to be redeveloped. City councilors still need to approve the redevelopment plan.",
      "Meanwhile in baseball, the president also pushed the Cleveland Guardians MLB team to change back to the Cleveland Indians, a name the franchise got rid of in 2021.",
      "\"MAKE INDIANS GREAT AGAIN,\" he wrote in the Sunday afternoon statement.",
      "Mr. Trump claimed, \"Our great Indian people, in massive numbers, want this to happen. Their heritage and prestige is systematically being taken away from them.\"",
      "The Guardians' president of baseball operations, Chris Antonetti,\u00a0told\u00a0reporters\u00a0of the name change Sunday, \"it's a decision we made and we've gotten the opportunity to build the brand as the Guardians over the last four years.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Commanders, the NFL and the MLB for comment.",
      "The football team in the nation's capital changed its name from the \"Washington Redskins\" in 2020, amid steep criticism and pressure from advertisers, Native American groups and some politicians. The team's then-owner, Dan Snyder, had previously vowed to leave the name in place. The team settled on the name \"Commanders\" after a brief period in which it was known only as the \"Washington Football Team.\"",
      "A day before Sunday's post, Jason Buck, a now-retired defensive lineman who played on the Washington team in the 1990s, told TMZ he would \"give anything\" to meet with Mr. Trump to discuss changing the Commanders' name back.",
      "Mr. Trump has weighed in on the issue in the past. Earlier this month, he told reporters he was opposed to the Commanders' name change.",
      "\"I wouldn't have changed the name,\" he said, when asked about the acrimonious redevelopment deal that could return the team to RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C. \"It doesn't have the same ring to me. But you know, winning can make everything sound good. So if they win, all of a sudden, the Commanders sounds good, but I wouldn't have changed it.\"",
      "The team last won a Super Bowl in 1992.",
      "And in 2020, he wrote on X: \"They name teams out of STRENGTH, not weakness, but now the Washington Redskins & Cleveland Indians, two fabled sports franchises, look like they are going to be changing their names in order to be politically correct.\"",
      "Earlier this year, the president also urged Massapequa High School in New York not to change its mascot's name and logo \u2014 currently the \"Chiefs\" \u2014 despite a state-level ban on Native American names for school mascots.",
      "Mr. Trump directed Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to \"fight for the people of Massapequa on this very important issue.\" Just over a month later, the Department of Education alleged the state policy violated civil rights law, and in June, the department said it had referred the case to the Department of Justice after the state of New York declined to rescind the policy.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 20, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 We turn now to Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. Good morning, Madam Mayor.",
      "LOS ANGELES MAYOR KAREN BASS:\u00a0 Good morning, good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Glad you can hear me. We are looking at immigration issues six months in. You have had such a firsthand experience out in LA, given the deployment of U.S. troops. The President ordered the early release of nearly half of the National Guard from LA. Have they departed yet? What are the remaining ones doing?",
      "MAYOR BASS:\u00a0 Well, I believe they've departed, but they were never needed in the first place, and the remaining ones are doing what they were doing all along, which is essentially protecting two federal buildings, one of which in Westwood, where there never has been a big protest against the immigration raids. This is just such an incredible misuse of, not only taxpayers money, but of the young people who are in the National Guard, who have had to leave their families, their jobs and their education for this deployment that is completely unnecessary. 4,000 troops, my understanding, is, most of their time has been spent in complete boredom, playing video games and essentially waiting around. Because again, 4,000 deployed, and about 200 actually used.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 The White House, of course, argues they deployed them because there was interference with the operations of law enforcement in carrying out some of the roundups. There are still enforcement actions by ICE taking place. You have talked about your objections, as you described them to \"masked men, unmarked cars, drawing guns, snatching people off the street.\" You filed a Freedom of Information request to quote, \"know who these masked men are.\" Why, though, is their identity important to you? Do you plan to prosecute them?",
      "MAYOR BASS:\u00a0 Well, no, let me just explain, because you have people who are literally walking down the street, sitting at bus stops, are individual vendors selling fruit on the street. These masked men pull up in unmarked cars and jump out of the cars with rifles and detain people. So for the average citizen, it looks like it's a violent kidnapping. So you should never have that. They don't identify themselves. And furthermore, to your previous guest, how on earth do they know that they're a threat when they're just chasing random people through parking lots at Home Depots, going to car washes and rounding up people. It's difficult to get your car washed in Los Angeles now, because most of the car washes, the employees won't come to work out of fear that a raid will take place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the acting director says that his agents, some of them fear that their families will be retaliated against, and that's why they are covering their faces, that they do wear markings for the agencies that they work with. How do you respond?",
      "MAYOR BASS:\u00a0 Well, well, first of all, let me just tell you that the masked men are not from Los Angeles, and so how their families could be retaliated against. And then what is that to say to local law enforcement, the Los Angeles Police Department, none of whom are ever masked who always identify themselves and even hand someone a business card. So that makes absolutely no sense at all. And I don't know, but I have a hard time believing that the woman selling pineapples on the corner is going to attack an ICE agent. And then when he says that there's identification, the problem is many of these men are in plain clothes with vests on that say 'police,' it looks like something that they could have gotten online. I think it's really important to point out the extreme nature of the randomness. And you know, Homan has said, he's mentioned a number of criteria for why they stop people. One of the points of criteria is physical appearance. Los Angeles is 3.8 million people, and about 50% of our population is Latino, so I guess that means 50% of Los Angeles could be possible suspects in an immigration raid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Tom Homan has- Tom Homan has said physical description cannot be the sole factor for reasonable suspicion, but things like location, occupation, physical appearance add up, particularly if a person runs away, or if there's a tattoo or something. You don't seem to believe that.",
      "MAYOR BASS: Location, sitting at a- well, location, sitting at a bus stop, walking down the street, selling fruit? No, I do dispute that, absolutely. And you know, again, the National Guard should have never been deployed in the first place. We did not ask for them. This is the federal seizure of power from a governor deploying the National Guard when the National Guard were not even needed. We had protests at the end of the- at the end of the peaceful protest, there absolutely was some violence and some looting and vandalism, we brought that completely under control. The troops have never been involved in crowd control, never involved in the protest. They have been guarding a building. Our police department and our sheriff's department are the ones that brought the protests, when it devolved into violence, under control. We never needed the National Guard in the first place. This is a political stunt, a terrible misuse of taxpayers' dollars.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's more we could talk about here but I want to ask you about fires, because we are now officially in fire season. It was just six months ago we saw those blazes in LA, you fired the then fire chief for you said a failure to prepare. But you still don't have a permanent fire chief in that role. Isn't that a problem? Are you prepared?",
      "MAYOR BASS:\u00a0 No, no, I don't think that that's a problem at all. Our interim fire chief has 40 years of experience. In fact, he had just recently retired. I called him in, out of retirement, during the fires. He was doing the emergency operation center. So he stepped in, didn't miss a beat by taking over the fire department. And we are prepared. We do know that it's fire season.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So is your plan to keep him in place since you brought him out of retirement?--",
      "MAYOR BASS: --No--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:--put him in an interim basis?",
      "MAYOR BASS:\u00a0 I'm sorry, no, we're doing a national search, and he is certainly open to apply. But the nation's second-largest city needs to make sure that we search the nation for the best talent. And I'm sure that there will be people in the department that apply, but we want to cast the net wide. We did the same type of search for our police chief--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Well okay--",
      "MAYOR BASS:--in the meantime he is more than capable of managing well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, wish the city well. We will be watching as you move through fire season. Thank you--",
      "MAYOR BASS:--Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 20, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Jim Himes. He joins us from Connecticut. Good morning to you. Congressman, you are on the Financial Services Committee, so let's pick up right there. The Supreme Court indicated that the President of the United States does not have the authority to fire the Fed Chair unless there is cause. It sounds like the White House is trying to build a case that they have cause. If they go ahead with it, what happens?",
      "CONGRESSMAN JIM HIMES: Yeah, well, you know, Margaret, the last question you asked the Secretary, shows what a con man he is. And I just listened to his whole thing. And, you know, if you're over the age of five, you've dealt with hucksters and con men. Everything is going to be great in two weeks. By August 1st, we're going to have a deal. The American people are going to be so happy. Complete failure to understand the facts, right? He said that tariffs are paid by foreign countries. Tariffs are not paid by foreign countries. He said, Jay Powell is torturing the American people. Margaret, you didn't have the time, but if you'd had a minute, you would have said, wait a minute. There's a Federal Open Market Committee that is comprised of seven Fed governors, and all of the heads of the central bank offices around the country. That committee, comprised of people who have been appointed by Democratic and Republican Presidents, set the interest rates, right? So, this notion that Jay Powell is unilaterally stopping a decline in interest rates, which, by the way, in the of- in the face- for those of those folks who know a little bit about economics, in the face of up-ticking inflation, which we're seeing, would be absolutely bananas. So, what you just saw was a master class by a huckster and a con man who uses words like torture that are very, very dangerous words, not just for the economy, but for the physical safety of people like Jay Powell.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, just to be clear, that's why I said it's not the Chairman's unilateral decision for exactly the reason you raised, that there is a committee that makes the decision. The inflation rate for the CPI was 2.7% if you strip out food- energy and food, which is more volatile, it's up two-tenths of a percent. So, that economic data is what we are pointing to there, not opinion on pricing. But, is there congressional pushback that can be done? I mean, what happens if there's a tweet that says the Fed chair is gone?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, interestingly, inside the White House, and I don't know who it is, my guess is it's maybe the Treasury Secretary is saying, and this is a very difficult thing to say to a person like Donald Trump, that if you fire the Fed chair, either illegally, which they're happy to do, or because you trump up some baloney-like-charge associated with a renovation of the headquarters, there is going to be a massive market reaction, because you cannot lie to the capital markets. We saw this the day after Liberation Day, before we all were familiarized with the TACO trade. The day after liberation day, the stock and the bond markets took a nosedive. So, my guess is that somebody is saying to the president because he doesn't care if he follows the law or not, and the law is very clear that he can't fire the Fed chair. But somebody is saying to the President, the economic instability that gets caused when the cornerstone of the global economy and capital markets all of the sudden has a politically driven interest rate policy. I think that's the one thing that's holding them off.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, we're going to take a quick break and continue our conversation on a variety of topics. We need to bring up with you on the other side of it, stay with us.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We are continuing our conversation now with Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes, who is the ranking member on the Intelligence Committee. Congressman, I want to pick up on that topic. Just a statement of fact here: A bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee investigation found that the US intelligence community assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 election was correct. They deemed it to be so on a bipartisan basis. I'm saying that because today and yesterday, the director of the intelligence community, Tulsi Gabbard, has said that she is referring for prosecution former American officials she accused of treasonous conspiracy, a years-long coup against President Trump, because they assessed Russia had tried to influence the election. This is weeks after the CIA Director issued a report critiquing the tradecraft that went into that 2016 assessment. Is there any legal basis for any kind of prosecution here?",
      "REP. HIMES: None, absolutely none. Margaret, what you saw from the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was not just a lie, but a very dangerous lie, because when you start throwing around language like sedition and treason, somebody is going to get hurt. Now, you pointed out that the Senate committee, then led by Marco Rubio, a Republican and now Secretary of State, found unanimously that Russia meddled in the election to try to assist Donald Trump. John Durham, special counsel appointed by Donald Trump, investigated this, found that the Senate report was correct. Now, what Tulsi is doing it's a little sleight of hand, but it's worth focusing on. She is saying that the Intelligence Committee, early on, said that the Russians could not use cyber tools to mess with the voting infrastructure, the machines that tally our votes. And that was true then, and it is true now, though the Russians tried to break into a couple of states, you know, election technical infrastructure. They didn't do it, but it is well known and well established that the Russians hacked into the DNC and undertook any number of other influence operations, including buying reams of Facebook ads to discredit Hillary Clinton. That is not in contention, right? And what is horrifying about this whole lie out of Gabbard is, number one, it puts people at risk. And right now, you know, the mouth-breathers on MAGA online are just going out of their minds based on a lie. And number two, the intelligence community is full of very, good people who do their jobs every single day, and now they're watching their leader do something that each and every one of them knows is dishonest and it is a really, really bad thing for the safety and security of the American people when that dynamic is- is out there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That Senate report is online, the findings are there, but I understand your distinction there, and it's an important one in influence versus physical hacking. You're--",
      "REP. HIMES: -- By- by the way Margaret, if I may- if I may, you asked about the referral. Here's the test. This is Epstein all over again. Criminal referrals. We're going to prosecute Barack Obama, you know, treasonous and seditious. Here's the thing, and I hope that 4, 5, 6, weeks from now- don't take it from this Democrat. 4,5,6, weeks from now, let's see if this administration, Tulsi Gabbard, accusing a former president of treason. Let's see if they bring charges. They won't. They won't, because there's not a judge in the land, not a single judge who will treat this with anything other than laughter that will be heard from the Atlantic to the Pacific in this country. So the test of this is 4,5,6 weeks from now, is the DOJ bringing charges? And the answer to that is no. And now we're going to be in Epstein world. We're like, wait a minute, treasonous conspiracy by a former president. Why isn't the Department of Justice bringing charges? And the answer to that question is that it is a lie.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. On the other topic, I want to ask you about as a Democrat, the New York Times-- the DNC--\u00a0 is reporting the DNC examination of what went wrong in the last election is going to steer clear of the decisions made by the Biden turned Harris campaign. You were very direct early on in calling for then President Biden to drop out of this race. You don't parse your words normally. Do you actually think it is possible for your party to self-diagnose problems without looking at the presidential race itself in terms of the candidates?",
      "REP. HIMES: Look, we need to acknowledge and every- and all of America saw it on the night of that disastrous debate in the July before the election that Joe Biden was not going to win the election. That was not just evident in the debate. It was evident in the polling that his people were keeping from him. Okay, so that is a fact. Now, Democrats are a big tent party. We go from Joe Manchin, who's practically a Republican, to AOC who is a Democratic socialist. So, we always have a struggle in coming up with sort of one set of policies, one set of messaging, and it's particularly hard to do when we don't have a presidential candidate. You know, a presidential candidate, of course, attracts the attention, is sort of the one person who must run nationwide and speak for the party as a whole. Right now, we're having a lot of conversations with a lot of different views, and I understand that's enormously frustrating to Democrats who are so upset over the result of the election. But you know, other than fight back with the tools that we have right now, we've got to be introspective about what we have done wrong that resulted in a dramatic win by Donald Trump in 2020*. There's an awful lot of rage in the Democratic Party, and my message to my Democratic friends is fine. I get the rage, believe me. I was in the chamber on January 6, 2021, and worried for my own life. But the thing to do right now is to be introspective and ask yourself, what can we do better to appeal to more people, including those people that we have lost time and time again in elections.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: 15 months out from the midterm races. Congressman Jim Himes, thank you. We'll be right back.",
      "*President Donald Trump won the 2024 election. Former President Biden won the 2020 election."

      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick expressed confidence Sunday that the Trump administration will cut trade deals with key U.S. trading partners in the coming weeks \u2014 before steep tariffs kick in for dozens of countries.",
      "\"The next two weeks are going to be weeks for the record books. President Trump is going to deliver for the American people,\" Lutnick said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The president sent letters this month to 25 trading partners \u2014 including Canada, Mexico and the European Union \u2014 telling them to expect higher tariffs starting Aug. 1 unless they make a deal. The administration has pressed countries for months to negotiate trade agreements with the U.S., but only a handful of deals have been formally announced so far \u2014 and CBS News polling\u00a0released Sunday showed 61% of Americans believe the administration is too focused on tariffs.",
      "But Lutnick said the American people are \"going to love the deals that President Trump and I are doing,\" and argued the president's strategy of sending tariff letters has sparked progress.",
      "\"That's gotten these countries to the table, and they are going to open their markets or they're going to pay the tariff,\" the commerce secretary told CBS News.",
      "He said imports from smaller countries will likely continue to face a baseline 10% tariff, while larger countries would face higher tariffs.",
      "One of the most closely watched negotiations is with the European Union. The U.S. traded $975.9 billion worth of goods with the 27-nation bloc last year \u2014 more than any single country. Mr. Trump has threatened 30% tariffs on its exports to the U.S. starting next month, up from the 20% tariffs he briefly imposed on Europe in April.",
      "European officials\u00a0say\u00a0they hope to reach an agreement with Mr. Trump, but if there's no deal, they have threatened to impose a set of retaliatory tariffs on American goods on Aug. 1.",
      "Lutnick told CBS News, \"I am confident we'll get a deal done,\" noting that he spoke with a top European trade negotiator earlier Sunday morning.",
      "The U.S.' two largest non-EU trading partners \u2014 Canada and Mexico \u2014 have also been told to expect tariffs next month of 35% and 30%, respectively, up from 25% imposed near the start of Mr. Trump's term. The president has tied their tariff rates to fentanyl trafficking and illegal immigration, which both countries say they have made progress on, though very little fentanyl is currently trafficked across the U.S.-Canada border.",
      "Mr. Trump's message to his northern neighbor, Lutnick said, is that tariffs will remain in place on Canadian imports if the country doesn't \"stop this fentanyl and close the border.\"",
      "But goods that are covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement \u2014 which was struck during Mr. Trump's first term \u2014 are not included in these tariffs, exempting most goods that cross the border, Lutnick noted.",
      "Aug. 1 is a \"hard deadline\" for tariffs, Lutnick says",
      "Mr. Trump penned this month's tariff letters after threatening a similar slate of tariffs on dozens of trading partners on \"Liberation Day\" in early April. Most of those tariffs were halted for 90 days to give the administration more time to negotiate trade deals \u2014 and before that pause expired earlier this month, the president sent letters naming Aug. 1 as a new deadline.",
      "Lutnick called Aug. 1 a \"hard deadline,\" and said the U.S. is planning to start collecting higher tariffs on imports at the start of next month \u2014 echoing Mr. Trump's pledge earlier this month that \"no extensions will be granted.\"",
      "But \"nothing stops countries from talking to us after Aug. 1st,\" Lutnick added.",
      "Mr. Trump has stood by his trade strategy, arguing tariffs will boost American manufacturing, shrink trade deficits and correct unfair trade practices by other countries.",
      "But some of the tariff moves have spooked financial markets, and economists warn steeper import duties will lead to higher consumer prices and slower economic growth. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said the central bank has held off on cutting interest rates relatively high in part because it is watching to see whether tariffs will impact inflation.",
      "Consumer prices rose 2.7% year-over-year last month, up from 2.4% a month prior.",
      "Lutnick said Sunday he's not worried about tariffs leading to higher consumer prices, telling Brennan, \"I think you're going to see inflation stay right where it is.\" He said Americans can expect \"shockingly low\" prices. He also argued that tariffs will benefit U.S. manufacturers.",
      "\"The idea that these importers are more important than the people who employ Americans, I think it's just [the] wrong way of thinking about it,\" Lutnick said.",
      "Lutnick accuses Jerome Powell of \"torturing America\"",
      "Lutnick also took a shot at Powell, joining Mr. Trump's attacks on the central bank chair.",
      "The Federal Reserve has chosen to leave interest rates steady so far this year, but Mr. Trump has lobbied the Fed to reduce rates instead. Rate cuts could boost economic growth and make it cheaper for Americans to borrow money, but at the risk of causing inflation to spike.",
      "The Fed's interest rate targets are set by a 12-member committee led by Powell, so he cannot unilaterally make decisions about monetary policy. The board's most recent decision not to cut interest rates in June was unanimous.",
      "CBS News reported last week that Mr. Trump privately asked GOP lawmakers whether he should fire Powell \u2014 a legally untested move that could rattle markets. The president later said he's unlikely to try to fire the Fed chair unless there's \"fraud,\" seemingly referring to a controversy over an office renovation project that Mr. Trump claims Powell has mismanaged.",
      "Lutnick did not comment on whether Powell is under threat, saying it's Mr. Trump's decision. But he attacked Powell over interest rates, saying the Fed chair is \"doing the worst job.\"",
      "\"It's just wrong. I don't know why he's torturing America this way,\" Lutnick said.",

      "But Lyons said non-criminals living in the U.S. without authorization will also be taken into custody during arrest operations, arguing that states and cities with \"sanctuary\" policies that limit cooperation between ICE and local law enforcement are forcing his agents to go into communities by not turning over noncitizen inmates.",
      "\"What's, again, frustrating for me is the fact that we would love to focus on these criminal aliens that are inside a jail facility,\" Lyons said during his first sit-down network interview on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"A local law enforcement agency, state agency already deemed that person a public safety threat and arrested them and they're in detention.\"",
      "\"I'd much rather focus all of our limited resources on that to take them into custody, but we do have to go out into the community and make those arrests, and that's where you are seeing (that) increase\" in so-called \"collateral\" arrests, Lyons added, referring to individuals who are not the original targets of operations but are nonetheless found to be in the U.S. unlawfully.",
      "If ICE encounters someone \"that is here in the country illegally, we will take them into custody,\" Lyons said.",
      "\"We have opened up the whole aperture\"",
      "Collateral arrests by ICE were effectively banned under the Biden administration, which issued rules instructing deportation officers to largely focus on arresting serious criminal offenders, national security threats and migrants who recently entered the U.S. illegally. That policy was reversed immediately after President Trump took office for a second time in January.",
      "As part of Mr. Trump's promise to crack down on illegal immigration, his administration has given ICE a broad mandate, with White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller pushing the agency to conduct 3,000 daily arrests. While ICE has so far not gotten close to that number, the agency just received tens of billions of dollars in additional funds from Congress to turbo-charge its deportation campaign.",
      "Lyons said \"it's possible\" to meet the administration's target of 1 million deportations in a year with the new infusion of funds. ICE has recorded nearly 150,000 deportations in Mr. Trump's first six months in office, according to internal government data obtained by CBS News.",
      "From Jan. 1 to June 24, ICE deported around 70,000 people with criminal convictions, but many of the documented infractions were for immigration or traffic offenses, according to data obtained by CBS News.",
      "While the administration frequently highlights arrests of non-citizens convicted of serious crimes like murder and rape, ICE also has sparked backlash in communities across the country due to some of its tactics and actions, including the use of masks by agents (which Lyons said will continue due to concerns about the safety of his officers), arrests of asylum-seekers attending court hearings and raids on worksites.",
      "\"ICE is always focused on the worst of the worst,\" Lyons said. \"One difference you'll see now is under this administration, we have opened up the whole aperture of the immigration portfolio.\"",
      "Lyons promises to hold companies accountable",
      "Another major policy at ICE under the second Trump administration is the lifting of a Biden-era pause on large-scale immigration raids at worksites.",
      "In recent weeks, federal immigration authorities have arrested hundreds of suspected unauthorized workers at a meatpacking plant in Nebraska, a horse racetrack in Louisiana and cannabis farms in southern California. At the cannabis farms alone, officials took into custody more than 300 immigrants who were allegedly in the country unlawfully, including 10 minors.",
      "Amid concerns from industry that Mr. Trump's crackdown was hurting their businesses, ICE in June ordered a halt to immigration roundups at farms, hotels and restaurants. But that pause lasted only a matter of days. Since then, the president has talked about giving farmers with workers who are not in the U.S. legally a \"pass,\" though his administration has not provided further details on what that would entail.",
      "In his interview with CBS News, Lyons said ICE would continue worksite immigration enforcement, saying there's no ban on such actions. He said those operations would rely on criminal warrants against employers suspected of hiring unauthorized immigrants, which he said is not a \"victimless crime,\" noting such investigations often expose forced labor or child trafficking.",
      "\"Not only are we focused on those individuals that are, you know, working here illegally, we're focused on these American companies that are actually exploiting these laborers, these people that came here for a better life,\" Lyons said.",
      "Asked to confirm that ICE plans to hold those employing immigrants in the U.S. illegally accountable \u2014 and not just arrest the workers themselves \u2014 Lyons said, \"One hundred percent.\"",
      "Margaret  Brennan\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 20, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For more on the Trump administration's economic policy, we go now to Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick. Welcome back to Face the Nation, Mr. Secretary,",
      "COMMERCE SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you heard in our polling some of the perceptions of the economy; 61% of Americans believe the administration is putting too much focus on tariffs, 70% say the administration is not doing enough to lower prices, and 60% oppose new tariffs on imported goods. This is a centerpiece to your policy plan. How do you reverse public opposition?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: They're going to love the deals that President Trump and I are doing. I mean, they're just going to love them. You know, the president figured out the right answer, and sent letters to these countries, said this is going to fix the trade deficit. This will go a long way to fixing the trade deficit, and that's gotten these countries to the table and they're going to open their markets or they're going to pay the tariff. And if they open their markets, the opportunity for Americans to export, to grow the business, farmers, ranchers, fishermen, this is going to be- the next two weeks, are going to be weeks for the record books. President Trump is going to deliver for the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Next two weeks for the record books, because you have that August 1st deadline. But, President Trump sent letters to most of the major trading partners announcing higher tariff rates effective August 1. That could hit countries accounting for three-quarters of US imports. Let's talk about Canada, one of the big ones. Their Prime Minister said this past week, there's not a lot of evidence they can get a trade deal with the U.S. that avoids tariffs. Is your message to Canada, Mr. Secretary, that no matter what they offer at the negotiating table, free trade is gone, there will be a tariff in place?",
      "LUTNICK: Now, see, that's silly. We have a plan called USMCA. U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Virtually 75% of all goods coming from Mexico and Canada already come in tariff-free. The President said look, unless you stop this fentanyl and close the border, we're just going to keep tariffs on the other 25% and that's what he has on. So, don't be confused about it. The President understands that we need to open the markets. Canada is not open to us. They need to open their market. Unless they're willing to open their market, they're going to pay a tariff. That's a simple message the President has. It's fair trade. It's reciprocal trade. Why should we have our country be wide open while theirs is closed? This is an 80-year wrong that President Trump is trying to fix, and our businesses are going to really, really enjoy it. I think the President is going to open between three and $400 billion of opportunity for Americans. That's 1.5%- up to 1.5% GDP growth, because the president's going to open all these markets up. You saw it with Vietnam. You saw it with Indonesia. You're going to watch all these other countries decide if they want to do business with America, let's just open our market up to America. That's the opportunity that President Trump is bringing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we saw framework announcements with those countries you just mentioned, but back on what the Canadian Prime Minister, the man you're negotiating with, said, he's assuming there's going to be a tariff here. There's already this baseline 10% tariff that we are seeing from the administration. Is that set in stone, or is it going to go to like 15 or 20%?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: Well, I think what you've got is you should assume that the small countries, you know, the Latin American countries, the Caribbean countries, many countries in Africa, they will have a baseline tariff of 10%. And then the bigger economies will either open themselves up or they'll pay a fair tariff to America for not opening themselves up and treating America unfairly. So, what the President's view is, and what he's instructed me to do is say, look, if you're willing to open yourself up and really open your economy to American business, to ranchers, fishermen, farmers, and businesses, then of course, we'll make a better deal with you. But if you're going to keep your tariffs and your tariff barriers holding us down, then of course, it seems fair that you should pay a tariff to do business with the greatest customer on Earth, the American consumer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so just quickly, are you going to renegotiate that free trade deal, the USMCA?",
      "LUTNICK: Oh, I think the President is absolutely going to renegotiate USMCA, but that's a year from today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.",
      "LUTNICK: Of course, 75% comes in free but of course, should you expect us to renegotiate it? It makes perfect sense for the President to renegotiate it. He wants to protect American jobs. He doesn't want cars built in Canada or Mexico when they could be built in Michigan and Ohio. It's just better for American workers. The President's got the American workers back. That's why they elected him. That's why the stock market is at all-time highs. They understand the President actually understands business and is doing it the right way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, okay, let me ask you about Europe. Boeing airplanes, Kentucky bourbon. These are some of the things that the Europeans are looking to target if we get into a trade war as retaliation by them--",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: --they're not going to do it--",
      "[CROSSTALK STARTS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just met with--",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: --they're just not going to do that\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- the European trade negotiator. He came out kind of downbeat. You disagree, you think we are going to get a deal with the European Union?",
      "LUTNICK: You know, I was on the phone with the European trade negotiators this morning about a half hour ago, so there's plenty of room. Look the president and the European Union, these are the two biggest trading partners in the world talking to each other. We'll get a deal done. I am confident we'll get a deal done. Okay, and it will be great for America, because the President has the back of America. So I think all these key countries will figure out it is better to open the markets to the United States of America than to pay a significant tariff, and Donald Trump has made that point clear. No one has protected America the way Donald Trump has protected America. It is so fun to work for him, because I have him behind me saying the right things for America, and I get to do those negotiations with all these countries, and you are going to see the best set of trade deals you've ever seen for America and for the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that August 1st deadline with the EU a hard deadline? Are you going to get a deal since you were just on the phone?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: I can't hear anything.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you- can you hear me, Mr. Secretary? It looks like your shot just froze up on my end. It looks like our remote shot with the secretary is frozen. So we're going to take a commercial break, try to fix it, and try to finish a conversation on the other side of this.",
      "[ COMMERCIAL BREAK ]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Right now, we want to go back to the Commerce Secretary, who I believe can hear me now. Mr. Secretary?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: I can hear you now",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, but to pick up where we left off before the technical issues, August 1st, is it a hard deadline with the EU, or is that going to slide?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: No, no, that's a hard deadline. So, on August 1, the new tariff rates will come in. But, nothing stops countries from talking to us after August 1, but they're going to start paying the tariffs on August 1. Now remember, the world is paying 10% right now, and China's paying 30%, so that's right now- and that's why we're running at about plus $30 billion a month for the American people. You got to remember, this is going to pay off our deficit. This is going to make America stronger. We are finally protecting America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you'll have that income if you keep them in place. But, if you're negotiating them away, then they won't be there. So, I that that is contradictory to me. But --",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: No, no, no, no, no. \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So you're not negotiating the tariffs away? --",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: Nothing is getting negotiated away. We have 10% of the world. No, no. 10% is definitely going to stay. Many countries will pay higher, like Vietnam and Indonesia, right? There 19 and 20%. Most countries will pay higher. The small countries are likely to be 10%, but the bigger countries are likely to pay higher. That's just the way it's going to be, because we can't have these $1 trillion trade deficits. It's just wrong for America, and Donald Trump is going to fix it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And American corporations are just going to swallow that, and not pass that price increase on to consumers? What's your projection?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: What's so interesting is that you're worried about the importers. How about the people who build and employ Americans here? \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 No I'm asking about people who go to the store to buy \u2013",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: The people who make cars here, people who manufacture here. They don't pay a tariff. They don't pay a tariff at all. So, President Trump says it all the time, build in America, you don't pay a tariff. The idea that these importers are more important than the people who employ Americans, I think, it's just a wrong way of thinking about it. Americans deserve to be employed here and have the best jobs in the world, and that's what Donald Trump is trying to deliver.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I was asking about consumer prices, what people will pay when they go to the store --",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: They'll be low. I think they'll be low, shockingly low,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. The Consumer Price Index doesn't- doesn't currently reflect that, though. That- the trend is towards higher.",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: Well, it just went up, what'd it go up? A tenth of a percent? \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 Two-tenths on the core \u2013",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: Look, the dollar has declined more than 10%, right? So, the dollar declining sort of softens tariffs completely. These are small numbers. You're going to see, inflation is not going to change. Remember, inflation is an expectation of rates continuing to grow. Tariffs are just going to reset the price level for imports, for certain imports from certain countries. But everybody was building in America. And remember Donald Trump announced over $11 trillion of building in America. All that building in America, the construction jobs here. But then, when those products come on the shelves, they come on much cheaper. Energy is cheaper. I think you're going to see inflation stay right where it is. And Jerome Powell has held these rates up way too high, way too high. You're going to see him cut rates. The Fed is going to cut rates. Mortgages are going to be cheaper, and America is going to be so much better off under Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are reports that the Treasury Secretary has talked the president out of his threat to fire the Fed Chair since the Fed is already expected, on a consensus basis, to be lowering rates. Are you telling us tonight or today that he's not under threat, that he will keep his job?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK:\u00a0 The President is an amazingly transparent person. When he thinks something, he says it. So he said, look, this guy is doing the worst job. We have interest rates the same Gabon. You know, Europe- all of Europe, the 27 countries of Europe are in the twos, and we're in the force. That means your mortgage, everybody's watching, the mortgage is two points higher than it should be. So, the Fed should be cutting rates, and Donald Trump's going to try to figure out how to get there. Whether he decides- whether he decides to let Jerome Powell stay in the job or not, I'll leave that to Donald Trump. I think the guy's doing the worst job. He's costing us, you, me, and the American people, more than $500 billion. I think he's costing us $700 billion a year by keeping rates too high. It's just wrong. I don't know why he's torturing America this way. Our rates should be lower.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He doesn't unilaterally set those rates, but we have to leave it there. We are out of time. Mr. Secretary, thank you for joining us and sticking through the technical- technical issues we had.",

      "The lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of Florida, includes two counts of defamation each seeking at least $10 billion in damages, for a total of at least $20 billion. The lawsuit alleges the paper's claims were \"false, defamatory, unsubstantiated, and disparaging,\" and accuses the Journal of \"clear journalistic failures.\"",
      "The paper claimed the letter, from the early 2000s, featured Mr. Trump's signature as well as a birthday message and a drawing of a nude woman. According to the Journal's report, it was collected in a book along with letters from other friends and acquaintances to mark Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003. The president has denied the report, calling the letter a \"FAKE.\"",
      "The president has previously acknowledged he crossed paths with Epstein years ago, but has said they had a \"falling out.\"",
      "The suit names the Journal's publisher, Dow Jones & Company, along with its parent company, News Corporation. Also named in the lawsuit as defendants are Wall Street Journal reporters Joseph Palazzolo and Khadeeja Safdar, the bylines on the Epstein story, as well as Murdoch and Dow Jones CEO Robert Thomson.",
      "In a Truth Social post, Mr. Trump referred to it as a \"POWERHOUSE Lawsuit\" and a \"historic legal action.\"",
      "A Dow Jones spokesperson said in a statement: \"We have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit.\"",
      "Defamation lawsuits face a high bar to success in U.S. courts.

The Justice Department late Friday filed a motion to unseal that grand jury testimony.",
      "Epstein was investigated by federal authorities in Florida in the 2000s, which ended in a non-prosecution agreement and a guilty plea on state prostitution charges, and he was later charged with child sex trafficking in Manhattan in 2019. The government also secured a conviction against Epstein's co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell. It investigated the circumstances of Epstein's death in federal custody, which was deemed a suicide.",
      "The order from Mr. Trump comes after the Justice Department and FBI released a memo stating that Epstein did not have an incriminating \"client list,\" did not try to blackmail any prominent figures, and died by suicide. The memo drew backlash from across the political spectrum, including from some fervent Trump backers, in part because Bondi and other administration figures had promised to release information on Epstein.",

    "summary": "The EPA's Office of Research and Development has more than 1,500 employees, including scientists and researchers, dispersed across the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "The Environmental Protection Agency announced Friday afternoon that it is eliminating its scientific division, known as the Office of Research and Development.",
      "The move to shutter the ORD comes one day after the agency said it was undergoing a reorganization involving several other EPA divisions.",
      "ORD conducts critical research to \"safeguard human health and ecosystems from environmental pollutants,\" according to its website. More than 1,500 employees, including scientists and researchers, are dispersed across the country at 11 different locations, but the bulk are based at the EPA's headquarters in Washington, D.C., and at a large scientific facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.",
      "Eliminating the office will bring $748.8 million in savings, according to a news release from the agency.",
      "The EPA had 16,155 employees back in January 2025, but following voluntary retirements, dismissals, and other reduction in force (RIF) actions, it is now down to 12,488 employees, the agency said in its release Friday, a reduction of about 22% of its staff. The staffing cuts include 3,201 employees who took the Trump administration's so-called \"Fork in the Road\" deferred resignation program, as well as those who took early retirement.",
      "\"Under President Trump's leadership, EPA has taken a close look at our operations to ensure the agency is better equipped than ever to deliver on our core mission of protecting human health and the environment while Powering the Great American Comeback,\" EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement Friday. \"This reduction in force will ensure we can better fulfill that mission while being responsible stewards of your hard-earned tax dollars.\"",
      "It was anticipated that ORD would be impacted, according to earlier documents that outlined the agency's RIF plans. Back in March, the documents indicated that somewhere between 50% to 75% of ORD employees would not be retained, the majority of them leading scientists in their field of research.",
      "A source inside ORD told CBS News Friday that employees found out about the reduction in force via the press release that was sent out to the public, and has not received any formal communication from the agency about what will happen next.",
      "\"A friend texted me the press release,\" the source told CBS News, \"that is how I found out.\"",
      "According to the source, most employees are anxiously checking their email, waiting to see if they'll be reassigned to another program office, or impacted by the reduction.",
      "Some ORD employees have already received notification that they have been reassigned, while most wait to learn their fate. In May, ORD employees were told they would be contacted by other programs inside the agency to discuss potential, lateral moves. But according to the source, it now appears that impacted individuals won't get much of a choice: either take the reassignment if one is offered, or leave the agency.",
      "\"I don't think I can stay in the U.S.,\" one source told CBS News, \"there are no jobs here.\"",
      "Because of cuts to the federal workforce and cuts to scientific research, there are very few scientific positions available in the U.S., and some are now contemplating work abroad.",
      "\"Today's cuts dismantle one of the world's most respected environmental health research organizations,\" said Jennifer Orme-Zavaleta, former EPA principal deputy assistant administrator for science, in a statement. \"EPA's science office has long been recognized internationally for advancing public health protections through rigorous science. Reducing its workforce under the guise of cost savings is both misleading and dangerous. This does not save taxpayers money; it simply shifts costs to hospitals, families and communities left to bear the health and economic consequences of increased pollution and weakened oversight. The people of this country are not well served by these actions. They are left more vulnerable.\"",
      "The ORD's research touches on a range of issues from PFAS, often referred to as \"forever chemicals,\" to water-bourne diseases, soot in the air, and environmental factors that contribute to childhood asthma, Orme-Zavaleta said.",
      "It is made up of six major research program offices, per its website, that include Air, Climate, and Energy, Chemical Safety for Sustainability, Health and Environmental Risk Assessment, Homeland Security, Safe and Sustainable Water Resources and Sustainable and Healthy Communities.",
      "It also includes four major research labs including the Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE), the Center for Environmental Measurement and Modeling (CEMM), the Center for Environmental Solutions and Emergency Response (CESER) and the Center for Public Health and Environmental Assessment (CPHEA).",

      "He also confirmed ICE plans to use data from government programs like Medicaid to locate immigrants suspected of living in the U.S. illegally, including those with criminal histories.",
      "Pressed on concerns about masked ICE officers and the possibility that imposters could exploit the practice by posing as immigration agents, Lyons said, \"That's one of our biggest concerns. And I've said it publicly before, I'm not a proponent of the masks.\"",
      "\"However, if that's a tool that the men and women of ICE to keep themselves and their family safe, then I will allow it,\" Lyons said during his first television network sit-down interview at ICE headquarters in Washington. \"I do kind of push back on the criticism that they don't identify themselves.\"",
      "Asked if he will allow ICE personnel to wear masks, Lyons said, \"I will.\"",
      "More of the interview with Lyons will air on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, July 20, at 10:30 a.m. ET.",
      "Lyons cited the increase in attacks faced by agents at ICE, the agency at the center of President Trump's promise of carrying out the largest deportation operation in American history.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has said attacks against ICE officials have increased by more than 800% this year compared to the same time period in 2024. Numerous instances of violence directed at ICE agents and facilities have occurred in recent weeks, including an armed attack against a detention center in Texas earlier this month that has led to more than a dozen arrests.",
      "Lyons agreed the increase in attacks faced by ICE agents could be partially attributed to the dramatic expansion in immigration arrests under the second Trump administration, acknowledging that the agency is \"more visible in the community.\"",
      "But he argued his agents are being forced to go into communities more often to arrest individuals living in the U.S. illegally, including those with criminal records, because more cities and states have adopted \"sanctuary\" policies that limit local law enforcement cooperation with ICE. Those policies lead many jurisdictions to refrain from notifying ICE when they release inmates who are also in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\"So you are seeing us out more, and I think there is more of a tension,\" Lyons added. \"The immigration mission is one of the forefront of this administration, so it is a lot of scrutiny and publicity to it.\"",
      "Lyons says Medicaid data will be used to \"locate\" those in the U.S. illegally",
      "CBS News also asked Lyons about a report from the Associated Press that an inter-agency agreement had granted ICE access to the personal information of millions of Medicaid enrollees, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers and data on patients' race and ethnicity.",
      "Lyons said ICE is \"working with all of our other federal partners to try to gain intelligence, to locate these individuals that have been ordered deported by a judge or have been released from a sanctuary jurisdiction like we talked about. That is what ICE is using that data for.\"",
      "He cited the \"many\" so-called \"got-ways\" who entered the U.S. illegally without getting caught under the Biden administration and \"just totally disappeared off the grid.\"",
      "Lyons suggested ICE would use different datasets, including from the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services, to locate the \"worst of the worst\" and those ordered deported from the U.S.",

      "Bondi toured Alcatraz, currently part of the National Park Service, along with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, arriving on a Coast Guard vessel. They were joined by a contingent of administration officials and Secret Service staffers who walked in the chilly bay air among the crumbling buildings, many dating back to the late 19th century.",

      "A spokesperson for the Department of Justice told CBS News that Bondi and Burgum were visiting Alcatraz to receive a briefing on the facility and the surrounding island. They were also directing staff to collaborate on the necessary planning to rehabilitate and reopen the facility, the spokesperson said.",
      "In an interview on Fox News, Bondi spoke about Alcatraz's potential to once again hold prisoners.",
      "\"Alcatraz could hold the worst of the worst. It could hold middle-class violent prisoners, it could hold illegal aliens, it could hold anything,\" said Bondi. \"This is a terrific facility, needs a lot of work, but no one has been known to escape from Alcatraz and survive.\"",
      "In May, Mr. Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that he was directing the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, the FBI, and Homeland Security to \"reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America's most ruthless and violent Offenders.\"",
      "Following the announcement, Bureau of Prisons Director William K. Marshall III said in a statement that his agency would \"vigorously pursue all avenues to support and implement the President's agenda\" and that he ordered \"an immediate assessment to determine our needs and the next steps.\"",
      "Alcatraz's history as federal penitentiary",
      "The former Army fortress and military prison was turned into a federal penitentiary in 1934 and housed the country's most infamous criminals, such as Al Capone and \"Machine Gun\" Kelly. However, most of the inmates were not notorious gangsters but prisoners who refused to conform to the rules of other federal institutions.",
      "The prison was said to be escape-proof because of the strong bay currents and cold waters surrounding it. The Bureau of Prisons says\u00a0of the 36 men involved in 14 separate escape attempts, 23 were caught, six were shot and killed during their escape, and two drowned, leaving five others as either successfully escaped or presumed drowned.",
      "The penitentiary was closed in 1963 due to the high operating costs and deteriorating facilities. In 1972, Alcatraz was designated part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area\u00a0under the National Park Service, and the following year it opened to the public as a historic site and tourist attraction. The site\u00a0has undergone multiple restoration efforts to improve visitor facilities and preserve historic structures and natural habitats around the island.",
      "Alcatraz a money-maker for federal government, San Francisco",
      "Alcatraz currently receives about 1.6 million visitors from around the world every year, according to the Park Service. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi lambasted the Trump administration's plans\u00a0to reopen Alcatraz as a prison, which would put an end to the approximately $60 million in annual revenue that tourism brings to the National Park Service. The city of San Francisco benefits indirectly through spending at hotels, restaurants, shops, and local tourism businesses.",
      "\"With stiff competition, the planned announcement to reopen Alcatraz as a federal penitentiary is the Trump Administration's stupidest initiative yet,\" said Pelosi in a prepared statement. \"It should concern us all that clearly the only intellectual resources the Administration has drawn upon for this foolish notion are decades-old fictional Hollywood movies.\"",
      "San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie had no plans to meet with either Bondi or Burgum, according to his office. He issued a statement criticizing the Trump administration's plans for Alcatraz.",
      "\"There's no realistic plan to make Alcatraz reopen as anything other than the wonderful tourist attraction that it currently is,\" Lurie said. \"If the federal government wants to spend billions of dollars, I want them to spend it on clean and safe streets and San Francisco's economic recovery. Alcatraz draws millions of visitors a year, tens of millions of dollars in economic activity, and that is benefiting San Francisco's recovery. We're on the rise and that's what I'm focused on.\"",
      "It's estimated that reopening Alcatraz as a prison would cost hundreds of millions of dollars upfront and up to $100 million a year in operating costs. When the penitentiary was closed in 1963, the annual operating costs were more than three times that of any other federal prison, according to the Bureau of Prisons.",

      "Can you teach an old dog new tricks? Atlantic staff writer Olga Khazan set out to change aspects of her personality she didn't like by forcing herself outside of her comfort zone, and documented the progress she made in her new book, \"Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change\" (Simon & Schuster/Simon Element).",
      "Among the challenges that Khazan, a lifelong introvert, set for herself: Tackling her social anxiety by enrolling in an improv class. Yes, and \u2026 how did that go?",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Susan Spencer's interview with Olga Khazan on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" July 20!",

      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "My journey into extroversion began solitarily, with me watching the improv show Middleditch & Schwartz on Netflix one night. The episode opened with two well-known actors, Thomas Middleditch and Ben Schwartz, spending an uncomfortably long time pulling a premise for their sketch out of a random audience member\u2014a photography intern. Then, on a bare stage, Middleditch pretended to interview Schwartz for a photography job, making up absurd questions like \"embody a gazelle.\"",
      "The audience laughed along gamely, but mostly, the scene reminded me that I needed to file my expense report. I felt uneasy for the actors, like at any moment the crowd could turn on them, leaving them groping for laughs in ghostly silence. I wondered why they couldn't have just written out better scenes ahead of time. And even worse, I knew that soon, I would be in their exact same position, except without the advantage of being a famous comedian.",
      "For my personality-change project, I had decided to focus on each of the five traits intensively for a few months at a time, and I tackled extroversion first. In recent years my life had descended into a rut that I didn't particularly like, and extroversion seemed like the way out. Most days, I worked, made dinner, watched TV, and worked some more. Rich and I were planning to relocate, and it occurred to me that I would have both moved into and out of my house without having met any of my neighbors. A test in a self-help book reminded me that I have \"high loneliness.\"",
      "My \"very low\" extroversion score was probably not surprising to people who know me: My friend Anastasia once sentenced me to attending a party on pain of ending our friendship. But my hard-core introversion could turn pernicious, shading at times into loneliness and isolation. I have a career in which work can expand to fill every crevice of the day, and sometimes I thought that was a good thing, because I didn't have many hobbies or friends to otherwise occupy my time. (And say what you will about extroverts, but they have plenty of hobbies and friends.) I had always told myself I could focus on socializing after my life had stabilized, but the absence of social interaction was, itself, destabilizing.",
      "Of all five traits, extroversion offers the simplest path to personality change: You just have to go out and talk to people. You don't even have to be particularly good at it, or to proclaim yourself an \"extrovert\" while you do it. You just go, and extroversion will find you, like the entire wedding follows the first intrepid dancer.",
      "Coincidentally, this is also the ethos behind improv comedy: You just have to say something. Anything! For the uninitiated, \"improv\" is short for \"improvisational theater.\" The idea is that two or more actors get up on stage without knowing what they'll say or do. They get to the \"scene\" by accepting and building on a partner's improvisations\u2014a concept known as \"yes, and.\" When this is done well, improvisers say there is virtually no difference between improv and scripted theater\u2014a claim about which opinions surely differ.",
      "I knew I needed a commitment device for extroversion\u2014something to force me out of my house and into gregariousness. I decided to try improv, which seemed like the full-immersion extrovert experience.",
      "It also felt like full-immersion insanity. Rich saw me entering my credit-card information into the website of Dojo Comedy, a cozy-looking D.C. improv theater whose logo incorporates a pair of mustachioed Groucho Marx comedy glasses. \"You doing improv is like Larry David doing ice hockey,\" he said.",
      "It's true. My general vibe is less \"yes, and\" and more \"well, actually.\" I've never really liked improv as an art form. I don't find it particularly funny\u2014it's more like an extended inside joke you're never going to get. I thought Middleditch would warm me to improv, but it only turned me off more.",
      "Before the first class a few weeks later, I donned a Groundlings-ready black T-shirt and jeans, hoping to draw as little attention to myself as possible. I tried to shake memories of being so timid in middle-school drama class that I only qualified to be the understudy for the smallest role\u2014Bob Cratchit's daughter. When I typed the address of the improv studio into my phone, I was relieved when the red snake of \"heavier than usual traffic\" indicated that I would have at least an hour to mentally prepare.",
      "The improv class met in an old townhouse, in a room that was, for no discernible reason, filled with dozens of sculptures of elephants. Six of us novices sat in a circle on chairs that looked like they'd been salvaged from Victorian funerals.",
      "The instructor, a short brunette with a brisk, friendly manner, opened by asking us about our past improv experience\u2014none, in my case. One of the other women rattled off a long list of improv classes she had taken. What kind of crazy person does improv multiple times? I wondered. (Me, as it would turn out.)",
      "Right after the instructor said, \"Let's get started,\" I prayed for someone to grab an elephant and knock me unconscious. That didn't happen, so instead I stood up to play warm-up games with a software engineer, two lawyers, and a guy who worked on the Hill. The games were meant to loosen us up for what was to come, which was \"scene work,\" or acting out unscripted mini plays with one another.",
      "First, we learned the improv standard Zip Zap Zop, which involves whooshing beams of energy at one another and taking turns saying \"Zip,\" \"Zap,\" and\u2014you guessed it\u2014 \"Zop.\" The point of the game is to stay unflustered enough to keep up the Zip-Zap-Zop sequence while still whooshing on to someone else in the circle.",
      "I struggled for several reasons: Because of the pandemic, I hadn't been in a room with other people for more than a year. On top of that, I have poor reflexes, and, because we wore masks, you had to determine whether someone was about to Zop you solely by the angle of their eyes.",
      "If someone messed up the sequence\u2014said \"Zip\" to another's \"Zip,\" for instance\u2014we would all stop, clap, and say, \"yay!,\" reinforcing the idea that it's okay to screw up in improv. The spirit of all this was so different from my job, where you can get fired for screwing up, that it felt like some sort of rehab for perfectionists.",
      "Then we moved on to juggling various invisible items between one another, including an invisible ball, which, humiliatingly, we had to refer to as \"invisible ball!\" I sensed that the others were as nervous as I was, but this being D.C., an air of try-hard overachievement subsumed everyone's true emotions. People, myself included, will behave ridiculously if they feel they have no alternative. I imagined all my fellow ball-jugglers back at work the next day, writing emails in which they promised to circle back and touch base. I wondered whether they would think back to this moment of whimsy at their brown-bag lunches, as they gravely discussed the situation in Burkina Faso. Maybe it would make the situation in Burkina Faso seem less chaotic by comparison.",
      "Soon it was time to call an invisible hawk to my arm. I noted with gratitude that at least the blinds were closed, so no one could see us from the street.",

      "Predictably, when she took a personality test four years ago, she was off the charts \u2013 way off \u2013 in neuroticism, or negative emotions \u2026 not that she hadn't tried to find help: \"This whole time I'd been in therapy,\" Khazan said. \"I had taken different medications. I did yoga. And I did all the self-care things. Nothing was truly working.\"",
      "Frustrated, Khazan set out to do something much more radical: She vowed to redesign her whole personality. \"I decided to spend a year trying to change my personality traits,\" she laughed.",
      "Professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala described one's personality as \"your characteristic way of thinking, feeling, and behaving. It's how you think about your behavior and how you act.\"",
      "I asked, \"I always assumed that once you had reached a certain age, your personality was your personality?\"",
      "\"That really is, I think, the prevailing way to think about personality, but it doesn't line up with our science,\" Sauer-Zavala replied.",
      "Personality science is her specialty, and her research at the University of Kentucky could be a game-changer for how we approach mental health issues. She says data tells us it is possible to scientifically change your personality, and that, with the right intervention, introverts can become extroverts \u2026 sloppy people can get neater \u2026 slackers can gain ambition \u2026 and anxious people can learn to be calm. \"In my almost 20 years of treating people with anxiety disorders, I've seen dramatic changes in 12, 16, 20 weeks,\" Sauer-Zavala said.",
      "Step one is a baseline personality test, which asks questions such as: \"I sometimes manipulate people into doing what I want.\"",
      "The next step is forcing yourself to act the opposite of how you normally would. If you're shy, make conversations. If you're messy, make the bed.",
      "Sauer-Zavala said, \"When we make intentional changes to our thinking, our feeling, and our behaviors, and we maintain those changes over time, then we're essentially shifting our personality. We're changing the way we're gonna fill out those bubbles on the personality questionnaire.\"",
      "\"So, you consciously adopt the behavior of the personality that you think you want?\" I asked. \"You make it sound easy.\"",
      "\"It's not easy,\" Sauer-Zavala replied. \"The principles are simple, but the execution is difficult.\"",
      "It wasn't easy for Olga Khazan, the lifelong introvert. Among other strategies to tackle her social anxiety, she enrolled in an improv class with total strangers \u2026 something completely outside her comfort zone. \"I was very, very scared,\" she said. \"Probably for the first three or four months that I did it, my heart was really beating in my chest, and I was deeply uncomfortable.\"",
      "What about it scared her? \"I didn't like looking silly!\" she laughed.",
      "Murphy McHugh, who was Khazan's improv teacher, said, \"For me, doing improv was a life-changing thing. I opened up socially. I became a better listener, a better collaborator.\"",
      "He said as Khazan continued coming to class, he noticed changes in her: \"Relaxing, a little bit less of the cross-armed body language. You see someone relaxed, you see their shoulders drop. You see them laughing, and coming into scenes with an idea.\"",
      "Along with improv, Khazan meditated, went sailing, took conversation classes, and kept a journal, as she describes in a new book, \"Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change.\"",
      "\"Journaling kind of helps you focus on some of the more positive elements of your life that, if you're very neurotic, you tend to kind of gloss over or forget,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Is this a case of fake it 'til you make it?\"",
      "\"Yeah, it is fake it 'til you make it,\" Khazan said. \"Because if you think about it, anything is gonna feel fake if it feels new, right? Anything that you're not accustomed to doing is gonna feel really unnatural. But the only way to make it natural is to do it over and over and over again\"",
      "\"And just incorporate it in who you are?\"",
      "\"Exactly.\"",
      "Today, Khazan is happily married, with a 14-month-old baby. As for that personality she once so disliked, she said, \"I feel like I am a different person today than I was three years ago. I think I genuinely have a different way of living my life, and approaching problems, than I did before.\"",
      "So, what advice does Shannon Sauer-Zavala have for everyone watching with completely unsatisfactory personalities? \"Not to get stuck in a personality-type box,\" she said. \"Think about the life that you want to have, and then know that you can intentionally develop the traits that will facilitate that journey for you.\"",

    "summary": "A groundbreaking IVF trial has raised hope that women with genetic mutations in their own DNA could one day have children without passing on deadly diseases.",
    "story": [
      "Eight healthy babies have been born in the U.K. using a new IVF technique that successfully reduced their risk of inheriting genetic diseases from their mothers, the people behind a world-first trial said Wednesday.",
      "The findings were hailed as a breakthrough, which raises hopes that women with mutations in their mitochondrial DNA could one day have children without passing debilitating or deadly diseases on to the children. One out of every 5,000 births is affected by mitochondrial diseases, which cannot be treated, and include symptoms such as impaired vision, diabetes and muscle wasting.",
      "In 2015, Britain became the first country to approve an in-vitro fertilization technique that uses a small amount of healthy mitochondrial DNA from the egg of a donor \u2014 along with the mother's egg and father's sperm.",
      "Some have called the result of this process \"three-parent babies,\" though researchers have pushed back at this term because only roughly 0.1% of the newborn's DNA comes from the donor.",
      "The results of the much-awaited U.K. trial were published in several papers in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "8 children with DNA from 3 people currently healthy",
      "Out of 22 women to undergo the treatment at the Newcastle Fertility Centre in northeast England, eight babies were born. The four boys and four girls now range from under 6 months to over 2 years old.",
      "The amount of mutated mitochondrial DNA \u2014 which causes disease \u2014   was reduced by 95-100% in six of the babies, according to the research. For the other two newborns, the amount fell by 77-88%, which is still below the range that causes disease.",
      "This indicates the technique was \"effective in reducing transmission\" of diseases between mother and child, one of the studies said.",
      "The eight children are currently healthy, though one had a disturbance of their heart's rhythm which was successfully treated, the researchers said.",
      "Their health will be followed up over the coming years to see if problems arise.",
      "Oxford University reproductive genetics expert Dagan Wells noted that among the eight children, three have shown some signs of what is known as \"reversal,\" which is still little understood.",
      "It is \"a phenomenon where the therapy initially succeeds in producing an embryo with very few defective mitochondria, but by the time the child is born the proportion of abnormal mitochondria in its cells has significantly increased,\" he explained.",
      "Nevertheless, Nils-Goran Larsson, a Swedish reproductive expert not involved in the research, hailed it as a \"breakthrough.\"",
      "The new technique offers a \"very important reproductive option\" for families affected by \"devastating\" mitochondrial diseases, he added.",
      "While the U.K. trial is the first to involve multiple mothers, the eight babies born to them are not the first to be born with DNA from three people. That first came in 2016, after a woman was treated by U.S. fertility specialists in Mexico, where there were no laws regulating the practice. A similar IVF method was used in that groundbreaking case.",
      "Ethical concerns over embryos and \"designer babies\"",
      "Mitochondrial donation remains controversial and has not been approved in many countries, including the United States and France.",
      "Religious leaders have opposed the procedure because it involves the destruction of human embryos. Other opponents have expressed fears it could pave the way for genetically engineered \"designer babies.\"",
      "An ethical review carried out by the U.K.'s independent Nuffield Council on Bioethics was \"instrumental\" in conducting the new research, the council's director Danielle Hamm said Wednesday.",
      "Peter Thompson, head of the U.K.'s Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which approved the procedure, said only people with a \"very high risk\" of passing on a mitochondrial disease would be eligible for the treatment.",
      "Ethical concerns have also been raised over the use of mitochondrial donation for infertility in Greece and Ukraine.",
      "French mitochondrial disease specialist Julie Steffann told AFP that \"it is a question of the risk-benefit ratio: for a mitochondrial disease, the benefit is obvious.\"",

    "story": [
      "The centuries-old complete skeleton of a medieval knight was found under the former site of a famous ice cream shop in Poland, researchers said.",
      "The discovery was made on a small plot in Gda\u0144sk, a city on the country's coast. The site was once home to an ice cream parlor called Mi\u015b, which operated there since 1962 but has since moved to a new location. Researchers say several other archaeological discoveries have been made at the site in recent years, including the remains of cottages dating back to the 12th and 13th century and an ancient city street.",
      "Archaeologists from the ArcheoScan Archaeological and Conservation Workshop were working on the site in July when they found the knight's tombstone. The stone, made of limestone, was engraved with the image of a knight, the organization said on social media. On July 8, the headstone was moved to Gda\u0144sk's Archaeological Museum. Early analysis determined the stone likely dates back to the 13th or 14th century.",
      "Two days later, the team found the complete skeleton of the medieval knight. He was buried about five inches under the tombstone, researchers said on social media. He appears to have been about 40 years old when he died, anthropologist Dr. Aleksandra Pud\u0142o said in an article published on Gda\u0144sk's official website. The knight appears to have been between about 5'6\" and 5'10\" tall, researchers said. Pud\u0142o said the skull and bones of the skeleton were very well-preserved. Gda\u0144sk's website noted that the skull is in worse shape than the other bones.",
      "It's not clear who the knight may have served, according to Gda\u0144sk's official website. The city was captured by a German Catholic military order called the Teutonic Knights in the early 13th century. It's also unclear if the burial predates or postdates the event, researchers said. The knight may have also served the Sobies\u0142aw dynasty, which ruled Gda\u0144sk during the 11th and 12th century.",
      "More research will be conducted on the skeleton and the tombstone, as well as other relics found during the dig. Researchers have found several other notable tombstones, though the knight's appears to be the most impressive. The tombstone will be examined with 3D software, and archaeologists will likely attempt a detailed reconstruction of the artifact. Pud\u0142o said that the skeleton of the knight will undergo a \"thorough examination,\"\u00a0 and the results of that may be available as early as next year.",

      "Warming ocean waters have had a devastating impact on the coral reefs of the Sunshine State. Efforts are underway to save the third-largest barrier reef system in the world, including the use of\u00a0lab-grown corals and the\u00a0removal of healthy corals, but scientists are now trying a method that they say has never been done before.",
      "\"It's the first time ever in the world that an international cross of corals from different countries have been permitted for outplanting on wild reefs,\" Dr. Andrew Baker, a marine biologist at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel  School of Marine Science, told CBS News on a boat ride near Miami.",
      "There are dozens of stony coral species along Florida's 350 miles of reefs, from the Florida Keys up to the St. Lucie Inlet. Two of them are listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, according to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, one of which is the Elkhorn coral.",
      "The Elkhorn species helps form the skeleton of a healthy reef, but according to Baker, more than 95% of the Elkhorn coral off Florida has been wiped out by a combination of factors, including rising temperatures fueled by climate change, increased coastal development and disease outbreaks",
      "\"Over the last 50 years or so, we've lost more of these Elkhorn corals, culminating in 2023 when we had this really warm summer,\" Baker said. \"And in order for that population to recover, it was determined that we need more diversity from outside the Florida population.\"",
      "So, scientists and conservationists started looking off the Caribbean coast in Honduras, specifically Tela Bay, where Elkhorn coral live in \"the kind of conditions where corals have to be really tough to survive,\" Baker said.",
      "To crossbreed the Elkhorns, scientists with Tela Marine, a Honduras-based aquarium and marine research center, carefully plucked coral from the reef in Honduras. Permits were then needed to transport the coral fragments into the U.S.",
      "Once they arrived in Florida, scientists with the University of Miami and the Florida Aquarium in Tampa worked to create the \"Flonduran\" Elkhorn, as it was nicknamed by Baker.",
      "Earlier this month, the crossbred species were planted for the first time in Florida, underneath protective umbrellas to deter predators.",
      "\"And if these corals can live through the next marine heat wave, then that is critical for our coastal protection on the coast of Florida,\" said Keri O'Neil, the director of coral conservation at the Florida Aquarium.",
      "With robust and healthy corals, South Florida's coastal communities are better protected from flooding because the reefs help break up hurricane-fueled waves. The planting of the first Flondurans is just the start of what's needed to rebuild.",

      "The meteor shower is expected to peak from Aug. 12-13, although moonlight will impact meteor visibility. The moon will be 84% full during the peak.",
      "Where and how to view the Perseids",

      "\"The Perseids are one of the most plentiful showers with about 50 to 100 meteors seen per hour,\" NASA says. \"They occur with warm summer nighttime weather allowing sky watchers to comfortably view them.\"",

      "\"Fireballs are larger explosions of light and color that can persist longer than an average meteor streak,\" the space agency says. \"This is due to the fact that fireballs originate from larger particles of cometary material. Fireballs are also brighter.\"",
      "What causes the Perseids meteor shower?",
      "The meteor shower occurs when Earth passes through an area of space debris left by a comet coming around the sun. Debris interacts with Earth's atmosphere and disintegrates, resulting in colorful lines in the sky, according to NASA and the American Meteor Society.",

    "story": [
      "The Perseids meteor shower begins this week and is expected to offer one of the best shows in the sky of 2025.",
      "The event is considered the best meteor shower of the year, according to NASA, and is also the most popular.",
      "When is the 2025 Perseid meteor shower?",
      "The shower begins on Thursday, July 17, and will continue for several weeks, until at least Aug. 23, according to NASA and the\u00a0American Meteor Society, a nonprofit organization.",
      "The meteor shower is expected to peak from Aug. 12-13, although moonlight will impact meteor visibility. The moon will be 84% full during the peak.",
      "Where and how to view the Perseids",
      "NASA says the best time to view the Perseids is early in the morning, before dawn, in the Northern Hemisphere. Sometimes, however, the meteors can be seen at night as early as 10 p.m.",
      "\"The Perseids are one of the most plentiful showers with about 50 to 100 meteors seen per hour,\" NASA says. \"They occur with warm summer nighttime weather allowing sky watchers to comfortably view them.\"",
      "Perseids often leave long \"wakes\" of color and light when they move through Earth's atmosphere. NASA notes they are also known for their fireballs.",
      "\"Fireballs are larger explosions of light and color that can persist longer than an average meteor streak,\" the space agency says. \"This is due to the fact that fireballs originate from larger particles of cometary material. Fireballs are also brighter.\"",
      "What causes the Perseids meteor shower?",
      "The meteor shower occurs when Earth passes through an area of space debris left by a comet coming around the sun. Debris interacts with Earth's atmosphere and disintegrates, resulting in colorful lines in the sky, according to NASA and the American Meteor Society.",
      "\"The pieces of space debris that interact with our atmosphere to create the Perseids originate from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle,\" which last visited the inner solar system in 1992, NASA says.",
      "Swift-Tuttle takes 133 years to orbit the sun, NASA said, and in 1865, Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli became the first person to determine this comet was the source of the Perseids.",
      "When looking at the Perseids, they appear to come from the constellation Perseus, which is why this meteor shower has its name. But as NASA explains, the meteors don't actually originate from the constellation.",

    "summary": "Two black holes merged into one massive one, scientists from an international collaborative group said.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists say they detected the largest-ever merger of two black holes, forming one that is 225 times the mass of the sun, adding that the new discovery \"pushes the limits of\" how astronomers understand how black holes are created.",
      "Two black holes combined to make the massive one, according to the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, an international group that uses gravitational waves to detect black hole mergers and who identified the event. Gravitational waves occur when there are minute distortions in spacetime, caused by events like black hole mergers, the group said in a news release.",
      "One of the black holes was about 103 times the mass of the sun. The other was about 137 times it. These large black holes may have been formed by even earlier mergers, Mark Hannam, a professor at Cardiff University and member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, said in the release.",
      "Even within the merger, the black holes are rapidly spinning, scientists said. Their rotation speed is about 400,000 times Earth's rotation speed, the collaboration said in a graphic. They are moving at about 80% to 90% of the maximum possible speed.",
      "\"The black holes appear to be spinning very rapidly \u2014 near the limit allowed by Einstein's theory of general relativity,\" said Dr. Charlie Hoy, a gravitational-wave astrophysicist, LIGO member and postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Portsmouth, in the news release. \"That makes the signal difficult to model and interpret.\"",
      "The massive black hole has been dubbed GW231123. Its unusual size and behavior is challenging scientists' understanding of black hole formation, Hannam said. Previously, the largest known black hole that came from a merger was about 140 times the mass of the sun.",
      "GW231123's discovery is also opening doors for new avenues of research, astronomers said. The behavior and size of the black hole \"pushes the limits of\" current theoretical models and existing gravitational-wave detection technology, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration said.",
      "\"It will take years for the community to fully unravel this intricate signal pattern and all its implications,\" Dr. Gregorio Carullo, a LIGO member and an assistant professor at the University of Birmingham's Institute for Gravitational Wave Astronomy, said in a statement. \"Despite the most likely explanation remaining a black hole merger, more complex scenarios could be the key to deciphering its unexpected features. Exciting times ahead!\"",
      "The black hole was discovered in November 2023, during an observation period by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. The observation period began in May 2023, and the first part of the period ended in January 2024.",
      "More information about GW231123 and other black holes discovered by the collaboration will be presented this month at the 24th International Conference on General Relativity and Gravitation (GR24) and the 16th Edoardo Amaldi Conference on Gravitational Waves, two conferences presented jointly in Glasgow, Scotland. Data from the observation window will be published later in the summer.

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 15:30:29 -0400",
    "summary": "Backers of the Genius Act, a potentially landmark bill that could help \"stablecoins\" go mainstream, say it would greatly speed electronic payments.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday is signing the Genius Act, the first major federal law governing cryptocurrencies.",
      "The law establishes federal regulations for \"stablecoins,\" which are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency because their value is pegged to fixed assets, like the dollar.",
      "The Genius Act passed in the House on Thursday by a 308-122 vote after being approved\u00a0in the Senate\u00a0last month with broad bipartisan support. The measure is part of a broader push by Republican lawmakers and President Trump to support the cryptocurrency industry and ease regulations around the emerging sector.",
      "\"For the first time in history, Congress has passed bipartisan digital assets legislation through both the Senate and the House. The Genius Act marks a major milestone in securing America's leadership in payments innovation while protecting consumers and strengthening our national security,\" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a statement Thursday following the bill's passage by Congress.",
      "The Genius Act, which is sponsored by Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty, has two Democratic co-sponsors \u2014 Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland \u2014 and two Republican co-sponsors \u2014 South Carolina's Sen. Tim Scott and Wyoming's Sen. Cynthia Lummis.",
      "Here's what to know about stablecoin and how the Genius Act could affect its use.",
      "What is stablecoin?",
      "Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, are prone to extreme swings in value, posing risks to investors. Stablecoins aim to reduce those risks by pegging their value to a less volatile financial asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar.",
      "In a recent interview with\u00a0CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns, Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer at financial technology company Circle,\u00a0 described stablecoins as \"digital dollars.\" As the name implies, stablecoins are intended to be less volatile and risky than other digital tokens, making them a better medium of exchange for bank payments and other financial services, he said.",
      "Circle is a large issuer of stablecoin and backed the passage of the Genius Act.",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's about being able to send dollars outside of banking hours and to send dollars the way you and I might interact with WhatsApp or messaging platforms,\" Disparte said.",
      "Disparte estimates that around 90% of stablecoins are linked to the dollar. Stablecoins are stored and exchanged on the blockchain, the public ledger technology underlying other cryptos.",
      "What will the Genius Act do?",
      "Backed by crypto advocates, the Genius Act (which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) established guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins.",
      "The bill also creates a legal category for stablecoins and establishes clear boundaries for which digital currencies could be referred to as stablecoins.",
      "With the Genius Act passed, banks, nonbanks and credit unions could dive into the market by issuing their own stablecoins.",
      "Along with being less volatile than other virtual currencies, stablecoins can facilitate faster, lower-cost financial transactions, supporters of the technology say. Before the Senate vote on the Genius Act in June, Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the bill's sponsor,\u00a0said\u00a0stablecoins could allow businesses and consumers to settle payments \"nearly instantaneously,\" rather than taking weeks.",
      "Although considered less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins come with risks. One of the biggest is that the digital currency can get \"depegged\" from its underlying asset if that asset's value or liquidity changes. This can trigger trading loses, or systemic market risks to insolvency and liquidity, according to S&P Global Ratings.",
      "In 2023, for example, the failure of U.S. banks Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and Silvergate Bank, caused two types of stablecoins \u2014 the USDC and DAI \u2014 to depeg.",
      "Stablecoins are also subject \"to market volatility, market confidence and adoption, technology risk, demand and supply and market liquidity,\" according to S&P Global.",
      "Are stablecoins catching on in financial services?",
      "As the Genius Act awaited approval from Congress, some of the nation's largest banks were already considering how they could integrate stablecoins into their business as they face mounting competition from fintech players like Circle.",
      "Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser said on the company's earnings call Tuesday that the bank is considering issuing its own form of the cryptocurrency. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, is already developing its digital currency capabilities in an attempt to expand revenue and attract clients, she added.",
      "\"We are closely monitoring developments in the legislative and regulatory space on coin issuance and evaluating how to best to support our clients' needs through our existing 24/7 products like [Citi Token Services], in addition to exploring options around issuing our own external token or coin and working with existing providers,\" Biswarup Chatterjee, global head of partnerships & innovation for Citi's Services business, told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement.",
      "JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, also plans to use stablecoin, CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts in an earnings call on Tuesday.",
      "Outside of the banking world, companies like Walmart and Amazon are also exploring the idea of issuing their own stablecoins, Sam Mcingvale, head of product at blockchain technology company Optimism, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"If new stablecoin legislation is passed, we expect it to open the floodgates even further,\" he said.",
      "What is Trump's position?",
      "Congress' approval of the Genius Act aligns with Mr. Trump's\u00a0commitment in March to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "At a bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last year, Mr. Trump\u00a0also said\u00a0it would be his administration's policy to \"keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken other actions that point to his interest in cryptocurrency. In January, shortly before taking office, he and his wife Melania Trump launched their own meme coins, a highly volatile type of crypto whose value derives from their online popularity.",
      "The president on Tuesdy\u00a0posted\u00a0his support for the Genius Act on Truth Social.",
      "\"The Genius Act is going to put our Great Nation lightyears ahead of China, Europe and all others, who are trying endlessly to catch up, but they just can't do it,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",

      "Hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were easily found with a simple search on TikTok and available to a user under the age of 18, in violation of the platform's own policies, CBS News has found.",
      "CBS News created a TikTok account for a hypothetical 15-year-old female user in the United States and found that, at the very least, hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were searchable and watchable on the platform using the account.",
      "Once the CBS News account interacted with a handful of these videos, similar content was then recommended to the account on TikTok's \"For You\" feed.",
      "Searchable videos ranged from content with captions such as, \"nothing feels better than an empty stomach,\" to \"what I eat in a day\" videos promoting restrictive, 500-calorie-per-day diets. Guidelines published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggest that girls between the ages of 14 and 18 ingest between 1,800 and 2,400 calories per day.",
      "Many of the videos promoted thin body types as aspirational targets and included the hashtag \"harsh motivation\" to push extreme weight loss advice.",
      "Some of those videos included messages or slogans such as \"skinny is a status symbol\" and \"every time you say no to food, you say yes to skinny.\"",
      "TikTok's community guidelines say the platform only allows users over the age of 18 to see content promoting restrictive, low-calorie diets, including videos promoting medications for weight loss or idealizing certain body types. The Chinese-owned platform also says it bans users under the age of 18 from viewing videos that promote cosmetic surgery without warning of the risks, such as before-and-after images, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery.",
      "But CBS News found a range of videos by entering basic search terms on the platform, such as \"skinny,\" \"thin,\" and \"low cal,\" that promoted thin bodies as ideal, while also pushing harmful weight management behaviors. One such video showed an image of a scale with a weight of 39.9 kg (88 pounds) alongside a caption saying \"weight loss\" and the hashtag \"ed,\" which is a common abbreviation for \"eating disorder.\"",
      "Another graphic video with the caption \"ana gives you wings\" showed a series of models with protruding collar bones and spines. The term \"ana\" is an abbreviation for the eating disorder anorexia.",
      "Responding to CBS News' research, a TikTok spokesperson said Thursday that it was \"based on a very limited sample size and does not reflect the experience of the vast majority of our community.\"",
      "\"TikTok does not allow content that promotes disordered eating or extreme weight loss behaviours, and we work with health experts to provide in-app support resources where needed,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson pointed to a study published in May by the University of Southern California, which found that a majority of the eating disorder content on TikTok is discussion among users about recovery from such conditions.",
      "The same study noted, however, the platform's \"dual role in both challenging harmful cultural norms and potentially perpetuating them,\" regarding body image perceptions and eating disorders.",
      "\"We know that this isn't a one-off error on TikTok's part and that children are coming across this content on a scale,\" said Gareth Hill, a spokesperson for the Molly Russell foundation, a charity in the United Kingdom that works to prevent young people from committing self-harm.",
      "\"The question for TikTok is, if this is not representative, then why has this account [created by CBS News], which is a child's account, been shown this content in the first place, and then why is it continuing to get recommended to it?\"",
      "CBS News also found a wide variety of videos available to the under-18 user promoting the weight loss drug Ozempic and various forms of cosmetic surgery. That included videos that showed up on the recommended \"For You\" feed, which promotes cosmetic surgeries such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and liposuction.",
      "In one case, a user talking about their waist reduction surgery included a voiceover saying: \"I would rather die hot than live ugly.\"",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment specifically on CBS News' findings regarding cosmetic surgeries being promoted to underage users.",
      "TikTok says it has taken a range of measures over the past several months to address criticism regarding the availability of extreme weight loss content on the platform. In early June, the platform suspended search results for the viral hashtag #SkinnyTok, after drawing criticism from health experts and European regulators. The hashtag had been associated primarily with videos promoting extreme weight loss, calorie restriction and negative body talk, often presented as wellness advice.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson also told CBS News on Thursday that searches for words or phrases such as #Anorexia would lead users to relevant assistance, including localized eating disorder helplines, where they can access further information and support.",
      "\"I think we're understanding more and more about how this content shows up and so even when you ban a particular hashtag, for example, it's not long until something similar jumps up in its place,\" Doreen Marshall, who leads the American nonprofit National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA], told CBS News.",
      "\"This is going to be an evolving landscape both for creating content guidelines, but also for the platforms themselves and, you know, while some progress has been made, there's clearly more that can be done,\" Marshall said.",
      "TikTok is not the only social media platform that has faced criticism for the accessibility of extreme weight loss content.",
      "In 2022, 60 Minutes reported on a leaked internal document from Meta that showed the company was aware, through its own research, of content on its Instagram platform promoting extreme weight loss and fueling eating disorders in young people.",
      "At the time, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined 60 Minutes' request for an interview but its global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said, \"We want teens to be safe online\" and that Instagram doesn't \"allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders.\"",
      "Last year, 60 Minutes reported that the Google-owned YouTube video platform, which is hugely popular among teenagers, was also serving up extreme weight loss and eating disorder content to children.",

      "President Trump and many leaders of the country's largest   technology and energy companies announced more than $90 billion in new investments\u00a0from private companies for Pennsylvania on Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump, who spoke for about 30 minutes during a roundtable discussion at the\u00a0Inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit\u00a0at\u00a0Carnegie Mellon University, said 20 \"leading technology and energy companies\" will invest in Pennsylvania to develop a new artificial intelligence economy, capitalizing on Pennsylvania's technology and energy assets.",
      "\"We're back in Pittsburgh to announce the largest package of investments in the history of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday.",
      "Among the projects will be the construction of data centers to help provide the enormous amounts of energy needed to power AI, and an energy innovation center to train workers in the Pittsburgh region in energy and AI jobs.",
      "The event was hosted by Republican U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick, who said the Pittsburgh region is uniquely positioned to marry its technological know-how with its vast energy resources in natural gas and nuclear to create a new AI economy. He said the investments will bring \"tens of thousands of jobs\" to Pennsylvania.",
      "\"Our vision for this event came from the realization about the crucial link between artificial intelligence and energy, but never before have the leaders of all those companies, as well as major investors, come together,\" McCormick said on Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump highlighted Westinghouse, saying the Pennsylvania-based company is set to build 10 nuclear reactors across the country. He also touted his involvement in consummating a\u00a0$14 billion partnership between Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel, which he said will revitalize the Mon Valley.",
      "Mr. Trump said the investments announced on Tuesday will spawn the development of AI in the region.",
      "\"We're building a future where American workers will forge the steel, produce the energy, build the factories and really run a country like, I believe, this country has never been run before. I think we have a true golden age for America,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We've been showing it, and it truly is the hottest country anywhere in the world. I'm honored to be in Pennsylvania, and I'm honored to be in Pittsburgh, and you're going to see some real action here.\"",
      "The organizers hope the investments mark only the beginning, hopeful of leveraging  the summit to ramp up energy production, build more data centers, and spawn new AI companies in the Pittbsurgh area \u2014 making the region the center of AI in the country.",
      "\"We have phenomenal technology resources inside of our universities systems,\" PNC Financial Services Group CEO Bill Demchak said on Tuesday. \"We have an abundance of energy, we have Westinghouse in the area. We have labor availability, and we have a huge need as we see the transformation that AI is causing.\"",
      "The event came after Amazon's announcement in June of a $20 billion investment in data centers across Pennsylvania, the largest economic development project in the state's history.",
      "Major political and industry leaders in Pittsburgh",
      "Several of the president's Cabinet members joined him at the summit.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks were among Trump administration officials listed as summit participants.",
      "Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, was also in attendance. He is participating in a panel about major investments in Pennsylvania, moderated by Penn State University President Dr. Neeli Bendapudi.",
      "Industry leaders like Alphabet President and CEO Ruth Porat, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Blackstone President and CEO Jon Gray, Gecko Robotics founder and CEO Jake Loosararian, EQT President and CEO Toby Rice, and Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman were all listed as panel participants, as well.",

      "Mr. Trump's visit was not without pushback, as evidenced on CMU's campus, where signs painted with the words \"protest the summit\" were seen on The Fence.",
      "That sentiment on the CMU Fence was also posted on social media to, in the words of activists, \"call on students and the Pittsburgh community to stand against fossil fuels, AI for surveillance, and authoritarianism.\"",
      "The advocates, who lined the streets across parts of the city, said the summit prioritizes corporate interests over sustainability and ethics.",
      "\"I do believe we should be focusing more on renewable energy, green energy. Just kowtowing to oil and gas is not the way to the future,\" Zach Zourelias of Plum said. \"I'm not saying get rid of it entirely. It is important for Pennsylvania, it is important for the country. But we need to be looking to the future, not the past.\"",
      "Pittsburgh Public Safety said officers used pepper spray on demonstrators outside the event on Tuesday evening.",
      "A spokesperson said police gave dispersal orders to demonstrators blocking the street and confronting attendees leaving the event. The spokesperson said a \"number of demonstrators were actively resisting\" and pushing and shoving officers. That's when two officers deployed pepper spray, officials said.",

      "Elmo's X account posted antisemitic and racist posts after it was hacked on Sunday, a spokesperson for the makers of \"Sesame Street\" said in a statement.",
      "On Tuesday, Elmo's X account posted a statement\u00a0saying the account \"was briefly hacked by an outside party, in spite of the security measures in place.\"",
      "\"We strongly condemn the abhorrent antisemitic and racist content, and the account has since been secured,\" it said. \"These posts in no way reflect the values of Sesame Workshop or Sesame Street, and no one at the organization was involved.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Sesame Workshop, which is the nonprofit organization behind \"Sesame Street,\" had said on Monday that Elmo's X account was \"briefly compromised\" on Sunday \"by an unknown hacker who posted disgusting messages, including antisemitic and racist posts.\"",
      "The spokesperson said the social media account, which is verified and has more than 600,000 followers, has since been secured.",
      "The posts contained slurs against Jews and commentary about President Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender who killed himself in prison in 2019 as he faced federal sex trafficking charges. The posts were removed Sunday afternoon, shortly after appearing on the platform.",
      "Epstein's case has been back in the news after the Justice Department and FBI released a report saying their review had found no evidence of a long-rumored \"client list,\" and that security video confirms no one entered the cell area before Epstein's death. The findings sparked a furor among some Trump supporters after right-wing media figures spent years promoting the idea of a cover-up or conspiracy.",
      "The posts on Elmo's X account were published several days after the team behind Grok, Elon Musk's xAI chatbot, deleted several posts on Musk's X in which the chatbot made antisemitic comments and praised Adolf Hitler. The company later issued an apology.",
      "Musk and X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, have been criticized for a surge of antisemitic and other hate speech on the site since he took ownership in October 2022. Musk allowed previously banned users back onto the platform \u2014 including\u00a0Andrew Tate,\u00a0Kanye West\u00a0and some notorious neo-Nazi figures \u2014 and reduced content moderation in the name of free speech.",
      "The Anti-Defamation League has also also been tracking a rise in antisemitic incidents in the U.S. The nonprofit\u00a0organization  said that last year, it recorded 9,354 antisemitic incidents nationwide, which is the highest number since it started monitoring more than four decades ago.

    "story": [
      "Aaron J. Snoswell is a senior research fellow in AI Accountability at Queensland University of Technology.",
      "Grok, the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot embedded in X (formerly Twitter) and built by Elon Musk's company xAI, is back in the headlines after\u00a0calling itself \"MechaHitler\" and producing pro-Nazi remarks.",
      "The developers have\u00a0apologized\u00a0for the \"inappropriate posts\" and \"taken action to ban hate speech\" from Grok's posts on X. Debates about AI bias have been revived, too.",
      "But the latest Grok controversy is revealing not for the extremist outputs, but for how it exposes a fundamental dishonesty in AI development. Musk claims to be building a \"truth-seeking\" AI free from bias, yet the technical implementation reveals systemic ideological programming.",
      "Pentagon to start using Grok as part of a $200 million contract with Elon Musk's xAIMusk unveils Grok 4 update a day after xAI chatbot made antisemitic remarks",
      "Pentagon to start using Grok as part of a $200 million contract with Elon Musk's xAI",
      "Musk unveils Grok 4 update a day after xAI chatbot made antisemitic remarks",
      "This amounts to an accidental case study in how AI systems embed their creators' values, with Musk's unfiltered public presence making visible what other companies typically obscure.",
      "What is Grok?",
      "Grok is an AI chatbot with \"a\u00a0twist\u00a0of humor and a dash of rebellion\" developed by xAI, which also owns the X social media platform.",
      "The first version of Grok launched in 2023. Independent evaluations suggest the latest model, Grok 4,\u00a0outpaces\u00a0competitors on \"intelligence\" tests. The chatbot is available standalone\u00a0and\u00a0on X.",
      "xAI\u00a0states\u00a0\"AI's knowledge should be all-encompassing and as far-reaching as possible.\" Musk has previously positioned\u00a0Grok\u00a0as a truth-telling alternative to chatbots accused of being \"woke\" by right-wing commentators.",
      "But beyond the latest Nazism scandal, Grok has made headlines for\u00a0generating\u00a0threats of sexual violence,\u00a0bringing\u00a0up \"white genocide\" in South Africa, and making insulting statements about politicians. The latter led to its ban in\u00a0Turkey.",
      "So how do developers imbue an AI with such values and shape chatbot behaviour? Today's chatbots are built using large language models (LLMs), which offer several levers developers can lean on.",
      "What makes an AI \"behave\" this way?",
      "Pre-training",
      "First, developers curate the data used during pre-training \u2013 the first step in building a chatbot. This involves not just filtering unwanted content, but also emphasising desired material.",
      "GPT-3 was shown Wikipedia up to six times more than other datasets as OpenAI considered it higher quality. Grok is trained on various sources, including posts from X, which might explain why Grok has been reported to\u00a0check\u00a0Elon Musk's opinion on controversial topics.",
      "Musk has shared that xAI\u00a0curates\u00a0Grok's training data, for example to improve legal knowledge and to remove LLM-generated content for quality control. He also appealed to the X community for difficult \"galaxy brain\" problems and facts that are \"politically incorrect, but nonetheless factually true\".",
      "We don't know if these data were used, or what quality-control measures were applied.",
      "Fine-tuning",
      "The second step, fine-tuning, adjusts LLM behaviour using feedback. Developers create detailed manuals outlining their preferred ethical stances, which either human reviewers or AI systems then use as a rubric to evaluate and improve the chatbot's responses, effectively coding these values into the machine.",
      "A Business Insider\u00a0investigation\u00a0revealed xAI's instructions to human  \"AI tutors\" instructed them to look for \"woke ideology\" and \"cancel culture\". While the onboarding documents said Grok shouldn't \"impose an opinion that confirms or denies a user's bias\", they also stated it should avoid responses that claim both sides of a debate have merit when they do not.",
      "System prompts",
      "The system prompt \u2013 instructions provided before every conversation \u2013 guides behaviour once the model is deployed.",
      "To its credit, xAI publishes Grok's system prompts. Its instructions to \"assume subjective viewpoints sourced from the media are biased\" and \"not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated\" were likely key factors in the latest controversy.",
      "These prompts are being updated daily at the time of writing, and their evolution is a fascinating case study in itself.",
      "Guardrails",
      "Finally, developers can also add guardrails \u2013 filters that block certain requests or responses. OpenAI claims it doesn't permit ChatGPT \"to generate hateful, harassing, violent or adult content\". Meanwhile, the Chinese model DeepSeek censors discussion of Tianamen Square.",
      "Ad-hoc testing when writing this article suggests Grok is much less restrained in this regard than competitor products.",
      "The transparency paradox",
      "Grok's Nazi controversy highlights a deeper ethical issue: Would we prefer AI companies to be explicitly ideological and honest about it, or maintain the fiction of neutrality while secretly embedding their values?",
      "Every major AI system reflects its creator's worldview \u2013 from Microsoft Copilot's risk-averse corporate perspective to Anthropic Claude's safety-focused ethos. The difference is transparency.",
      "Musk's public statements make it easy to trace Grok's behaviours back to Musk's stated beliefs about \"woke ideology\" and media bias. Meanwhile, when other platforms misfire spectacularly, we're left guessing whether this reflects leadership views, corporate risk aversion, regulatory pressure, or accident.",
      "This feels familiar. Grok resembles Microsoft's 2016 hate-speech-spouting Tay chatbot, also trained on Twitter data and set loose on Twitter before being shut down.",
      "But there's a crucial difference. Tay's racism emerged from user manipulation and poor safeguards \u2013 an unintended consequence. Grok's behaviour appears to stem at least partially from its design.",
      "The real lesson from Grok is about honesty in AI development. As these systems become more powerful and widespread (Grok support in Tesla vehicles was just\u00a0announced), the question isn't whether AI will reflect human values. It's whether companies will be transparent about whose values they're encoding and why.",
      "Musk's approach is simultaneously more honest (we can see his influence) and more deceptive (claiming objectivity while programming subjectivity) than his competitors.",
      "In an industry built on the myth of neutral algorithms, Grok reveals what's been true all along: there's no such thing as unbiased AI \u2013 only AI whose biases we can see with varying degrees of clarity.",

      "One memorable encounter came in 2023, when he came across\u00a0Bill Gladden, a then-99-year-old British veteran who survived a glider landing on D-Day and a bullet that tore through his ankle.",
      "\"I want to give you a hug, thank you. I got tears in my eyes. We were meant to meet,\" Larson told Gladden, as their hands, lined and spotted with age, clasped tightly. Gladden died the following year.",

    "summary": "Authorities determined that three people are still missing from the floods, a sharp drop from the approximately 100 people authorities had previously said were unaccounted for.",
    "story": [
      "The number of people missing in Texas Hill Country following the deadly flooding which struck the region over the Fourth of July holiday weekend has plummeted significantly, officials announced Saturday.",
      "The Kerr County Flood Disaster Joint Information Center determined that three people are still missing from the floods, the city of Kerrville said in a news release. That is a sharp drop from the approximately 100 people authorities had previously said were unaccounted for.",
      "\"Through extensive follow-up work among state and local agencies, many individuals who were initially reported as missing have been verified as safe and removed from the list,\" the city said in its news release. \"This has been an ongoing effort as investigators worked diligently to verify reports of missing persons and confirm their status.\"",
      "Kerrville is the county seat of Kerr County, which was hard-hit by the historic flooding. It is located about 60 miles northwest of San Antonio.",
      "\"We are profoundly grateful to the more than 1,000 local, state, and federal authorities who have worked tirelessly in the wake of the devastating flood that struck our community,\" Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said in a statement. \"Thanks to their extraordinary efforts, the number of individuals previously listed as missing has dropped from over 160 to three.\"",
      "Recovery efforts for those missing are continuing along the Guadalupe River watershed, officials added, with local, state, federal and international search and rescue teams involved.",
      "The flash floods killed at least 135 people in Texas, with most deaths along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County. The Hill Country is naturally prone to flash flooding because its dry, dirt-packed soil cannot soak up heavy rain.",
      "Earlier this week, state officials reduced the number of people unaccounted for from approximately 160 to about 100 in Kerr and other counties. State, federal and international resources were poured into rescue efforts, which were hindered by more rain in mid-July.",
      "Kerr County officials also said earlier this week the number of missing people decreased as victims were recovered, contact was made with people who were found safe, and some reports were found to be unsubstantiated or falsified. Also, they said, the missing list fluctuates as reports come into a hotline.",
      "The floods laid waste to the Hill Country. Vacation cabins, youth camps campgrounds fill the riverbanks and hills of Kerr County, and Camp Mystic, a century-old Christian summer camp for girls in a low-lying area along the Guadalupe. At least 27 of its campers and counselors died. Many of the campers who died were the camp's youngest attendees.",
      "The Texas Legislature is scheduled to convene Monday for a special session. Gov. Greg Abbott initially called lawmakers back to the Texas State Capitol in Austin hoping legislators would pass a measure to regulate a booming business in THC products after he vetoed a bill that would have banned them. Since the flooding, President Donald Trump has also told the Republicans who control state government to redraw congressional districts to help the GOP's chances of retaining a U.S. House majority in next year's midterm elections.",
      "Now, Abbott and other legislative leaders have added flooding-related issues to the agenda. Abbott said lawmakers would also review authorities' handling of the flooding and consider improving warning systems for Hill Country residents. Kerr County does not have a warning system because state and local agencies missed opportunities over the past decade to finance one.",
      "Trump and Abbott have pushed back aggressively against questions about how well local authorities responded to forecasts of heavy rain and the first reports of flash flooding. The president, who visited the area on July 11, called a reporter \"evil\" for raising such issues and said he thought \"everyone did an incredible job under the circumstances.\" Abbott dismissed a question about who was to blame for the deaths as \"the word choice of losers\" and used an analogy that began: \"Every football team makes mistakes.\"",
      "\"The way winners talk is not to point fingers,\" he concluded.",
      "Abbott has designated bills dealing with early warning systems and emergency communications as priorities for the Legislature's special session, scheduled to last 30 days.",
      "The House and Senate have formed special committees on flooding and disaster preparedness, and they're planning a July 31 visit to Kerrville, the seat of hardest-hit Kerr County, to hear comments from residents.",
      "The committees are scheduled to begin with a joint hearing Wednesday to consider the state's response to the fatal floods; planning for floods; infrastructure for managing floods; and communications among first responders. Washington senator Maria Cantwell said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that there is a \"national responsibility\" for the federal government to\u00a0improve forecasting systems.",
      "One bill already introduced by Republican Rep. Don McLaughlin would require the state's top public health official to set building standards for youth camps in 100-year floodplains \u2014 which FEMA defines as a high-risk area with a 1% chance of flooding in any given year.",
      "During a recent news conference, Republican state Rep. Drew Darby, a member of the House's committee, said lawmakers cannot bring back flood victims or undo the flooding.",

      "Residents were shocked by how fast the waters rose. Angel, who has lived in the area for 20 years, said he had never witnessed such intense flooding before.",
      "As of Sunday morning, Sligo Creek Parkway remained closed because of the floods. Other areas also reported road closures throughout Saturday evening.",
      "The flash flood emergency was valid through 9 p.m., according to the National Weather Service. Looking ahead, forecasts predict some light showers Sunday and throughout next week, but it isn't until late next week when the possibility of more notable thunderstorms increases.",

      "For a closer look at the numbers, we're joined by elections and surveys, executive director Anthony Salvanto.",
      "Anthony, good to have you here.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Good morning.",

      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, let me start with immigration, because you're right, that is a big reason he won, deportation, in particular.",
      "The deportation program started with majority approval. And since then, it's declined gradually and then a little more over the last month. But the reason for why it has is pretty compelling, and that is a majority now says they think the administration is trying to deport more people than they'd expected it to.",
      "And then it's the who. They no longer \u2013 a majority no longer thinks that the administration is just trying to prioritize dangerous criminals, that that has expanded. And when they think those things, they're less approving of it overall.",
      "So, another component of this too, which is that you get a majority who doesn't approve of the way in which the administration is using the detention centers as well. So all of that is in the mix. The other part of this, though, is that Donald Trump's handling of immigration more broadly is also down.",
      "And that's happening at the same time that Americans say, because they are, that border crossings have gone down. So, within that gauge on immigration, you see how much the deportation program is really driving things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we have seen and CBS obtained data that the number one issue in terms of convictions for traffic violations and then immigration.",
      "You looked in your polling at the supporters of the president. How are they feeling?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Very, very strongly behind him and especially on this immigration issue and especially on deportation.",
      "And that's an important point, right? His base is still with him. What you see in this dynamic is increasingly a base that really likes what it sees and everybody else with growing doubts. The other part of this is, on the deportation program in particular, we have seen declines among Hispanic Americans, and here again, the why.",
      "Hispanic Americans and Americans overall believe that they, Hispanics, are being targeted or sought after for more searches for deportation compared to other groups. Earlier in the president's term, he had much more overall approval from Hispanics. He had made gains during the election, people will recall, importantly among Hispanics, and now that has fallen off.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president just had this big legislative win with the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill. This was tax. This was spending. A lot of these changes haven't taken hold yet. But what is the perception of it?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: So let's benchmark this. He's got majority disapproval on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's interesting.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: And the why there is, and this is at least initially, as we say, it's that more people think that it will help the wealthy and not help them in particular.",
      "And here we get into focus, because people say the administration is not focused enough on lowering prices and is focused too much on tariffs, which a majority opposes. It's a \u2013 here, there's that juxtaposition of what they expected, what they want to focus on, and what they see as being focused on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president has been talking about firing the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell. We know the Supreme Court said back in May, they signaled here, he doesn't really have the authority to do it without cause.",
      "But we know the Fed's job is to manage employment, manage price stability, and they're supposed to be politically independent, so that there is an interference with the economy. Have you ever polled before on whether there should be \u2013 that the president should really be able to do this?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: We haven't. Most people say they think the Fed should act independently from the president's guidance.",
      "But on that larger point about the way institutions work, we have sometimes asked questions in this administration about things like, who should have the power of the purse? Who should have the final say on spending? We have asked about things like pushing back against judges who rule against the administration.",
      "All of these things, for context, are new. Now, this obviously isn't the first president to try to expand executive power. And that has a long history in politics and in polling. But some of these institutional arrangements and public views of them are certainly new for us here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have a reason to ask, in other words.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's fascinating.",
      "Anthony Salvanto, thank you.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For more on the Trump administration's economic policy, we go now to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.",
      "Welcome back to Face the Nation, Mr. Secretary.",
      "HOWARD LUTNICK (U.S. Commerce Secretary): Great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you heard in our polling some of the perceptions of the economy; 61 percent of Americans believe the administration is putting too much focus on tariffs; 70 percent say the administration is not doing enough to lower prices. And 60 percent oppose new tariffs on imported goods.",
      "This is a centerpiece to your policy plan. How do you reverse public opposition?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Oh, they're going to love the deals that President Trump and I are doing. I mean, they're just going to love them.",
      "The president figured out the right answer and sent letters to these countries, said, this is going to fix the trade deficit. This will go a long way to fixing the trade deficit. And that's gotten these countries to the table. And they're going to open their markets, or they're going to pay the tariff.",
      "And if they open their markets, the opportunity for Americans to export, to grow their business, farmers, ranchers, fishermen, this is going to be \u2013 the next two weeks are going to be weeks for the record books. President Trump is going to deliver for the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Next two weeks for the record books, because you have that August 1 deadline.",
      "But President Trump sent letters to most of the major trading partners announcing higher tariff rates effective August 1. That could hit countries accounting for three-quarters of U.S. imports. Let's talk about Canada, one of the big ones. Their prime minister said this past week there's not a lot of evidence they can get a trade deal with the U.S. that avoids tariffs.",
      "Is your message to Canada, Mr. Secretary, that no matter what they offer at the negotiating table, free trade is gone, there will be a tariff in place?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: No, see, that's silly.",
      "We have a plan called USMCA, U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement. Virtually 75 percent of all goods coming from Mexico and Canada already come in tariff- free. The president said, look, unless you stop this fentanyl and close the border, we're just going to keep tariffs on the other 25 percent. And that's what he has on.",
      "So don't be confused about it. The president understands that we need to open the markets. Canada is not open to us. They need to open their market. Unless they're willing to open their market, they're going to pay a tariff. That's a simple message the president has. It's fair trade. It's reciprocal trade.",
      "Why should we have our country be wide open while theirs is closed? This is an 80-year wrong that President Trump is trying to fix. And our businesses are going to really, really enjoy it. I think the president's going to open between $300 billion and $400 billion of opportunity for Americans.",
      "That's 1.5 percent \u2013 up to 1.5 percent GDP growth because the president's going to open all these markets up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: You saw it with Vietnam. You saw it with Indonesia. You're going to watch all these other countries decide, if they want to do business with America, let's just open our market up to America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: That's opportunity that President Trump is bringing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we saw framework announcements with those countries you just mentioned.",
      "But back on what the Canadian prime minister, the man you're negotiating with, said, he's assuming there's going to be a tariff here. There's already this baseline 10 percent tariff that we are seeing from the administration. Is that set in stone or is it going to go to like 15 or 20 percent?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Well, I think what you have got is, you should assume that the small countries, the Latin American countries, the Caribbean countries, many countries in Africa, they will have a baseline tariff of 10 percent.",
      "And then the bigger economies will either open themselves up or they will pay a fair tariff to America for not opening themselves up and treating America unfairly. So what the president's view is and what he's instructed me to do is say, look, if you're willing to open yourself up and really open your economy to American business to ranchers, fishermen, farmers and businesses, then, of course, we will make a better deal with you.",
      "But if you're going to keep your tariffs and your tariff barriers holding us down, then, of course, it seems fair that you should pay a tariff to do business with the greatest customer on Earth, the American consumer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so just quickly, are you going to renegotiate that free trade deal the USMCA?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Oh, I think the president is absolutely going to renegotiate USMCA.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: But that's a year from today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Today, of course, 75 percent comes in free.",
      "But, of course, should you expect us to renegotiate it? It makes perfect sense for the president to renegotiate it. He wants to protect American jobs. He doesn't want cars built in Canada or Mexico, when they could be built in Michigan or \u2013 and Ohio.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: It's just better for American workers. The president's got the American workers' back. That's why they elected him. That's why the stock market's at all-time highs. They understand the president actually understands business and is doing it the right way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, OK, let me ask you about Europe.",
      "Boeing airplanes, Kentucky bourbon, these are some of the things that the Europeans are looking to target if we get into a trade war as retaliation by them.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We're not \u2013 they're not going to do it. They're just not going to do it. We are\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just met with the European trade negotiator. He came out kind of downbeat. You disagree? You think we are going to get a deal with the European Union?",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: I was on the phone with the European trade negotiators this morning about a half-hour ago. So there's plenty of room.",
      "Look, the president and the European Union, these are the two biggest trading partners in the world talking to each other. We will get a deal done. I am confident we will get a deal done, OK? And it will be great for America because the president has the back of America.",
      "So I think all these key countries will figure out it is better to open their markets to the United States of America than to pay a significant tariff. And Donald Trump has made that point clear. No one has protected America the way Donald Trump has protected America. It is so fun to work for him, because I have him behind me saying the right things for America.",
      "And I get to do those negotiations with all these countries. And you are going to see the best set of trade deals you have ever seen for America and for the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that August 1 deadline with the E.U. a hard deadline? Are you going to get a deal, since you were just on the phone?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: I can't hear anything.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you \u2013 can you hear me, Mr. Secretary? It looks like your shot just froze up on my end.",
      "It looks like our remote shot with the secretary is frozen, so we're going to take a commercial break, try to fix it and try to finish a conversation on the other side of this.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, an update on an important story.",
      "The Hamas-ran Gaza Health Ministry says at least 67 people were killed while waiting for aid from United Nations trucks today. Our CBS Gaza team spoke with eyewitnesses who say that Israeli tanks were behind the hills and, as thousands of people searching for food approached, the tanks opened fire. The IDF tells us that the troops did so to remove \u2013 quote \u2013 \"an immediate threat\" in the area and that the reported number of deaths does not match their initial review.",
      "We will continue to track that as we track the hopes for a hostage deal and cease-fire.",
      "But, right now, we want to go back to the commerce secretary, who I believe can hear me now?",
      "Mr. Secretary?",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: I can hear you now. Yes, I can hear you now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. All right.",
      "But to pick up where we left off before the technical issues, August 1, is it a hard deadline with the E.U. or is that going to slide?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: No, no, that's a hard deadline.",
      "So, on August 1, the new tariff rates will come in. But nothing stops countries from talking to us after August 1, but they're going to start paying the tariffs on August 1. Now, remember, the world is paying 10 percent right now, and China's paying 30 percent. So that's right now. And that's why we're running at about plus-$30 billion a month for the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: You got to remember, this is going to pay off our deficit. This is going to make America stronger.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We are finally protecting America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you will have that income if you keep them in place. But if you're negotiating them away, then they won't be there. So that is contradictory to me.",
      "But I want\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Nothing \u2013 nothing is getting \u2013 no, no, no, no, no, no, no.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're not negotiating the tariffs away?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Nothing is getting negotiated away. We have a 10 percent on the world.",
      "No, no, 10 percent is definitely going to stay. Many countries will pay higher, like Vietnam and Indonesia, right? They're 19 and 20 percent. Most countries will pay higher. The small countries are likely to be 10 percent, but the bigger countries are likely to pay higher. That's just the way it's going to be because we can't have these \u2013 $1 trillion trade deficit.",
      "It's just wrong for America and Donald Trump is going to fix it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And American corporations are just going to swallow that and not pass that price increase on to consumers? What is your projection?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: What, what's so interesting is that you're worried about the importers. How about the people who build and employ Americans\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, I'm asking about people who go to the store to buy.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: \u2026 people who make cars here, people who manufacture here? They don't pay a tariff. They don't pay a tariff at all.",
      "So President Trump says it all the time. Build in America, you don't pay a tariff. The idea that these importers are more important than the people who employ Americans, I think it's just a wrong way of thinking about it. Americans deserve to be employed here and have the best jobs in the world. And that's what Donald Trump is trying to deliver.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I was asking you about consumer prices, what people will pay when they go to the store.",
      "But in \u2013 since you don't want to answer\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Oh, I think they will be low. I think they will be low, shockingly low.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Seriously.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Consumer Price Index doesn't currently reflect that, though, that the trend is towards higher.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Well, it just went up. What did it go up, a tenth-of-a-percent?",
      "Look, the dollar has declined\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Two-tenths on the core.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: \u2026 more than 10 percent, right? So the dollar declining sort of softens tariffs completely. These are small numbers. You're going to see inflation is not going to change.",
      "Remember, inflation is an expectation of rates continuing to grow. Tariffs are just going to reset the price level for imports, for certain imports from certain countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: But everybody is building in America. And, remember, Donald Trump announced over $11 trillion of building in America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: All that building in America, the construction jobs here, but then, when those products come on the shelves, they come on much cheaper. Energy is cheaper. I think you're going to see inflation stay right where it is.",
      "And Jerome Powell, who's held these rates up way too high, way too high, you're going to see him cut rates. The Fed's going to cut rates. Mortgages are going to be cheaper. And America's going to be so much better off under Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are reports that the treasury secretary has talked the president out of his threat to fire the Fed chair, since the Fed's already expected on a consensus basis to be lowering rates.",
      "Are you telling us tonight \u2013 or today that he's not under threat, that he will keep his job?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: The president is an amazingly transparent person. When he thinks something, he says it.",
      "So he says, look, this guy's doing the worst job. We have interest rates the same as Gabon. Europe, all of Europe, the 27 countries of Europe, they're in the 2's, and we're in the 4's. That means your mortgage, everybody who is watching, their mortgage is two points higher than it should be.",
      "So the Fed should be cutting rates. And Donald Trump's going to try to figure out how to get there\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they're projected to.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Whether he decides \u2013 but whether he decides to let Jerome Powell stay in the job or not, I will leave that to Donald Trump.",
      "I think the guy's doing the worst job. He's costing us, you and me and the American people, more than $500 billion. I think he's costing us $700 billion a year by keeping rates too high. It's just wrong. I don't know why he's torturing America this way. Our rates should be lower.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He doesn't unilaterally set those rates.",
      "But we have to leave it there. We are out of time. Mr. Secretary, thank you for joining us and sticking through the technical \u2013 technical issues we had.",
      "We turn now to the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Jim Himes. He joins us from Connecticut.",
      "Good morning to you, Congressman. You are on the Financial Services Committee, so let's pick up right there.",
      "The Supreme Court indicated the president of the United States does not have the authority to fire the Fed chair unless there is cause. It sounds like the White House is trying to build a case that they have cause. If they go ahead with it, what happens?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-Connecticut): Yes.",
      "Well, you know, Margaret, the last question you asked the secretary shows what a con man he is. And I just listened to his whole thing. And if you're over the age of 5, you have dealt with hucksters and con men. Everything's going to be great in two weeks. By August 1, we're going to have a deal. The American people are going to be so happy.",
      "Complete failure to understand the facts, right? He said that tariffs are paid by foreign countries. Tariffs are not paid by foreign countries. He said Jay Powell is torturing the American people.",
      "Margaret, you didn't have the time, but if you had had a minute, you would have said, wait a minute. There's a Federal Open Market Committee that is comprised of seven Fed governors and all of the heads of the Central Bank offices around the country. That committee, comprised of people who have been appointed by Democratic and Republican presidents, set the interest rates, right?",
      "So this notion that Jay Powell is unilaterally stopping a decline in interest rates, which, by the way, in the face of \u2013 in the face \u2013 for those of \u2013 those folks who know a little bit about economics, in the face of upticking inflation, which we're seeing, would be absolutely bananas.",
      "So what you just saw was a master class by a huckster and a con man who uses words like torture that are very, very dangerous words, not just for the economy, but for the physical safety of people like Jay Powell.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, just to be clear, that's why I said it's not the chairman's unilateral decision, for exactly the reason you raised, that there is a committee that makes the decision.",
      "The inflation rate for the CPI was 2.7 percent. If you strip out food \u2013 energy and food, which is more volatile, it is up two-tenths of a percent, so the economic data is what we are pointing to there, not opinion on pricing.",
      "But is there congressional pushback that can be done? I mean, what happens if there's a tweet that says the Fed chair is gone?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, interestingly, inside the White House \u2013 and I don't know who it is \u2013 my guess is, it's maybe the treasury secretary \u2013 is saying \u2013 and this is a very difficult thing to say to a person like Donald Trump \u2013 that, if you fire the Fed chair, either illegally, which they're happy to do, or because you trump up some baloney- like charge associated with a renovation of the headquarters, there is going to be a massive market reaction, because you cannot lie to the capital markets.",
      "We saw this the day after Liberation Day, before we all were familiarized with the TACO trade. The day after Liberation Day, the stock and the bond markets took a nosedive. So my guess is that somebody saying to the president, because he doesn't care if he follows the law or not \u2013 and the law is very clear that he can't fire the Fed chair \u2013 but somebody is saying to the president, the economic instability that gets caused when the cornerstone of the global economy and capital markets all of a sudden has a politically driven interest rate policy\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: \u2026 I think that's the one thing that's holding them off.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, we're going to take a quick break and continue our conversation on a variety of topics we need to bring up with you on the other side with \u2013 of it.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: If you're looking for more Face the Nation, including extended interviews and special content, you can subscribe to our podcast. It's available on all platforms, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify and Amazon.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be right back with Congressman Jim Himes and an exclusive interview with the acting ICE director, Todd Lyons.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We are continuing our conversation now with Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes, who is the ranking member on the Intelligence Committee.",
      "Congressman, I want to pick up on that topic.",
      "Just a statement of fact here. A bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee investigation found that the U.S. intelligence community's assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 election was correct, they deemed it to be so on a bipartisan basis. I'm saying that because today, and yesterday, the director of the intelligence community, Tulsi Gabbard, has said that she is referring for prosecution former American officials she accused of treasonist conspiracy, a year's long coo against President Trump because they assessed Russia had tried to influence the election. This is weeks after the CIA director issued a report critiquing the tradecraft that went into that 2016 assessment.",
      "Is there any legal basis for any kind of prosecution here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-CT): None. Absolutely none, Margaret. What you saw from the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was not just a lie, but a very dangerous lie. Because when you start throwing around language like sedition and treason, somebody's going to get hurt.",
      "Now, you pointed out that the Senate committee, then led by Marco Rubio, a Republican and now secretary of state, found unanimously that Russia medaled in the election to try to assist Donald Trump. John Durham, special council appointed by Donald Trump, investigated this, fund that the Senate report was correct.",
      "Now, what Tulsi is doing, it's a little slight of hand but it's worth focusing on. She is saying that the Intelligence Committee early on said that the Russians could not use cyber tools to mess with the voting infrastructure, the machines that tally our votes. That was true then and it is true now. Though the Russians tried to break into a couple of states', you know, election technical infrastructure, they didn't do it. But it is well known and well established that the Russians hacked into the DNC and undertook any number of influence operations, including buying reams of Facebook ads, to discredit Hillary Clinton. That is not in contention, right?",
      "And what is horrifying about this whole lie out of Gabbard is, number one, it puts people at risk. And right now, you know, the mouth breathers on MAGA online are just going out of their minds based on a lie. And, number two, the intelligence community is full of very, very good people who do their jobs every single day and now they're watching their leader do something that each and every one of them knows is dishonest and it is a really, really bad thing for the safety and security of the American people when that dynamic is \u2013 is \u2013 is out there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That Senate report is online. The findings are \u2013 are there. But I understand your distinction there. It's an important one in influence verses physical hacking.",
      "You are \u2013",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: But, by the way, Margaret, if I may.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: If I may. You asked about the referral.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Here's the test. This is Epstein all over again. Criminal referrals. We're going to prosecute Barack Obama. You know, treasonist and seditious. Here's the thing. And I hope that four, five, six weeks from now. Don't take it from this Democrat. Four or five, six weeks from now, let's see if this administration, Tulsi Gabbard accusing a former president of treason, let's see if they bring charges. They won't. They won't, because there's not a judge in the land, not a single judge, who will treat this with anything other than laughter that will be heard from the Atlantic to the Pacific in this country.",
      "So, the test of this is, four, five, six weeks from now, is the DOJ bringing charges.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: And the answer to that is no. And now we're going to be in Epstein world. We're like, wait a minute, treasonist conspiracy by a former president. Why isn't the Department of Justice bringing charges? And the answer to that question is that it is a lie.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "On the other topic I want to ask you about, as a Democrat, \"The New York Times,\" the DNC \u2013 is reporting the DNC's examination of what went wrong in the last election is going to steer clear the decisions made by the Biden turned Harris campaign.",
      "You were very direct early on in calling for then President Biden to drop out of this race. You don't parse your words normally. Do you actually think it is possible for your party to self-diagnose problems without looking at the presidential race itself in terms of the candidates?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Look, we \u2013 we \u2013 we need to acknowledge, and every \u2013 and all of America saw it on the night of the disastrous debate in the July before the election, that Joe Biden was not going to win the election. That was not just evident in the debate, it was evident in the polling that his people were keeping from him. OK, so that is a fact.",
      "Now, Democrats are a big tent party. We go from Joe Manchin, who's practically a Republican, to AOC, we is a Democratic socialist. So, we always have a struggle in coming up with sort of one set of policies, one set of messaging. And it's particularly hard to do when we don't have a presidential candidate. You know, a presidential candidate, of course, attracts the attention, is sort of the one person who must run nationwide and speak for the party as a whole. Right now we're having a lot of conversations with a lot of different views. And I understand that's enormously frustrating to Democrats who are so upset over the result of the election.",
      "But, you know, other than fight back with the tools that we have right now, we've got to be introspective about what we have done wrong that resulted in a dramatic win by Donald Trump in 2020.*",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: There's an awful lot of rage in the Democratic Party. And my message to my Democratic friends is, fine, I get the rage, believe me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: I was in the chamber on January 6, 2021, and worried for my own life. But the thing to do right now is to be introspective and ask yourself \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: What can we do better to appeal to more people, including those people that we have lost time and time again in elections?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Fifteen months out from the mid-term races.",
      "Congressman Jim Himes, thank you.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mass deportation was one of President Trump's biggest campaign promises. Six months into his administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has deported nearly 150,000 people thus far.",
      "And with the recent passage of Trump's tax and border bill, the agency will be getting an unprecedented infusion of funds, becoming the highest funded law enforcement agency in this country.",
      "Our immigration and politics reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez spoke with the acting director of ICE, Todd Lyons, this Friday. And he began by asking whether the new money will help the administration meet its goal of one million deportations per year.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "TODD LYONS (Acting Director, ICE): I definitely think it's possible. One thing, though, that ICE is historically known for our mission is, we detain to remove. We don't detain punitively. So, people do hear that increase in the bed space, but it's not for the long term. There's no reason for someone to linger in a detention facility after they've been lawfully ordered by an immigration judge. We want to insure that they can get back to their home country safely and quickly.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: More than a dozen individuals are facing charges for that violent attack against an ICE facility in Texas. The Department of Homeland Security, as you know, has also reported a sharp increase in attacks against your agents. What do you think is behind that?",
      "TODD LYONS: I think the sharp increase in the rhetoric, especially from a lot of elected officials that are shaming, if you will, or speaking out against ICE law enforcement mission is what's really increasing these attacks on officers. In that, unfortunately, the Alvarado incident down in Prairieland, that is one that's really taking it to the next level. Just the increase is amazing. The fact that, like you said, 830 percent increase from last year assaults on officers.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Do you think the increase in attacks against ICE officers is connected to the broader increase in ICE arrests across the country? Because you're seeing more arrests, you're seeing more attacks too.",
      "TODD LYONS: I think we're seeing both. I think because we are more visible in the community. You know, there was \u2013 recently people had talked about the amount of support that ICE had under President Obama. Well, during those times, we did make more custodial arrests, those arrests like you would \u2013",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: In jails.",
      "TODD LYONS: In the jails, right? We weren't really out there. We just don't see that now with a lot of the sanctuary policies and just a lot of \u2013 a lot of lack of cooperation. So, you are seeing us out more.",
      "And I think there is more attention. Kind of like you said, the immigration missions, one of the forefront of this administration. So, there is a lot of scrutiny and \u2013 and publicity to it.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: What do you say, Director, to the criticism that law enforcement officials, including ICE officers, should be identifying themselves and that the use of masks could be potentially dangerous, including because it could lead to imposters posing as ICE agents?",
      "TODD LYONS: Yes, and that's one of our biggest concerns. And I've said it publicly before, I'm not a proponent of the masks. However, if that's a tool that the men and women of ICE t hat keep themselves and their families safe, then I will allow it.",
      "I do kind of push back on the criticism that they don't identify themselves. Men and women of ICE and our DOJ partners and local law enforcement do help us. They are identified on their vests. You can see the HIS, ERO, federal police officer, FBI, on the back of the vest. So, I \u2013 I would push back on the notion that we aren't identifying themselves.",
      "Now, what I would advocate for, and I've said this many times, is I know a lot of elected officials have put forward legislation or proposed legislation about banning of the masks, things like that. I would also want, you know, elected officials to help us hold those people accountable that do docks (ph) or threat an ICE officer or agent or their family.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: So, you will continue to allow ICE officers to wear masks during operations?",
      "TODD LYONS: I will.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Do you know how many of the individuals arrested by ICE are people here illegally but who also have serious criminal records?",
      "TODD LYONS: ICE is always focused on the worst of the worst. One difference you'll see now is, under this administration, we have opened up the whole aperture of the immigration portfolio. Meaning that, if you're here illegally and ICE goes out and arrests someone that is released from a sanctuary jurisdiction, are wanted in their home country, and you \u2013 an ICE officer finds others individuals with them who are in the country illegally, we're going to take them as well.",
      "One thing, though, that I'd like to highlight is the fact that foreign criminal records are in U.S. data systems. So, when we do go out and, say, arrest someone that has an Interpol red notice because they're wanted in their home country, they're still a criminal. But under the American judicial standard (ph), they don't have an American criminal history. But that doesn't mean they don't have a criminal history in their home country.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: If your agents encounter anyone who is here illegally, irrespective of whether or not they have a criminal record, that person will be taken into custody?",
      "TODD LYONS: If they're here in the United States illegally, yes, they will. I \u2013",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Those so-called \"collateral arrests.\"",
      "TODD LYONS: Correct.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: We just, as you mentioned, rode along with border \u2013 not Border Patrol, but ICE agents in Maryland, and we saw the agents arresting sex offenders, suspected gang members, the individuals that the president has promised to deport from the country. He often talks about getting rid of the worse of the worse who are in the country illegally.",
      "But we have also seen ICE arrest day laborers outside of Home Depots, in some cases farm workers, people attending their court hearings in immigration court. Is the policy still to prioritize the arrests and deportation of people who are here illegally but also are violent offenders?",
      "TODD LYONS: Yes, ICE Is going to focus on the worst of the worst. And that's what we do need to focus our limited resources on. That's one thing I've always said from the start.",
      "What's, again, frustrating for me is the fact that we would love to focus on these criminal aliens that are inside a jail facility, right? A local law enforcement agency, state agency, already deemed that person a public safety threat and arrested them and they're in detention. I'd much rather focus all of our limited resources on that to take them into custody. But we \u2013 we do have to go out into the community and make those arrests. And that's where you are seeing those increase of if we encounter someone say that is here in the country illegally, we will take them into custody.",
      "In regards to the work site, like you mentioned. One thing that I'd really like to highlight, especially what kicked off June 6th in L.A., is the fact that when you see ICE doing these work raids, like the marijuana grow farm, you \u2013 we are going there with criminal search warrants or criminal arrest warrants. Not only are we focused on those individuals that are, you know, working here illegally, we're focused on these American companies that are actually exploiting these laborers. These people that came here for a better life. You know, either, you know, forced labor, child trafficking, you know, a lot of these work site cases just isn't a victimless crime of someone here working illegally. And that's why we're going there with these criminal warrants to focus on these American businesses that are trying to make an extra dollar on the backs of these people that came here for a better life.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: So, you are planning on holding accountable the employers, the companies that are hiring people who are here illegally, not just the workers?",
      "TODD LYONS: One hundred percent.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Because that has been a concern.",
      "TODD LYONS: It is.",
      "CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Our colleague, Margaret Brennan, recently obtained ICE data showing that only a small percentage of the convicted criminals that ICE has deported over the past six months had convictions for violent offenses. For example, fewer than 1 percent had homicide convictions. What do you make of the data?",
      "TODD LYONS: We can't look at it just based on violence or the propensity of violence in that crime. What I looked at is, someone has committed a crime in the United States. Now, if you look at someone that's just been arrested, say for DUI, well, some people might say that's only a misdemeanor. We may have prevented vehicular homicide down the road for someone who's a habitual traffic offender. I can't look at the largest scale of what a specific crimes are \u2013 are. you know, whether it's a rape, a homicide. Of course, you want to get those worse of the worse. But if someone's committed a crime here in the United States and been let back into the community and are here illegally, we need to focus on that.",

      "Good morning, Madam Mayor.",
      "KAREN BASS (Los Angeles Mayor): Good morning. Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, glad you can hear me.",
      "We are looking at immigration issues six months in. You have had such a first-hand experience out in L.A. given the deployment of U.S. troops. The president ordered the early release of nearly half of the National Guard from L.A. Have they departed yet? What are the remaining ones doing?",
      "KAREN BASS: Well, I believe they've departed, but they were never needed in the first place. And the remaining ones are doing what they were doing all along, which is essentially protecting two federal buildings, one of which in Westwood, where there never has been a big protest against the immigration raids. This is just such an incredible misuse of not only taxpayers' money, but of the young people who are in the National Guard, who have had to leave their families, their jobs, and their education for this deployment that is completely unnecessary.",
      "Four thousand troops, my understanding is most of the time has been spent in complete boredom, playing video games, and essentially waiting around because, again, 4,000 deploy and about 200 actually used.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The White House, of course, argues they deployed them because there was interference with the operations of law enforcement and carrying out some of the roundups.",
      "There are still enforcement actions by ICE taking place. You have talked about your objections, as you've described them, to masked men, unmarked cars drawing guns, snatching people off the street.",
      "KAREN BASS: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've filed a Freedom of Information requests to, quote, \"know who these masked men are.\"",
      "Why, though, is their identity important to you? Do you plan to prosecute them?",
      "KAREN BASS: Well, no. Let me just explain, because you have people who are literally walking down the street, sitting at bus stops, are individual vendors selling fruit on the street. These masked men pull up in unmarked cars and jump out of the cars with rifles and detain people. So, for the average citizen, it looks like it's a violent kidnapping. So, you should never have that. They don't identify themselves. And, furthermore, to your previous guest, how on earth do they know that they're a threat when they're just chasing random people through parking lots, at Home Depots, going to car washes and rounding up people. It's difficult to get your car washed in Los Angeles now because most of the car washes, the employees won't come to work out of fear that a raid will take place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the acting director says that his agents, some of them fear that their families will be retaliated against, and that's why they are covering their faces, that they do wear markings for the agencies that they work with.",
      "KAREN BASS: So \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you respond?",
      "KAREN BASS: Well \u2013 well, first of all, let me just tell you that the masked men are not from Los Angeles. And so, how their families could be retaliated against? And then what is that to say to local law enforcement, the Los Angeles Police Department, none of whom are ever masked, who always identify themselves, and even hand someone a business card. So, that makes absolutely no sense at all.",
      "And I don't know, but I have a hard time believing that the woman selling pineapples on the corner will going to attack an ICE agent.",
      "And then when he says that there is identification, the problem is, many of these men are in plain clothes with vests on that say \"police.\" It looks like something that they could have gotten online. I think it's really important to point out the extreme nature of the randomness. And, you know, Homan has said, he's mentioned a number of criteria for why they stop people. One of the points of criteria is physical appearance. Los Angeles has 3.8 million people and about 50 percent of our population is Latino. So, I guess that means 50 percent of Los Angeles could be possible suspects in an immigration raid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Tom Homan has \u2013",
      "KAREN BASS: It's ridiculous.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tom Homan has said, physical description cannot be the sole factor for reasonable suspicion. But things like location, occupation, physical appearance add up, particularly if a person runs away or if there's a tattoo or something. You don't seem to believe that.",
      "KAREN BASS: Location, sitting at a \u2013 well, location, sitting at a bus stop, walking down the street, selling fruit, no, I do dispute that, absolutely. And, you know, again, the National Guard should have never been deployed in the first place. We did not ask for them. This is the federal seizure of power from a governor deploying the National Guard when the National Guard were not even needed.",
      "We had protests at the end of the violent \u2013 at the end of the peaceful protest. There absolutely was \u2013 was some violence and some looting and vandalism. We brought that completely under control.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "KAREN BASS: The troops have never been involved in crowd control, never involved in the protest. They have been guarding a building. Our police department and our sheriff's department are the ones that brought the protests when it devolved into violence under control. We never needed the National Guard in the first place. This is a political stunt, a terrible misuse of taxpayers' dollars.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "I \u2013 there's more we could talk about here but I want to ask you about fires, because we are now officially in fire season.",
      "KAREN BASS: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was just six months ago we saw those blazes in L.A. You fired the then fire chief for, you said, a failure to prepare.",
      "KAREN BASS: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you still don't have a permanent fire chief in that role. Isn't that a problem? Are you prepared?",
      "KAREN BASS: No. No, I don't think that that's a problem at all. Our interim fire chief has 40 years of experience. In fact, he had just recently retired.",
      "I called him in out of retirement during the fires. He was doing the emergency operations center. So, he stepped in, didn't miss a beat by taking over the fire department. And we are prepared. We do know that it's fire season.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, is your plan to keep him in place since you brought him out of retirement and put him in an interim basis?",
      "KAREN BASS: No. No, I'm sorry. No, we're doing a national search. And he is certainly open to apply. But the nation's second largest city needs to make sure that we search the nation for the best talent. And I'm sure that there will be people in the department that apply. But we want to cast the net wide. We did the same type of search for our police chief.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Well, we \u2013",
      "KAREN BASS: In the meantime, he is more than capable of managing.",

      "\"The District Attorney falsely made up a court date-May 23, 2025-and drafted a fraudulent subpoena that if Aetna did not provide documents on that date, it would be in contempt of Court,\" Mangione's attorney Karen Agnifilo wrote in a letter to the judge. \"Because the District Attorney has taken possession of, and at least partially reviewed, Luigi Mangione's confidential doctor-patient privileged and HIPAA protected medical records, and further because the District Attorney misused the subpoena process to obtain these protected records, this Court should impose an appropriate sanction after conducting a full evidentiary hearing to uncover the extent and nature of the significant privilege and HIPAA violation intentionally caused by the prosecutors.\"",
      "Sources in the Manhattan DA's office say it requested limited information, but Aetna sent them additional materials in error, and that they deleted the materials as soon as they became aware of them.",

      "Washington \u2014 In an exclusive interview, Todd Lyons, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told CBS News he's not a \"proponent\" of agents wearing masks during arrest operations, but said he will allow the practice to continue due to concerns about his officers' safety.",
      "He also confirmed ICE plans to use data from government programs like Medicaid to locate immigrants suspected of living in the U.S. illegally, including those with criminal histories.",
      "Pressed on concerns about masked ICE officers and the possibility that imposters could exploit the practice by posing as immigration agents, Lyons said, \"That's one of our biggest concerns. And I've said it publicly before, I'm not a proponent of the masks.\"",
      "\"However, if that's a tool that the men and women of ICE to keep themselves and their family safe, then I will allow it,\" Lyons said during his first television network sit-down interview at ICE headquarters in Washington. \"I do kind of push back on the criticism that they don't identify themselves.\"",
      "Asked if he will allow ICE personnel to wear masks, Lyons said, \"I will.\"",
      "More of the interview with Lyons will air on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, July 20, at 10:30 a.m. ET.",
      "Lyons cited the increase in attacks faced by agents at ICE, the agency at the center of President Trump's promise of carrying out the largest deportation operation in American history.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has said attacks against ICE officials have increased by more than 800% this year compared to the same time period in 2024. Numerous instances of violence directed at ICE agents and facilities have occurred in recent weeks, including an armed attack against a detention center in Texas earlier this month that has led to more than a dozen arrests.",
      "Lyons agreed the increase in attacks faced by ICE agents could be partially attributed to the dramatic expansion in immigration arrests under the second Trump administration, acknowledging that the agency is \"more visible in the community.\"",
      "But he argued his agents are being forced to go into communities more often to arrest individuals living in the U.S. illegally, including those with criminal records, because more cities and states have adopted \"sanctuary\" policies that limit local law enforcement cooperation with ICE. Those policies lead many jurisdictions to refrain from notifying ICE when they release inmates who are also in the U.S. illegally.",
      "\"So you are seeing us out more, and I think there is more of a tension,\" Lyons added. \"The immigration mission is one of the forefront of this administration, so it is a lot of scrutiny and publicity to it.\"",
      "Lyons says Medicaid data will be used to \"locate\" those in the U.S. illegally",
      "CBS News also asked Lyons about a report from the Associated Press that an inter-agency agreement had granted ICE access to the personal information of millions of Medicaid enrollees, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers and data on patients' race and ethnicity.",
      "Lyons said ICE is \"working with all of our other federal partners to try to gain intelligence, to locate these individuals that have been ordered deported by a judge or have been released from a sanctuary jurisdiction like we talked about. That is what ICE is using that data for.\"",
      "He cited the \"many\" so-called \"got-ways\" who entered the U.S. illegally without getting caught under the Biden administration and \"just totally disappeared off the grid.\"",
      "Lyons suggested ICE would use different datasets, including from the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services, to locate the \"worst of the worst\" and those ordered deported from the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "Older Americans are kicking the can down the road on retirement over concerns about the economy and their own financial readiness to step back from work.",
      "That's according to a new survey from F&G Annuities & Life, which polled 2,000 U.S. adults over 50 years old. The life insurance and annuities company found that 23% of those polled have already decided to delay their retirement as they grapple with questions about their financial readiness, up from 14% in 2024.",
      "The findings come at a time when the median savings of 55-year-olds is just $50,000, far from enough to fund a secure old age, according to\u00a0another recent study\u00a0by Prudential Financial.",
      "The F&G survey provides a snapshot into the thinking of Gen X, ages 45 to 60, whose oldest members are now entering their pre-retirement years. The\u00a0average retirement age\u00a0in the United States is 62, which is also the earliest age at which people can start claiming Social Security benefits.",
      "The longer a person waits to claim Social Security, the higher benefit they'll receive from the program. The full retirement age for people born in 1960 or later is 67, at which point workers can receive their full benefits. Those who delay claiming until age 70, however, can get another 24% boost to their monthly checks.",
      "Among the 23% in the F&G study who plan to delay claims on their Social Security benefits, half cited financial uncertainties or economic volatility as the reason for their decision to delay retirement \u2014 a 10% increase from last year. Forty-four percent said they are worried about inflation, while 34% indicated they are worried about a recession or stock market downturn.",
      "They're not the only ones, according to David John, a senior policy adviser at AARP.\u00a0 The majority of Americans nearing retirement age are unsure of whether they will have enough money to make it through retirement as they fret over inflation and general economy uncertainty, he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Along those lines, Johns said he's also observed that people are cutting back on their retirement savings or pulling money out of retirement savings to deal with unexpected costs or inflationary pressures.",
      "\"Of course, that helps in the short run, but that means that you have even more people who have worries once they start to get to retirement,\" he said.",
      "Unlike 401(k)s and other retirement accounts, Social Security benefits are protected from inflation because the agency institutes a cost-of-living adjustment each year, John pointed out. To guard against disruptions to retirement plans, John suggests that people consistently put away money \u2014 even if it's just a small amount each month.",

    "story": [
      "At least 85 Palestinians were killed while trying to reach aid at locations across Gaza on Sunday, the Hamas-run Health Ministry said, in one of the deadliest days yet for aid-seekers in over 21 months of war.",
      "There was new alarm as Israel's military issued evacuation orders for areas of central Gaza, one of the few areas where it has rarely operated with ground troops and where many international organizations attempting to distribute aid are located.",
      "The largest toll was in northern Gaza, where at least 67 Palestinians were killed while trying to reach aid entering through the Zikim crossing with Israel, according to the Health Ministry and local hospitals. The U.N. World Food Program said 25 trucks with aid had entered for \"starving communities\" when it encountered massive crowds that came under gunfire. It called violence against aid-seekers \"completely unacceptable.\"",
      "The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a U.S.-based organization that has been distributing aid in the territory, said in a statement Sunday that its workers were \"deeply saddened by reports that more than 30 people were killed while trying to access food from a U.N. convoy at the Zikim crossing in Northern Gaza as humanitarian efforts face escalating violence.\" The foundation said it distributed 31,968 boxes of aid throughout the day at two distribution sites.",
      "Some witnesses said Israel's military shot into the crowd at the Zikim crossing. The Israel Defense Forces said they \"fired warning shots in order to remove an immediate threat.\"",
      "\"Suddenly, tanks surrounded us and trapped us as gunshots and strikes rained down. We were trapped for around two hours,\" said Ehab Al-Zei, who had been waiting for flour. \"I will never go back again. Let us die of hunger, it's better.\"",
      "Nafiz Al-Najjar, who was injured, said tanks and drones targeted people \"randomly\" and he saw his cousin and others shot dead.",
      "Israel's military said soldiers had shot at a gathering of thousands of Palestinians in northern Gaza who posed a threat, and it was aware of some casualties. But it said the numbers reported by officials in Gaza were far higher than its initial investigation found.",
      "The military said it was attempting to facilitate the entry of aid, and accused Hamas militants of creating chaos and endangering civilians.",
      "More than 150 people were wounded overall, with some in critical condition, hospitals said. Separately, seven Palestinians were killed while sheltering in tents in Khan Younis in the south, including a 5-year-old boy, according to the Kuwait Specialized Field Hospital, which received the casualties.",
      "The killings in northern Gaza didn't take place near aid distribution points associated with the recently created Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a U.S.- and Israel-backed group. Witnesses and health workers say hundreds of people have been killed by Israeli fire while trying to access the group's aid distribution sites.",
      "The new evacuation orders cut access between the central city of Deir al-Balah and the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis in the narrow territory. The military also reiterated evacuation orders for northern Gaza.",
      "The United Nations has been in contact with Israeli authorities to clarify whether U.N. facilities in the southwestern part of Deir al-Balah are included in the evacuation order, according to a U.N. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to the media. The official said that in previous instances, U.N. facilities were spared from evacuation orders.",
      "The latest order covers an area stretching from a previously evacuated area all the way to the Mediterranean coast and will severely hamper movement for aid groups and civilians in Gaza.",
      "Military spokesman Avichay Adraee called for people to head to the Muwasi area, a desolate tent camp on Gaza's southern coast that Israel's military has designated a humanitarian zone.",
      "The announcement came as Israel and Hamas have been holding ceasefire talks in Qatar, but international mediators say there have been no breakthroughs. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly asserted that expanding Israel's military operations in Gaza will pressure Hamas in negotiations.",
      "Also on Sunday, Pope Leo XIV reiterated his call for an immediate ceasefire, urging the international community to respect international laws and protect civilians in the wake of an Israeli attack on Gaza's only Catholic church last week, which killed three people and wounded 10 others, including the priest.",
      "Earlier this month, Israel's military said it controlled more than 65% of Gaza.",
      "Gaza's population of more than 2 million Palestinians are in a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, now relying largely on the limited aid allowed into the territory. Many people have been displaced multiple times.",
      "Hamas triggered the war when militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage. Most of the hostages or their remains have been released through various deals, while 50 remain in Gaza, but fewer than half are thought to be alive.",
      "Israel's military offensive has killed more than 58,800 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which doesn't say how many militants have been killed but says more than half of the dead have been women and children. The ministry is part of the Hamas government, but the U.N. and other international organizations see it as the most reliable source of data on casualties.",
      "The Hostages Family Forum, a grassroots organization that represents many families of hostages, condemned the new evacuation announcement and demanded that Netanyahu and Israel's military explain what they hope to accomplish in central Gaza, accusing Israel of operating without a clear plan.",
      "\"Enough! The Israeli people overwhelmingly want an end to the fighting and a comprehensive agreement that will return all of the hostages,\" the forum said. On Saturday night, during a weekly protest, tens of thousands marched in Tel Aviv to the branch of the U.S. Embassy, demanding an end to the war.",
      "Ambulances in front of three major hospitals in Gaza sounded their alarms simultaneously Sunday morning in an urgent appeal as the hunger crisis grows. The Health Ministry posted pictures on social media of doctors holding signs about malnourished children and the lack of medication.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 We turn now to Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. Good morning, Madam Mayor.",
      "LOS ANGELES MAYOR KAREN BASS:\u00a0 Good morning, good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Glad you can hear me. We are looking at immigration issues six months in. You have had such a firsthand experience out in LA, given the deployment of U.S. troops. The President ordered the early release of nearly half of the National Guard from LA. Have they departed yet? What are the remaining ones doing?",
      "MAYOR BASS:\u00a0 Well, I believe they've departed, but they were never needed in the first place, and the remaining ones are doing what they were doing all along, which is essentially protecting two federal buildings, one of which in Westwood, where there never has been a big protest against the immigration raids. This is just such an incredible misuse of, not only taxpayers money, but of the young people who are in the National Guard, who have had to leave their families, their jobs and their education for this deployment that is completely unnecessary. 4,000 troops, my understanding, is, most of their time has been spent in complete boredom, playing video games and essentially waiting around. Because again, 4,000 deployed, and about 200 actually used.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 The White House, of course, argues they deployed them because there was interference with the operations of law enforcement in carrying out some of the roundups. There are still enforcement actions by ICE taking place. You have talked about your objections, as you described them to \"masked men, unmarked cars, drawing guns, snatching people off the street.\" You filed a Freedom of Information request to quote, \"know who these masked men are.\" Why, though, is their identity important to you? Do you plan to prosecute them?",
      "MAYOR BASS:\u00a0 Well, no, let me just explain, because you have people who are literally walking down the street, sitting at bus stops, are individual vendors selling fruit on the street. These masked men pull up in unmarked cars and jump out of the cars with rifles and detain people. So for the average citizen, it looks like it's a violent kidnapping. So you should never have that. They don't identify themselves. And furthermore, to your previous guest, how on earth do they know that they're a threat when they're just chasing random people through parking lots at Home Depots, going to car washes and rounding up people. It's difficult to get your car washed in Los Angeles now, because most of the car washes, the employees won't come to work out of fear that a raid will take place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the acting director says that his agents, some of them fear that their families will be retaliated against, and that's why they are covering their faces, that they do wear markings for the agencies that they work with. How do you respond?",
      "MAYOR BASS:\u00a0 Well, well, first of all, let me just tell you that the masked men are not from Los Angeles, and so how their families could be retaliated against. And then what is that to say to local law enforcement, the Los Angeles Police Department, none of whom are ever masked who always identify themselves and even hand someone a business card. So that makes absolutely no sense at all. And I don't know, but I have a hard time believing that the woman selling pineapples on the corner is going to attack an ICE agent. And then when he says that there's identification, the problem is many of these men are in plain clothes with vests on that say 'police,' it looks like something that they could have gotten online. I think it's really important to point out the extreme nature of the randomness. And you know, Homan has said, he's mentioned a number of criteria for why they stop people. One of the points of criteria is physical appearance. Los Angeles is 3.8 million people, and about 50% of our population is Latino, so I guess that means 50% of Los Angeles could be possible suspects in an immigration raid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Tom Homan has- Tom Homan has said physical description cannot be the sole factor for reasonable suspicion, but things like location, occupation, physical appearance add up, particularly if a person runs away, or if there's a tattoo or something. You don't seem to believe that.",
      "MAYOR BASS: Location, sitting at a- well, location, sitting at a bus stop, walking down the street, selling fruit? No, I do dispute that, absolutely. And you know, again, the National Guard should have never been deployed in the first place. We did not ask for them. This is the federal seizure of power from a governor deploying the National Guard when the National Guard were not even needed. We had protests at the end of the- at the end of the peaceful protest, there absolutely was some violence and some looting and vandalism, we brought that completely under control. The troops have never been involved in crowd control, never involved in the protest. They have been guarding a building. Our police department and our sheriff's department are the ones that brought the protests, when it devolved into violence, under control. We never needed the National Guard in the first place. This is a political stunt, a terrible misuse of taxpayers' dollars.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's more we could talk about here but I want to ask you about fires, because we are now officially in fire season. It was just six months ago we saw those blazes in LA, you fired the then fire chief for you said a failure to prepare. But you still don't have a permanent fire chief in that role. Isn't that a problem? Are you prepared?",
      "MAYOR BASS:\u00a0 No, no, I don't think that that's a problem at all. Our interim fire chief has 40 years of experience. In fact, he had just recently retired. I called him in, out of retirement, during the fires. He was doing the emergency operation center. So he stepped in, didn't miss a beat by taking over the fire department. And we are prepared. We do know that it's fire season.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So is your plan to keep him in place since you brought him out of retirement?--",
      "MAYOR BASS: --No--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:--put him in an interim basis?",
      "MAYOR BASS:\u00a0 I'm sorry, no, we're doing a national search, and he is certainly open to apply. But the nation's second-largest city needs to make sure that we search the nation for the best talent. And I'm sure that there will be people in the department that apply, but we want to cast the net wide. We did the same type of search for our police chief--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Well okay--",
      "MAYOR BASS:--in the meantime he is more than capable of managing well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, wish the city well. We will be watching as you move through fire season. Thank you--",
      "MAYOR BASS:--Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 20, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Jim Himes. He joins us from Connecticut. Good morning to you. Congressman, you are on the Financial Services Committee, so let's pick up right there. The Supreme Court indicated that the President of the United States does not have the authority to fire the Fed Chair unless there is cause. It sounds like the White House is trying to build a case that they have cause. If they go ahead with it, what happens?",
      "CONGRESSMAN JIM HIMES: Yeah, well, you know, Margaret, the last question you asked the Secretary, shows what a con man he is. And I just listened to his whole thing. And, you know, if you're over the age of five, you've dealt with hucksters and con men. Everything is going to be great in two weeks. By August 1st, we're going to have a deal. The American people are going to be so happy. Complete failure to understand the facts, right? He said that tariffs are paid by foreign countries. Tariffs are not paid by foreign countries. He said, Jay Powell is torturing the American people. Margaret, you didn't have the time, but if you'd had a minute, you would have said, wait a minute. There's a Federal Open Market Committee that is comprised of seven Fed governors, and all of the heads of the central bank offices around the country. That committee, comprised of people who have been appointed by Democratic and Republican Presidents, set the interest rates, right? So, this notion that Jay Powell is unilaterally stopping a decline in interest rates, which, by the way, in the of- in the face- for those of those folks who know a little bit about economics, in the face of up-ticking inflation, which we're seeing, would be absolutely bananas. So, what you just saw was a master class by a huckster and a con man who uses words like torture that are very, very dangerous words, not just for the economy, but for the physical safety of people like Jay Powell.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, just to be clear, that's why I said it's not the Chairman's unilateral decision for exactly the reason you raised, that there is a committee that makes the decision. The inflation rate for the CPI was 2.7% if you strip out food- energy and food, which is more volatile, it's up two-tenths of a percent. So, that economic data is what we are pointing to there, not opinion on pricing. But, is there congressional pushback that can be done? I mean, what happens if there's a tweet that says the Fed chair is gone?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, interestingly, inside the White House, and I don't know who it is, my guess is it's maybe the Treasury Secretary is saying, and this is a very difficult thing to say to a person like Donald Trump, that if you fire the Fed chair, either illegally, which they're happy to do, or because you trump up some baloney-like-charge associated with a renovation of the headquarters, there is going to be a massive market reaction, because you cannot lie to the capital markets. We saw this the day after Liberation Day, before we all were familiarized with the TACO trade. The day after liberation day, the stock and the bond markets took a nosedive. So, my guess is that somebody is saying to the president because he doesn't care if he follows the law or not, and the law is very clear that he can't fire the Fed chair. But somebody is saying to the President, the economic instability that gets caused when the cornerstone of the global economy and capital markets all of the sudden has a politically driven interest rate policy. I think that's the one thing that's holding them off.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, we're going to take a quick break and continue our conversation on a variety of topics. We need to bring up with you on the other side of it, stay with us.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We are continuing our conversation now with Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes, who is the ranking member on the Intelligence Committee. Congressman, I want to pick up on that topic. Just a statement of fact here: A bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee investigation found that the US intelligence community assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 election was correct. They deemed it to be so on a bipartisan basis. I'm saying that because today and yesterday, the director of the intelligence community, Tulsi Gabbard, has said that she is referring for prosecution former American officials she accused of treasonous conspiracy, a years-long coup against President Trump, because they assessed Russia had tried to influence the election. This is weeks after the CIA Director issued a report critiquing the tradecraft that went into that 2016 assessment. Is there any legal basis for any kind of prosecution here?",
      "REP. HIMES: None, absolutely none. Margaret, what you saw from the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was not just a lie, but a very dangerous lie, because when you start throwing around language like sedition and treason, somebody is going to get hurt. Now, you pointed out that the Senate committee, then led by Marco Rubio, a Republican and now Secretary of State, found unanimously that Russia meddled in the election to try to assist Donald Trump. John Durham, special counsel appointed by Donald Trump, investigated this, found that the Senate report was correct. Now, what Tulsi is doing it's a little sleight of hand, but it's worth focusing on. She is saying that the Intelligence Committee, early on, said that the Russians could not use cyber tools to mess with the voting infrastructure, the machines that tally our votes. And that was true then, and it is true now, though the Russians tried to break into a couple of states, you know, election technical infrastructure. They didn't do it, but it is well known and well established that the Russians hacked into the DNC and undertook any number of other influence operations, including buying reams of Facebook ads to discredit Hillary Clinton. That is not in contention, right? And what is horrifying about this whole lie out of Gabbard is, number one, it puts people at risk. And right now, you know, the mouth-breathers on MAGA online are just going out of their minds based on a lie. And number two, the intelligence community is full of very, good people who do their jobs every single day, and now they're watching their leader do something that each and every one of them knows is dishonest and it is a really, really bad thing for the safety and security of the American people when that dynamic is- is out there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That Senate report is online, the findings are there, but I understand your distinction there, and it's an important one in influence versus physical hacking. You're--",
      "REP. HIMES: -- By- by the way Margaret, if I may- if I may, you asked about the referral. Here's the test. This is Epstein all over again. Criminal referrals. We're going to prosecute Barack Obama, you know, treasonous and seditious. Here's the thing, and I hope that 4, 5, 6, weeks from now- don't take it from this Democrat. 4,5,6, weeks from now, let's see if this administration, Tulsi Gabbard, accusing a former president of treason. Let's see if they bring charges. They won't. They won't, because there's not a judge in the land, not a single judge who will treat this with anything other than laughter that will be heard from the Atlantic to the Pacific in this country. So the test of this is 4,5,6 weeks from now, is the DOJ bringing charges? And the answer to that is no. And now we're going to be in Epstein world. We're like, wait a minute, treasonous conspiracy by a former president. Why isn't the Department of Justice bringing charges? And the answer to that question is that it is a lie.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. On the other topic, I want to ask you about as a Democrat, the New York Times-- the DNC--\u00a0 is reporting the DNC examination of what went wrong in the last election is going to steer clear of the decisions made by the Biden turned Harris campaign. You were very direct early on in calling for then President Biden to drop out of this race. You don't parse your words normally. Do you actually think it is possible for your party to self-diagnose problems without looking at the presidential race itself in terms of the candidates?",
      "REP. HIMES: Look, we need to acknowledge and every- and all of America saw it on the night of that disastrous debate in the July before the election that Joe Biden was not going to win the election. That was not just evident in the debate. It was evident in the polling that his people were keeping from him. Okay, so that is a fact. Now, Democrats are a big tent party. We go from Joe Manchin, who's practically a Republican, to AOC who is a Democratic socialist. So, we always have a struggle in coming up with sort of one set of policies, one set of messaging, and it's particularly hard to do when we don't have a presidential candidate. You know, a presidential candidate, of course, attracts the attention, is sort of the one person who must run nationwide and speak for the party as a whole. Right now, we're having a lot of conversations with a lot of different views, and I understand that's enormously frustrating to Democrats who are so upset over the result of the election. But you know, other than fight back with the tools that we have right now, we've got to be introspective about what we have done wrong that resulted in a dramatic win by Donald Trump in 2020*. There's an awful lot of rage in the Democratic Party, and my message to my Democratic friends is fine. I get the rage, believe me. I was in the chamber on January 6, 2021, and worried for my own life. But the thing to do right now is to be introspective and ask yourself, what can we do better to appeal to more people, including those people that we have lost time and time again in elections.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: 15 months out from the midterm races. Congressman Jim Himes, thank you. We'll be right back.",
      "*President Donald Trump won the 2024 election. Former President Biden won the 2020 election."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For more on the Trump administration's economic policy, we go now to Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick. Welcome back to Face the Nation, Mr. Secretary,",
      "COMMERCE SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you heard in our polling some of the perceptions of the economy; 61% of Americans believe the administration is putting too much focus on tariffs, 70% say the administration is not doing enough to lower prices, and 60% oppose new tariffs on imported goods. This is a centerpiece to your policy plan. How do you reverse public opposition?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: They're going to love the deals that President Trump and I are doing. I mean, they're just going to love them. You know, the president figured out the right answer, and sent letters to these countries, said this is going to fix the trade deficit. This will go a long way to fixing the trade deficit, and that's gotten these countries to the table and they're going to open their markets or they're going to pay the tariff. And if they open their markets, the opportunity for Americans to export, to grow the business, farmers, ranchers, fishermen, this is going to be- the next two weeks, are going to be weeks for the record books. President Trump is going to deliver for the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Next two weeks for the record books, because you have that August 1st deadline. But, President Trump sent letters to most of the major trading partners announcing higher tariff rates effective August 1. That could hit countries accounting for three-quarters of US imports. Let's talk about Canada, one of the big ones. Their Prime Minister said this past week, there's not a lot of evidence they can get a trade deal with the U.S. that avoids tariffs. Is your message to Canada, Mr. Secretary, that no matter what they offer at the negotiating table, free trade is gone, there will be a tariff in place?",
      "LUTNICK: Now, see, that's silly. We have a plan called USMCA. U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Virtually 75% of all goods coming from Mexico and Canada already come in tariff-free. The President said look, unless you stop this fentanyl and close the border, we're just going to keep tariffs on the other 25% and that's what he has on. So, don't be confused about it. The President understands that we need to open the markets. Canada is not open to us. They need to open their market. Unless they're willing to open their market, they're going to pay a tariff. That's a simple message the President has. It's fair trade. It's reciprocal trade. Why should we have our country be wide open while theirs is closed? This is an 80-year wrong that President Trump is trying to fix, and our businesses are going to really, really enjoy it. I think the President is going to open between three and $400 billion of opportunity for Americans. That's 1.5%- up to 1.5% GDP growth, because the president's going to open all these markets up. You saw it with Vietnam. You saw it with Indonesia. You're going to watch all these other countries decide if they want to do business with America, let's just open our market up to America. That's the opportunity that President Trump is bringing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we saw framework announcements with those countries you just mentioned, but back on what the Canadian Prime Minister, the man you're negotiating with, said, he's assuming there's going to be a tariff here. There's already this baseline 10% tariff that we are seeing from the administration. Is that set in stone, or is it going to go to like 15 or 20%?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: Well, I think what you've got is you should assume that the small countries, you know, the Latin American countries, the Caribbean countries, many countries in Africa, they will have a baseline tariff of 10%. And then the bigger economies will either open themselves up or they'll pay a fair tariff to America for not opening themselves up and treating America unfairly. So, what the President's view is, and what he's instructed me to do is say, look, if you're willing to open yourself up and really open your economy to American business, to ranchers, fishermen, farmers, and businesses, then of course, we'll make a better deal with you. But if you're going to keep your tariffs and your tariff barriers holding us down, then of course, it seems fair that you should pay a tariff to do business with the greatest customer on Earth, the American consumer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so just quickly, are you going to renegotiate that free trade deal, the USMCA?",
      "LUTNICK: Oh, I think the President is absolutely going to renegotiate USMCA, but that's a year from today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.",
      "LUTNICK: Of course, 75% comes in free but of course, should you expect us to renegotiate it? It makes perfect sense for the President to renegotiate it. He wants to protect American jobs. He doesn't want cars built in Canada or Mexico when they could be built in Michigan and Ohio. It's just better for American workers. The President's got the American workers back. That's why they elected him. That's why the stock market is at all-time highs. They understand the President actually understands business and is doing it the right way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, okay, let me ask you about Europe. Boeing airplanes, Kentucky bourbon. These are some of the things that the Europeans are looking to target if we get into a trade war as retaliation by them--",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: --they're not going to do it--",
      "[CROSSTALK STARTS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You just met with--",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: --they're just not going to do that\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- the European trade negotiator. He came out kind of downbeat. You disagree, you think we are going to get a deal with the European Union?",
      "LUTNICK: You know, I was on the phone with the European trade negotiators this morning about a half hour ago, so there's plenty of room. Look the president and the European Union, these are the two biggest trading partners in the world talking to each other. We'll get a deal done. I am confident we'll get a deal done. Okay, and it will be great for America, because the President has the back of America. So I think all these key countries will figure out it is better to open the markets to the United States of America than to pay a significant tariff, and Donald Trump has made that point clear. No one has protected America the way Donald Trump has protected America. It is so fun to work for him, because I have him behind me saying the right things for America, and I get to do those negotiations with all these countries, and you are going to see the best set of trade deals you've ever seen for America and for the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that August 1st deadline with the EU a hard deadline? Are you going to get a deal since you were just on the phone?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: I can't hear anything.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you- can you hear me, Mr. Secretary? It looks like your shot just froze up on my end. It looks like our remote shot with the secretary is frozen. So we're going to take a commercial break, try to fix it, and try to finish a conversation on the other side of this.",
      "[ COMMERCIAL BREAK ]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Right now, we want to go back to the Commerce Secretary, who I believe can hear me now. Mr. Secretary?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: I can hear you now",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, but to pick up where we left off before the technical issues, August 1st, is it a hard deadline with the EU, or is that going to slide?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: No, no, that's a hard deadline. So, on August 1, the new tariff rates will come in. But, nothing stops countries from talking to us after August 1, but they're going to start paying the tariffs on August 1. Now remember, the world is paying 10% right now, and China's paying 30%, so that's right now- and that's why we're running at about plus $30 billion a month for the American people. You got to remember, this is going to pay off our deficit. This is going to make America stronger. We are finally protecting America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you'll have that income if you keep them in place. But, if you're negotiating them away, then they won't be there. So, I that that is contradictory to me. But --",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: No, no, no, no, no. \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- So you're not negotiating the tariffs away? --",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: Nothing is getting negotiated away. We have 10% of the world. No, no. 10% is definitely going to stay. Many countries will pay higher, like Vietnam and Indonesia, right? There 19 and 20%. Most countries will pay higher. The small countries are likely to be 10%, but the bigger countries are likely to pay higher. That's just the way it's going to be, because we can't have these $1 trillion trade deficits. It's just wrong for America, and Donald Trump is going to fix it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And American corporations are just going to swallow that, and not pass that price increase on to consumers? What's your projection?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: What's so interesting is that you're worried about the importers. How about the people who build and employ Americans here? \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 No I'm asking about people who go to the store to buy \u2013",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: The people who make cars here, people who manufacture here. They don't pay a tariff. They don't pay a tariff at all. So, President Trump says it all the time, build in America, you don't pay a tariff. The idea that these importers are more important than the people who employ Americans, I think, it's just a wrong way of thinking about it. Americans deserve to be employed here and have the best jobs in the world, and that's what Donald Trump is trying to deliver.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I was asking about consumer prices, what people will pay when they go to the store --",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 Two-tenths on the core \u2013",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: Look, the dollar has declined more than 10%, right? So, the dollar declining sort of softens tariffs completely. These are small numbers. You're going to see, inflation is not going to change. Remember, inflation is an expectation of rates continuing to grow. Tariffs are just going to reset the price level for imports, for certain imports from certain countries. But everybody was building in America. And remember Donald Trump announced over $11 trillion of building in America. All that building in America, the construction jobs here. But then, when those products come on the shelves, they come on much cheaper. Energy is cheaper. I think you're going to see inflation stay right where it is. And Jerome Powell has held these rates up way too high, way too high. You're going to see him cut rates. The Fed is going to cut rates. Mortgages are going to be cheaper, and America is going to be so much better off under Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are reports that the Treasury Secretary has talked the president out of his threat to fire the Fed Chair since the Fed is already expected, on a consensus basis, to be lowering rates. Are you telling us tonight or today that he's not under threat, that he will keep his job?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK:\u00a0 The President is an amazingly transparent person. When he thinks something, he says it. So he said, look, this guy is doing the worst job. We have interest rates the same Gabon. You know, Europe- all of Europe, the 27 countries of Europe are in the twos, and we're in the force. That means your mortgage, everybody's watching, the mortgage is two points higher than it should be. So, the Fed should be cutting rates, and Donald Trump's going to try to figure out how to get there. Whether he decides- whether he decides to let Jerome Powell stay in the job or not, I'll leave that to Donald Trump. I think the guy's doing the worst job. He's costing us, you, me, and the American people, more than $500 billion. I think he's costing us $700 billion a year by keeping rates too high. It's just wrong. I don't know why he's torturing America this way. Our rates should be lower.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He doesn't unilaterally set those rates, but we have to leave it there. We are out of time. Mr. Secretary, thank you for joining us and sticking through the technical- technical issues we had.",

      "Prologue",
      "Two brothers smoothed a map on the table in front of them. The land they were examining was colored in greens, browns, and grays. Running across the map, like the stripes of a tiger, were irregular white blotches. Each blank space represented the unknown, a section of the map still unplotted and unexplored. The squiggly dotted line of a river, unknown printed in small text, cut through the white. It was 1928 and the world was still a checkerboard of wonder, the continents imperfectly mapped. Ted and Kermit Roosevelt, the two eldest sons of former president Theodore Roosevelt, were planning an adventure. Although they consulted maps from a diverse range of cartographers, including those drawn in China, the unexplored regions persisted. The vast Asian continent dappled with white spoke to them. The world was full of explorers, all examining maps like the ones the Roosevelts possessed. There was a heady, optimistic feeling that persisted among them. No one could be certain which mountain was the tallest on earth nor which trench in the ocean the deepest. Every expedition held the possibility of making its members world-famous explorers.",
      "The 1920s were a decade of discovery, as groups of scientists, adventurers, and hunters ventured forth into the wilderness to fill museum collections. They were successful: every large mammal on earth had been attained, and their bodies mounted in exhibits, except for one.",
      "The Roosevelts desired this one animal so acutely that they could barely speak about it with each other, much less anyone else. \"We did not let even our close friends know,\" wrote Ted of their shared purpose. Some dreams sound too wild when spoken aloud. The animal the Roosevelt brothers coveted looked like no other species in the world. It was a black-and-white bear so rare that many people did not believe it was real. This legendary creature was called the giant panda. Rumors swirled about the mysterious animal. No one, not even naturalists who had worked in China all their lives, could say precisely where the creature lived, what it ate, or how it behaved.",
      "Brown, black, and polar bears had never been in doubt among humans. Even polar bears, although living in the remote reaches of the Arctic, were well known, and had been kept in zoos for thousands of years. In Egypt, King Ptolemy II had a polar bear in his zoo in Alexandria as early as 285 BC. In 1252, a polar bear was part of the Tower of London's extensive menagerie of beasts.",
      "Yet the same could not be said of the panda bear. Even among those living in the Republic of China, spanning some 7.7 percent of the earth's landmass, few had ever caught sight of the creature. Dozens of names were used to describe what might be a panda. In different dialects they called it \"spotted bear,\" \"giant bear cat,\" \"white bear,\" and \"bamboo bear,\" although no one could be sure that all these different names were referring to the same species. There were probable references to the giant panda in Chinese literature as early as the third century, although the descriptions were mythical, describing yellow-and-black creatures that munched on copper and iron. \"While there are tantalizing stories implying that one Chinese emperor or another knew all about panda,\" wrote one author, \"there's one great mystery. Why is there not a single rendition of this endearing beast in any of imperial China's illustrated natural histories?\"",

      "Felix Baumgartner, the daredevil who made a record-breaking parachute jump from the stratosphere in 2012, died Thursday in a paragliding accident in Italy, a local mayor confirmed. Firefighters who responded to the scene said they found a paraglider that had crashed into the side of a swimming pool in the city of Porto Sant Elpidio, on central Italy's eastern coast.",
      "\"Our community is deeply affected by the tragic disappearance of Felix Baumgartner, a figure of global prominence, a symbol of courage and passion for extreme flight,\" the town's mayor, Massimiliano Ciarpella, said on Facebook. Ciarpella told The Associated Press that the extreme athlete had been in the area on vacation.",
      "Witnesses told The Associated Press they heard a loud boom as the paraglider spun out of control. Mirella Ivanov, 30, told AP she was in the area with her two young children when they saw the paraglider lose control.",
      "\"Everything was normal, then it started to spin like a top,\" Ivanov said Friday. \"It went down and we heard a roar. In fact, I turned around because I thought it crashed on the rocks.\"",
      "Baumgartner, 56, made global headlines in 2012 when he was lifted into the stratosphere, about 24 miles up, in a capsule carried by a helium balloon, and then parachuted down to a landing in New Mexico. During the jump, he broke the record for fastest free fall, descending at about 843.6 mph and becoming the first human to break the sound barrier without the assistance of a vehicle.",
      "Originally from Austria, Baumgartner began skydiving at age 16 and further honed his skills in the Austrian military, according to his personal website. In 1988, he teamed up with Red Bull, which sponsored the stratosphere jump under the Stratos project and many other daring feats.",
      "The training and planning for the 2012 Stratos jump took five years. Among the records Baumgartner would break that day was highest jump, which had been held by Air Force Capt. Joe Kittinger since 1960, when he leapt from an open-air gondola basket that rose to 102,000 feet. Kittinger would go on to train Baumgartner for the record-breaking Stratos jump. (Baumgartner's height record was broken two years later.)",
      "In addition to skydiving, Baumgartner was an accomplished BASE jumper, breaking two records in 1999: highest BASE jump and lowest BASE jump. The low jump, which he took from one of the hands of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, was only 95 feet. The high jump was taken from the 88th floor of the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, although that record has since been broken and is currently held by the late Valery Rozov, who jumped from Cho Oyu in 2016.",
      "Baumgartner was also a helicopter pilot and was part of Red Bull's aerial acrobatics team.",
      "\"Ever since I was a child, I have always wanted to jump out of a plane,\" Baumgartner told Red Bull in an interview after becoming a licensed helicopter pilot.",
      "\"For Red Bull Stratos, we had a very long list of 'what ifs,' in other words eventualities that could happen and how we would deal with them in an emergency. The list kept getting longer and longer. I was only afraid of the things that were not on the list. The things we had not thought of,\" he told Red Bull, adding: \"To this day, I abort missions if the conditions are not right.\"",
      "While Baumgartner's stunts inspired millions, his political views were known to cause controversy. On social media, he mocked climate activists and others who sought to limit the effects of climate change, and voiced opposition to LGBTQ rights, according to the AFP news agency. He also once suggested Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n should receive the Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-immigration policies.",

    "published": "Fri, 18 Jul 2025 15:30:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Content promoting extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery is available to young TikTok users, breaching the social media platform's policies.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were easily found with a simple search on TikTok and available to a user under the age of 18, in violation of the platform's own policies, CBS News has found.",
      "CBS News created a TikTok account for a hypothetical 15-year-old female user in the United States and found that, at the very least, hundreds of extreme weight loss and cosmetic surgery videos were searchable and watchable on the platform using the account.",
      "Once the CBS News account interacted with a handful of these videos, similar content was then recommended to the account on TikTok's \"For You\" feed.",
      "Searchable videos ranged from content with captions such as, \"nothing feels better than an empty stomach,\" to \"what I eat in a day\" videos promoting restrictive, 500-calorie-per-day diets. Guidelines published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggest that girls between the ages of 14 and 18 ingest between 1,800 and 2,400 calories per day.",
      "Many of the videos promoted thin body types as aspirational targets and included the hashtag \"harsh motivation\" to push extreme weight loss advice.",
      "Some of those videos included messages or slogans such as \"skinny is a status symbol\" and \"every time you say no to food, you say yes to skinny.\"",
      "TikTok's community guidelines say the platform only allows users over the age of 18 to see content promoting restrictive, low-calorie diets, including videos promoting medications for weight loss or idealizing certain body types. The Chinese-owned platform also says it bans users under the age of 18 from viewing videos that promote cosmetic surgery without warning of the risks, such as before-and-after images, videos of surgical procedures, and messages discussing elective cosmetic surgery.",
      "But CBS News found a range of videos by entering basic search terms on the platform, such as \"skinny,\" \"thin,\" and \"low cal,\" that promoted thin bodies as ideal, while also pushing harmful weight management behaviors. One such video showed an image of a scale with a weight of 39.9 kg (88 pounds) alongside a caption saying \"weight loss\" and the hashtag \"ed,\" which is a common abbreviation for \"eating disorder.\"",
      "Another graphic video with the caption \"ana gives you wings\" showed a series of models with protruding collar bones and spines. The term \"ana\" is an abbreviation for the eating disorder anorexia.",
      "Responding to CBS News' research, a TikTok spokesperson said Thursday that it was \"based on a very limited sample size and does not reflect the experience of the vast majority of our community.\"",
      "\"TikTok does not allow content that promotes disordered eating or extreme weight loss behaviours, and we work with health experts to provide in-app support resources where needed,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The spokesperson pointed to a study published in May by the University of Southern California, which found that a majority of the eating disorder content on TikTok is discussion among users about recovery from such conditions.",
      "The same study noted, however, the platform's \"dual role in both challenging harmful cultural norms and potentially perpetuating them,\" regarding body image perceptions and eating disorders.",
      "\"We know that this isn't a one-off error on TikTok's part and that children are coming across this content on a scale,\" said Gareth Hill, a spokesperson for the Molly Russell foundation, a charity in the United Kingdom that works to prevent young people from committing self-harm.",
      "\"The question for TikTok is, if this is not representative, then why has this account [created by CBS News], which is a child's account, been shown this content in the first place, and then why is it continuing to get recommended to it?\"",
      "CBS News also found a wide variety of videos available to the under-18 user promoting the weight loss drug Ozempic and various forms of cosmetic surgery. That included videos that showed up on the recommended \"For You\" feed, which promotes cosmetic surgeries such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and liposuction.",
      "In one case, a user talking about their waist reduction surgery included a voiceover saying: \"I would rather die hot than live ugly.\"",
      "A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment specifically on CBS News' findings regarding cosmetic surgeries being promoted to underage users.",
      "TikTok says it has taken a range of measures over the past several months to address criticism regarding the availability of extreme weight loss content on the platform. In early June, the platform suspended search results for the viral hashtag #SkinnyTok, after drawing criticism from health experts and European regulators. The hashtag had been associated primarily with videos promoting extreme weight loss, calorie restriction and negative body talk, often presented as wellness advice.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson also told CBS News on Thursday that searches for words or phrases such as #Anorexia would lead users to relevant assistance, including localized eating disorder helplines, where they can access further information and support.",
      "\"I think we're understanding more and more about how this content shows up and so even when you ban a particular hashtag, for example, it's not long until something similar jumps up in its place,\" Doreen Marshall, who leads the American nonprofit National Eating Disorders Association [NEDA], told CBS News.",
      "\"This is going to be an evolving landscape both for creating content guidelines, but also for the platforms themselves and, you know, while some progress has been made, there's clearly more that can be done,\" Marshall said.",
      "TikTok is not the only social media platform that has faced criticism for the accessibility of extreme weight loss content.",
      "In 2022, 60 Minutes reported on a leaked internal document from Meta that showed the company was aware, through its own research, of content on its Instagram platform promoting extreme weight loss and fueling eating disorders in young people.",
      "At the time, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined 60 Minutes' request for an interview but its global head of safety, Antigone Davis, said, \"We want teens to be safe online\" and that Instagram doesn't \"allow content promoting self-harm or eating disorders.\"",
      "Last year, 60 Minutes reported that the Google-owned YouTube video platform, which is hugely popular among teenagers, was also serving up extreme weight loss and eating disorder content to children.",

      "The centuries-old complete skeleton of a medieval knight was found under the former site of a famous ice cream shop in Poland, researchers said.",
      "The discovery was made on a small plot in Gda\u0144sk, a city on the country's coast. The site was once home to an ice cream parlor called Mi\u015b, which operated there since 1962 but has since moved to a new location. Researchers say several other archaeological discoveries have been made at the site in recent years, including the remains of cottages dating back to the 12th and 13th century and an ancient city street.",
      "Archaeologists from the ArcheoScan Archaeological and Conservation Workshop were working on the site in July when they found the knight's tombstone. The stone, made of limestone, was engraved with the image of a knight, the organization said on social media. On July 8, the headstone was moved to Gda\u0144sk's Archaeological Museum. Early analysis determined the stone likely dates back to the 13th or 14th century.",
      "Two days later, the team found the complete skeleton of the medieval knight. He was buried about five inches under the tombstone, researchers said on social media. He appears to have been about 40 years old when he died, anthropologist Dr. Aleksandra Pud\u0142o said in an article published on Gda\u0144sk's official website. The knight appears to have been between about 5'6\" and 5'10\" tall, researchers said. Pud\u0142o said the skull and bones of the skeleton were very well-preserved. Gda\u0144sk's website noted that the skull is in worse shape than the other bones.",
      "It's not clear who the knight may have served, according to Gda\u0144sk's official website. The city was captured by a German Catholic military order called the Teutonic Knights in the early 13th century. It's also unclear if the burial predates or postdates the event, researchers said. The knight may have also served the Sobies\u0142aw dynasty, which ruled Gda\u0144sk during the 11th and 12th century.",
      "More research will be conducted on the skeleton and the tombstone, as well as other relics found during the dig. Researchers have found several other notable tombstones, though the knight's appears to be the most impressive. The tombstone will be examined with 3D software, and archaeologists will likely attempt a detailed reconstruction of the artifact.

It's like he didn't want us to leave without hearing him first. At the end of the night, he drives us up to our house, gets out of the car. He gave both my wife Jane and me a kiss and a hug. Then he tells us, \u2018I love you.\u2019 John was not standoffish, but I'd never seen him do anything like that.\"",

      "As rescue crews and volunteers work to clean up after the tragic flooding that violently swept through central Texas over the July 4 weekend, others are looking to help survivors and victims\u2019 loved ones mentally recover. Dallas-based pediatric psychiatrist and assistant professor at UT Southwestern Medical Center Dr. Sabrina Browne spoke with Fox News Digital about what survivors and those close to victims could be grappling with.",
      "\"Tragedies like this, in a very literal sense, hit close to home, right? It\u2019s one thing when you see things playing out on TV, but when it happens in your community, it really affects your life on every level,\" Browne told Fox News Digital. \"The reality for these families is that once the camera crews are gone and once the aid organizations are packing up, they\u2019re still going to be living with the repercussions of this.\"",
      "There are several possible reactions people may have in the wake of a tragedy, like the recent flooding. According to Browne, one of the most common reactions is a loss of a \"feeling of safety\" and a \"sense of stability.\"",
      "\"You take for granted that you're gonna wake up in the morning, go about your day, you're going to come home to your house, right? And all of those things. And so they lose that sense of stability,\" Browne said.",

      "She added that along with this loss of stability, some people can experience anxiety, worry or even fear that another disaster is around the corner. The mental health professional also mentioned that flood survivors could experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and even survivor\u2019s guilt.",
      "Browne has unique experience in helping Texas families through tragedy, having supported families in the wake of the 2022 Uvalde school shooting, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed at Robb Elementary School.",
      "Like the case of the Uvalde shooting, many of the flood victims in Texas were children. Browne spoke to the differences in treating adults versus children, emphasizing that \"kids aren\u2019t just little adults.\"",
      "\"When we talk about kids, that's a wide spectrum of ages and developmental levels,\" Browne said. \"A child who is 12 is going to be having a different experience than a child who\u2019s seven, right? Because they\u2019re more mature, they cognitively can understand things.\"",
      "Beyond their ability to understand what has happened, this could be a child\u2019s first time dealing with disaster and death.",
      "\"Oftentimes, kids are encountering [death] in the setting of losing a grandparent or someone where it feels removed from them. But when they're seeing their peers, other kids in camp, when school starts back up, starting school and seeing maybe their friends aren't there, that brings it to a very real level so that now they're having to wrap their heads around, what does that mean? And then they're also struggling with, is this something that could happen to me? And so that can add another layer.\"",

      "\"If we notice that, you know, they're, they are not sleeping, they don't want to eat, they don\u2019t want to play, right? Those big shifts, that is a sign of we need to get them in to see somebody for more support,\" Browne said.",

The program, meant to meet federal contracting regulations, used a system of \"digital escort\" chaperones for global cybersecurity officials, such as those based in China, meant to create a security buffer so that they can work on agency computing systems.

      "NEW GOOGLE AI MAKES ROBOTS SMARTER WITHOUT THE CLOUD",
      "Amazon website\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is Amazon\u2019s Starfish AI project?",
      "Starfish is a multi-year initiative built around generative AI. According to an internal Amazon document obtained by Business Insider, the system gathers product data from across the web, including external websites and images. It then uses large language models (LLMs) to create \"complete, correct and consistent\" product listings. This isn't a small update. Amazon expects Starfish to boost sales by $7.5 billion in 2025 alone by improving conversion rates and expanding product variety.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How Amazon is using AI to improve product listings",
      "Starfish builds on earlier AI tools that Amazon began testing in 2023. These tools could:",

      "Fill in missing data for third-party listings",

      "Now, with Starfish, Amazon wants to scale that effort across millions of listings. The AI will also collect data from 200,000 external brand websites by crawling, scraping and mapping their content to Amazon's catalog. It's not yet clear whether Amazon's own web crawler, Amazonbot, is powering Starfish. But the company confirmed to Business Insider that Starfish is already supporting its new \"Buy for Me\" feature. This feature recommends products from external websites and lets shoppers buy them directly within Amazon's app.",
      "A person shopping on Amazon (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why Amazon built the Starfish AI for marketplace listings",
      "Manually creating product listings is slow and often inconsistent. That's a problem when Amazon wants to offer a massive selection with reliable information. If shoppers can't find what they're looking for, or if the listings are vague, they may head elsewhere. Starfish addresses this by automating the tedious parts of listing creation. That helps sellers spend less time writing and more time selling. For Amazon, better listings mean higher conversion rates and happier customers. Plus, this move positions Amazon to compete more directly with Google Shopping, which also aims to be a central hub for product information.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Amazon\u2019s Starfish AI is expanding globally",
      "Amazon is testing Starfish's effectiveness with A/B comparisons, measuring sales performance of AI-enriched listings versus standard ones. It's also rolling out bulk listing tools and preparing to expand the system globally. This isn't just about improving Amazon's website. It's about changing the way product information is gathered, created and shared at scale.",
      "A person shopping on Amazon\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What does this mean for you as an Amazon shopper or seller",
      "If you're a shopper on Amazon, this could mean faster access to clearer, more accurate product listings, especially for obscure or hard-to-find items. As Amazon's AI fills in missing details and improves titles and descriptions, the results should help you make better decisions with less research.",
      "For sellers, this streamlines the work of creating listings. If you've struggled to write compelling descriptions or keep up with Amazon's catalog standards, the Starfish project may do much of the heavy lifting. That could save time, reduce errors and improve sales performance.",
      "However, there are some trade-offs. As Amazon scrapes more data from across the web to power its listings, brands and smaller websites may worry about how their product information is being used. And if AI-generated content becomes widespread, quality and trust in listings may vary depending on how well the system works.",
      "In short, expect a more automated Amazon shopping experience, with both conveniences and questions about how your data and the broader web are being used to power it.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Amazon's Starfish project signals a major shift in how e-commerce works. By combining web scraping, AI models and deep integration into its Marketplace, Amazon hopes to automate one of the most time-consuming parts of online selling. For buyers and sellers, this could mean more convenience and better results. But it also raises important questions about transparency, data ownership and the future role of AI in shaping what we see online.",

      "Keep in mind that this list may not include every product affected by these vulnerabilities. As more research emerges, the list could change. Furthermore, not every device faces all the same risks. For instance, at least one manufacturer seems to have already addressed CVE-2025-20700 and CVE-2025-20701. However, we do not know if this fix was intentional or accidental.",
      "Because of these factors, getting a complete and accurate picture of which devices are truly secure remains a challenge. As a consumer, you should stay alert for updates and check with your device's manufacturer for the latest information.",

      "Firmware updates rolling out but gaps remain",
      "Airoha has addressed the vulnerabilities in its software development kit (SDK) and released an updated version to device manufacturers in early June. These manufacturers are now responsible for building and distributing firmware updates to affected products. If you haven't seen an update yet, it should be arriving soon, though some may already be available.",
      "However, there's a catch. According to a report by German outlet Heise, many of the most recent firmware updates for affected devices were released before Airoha provided its official fix. This means some products may still be running vulnerable code, despite appearing up to date.",
      "To make matters more complicated, consumers typically aren't notified directly about these updates. Firmware patches for headphones and similar devices often install silently, or in some cases, may not be delivered at all. As a result, most users have no way of knowing whether their devices are secure or still exposed to risk.",

      "5 ways you can stay safe from Bluetooth vulnerabilities",
      "1. Regularly check for firmware updates:\u00a0Visit the manufacturer's app or website to manually check for firmware updates, even if you haven\u2019t received a notification. Automatic updates aren\u2019t always reliable, especially for headphones and earbuds.",
      "2. Turn off Bluetooth when not in use:\u00a0Disabling Bluetooth when you're not actively using it reduces your exposure window and makes it harder for attackers to target your device.",
      "3. Use devices in low-risk areas:\u00a0Since these attacks require close proximity, avoid using Bluetooth audio devices in crowded or unfamiliar public places where someone nearby could exploit vulnerabilities.",
      "4. Pair devices with trusted sources only:\u00a0Avoid pairing your Bluetooth headphones with unfamiliar phones, computers or public terminals. Once paired, those devices can sometimes maintain a connection or reestablish one without your knowledge, increasing the risk of abuse if they're compromised.",
      "5. Remove unused paired devices: Go into your Bluetooth settings and delete old or unfamiliar pairings. This helps prevent unauthorized reconnections from previously trusted devices that may now be compromised.",

      "\"Unfortunately, a lot of credentials are harvested and sold on the dark web between different threat actor groups despite strong passwords or MFA barriers. Maybe someone lost their password or an administrator had theirs saved on a laptop that was part of another breach. Once those passwords are collected, they get traded or sold,\" Daniel explained.",
      "While brute-force attacks still happen, most criminals don't waste time hammering away at complex passwords. Instead, they exploit simpler routes: snatching passwords from old breaches, targeting users directly or hijacking password vaults, especially those managed by social media admins.",

      "Tobok points out, \"There really isn't public-facing software that notifies you. Sometimes, you might get an email saying, 'We noticed unusual activity. Was this you?' That typically comes through MFA channels. But most executives don't manage their own social media accounts. It's usually someone on their team or a designated admin.

      "An airliner taking off \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why traditional runway safety systems fall short",
      "The most dangerous parts of any flight are takeoff and landing. To reduce risk, airports use Runway End Safety Areas (RESAs). These zones are meant to stop planes that overshoot the runway. In the past, airports used sand, soil, grass, or water pools for this purpose. But each of these materials has serious drawbacks.",
      "Soil becomes unstable in wet or freezing conditions. Water can freeze in winter and attract wildlife, creating new hazards. Sand and grass don't always perform well, especially with heavier aircraft. These weaknesses have made it clear that airports need a more reliable and consistent safety solution.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How marshmallow concrete works: The science behind the softness",
      "Marshmallow concrete is engineered with a precise strength between 0.30 and 0.35 megapascals. If it's too strong, it won't crush and absorb energy. If it's too weak, it won't slow the plane. The research team compared the process to blowing bubbles into a concrete mix. These bubbles create the soft, crushable texture that helps stop a plane during an emergency.",
      "To make the bubbles strong enough to last until impact, the team used a special air-entraining agent. This forms a tough coating around each bubble. As a result, the material stays intact until an aircraft overruns the runway, then it collapses at the right moment to maximize safety.",
      "An airliner coming in for a landing (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Durability and cost benefits of marshmallow concrete for airports",
      "Unlike some international systems that rely on expensive calcium sulfoaluminate cement, marshmallow concrete uses ordinary cement, making it far more affordable for airports, especially those with limited budgets. The team also developed a two-stage strength-control system that helps the material adapt to harsh climates and maintain consistent performance throughout the year.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Real-world data from 14 airports in China, including one in the challenging climate of Tibet, show that the material's properties fluctuated by just three percent over a year. This result is well below the design tolerance of ten percent, which means airports can depend on the material to perform reliably, regardless of the weather.",

      "Marshmallow concrete airport safety: The future standard?",
      "With its unique combination of low cost, environmental resilience, and life-saving performance, marshmallow concrete is poised to become the new global standard for runway safety. The material has already been installed at 14 Chinese airports, where it has demonstrated consistent and reliable performance even in extreme conditions. As more airports seek affordable ways to enhance safety, marshmallow concrete offers a promising solution that can save lives and reduce costs worldwide.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you fly in the U.S., whether for business, vacation, or visiting family, marshmallow concrete could soon make your journeys safer. While this breakthrough is currently being used at airports in China, its performance is turning heads worldwide, including among U.S. aviation experts looking for better runway safety solutions.",
      "Runway overruns don\u2019t happen often in the United States, but when they do, the consequences can be deadly. Think of high-traffic airports like LAX, JFK, or Atlanta, where a single overrun can disrupt thousands of flights and put lives at risk. Marshmallow concrete offers a low-cost, highly effective safety upgrade that could prevent these incidents or dramatically reduce their severity.",
      "The best part? This isn't some billion-dollar overhaul. Because it uses standard cement and is designed to work in all kinds of weather, including harsh winters and extreme heat, it\u2019s a practical option for airports from Maine to Arizona. That means even smaller regional airports across the U.S. could benefit.",
      "You may never see this material, but it could be quietly protecting your flight behind the scenes, ready to absorb impact and bring a plane to a safe stop if something goes wrong.

      "Airfields face a constant battle with wildlife. Birds, rabbits and even deer can wander onto runways, creating dangerous situations for aircraft and crews. Birds are the biggest threat. When sucked into engines or hitting windscreens, they can cause catastrophic damage. In fact, the threat is so serious that the U.S. Civil Air Administration once built a \"chicken gun\" to fire bird carcasses at planes to test their resilience.",

      "Enter the robot coyote. The ERDC, in partnership with wildlife biologists Stephen Hammond and Jacob Jung and the USDA National Wildlife Research Center (NWRC), has spent five years developing these unique machines. The idea is simple. Most animals instinctively avoid coyotes, so why not use that fear to keep them away from airfields?",
      "The first prototypes, Coyote Rovers, started as Boston Dynamics Spot robots. However, these proved too slow to scare off wildlife. The team switched to four-wheeled Traxxas X-Maxx motorized cars, which can reach speeds of 20 mph. Each vehicle carries a plastic coyote dummy, blending just the right amount of realism and intimidation, all for about $3,000 each.",

These early trials showed promise. The robot coyotes successfully deterred birds and other animals, helping to keep runways clear and safe.",
      "But the ERDC isn't stopping there. The goal is to make these robot coyotes even smarter.

      "A phone with a Google Drive app on the homescreen (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Security: Strong protections, but user vigilance needed",
      "Google Drive employs robust security measures, including 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for data at rest and in transit. Additionally, users can enable two-factor authentication and manage sharing permissions to protect their files. However, like all cloud services, Google Drive is not immune to security threats.",
      "Phishing attacks targeting Google accounts remain common, and attackers may exploit weak passwords or compromised credentials. Furthermore, some third-party integrations request extensive permissions, which could be misused if not carefully managed. While Google has experienced security incidents in the past, such as the 2018 Google+ data breach, these have not directly impacted Google Drive. It's important to note that most major cloud storage providers face similar risks, and Google provides tools to help users mitigate them.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "To stay safe, you should regularly audit account access, and use strong passwords. By taking these steps, you can significantly reduce your exposure to security risks.",
      "Privacy: Automated scanning and user control",
      "Google Drive scans files for malware and policy violations using automated systems. While this process helps protect users, some privacy-focused individuals may feel uneasy knowing that their files are subject to automated review. Google is transparent about these practices and states that no human reviews your content unless required by law.",

However, you can make files available offline using Google Drive's desktop app or by enabling offline mode in your browser. Planning ahead ensures you can access important documents even during internet outages or while traveling.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Upload limits: Consider your backup needs",
      "Google Drive imposes a daily upload limit of 750 GB per user. If you need to back up large amounts of data, you may find this limit restrictive, as uploads will pause once you reach the cap and resume the next day. While some competitors may not have explicit daily limits, they often enforce fair use policies or bandwidth restrictions. Be sure to compare providers based on your specific backup needs.",
      "Illustration of devices uploading data to Google Drive in the cloud (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Not a dedicated backup solution, but still useful",
      "It's important to recognize that Google Drive is primarily designed for file storage and synchronization, not as a comprehensive backup tool. It lacks some advanced backup features, such as scheduled backups, full system image recovery, and granular file versioning for all file types. However, you can enhance its capabilities by using third-party backup software that integrates with Google Drive, allowing for more automated and reliable backups.",
      "An image of remote servers (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

By understanding its strengths and potential risks, and by taking proactive security measures, you can use Google Drive safely and effectively.",
      "If you need advanced backup features or require strict privacy controls, consider supplementing Google Drive with specialized backup software or exploring\u00a0alternative cloud storage providers. Ultimately, the best solution depends on your unique requirements and how you choose to manage your data.",

French startup Seaturns has designed technology that taps into the natural motion of the sea. Their water pendulum turbines are built to last, require little maintenance, and turn rolling waves into electricity. Unlike other renewable options, ocean waves offer a steady, often predictable source of power.",

      "Water pendulum turbine. (Seaturns)",
      "How renewable wave energy works using a water pendulum system",
      "Here's how the water pendulum wave converter works. These large, yellow, floating cylinders pitch back and forth with each passing wave. Inside, the motion causes a column of water to swing like a pendulum, compressing air between two chambers and driving a turbine that generates electricity. This constant back-and-forth movement happens entirely within the hull, protecting components from corrosive saltwater and turbulent seas.",
      "Unlike older wave converters that rely on exposed mechanical parts, Seaturns' design is simple, reliable, and self-contained. Backed by organizations such as Bpifrance, Horizon Europe, and marine research institute Ifremer, the project has drawn support from across France's public and private sectors.",
      "Water pendulum turbines. (Seaturns)",
      "Renewable wave energy turbine passes open-sea testing",
      "Seaturns recently completed 18 months of successful offshore testing using a prototype built near Brest, France. Built at quarter-scale, the test demonstrated the system's durability and energy efficiency under harsh marine conditions. This confirms the power-producing concept as a promising alternative to traditional energy technologies.",
      "Historically, ocean power projects have struggled due to their complexity, cost, and vulnerability to damage. Seaturns' design addresses these weaknesses head-on. A water pendulum is driven by the horizontal motion of wave surges, allowing it to function efficiently even in shallower waters where wave height is limited. This enables performance in shallower depths, bringing the system closer to shore. Its compact size, modular construction, and simplified deployment process make it attractive for coastal cities, offshore industries, and island communities alike.",
      "And unlike wind or solar power, which can fluctuate with weather and daylight, wave converters can generate energy more consistently, though typically at lower output levels, even when skies are cloudy or winds are still.",
      "Water pendulum turbine. (Seaturns)",
      "Low-maintenance renewable wave energy designed to last",
      "Wave energy offers enormous untapped potential. According to some estimates, global oceans could theoretically produce more than 2 terawatts of renewable electricity using wave technology. That's enough to power a significant portion of national grids, potentially up to a third of the United States' energy demand, if fully harnessed, though real-world output would depend on many local and technical factors. Harnessing even part of Alaska's extensive coastline could significantly reduce fossil fuel reliance in remote communities.",
      "Recent academic studies have highlighted the promise of pendulum-based wave energy converters. Their ability to deliver direct mechanical-to-electrical conversion, combined with structural simplicity, makes them a viable path forward for clean ocean power.",

Even so, the Seaturns system could be a real breakthrough. Its tough design, simple upkeep, and environmental benefits make it a strong contender for future energy grids. As we keep searching for reliable and sustainable power, wave energy is starting to stand out.

      "Bank of America and other big institutions are seeing major customer engagement with their AI-powered chatbots.",
      "AI chatbots are quickly becoming the primary way people interact with the internet. Instead of browsing through a list of links, you can now get direct answers to your questions. However, these tools often provide information that is completely inaccurate, and in the context of security, that can be dangerous. In fact, cybersecurity researchers are warning that hackers have started exploiting flaws in these chatbots to carry out AI phishing attacks.",
      "Specifically, when people use AI tools to search for login pages, especially for banking and tech platforms, the tools return incorrect links. And once you click that link, you might get directed to fake websites. These sites can then be used to steal personal information or login credentials.",

      "Researchers at Netcraft recently ran a test on the GPT-4.1 family of models, which is also used by Microsoft's Bing AI and AI search engine Perplexity. They asked where to log in to fifty different brands across banking, retail, and tech.",
      "Out of 131 unique links the chatbot returned, only about two-thirds were correct. Around 30 percent of the links pointed to unregistered or inactive domains. Another five percent led to unrelated websites. In total, more than one-third of the responses linked to pages not owned by the actual companies. This means someone looking for a login link could easily end up on a fake or unsafe site.",
      "If attackers register those unclaimed domains, they can create convincing phishing pages and wait. Since the AI-supplied answer often sounds official, users are more likely to trust it without double-checking.",
      "Wikipedia page showing ChatGPT description on a smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AI phishing attacks are already happening: Real-world example",
      "In one recent case, a user asked Perplexity AI for the Wells Fargo login page. The top result wasn't the official Wells Fargo site; it was a phishing page hosted on Google Sites. The fake site closely mimicked the real design and prompted users to enter personal information. Although the correct site was listed further down, many people would not notice or think to verify the link.",
      "The problem in this case wasn't specific to Perplexity's underlying model. It stemmed from Google Sites abuse and a lack of vetting in the search results surfaced by the tool. Still, the result was the same: a trusted AI platform inadvertently directed someone to a fake financial website.",
      "Smaller banks and regional credit unions face even higher risks. These institutions are less likely to appear in AI training data or be accurately indexed on the web. As a result, AI tools are more prone to guessing or fabricating links when asked about them, raising the risk of exposing users to unsafe destinations.",

      "AI-generated phishing links often use lookalike domains. Check for subtle misspellings, extra words, or unusual endings like \".site\" or \".info\" instead of \".com\". If it feels even slightly off, do not proceed.",
      "Even if your login credentials get stolen, 2FA adds an extra layer of security. Choose app-based authenticators like Google Authenticator or Authy instead of SMS-based codes when available.",
      "If you need to access your bank or tech account, avoid searching for it or asking a chatbot. Use your browser\u2019s bookmarks or enter the official URL directly. AI and search engines can sometimes surface phishing pages by mistake.",
      "If a chatbot or AI tool gives you a dangerous or fake link, report it. Many platforms allow user feedback. This helps AI systems learn and reduces future risks for others.",
      "Modern browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Edge now include phishing and malware protection. Enable these features and keep everything updated..",
      "If you want extra protection, the best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

This powerful feature lets you unsubscribe from dozens of mailing lists in just a few clicks, no more opening each email one by one or risking your privacy with sketchy unsubscribe links. Let's dive into how this tool works, how you can use it, and why it's a game-changer for anyone who wants a cleaner, more manageable Gmail inbox.",

      "How Gmail\u2019s \u2018Manage Subscriptions\u2019 tool works",
      "Recently, Google expanded its Android unsubscribe feature to Gmail's desktop version, introducing a new \"Manage Subscriptions\" button. This feature compiles every email list you're subscribed to, showing the sender's name, email address, and how many messages you've received recently, all in one convenient place. With just a click, you can unsubscribe from any or all of these lists without leaving the page. The tool offers several key benefits. You can quickly unsubscribe from dozens of mailing lists in just a few seconds.",
      "All of your active subscriptions are displayed on a single page, so there's no need to hunt through your inbox or open individual emails. It's also safer, as it avoids the risks of clicking on unknown or potentially malicious unsubscribe links found in some messages.",
      "Gmail's Manage Subscriptions tool also provides a secure and convenient way to reduce inbox clutter without depending on third-party services. Unlike those apps, Gmail's feature doesn't ask for access to your inbox, helping protect your personal data. It's built directly into Gmail, works with your current setup, and doesn't require any extra downloads or paid plans. In some cases, you may still need to visit a sender's website to complete the unsubscribe process, and Gmail will give you options like \"Go to website\" or \"Block\" on mobile.",
      "The new \"Manage subscriptions\" tool is being gradually released across the web, iOS and Android, so if it's not visible yet, it should appear soon.",
      "How to use Gmail's bulk unsubscribe feature on web, Android, and iOS",

      "Keeping your inbox under control doesn't have to be a chore. With the right habits and tools, you can cut down on clutter, avoid scams, and stay focused on the messages that matter. Here are some simple but effective strategies:",
      "Make a habit of visiting Gmail's Manage Subscriptions page every few weeks. This tool shows you all the mailing lists you're currently subscribed to and how frequently each sender contacts you. Unsubscribing from irrelevant or annoying lists only takes a click and helps prevent your inbox from being overrun with marketing emails.",
      "Set up Gmail filters to automatically archive, label, or delete certain types of messages. For example, you can filter out promotional offers that arrive too often. This keeps your inbox focused without manually sorting through messages every day.",
      "Think twice before clicking on \"unsubscribe\" links in unfamiliar or suspicious emails. Some of these links are used in phishing attacks to confirm your email address or trick you into handing over personal information. If you're unsure, it's safer to use Gmail's built-in tools instead.",
      "For Android devices, Google Play Protect offers built-in malware protection and can automatically remove known threats. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android devices. That's why it's important to add a trusted antivirus app.",
      "The same goes for iPhones, Macs, and PCs. While Apple and Microsoft have built-in defenses, adding reputable antivirus software gives you extra layers of protection against phishing, ransomware, and other digital threats.",
      "To stay safer across all your devices, make sure you're protected.",
      "See my picks for the best antivirus protection of 2025 for Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech.",
      "Consider creating an alias email address for online shopping, newsletters, and one-time sign-ups. This keeps promotional messages out of your main inbox and makes it easier to manage subscriptions. By creating email aliases, you can protect your information and reduce spam. These aliases forward messages to your primary address, making it easier to manage incoming communications and avoid data breaches.",
      "For recommendations on private and secure email providers that offer alias addresses, visit\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Mail.",
      "When you receive an unwanted email, don't just delete it, mark it as spam. Gmail uses this feedback to improve its filtering system and automatically catch similar messages in the future. This helps protect not only your inbox, but other users' too.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Gmail's new Manage Subscriptions tool is a long-awaited upgrade for anyone tired of inbox overload. With the ability to see all your subscriptions in one place and unsubscribe in bulk, you can reclaim your inbox, and your attention, in just a few minutes. If you haven't spotted the feature yet, keep an eye out as Google continues to roll it out to more users. In the meantime, enjoy a cleaner, more focused email experience, one click at a time.",

      "The humanitarian situation in Gaza has been a central focus of international debate since Hamas\u2019 war with Israel began in 2023. Longstanding aid organizations and new ones have rushed to provide Palestinians with critical support. But one group in particular has received backlash for trying to deliver food to the Strip, the U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).",
      "\"The big difference between GHF and other aid organizations such as the U.N., for example, is that effectively GHF undercutting Hamas or keeping Hamas out of the loop here when it comes to aid,\" Joe Truzman, a senior research analyst and editor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\u2019 Long War Journal, told Fox News Digital.",

      "Despite the criticism and accusations of violence against Palestinians seeking aid at its distribution sites, GHF has delivered over 76 million meals since its operation began in late May. Truzman said that Hamas has taken notice \u2014 and is reacting \u2014 to the GHF\u2019s success, as the terror organization has been unable to control the aid coming from them.",
      "Truzman believes Hamas\u2019 reaction to the GHF is telling and could signal that the group is losing access to a key tool in its arsenal for maintaining control in Gaza. He told Fox News Digital that Hamas uses \"a social welfare program\" to keep its grip on the population.",
      "\"So, for instance, charities that are controlled by Hamas, mosques that are controlled by Hamas, schools that are controlled Hamas and aid that is controlled by Hamas. Now they use it to either feed the community \u2014 Palestinians \u2014 and by doing that they gain this leverage over Palestinians,\" Truzman said. \"Palestinian civilians need this aid to obviously survive and they count on Hamas to do it.

In June, when the U.S. announced $30 million in funding for the GHF, \u00a0State Department Principal Deputy Spokesperson Tommy Pigott touted the organization\u2019s work distributing aid \"while preventing Hamas looting.\"",
      "\"If GHF wasn't around right now, I think we'd be back to the same old distribution where Hamas would control it, all right, or other Palestinian terrorist groups. I think that's a problem that nobody's really been able to figure out just yet,\" Truzman told Fox News Digital.",

    "summary": "For years, both parties had to sign off on funding the government. Under Trump and Republicans, that's changing.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 For many years, final decisions over how much the U.S. government spends, and how, have required sign-off from leaders of both parties, no matter who controlled the White House or Capitol Hill or the level of polarization.",
      "Now, that last vestige of the bipartisan funding process is at risk of dying after a one-two punch by President Donald Trump and the Republican-led Congress.",
      "The \u201cappropriations\u201d process, whereby both parties pass detailed funding bills for various federal agencies every year, has been in a slow decline for decades. But recent moves by the Trump-era GOP to disrupt past funding agreements have accelerated that decline \u2014 and, in the view of Democrats and even some weary Republicans, undermined Congress\u2019 power of the purse in deference to the White House.",
      "First, Republicans passed a $300 billion hike in military spending and immigration enforcement as part of Trump\u2019s megabill; and second, they cut $9 billion in domestic money and foreign aid under a rarely used \u201crescission\u201d process, allowing the GOP to cancel already approved bipartisan spending with a party-line vote.",
      "A Sept. 30 deadline to fund the government or risk a shutdown will test whether a bipartisan deal is still possible, particularly as Trump\u2019s top budget aide publicly calls for a more partisan approach.",
      "House Republicans have undermined the bipartisan path for years by slamming the resulting deals as \u201cswamp\u201d creations by a \u201cuniparty\u201d that is addicted to spending. Now, GOP lawmakers in both chambers are going it alone, suggesting they\u2019ll bring more rescissions packages to undo past bipartisan spending agreements because the existing process is failing.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have an appropriations process. It\u2019s broken. It\u2019s been broken for a while,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee.",
      "He said Congress will likely fall back on continuing resolutions, which largely maintain the status quo, and rescission packages for the remainder of Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., a senior appropriator, said the once-respected government funding process has \u201cdisappeared,\u201d calling the latest rescissions package \u201ca step backwards.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s basically saying: No matter what you decide on, the president is going to be able to change the bill, even for money that\u2019s been appropriated,\u201d Durbin said.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Appropriations Chair Susan Collins, R-Maine, insist the process is alive and well. They will test that theory this week as Thune plans to bring at least one \u2014 if not more \u2014 appropriations bills to the Senate floor. He has argued that the $9 billion cut hits a tiny portion of the federal budget and shouldn\u2019t dissuade Democrats from working toward a deal.",
      "\u201cI would hope, at least for the functioning of our government, that they would be willing to work with us on some things,\u201d Thune said Wednesday on Fox News. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been so far.\u201d",
      "But even some GOP proponents of the bill admit it adds to the challenges.",
      "\u201cThe rescission package \u2014 of course, I understand that could complicate things,\u201d said Rep. Robert Aderholt of Alabama, a senior Republican on the House Appropriations Committee.",
      "Vought weighs in",
      "Just after the Senate overcame objections in both parties to approve the $9 billion spending-cut bill requested by Trump, a comment from White House budget director Russell Vought dropped like a bomb on Capitol Hill.",
      "\u201cThe appropriations process has to be less bipartisan,\u201d Vought told reporters at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to keep me up at night, and I think will lead to better results, by having the appropriations process be a little bit partisan.\u201d",
      "He added that more rescission packages would be coming.",
      "The backlash was fierce. Senate Republicans responsible for crafting the government funding bills were taken aback by his candor.",
      "\u201cMr. Vought\u2019s lack of respect and apparent lack of understanding of how Congress operates is baffling, because he\u2019s served in government before,\u201d Collins told NBC News.",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said Vought \u201cdisrespects\u201d the appropriations process in Congress with his \u201cdismissive\u201d comments.",
      "\u201cI think he thinks that we are irrelevant,\u201d she said.",
      "And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., on Thursday called on Trump to \u201cfire Russell Vought immediately, before he destroys our democracy and runs the country into the ground.\u201d",
      "The series of clashes escalates tensions leading up to the fall deadline, with top Democrats warning ahead of the vote that they would have little incentive to provide the 60 votes to cut a deal.",
      "\u201cIt is absurd to expect Democrats to play along with funding the government if Republicans are just going to renege on a bipartisan agreement by concocting rescissions packages behind closed doors that can pass with only their votes,\u201d Schumer warned in a recent speech.",
      "The debate over the demise of individual lawmakers getting to dictate where federal funding is allocated came to a head during a recent meeting of the Senate Appropriations Committee, with many senators arguing that the work they were doing in that moment may just be overridden by congressional leadership and the president.",
      "\u201cThe one thing we all agree on is the appropriations process is broken,\u201d former Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., lamented, describing how during his 18 years leading the GOP conference he helped oversee a shift away from government funding levels being decided by committees and instead being negotiated by only the highest levels of leadership and the White House.",
      "\u201cI concluded our failure to pass our bills empower every president, regardless of party, because I\u2019ve been in those discussions at the end, the big four and the guy with the pen, and that makes all of our requests irrelevant,\u201d McConnell said.",
      "Collins has repeatedly blamed the decline of the process on Schumer\u2019s refusal to put appropriations bills on the Senate floor. That has also been a slow-moving trend: McConnell and former Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., also short-circuited the process on the floor when in charge.",
      "Rising partisanship has weakened committees broadly and placed more power in the hands of leadership. In the context of government funding, that led to \u201comnibus\u201d spending bills and continuing resolutions \u2014 or CRs \u2014 negotiated by party leaders and jammed through Congress, often with an impending deadline to pressure holdouts to fall in line quickly.",
      "But House Republicans raised hell, torching the massive bills negotiated behind closed doors as a betrayal to their constituents. In recent years, they have successfully steered their leadership away from that approach. And it leaves few options going forward.",
      "'What the math tells us'",
      "Durbin, who is retiring after a 30-year Senate career, reminisced about when the process was at the peak of its powers \u2014 last century. The last time Congress completed it through \u201cregular order\u201d was in the 1990s.",
      "\u201cThere was a time when we called 12 appropriation bills to the floor, open for amendment! Can you imagine that?\u201d Durbin said. \u201cI remember. And you had to do your job in the committee. You had to have a subcommittee lined up on a bipartisan basis, a full committee lined up on a bipartisan basis. And the committee stood together. And you could find enough to support it to pass something. That, I think, really reflected the best of the Senate.\u201d",
      "He attributed the change to the growing discord between the parties and the declining \u201creputation of the Appropriations Committee,\u201d although he credited Collins and Vice Chair Patty Murray, D-Wash., with trying to restore the bipartisan spirit of the panel.",
      "Collins, notably, is on an island as the only GOP senator who voted against both attempts to rewrite government funding \u2014 in the megabill and rescissions package. Collins is also up for re-election next year in a Democratic-leaning state that Trump lost in 2024.",
      "Sarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University and the Brookings Institution, said the megabill\u2019s changes to GOP spending priorities \u201cundermines the rough parity between defense and nondefense discretionary spending that until recently made bipartisan deals possible.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cThe Trump OMB\u2019s aggressive impoundments of enacted appropriations severely threatens Congress\u2019 power of the purse and with it the authority and expertise of and oversight by appropriators.\u201d",
      "Yet even as Republicans find new ways to go around the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold, Thune has promised he won\u2019t abolish the filibuster. He distanced himself from Vought\u2019s remarks.",
      "\u201cWell, that runs contrary to what the math tells us around here,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, we need 60 on approps bills. And it\u2019s going to take 60 to fund the government.\u201d",
      "The path to a new funding law is murky, at best.",
      "And Collins, for now, maintains confidence in the bipartisan appropriations process. When asked if she has any concerns about its future, Collins told NBC News, \u201cNone whatsoever.\u201d"

      "But with the MAGA movement split over the administration\u2019s handling of files involving deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the accounts\u2019 messaging has broken, offering contradictory statements on the issue and revealing the AI-fueled nature of the accounts.",
      "The network, tracked for NBC News by both the social media analytics company Alethea and researchers at Clemson University, consists of more than 400 identified bot accounts, though the number could be far larger, the researchers say. Its accounts offer consistent praise for key Trump figures, particularly support for Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.",
      "As often is the case with bot accounts, those viewed by NBC News tended to have only a few dozen followers, and their posts rarely get many views. But a large audience does not appear to be the point. Their effectiveness, if they have any, is in the hope that they contribute to a partisan echo chamber, and that en masse they can \u201cmassage perceptions,\u201d said Darren Linvill, the director of Clemson University\u2019s Media Forensics Hub, which studies online disinformation campaigns.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not really there to get engagement. They\u2019re there to just be occasionally seen in those replies,\u201d Linvill told NBC News.",
      "The researchers declined to share specifics on how they identified the accounts, but noted they shared a number of distinct trends. All were created, seemingly in batches, around three specific days last year. They frequently punctuate their posts with hashtags, often ones that are irrelevant to the conversation. They post almost exclusively by replying to other users, often to people who pay X for verification and by repeating similarly worded sentiments over and over in short succession. At times, they will respond to someone\u2019s post by repeating it back to them verbatim.",
      "It\u2019s unclear who is behind the network, or which of the multiple AI chatbots that are widely accessible to the public was used to power it.",
      "The bots have posted support for conservative figures since 2024, including supporting Trump and other Republicans on the ballot in the lead-up to the election, and then afterward posting that they were excited for Trump to take office. Though they would occasionally mix their messages \u2014 some have professed affection for MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, for instance \u2014 their messaging was consistently in favor of MAGA figures until the recent Epstein files controversy.",
      "A core constituency of Trump supporters voted for him on the belief that Trump, a former friend of Epstein\u2019s, would expose a list of supposed rich and powerful clients and bring justice to Epstein\u2019s victims.",
      "It\u2019s only since earlier this month, when Attorney General Pam Bondi announced she would not release additional Epstein files, that the accounts\u2019 messaging has become so split, with some accounts telling different users opposite opinions almost concurrently.",
      "During the same minute last Saturday morning, for example, one account in the network both cautioned a MAGA supporter from judging Bondi too harshly and told another that Bondi or FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino should resign over the scandal."

      "The second aircraft was moving faster than the SkyWest plane, the pilot says, so he made the decision to turn behind it.",

      "In the video, the pilot also mentions that the tower that serves Minot International Airport does not have a radar and that controllers rely only on visuals to make calls.",
      "The Air Force Base nearby does have radar, the pilot says, which causes him to wonder why nobody said, \"Hey, there's also a B-52 in the pattern.\"",

      "Contract towers are also not unheard of, he said \u2014 there are 265 of them in the United States.",
      "The key question, Guzzetti said, is how much coordination there was between the Air Force base and the airport.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t think that you would need a more powerful radar system or a larger tower to prevent things like this,\u201d Guzzetti said. \"I just think that you need good coordination between the military base and the local civilian airport to work together to avoid these types of near misses.\""

    "story": [
      "The country's largest wildfire this year has burned over 95,740 acres, fire officials in central Oregon said Sunday, as ground crews made progress to partially contain a blaze that could still intensify to become a so-called megafire.",
      "The size of the Cram Fire was adjusted slightly downward from Saturday after \"more accurate mapping\" was completed, officials said. They added that the massive blaze \u2014 which has drawn more than 900 fire personnel, destroyed a handful of homes and prompted evacuations in two counties \u2014 was 49% contained after crews struggled to keep back the flames last week.",
      "\"Yesterday was another favorable day with us with the weather, and so a lot of good work was done,\" Scott Stutzman, operations section chief of the Oregon State Fire Marshal, said Sunday in a Facebook video. \"We'll have those crews out there continuing to maintain a presence mopping up, and also assisting our wildland partners on the perimeter.\"",
      "Cooler temperatures and higher humidity over the weekend are expected to continue early this week, potentially aiding firefighting efforts, but the sheer size of the fire has been staggering: If it grows to at least 100,000 acres, it would be classified as a megafire, becoming the first one in the U.S. in 2025, said Stanton Florea, a spokesman with the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, which coordinates the country's wildland firefighting operations.",
      "Oregon saw six wildfires reach megafire status last year, federal data shows.",
      "The phenomenon is considered rare, but it has grown in frequency as wildfires in general become more widespread and intense.",
      "Megafires \"are more common now,\" Florea said. \"We're having longer fire seasons \u2014 what we're calling, the 'fire year.' And more intense fires that are lasting longer.\"",
      "So far this year, there have been 40,934 wildfires, the highest year-to-date total in at least a decade, according to National Interagency Fire Center data.",
      "But of the 1.6 million wildfires that have occurred since 2000, just 254 exceeded 100,000 acres burned, and only 16 were at least 500,000 acres, a Congressional Research Service report said in 2023.",
      "\"A small fraction of wildfires become catastrophic, and a small percentage of fires accounts for the vast majority of acres burned,\" the service said. \"For example, about 1% of wildfires become conflagrations \u2014 raging, destructive fires \u2014 but predicting which fires will 'blow up' into conflagrations is challenging and depends on a multitude of factors, such as weather and geography.\"",
      "The higher chance of extreme weather conditions, such as prolonged drought and strong winds, is being fueled by human-caused global warming, recent reports indicate. That means wildfires may not only ignite suddenly, but also strengthen in magnitude at a furious pace.",
      "The Cram Fire, which led to evacuations in parts of Jefferson and Wasco counties, began a week ago, exploding amid extremely hot, dry and windy conditions in the West. The cause remains under investigation.",
      "Florea said the Pacific Northwest is the highest-priority area in the country at the moment, with the country's wildland firefighting resources being directed there, including to help battle at least nine large fires burning in Oregon.",
      "Such heavy demand means officials must prioritize how resources are used. An increase in the number of wildfires strains the system and the fatigued crews who work around-the-clock shifts, Florea added.",
      "While 88 engines and eight helicopters continue to be deployed to prevent the Cram Fire from spreading, the Oregon State Fire Marshal said Sunday it would begin modifying its response as containment improves.",
      "At least four homes and two other structures have been destroyed so far. The fire is no longer threatening residences to the same degree, officials said.",
      "Kyle Butler, whose home in rural Jefferson County was nearly burned in the blaze, said one neighbor fled the flames with her life, but returned to find her home severely damaged.",
      "\"Everything's gone,\" Butler told NBC affiliate KGW in Portland. \"Her house is pretty much in shambles.\""

    "summary": "The viral TikTok account Sylvanian Drama, known for its darkly comedic skits using Calico Critters toys, has gone silent amid a lawsuit from toy company Epoch.",
    "story": [
      "The social media account Sylvanian Drama, which has frequently gone viral for its darkly comedic skits featuring small, anthropomorphic animal toys, mysteriously went quiet this year after it landed in legal hot water with the toys\u2019 maker.",
      "Epoch, the Japanese company behind the toys, sued the account\u2019s creator earlier this year, claiming that she has been \u201cdoubling her efforts to exploit Epoch\u2019s copyrights and trademarks for her own commercial gain\u201d despite the company\u2019s attempts to work the issue out amicably.",
      "Sylvanian Families, also known as Calico Critters in the United States and Canada, are felt dolls in the shape of cute, anthropomorphized animals. They were first released in Japan in 1985. The creatures range from bunnies and kittens to squirrels and more, all with wide, black eyes and tiny clothing.",
      "Online, Irish content creator Thea Von Engelbrechten has taken the adorable creatures and given them backstories with mature themes, putting them in real-world scenarios that aren\u2019t as innocent or family-friendly as the dolls themselves appear to be.",
      "Her Sylvanian Drama page has 2.5 million followers on TikTok and 1 million on Instagram. The videos, all of which feature Calico Critters, often rack up millions of views each. In these soap opera-style clips, the critters might be getting drunk, doing drugs, committing violence or doing other unsavory things.",
      "Epoch\u2019s lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on April 7, initially flew under the radar but drew attention online last week when some outlets reported on the situation after noticing months of silence from the account. The Irish Independent was the first to report the lawsuit.",
      "The company accused Von Engelbrechten of copyright infringement, trademark infringement and unfair competition. It stated that she has been prominently featuring Calico Critters products in videos without permission, including for commercial purposes by advertising for other brands\u2019 goods and services. The lawsuit added that she also uses a copyrighted image as Sylvanian Drama\u2019s social media profile picture.",
      "Von Engelbrechten declined to comment. Attorneys for Epoch did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The lawsuit underscores the potential tensions that can arise when creators use branded materials as drivers of their content. Early gaming creators faced similar legal pushback when using copyrighted games and characters in their videos, for example. The case against Sylvanian Drama is the latest to highlight how the creator economy straddles the line between user-generated content and copyright protections.",
      "Von Engelbrechten\u2019s account has become so popular in recent years that some on the internet have begun to associate the toys with the Sylvanian Drama account more than the official Sylvanian Families or Calico Critters brands. In its lawsuit, Epoch wrote that Von Engelbrechten has caused \u201cirreparable injury to Epoch\u2019s goodwill and reputation,\u201d noting that the brand was originally intended to engage children.",
      "Von Engelbrechten began posting Sylvanian Drama videos in 2021, when she was a 19-year-old multimedia student at Dublin City University. She told The Tab in a 2023 interview that her videos were meant to parody shows like \u201cGossip Girl\u201d and \u201cPretty Little Liars.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always surprised that I\u2019m not already canceled for the stuff that I do,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean any harm and also \u2026 a lot of the issues that I joke about are problems in my own life. There\u2019s a lot of stuff about weight and dieting and people struggling with that, and that\u2019s all just me joking about myself. So I\u2019m not making fun of anyone.\u201d",
      "The account hasn\u2019t posted on any of its platforms since January. Its latest video was a paid partnership promoting \u201cSquid Game\u201d shortly after the release of the hit Netflix show\u2019s second season. (The lawsuit noted that Sylvanian Drama has similarly advertised for the likes of Kate Spade, Sephora, Burberry, Hilton and Taco Bell.)",
      "Epoch claimed in its complaint that TikTok had previously removed allegedly infringing videos from its platform after the company served a Digital Millennium Copyright Act notice in October 2023. But because it was not able to work out a permanent resolution with Von Engelbrechten, Epoch wrote, it \u201chad no choice but to file this lawsuit\u201d this year.",
      "The company, which demanded a jury trial, sought an order declaring that Von Engelbrechten infringed its copyrights, as well as an order prohibiting her from infringing any copyrights in the future. It also asked for damages of up to $150,000 for each copyrighted work infringed, plus all profits made by Von Engelbrechten as a result of the alleged infringement.",
      "According to a court document this month, however, Epoch and Von Engelbrechten are now \u201cactively engaged in settlement discussions\u201d and planning to submit a joint letter with a proposed plan to move forward.",
      "Von Engelbrechten has until Aug. 8 to respond to the lawsuit, with the initial pretrial conference slated for Aug. 14."

      "Police are searching for a person who stole a fire truck in Washington state on Friday night and left behind a trail of damage and wrecked vehicles.",
      "The Everett Fire Department truck was stolen from the 2900 block of Hoyt Avenue, about 30 miles north of Seattle, while firefighters were responding to a medical emergency on the fifth floor of an apartment building, the fire department said in an update posted to Facebook on Saturday morning.",
      "\"The suspect drove the stolen fire engine at high speeds through north Everett residential streets, causing significant damage to multiple parked vehicles and landscaping across five locations before fleeing on foot,\" the fire department said.",
      "The firefighters discovered the missing truck just after 11 p.m., when the first 911 call reporting a nearby hit-and-run was received, per the fire department. Witnesses told authorities that a fire truck \"struck two parked cars at a high rate of speed and left the scene.\"",
      "\"About a minute later, similar reports came in from the 1000 block of E Marine View Drive, where the fire engine came to a stop after plowing into ten parked vehicles,\" the fire department said.",
      "The Everett Police Department began responding to the incident scenes, which included at least six locations where damage was reported to parked cars, trees, directional signs and grass, per the fire department. No injuries were reported at any of the locations.",
      "Pictures posted by the fire department show the aftermath of the incident, including totaled cars, a knocked-down street sign and miscellaneous debris lining the streets.",
      "The stolen firetruck, a 2018 Pierce Enforcer Pumper weighing around 35,000 pounds, received \"significant damage\" and has been impounded for evidence, the fire department said. It was one of the department's newer engines, and its weight makes it \"a substantial vehicle when in motion.\"",
      "The driver is still at large and the investigation into the incident is ongoing.",
      "\"Losing a fire engine to such a reckless person not only jeopardizes the safety of our first responders but also puts our community at risk,\" Everett Police Chief John DeRousse said in a statement. \"We are committed to ensuring the safety of our residents, and any information that helps us resolve this incident is crucial. It is imperative that we hold the suspect accountable for their actions, and we will work diligently to bring them to justice.\"",
      "The police department is asking anyone with information or footage of the incident to get in touch.",
      "Everett Fire Chief Dave DeMarco said the fire department is looking into what can be done to prevent such incidents in the future.",
      "\"We are thankful that no one was injured in this event, and we remain focused on safeguarding our community and our emergency response capabilities,\" DeMarco said."

Unlike plastic, glass food containers aren\u2019t susceptible to leaching microplastics, making them safer to heat up, eat out of and prepare food in. Most of the food containers on this list are made of borosilicate glass, which is highly resistant to heat, thermal shock and cracking (though not shatterproof). Additionally, I also curated options that have ceramic coatings, which makes them stain resistant and nonstick, as well as containers made from stainless steel. While every container on this list is made from either glass or stainless steel, some of the included lids are made of BPA-free plastic and/or come with a silicone lining to prevent leaking, so some of the sets aren\u2019t entirely plastic free.",

The easiest way to avoid leaching consequences is to simply avoid plastic food containers altogether. Here\u2019s how to find the best plastic-free container:",
      "Glass is arguably the best material to look for as an eco-friendly alternative to plastic food containers, according to experts. To a lesser extent, stainless steel containers can also be a reliable option. Glass allows for versatility since it\u2019s usually oven-, microwave- and dishwasher-safe, and isn\u2019t susceptible to leaching like plastic. Stainless steel doesn\u2019t always have these features, though it isn\u2019t susceptible to breaking or cracking and it often allows food to stay warm for longer. Also, many glass food storage containers have plastic lids, even if they\u2019re free of BPA, PFAS and other chemicals.",
      "If you plan on only using storage containers to prepare food \u2014 whether it be on the stove or in the oven \u2014 and then transfer food to them, then they don\u2019t need to be oven- or microwave-safe. If you don\u2019t want to have to dirty more dishes or transfer the food to a plate for reheating, then you should make sure that whatever you buy is microwave or oven safe. If you\u2019re someone who likes to meal prep and then freeze food, be sure to purchase something that\u2019s freezer compatible.",
      "In addition to buying new containers, Woodruff also recommends reusing store-bought glass containers, like those for condiments or sauces, to store food (not necessarily heat it), similar to how you would a mason jar. Doing this can help you save money and it reduces your single-use plastic consumption.",
      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Leaching is what happens when molecular particles and chemicals in microplastics, like BPA and PFAS, slough off from plastic (in this case, food containers) and get into food, according to Woodruff. While this happens at any temperature, leaching is much more probable when you heat the plastic material, according to Woodruff. This is because heat agitates the molecules in the plastic, making them more susceptible to breaking apart. Additionally, some chemicals, such as BPA, leach more when you prepare acidic foods, such as tomato-based sauces, in them.",
      "Many people and organizations call PFAS \u201cforever chemicals\u201d because of how long they take to degrade and break down in the environment, according to The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Since these chemicals last so long they eventually make their way into food, water and animals, according to the EPA. From there, they can lead to health complications in humans, like infertility and cancer, according to Woodruff.",

      "What attracts flies in the home?",
      "There are a few common causes for flies around the home, according to our experts. While there are a few different types of flies, in addition to other flying insects that are often confused for one another, like mosquitoes and gnats, many of them are typically caused by the following factors:",
      "Fruit and sugar: Both fruit flies and house flies, which are categorized as \u201cfilth flies,\u201d are extremely attracted to the smell of fruit, according to Bloom.  \u201cIn the home, they are typically introduced as eggs on fruit and produce which then emerge once fermentation starts,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can see this relationship if you look at fruit stands.\u201d This problem arises when the fruit is left out, unwashed, overripe and/or rotting in a trash, fridge or cabinet or on a countertop. Additionally, fruit flies gravitate toward sugar substances like soda, fruit juice and candy.",
      "Fermentation: Similarly, fruit flies are often attracted to the smell of fermented foods and drinks, such as beer, wine, kombucha, yogurt, cheese and bread. While you keep these items in the fridge, things like small spills or crumbs left on the counter can attract flies. Plus, when you throw these items out, they can still attract flies due to residual matter. This is why Bloom recommends regularly rinsing out containers, cans and bottles before throwing them out to prevent flies.",
      "Decaying matter and filth: Other types of filth flies, such as the house fly, may gravitate towards fruit, but they\u2019re also attracted to dirtier materials, according to Bloom. This includes leaking drains, dirty mops, compost and pet litter.  This could also include bits of food sitting in your garbage disposal.",
      "Windows and weather: Lastly, leaving windows and doors open, even for a few seconds, gives flies the easiest entry into your home. That said, you may also notice an increase in flying insects like flies, fruit flies, mosquitoes and fungus gnats during late spring and throughout summer, according to Williams. \u201cFlies and fruit flies have more access to food sources in the warmer months, as they\u2019re attracted to rotting produce that is more abundant this time of year,\u201d he says. In other words, a more humid environment makes it easier for flies to survive and reproduce.",

      "Anytime our hair fibers are pressed against a surface, there\u2019s a chance of the fibers becoming stressed via pulling or tangling from our head movements, says Hill. In addition to breakage caused by rough fibers from your pillow or sleep accessories, Malhotra says sleeping with wet hair can also cause damage, since wet hair is weaker and more prone to breakage. Along with breakage, you\u2019ll wake up to a tangled mess that may require more heat and styling to fix, she says. To avoid this, she recommends fully drying your hair at night and sleeping on a smooth, high-quality pillowcase \u2014 preferably silk or satin, like the options I listed above.",
      "Yes; although Hill cautions that all hair textures risk unwanted friction and tension, factors like your hair\u2019s porosity, your cleansing routine, scalp hydration and more can impact what areas of concern you should focus on. Here\u2019s some general advice Malhotra has for different hair types:",
      "Straight hair concerns typically center on greasiness and oiliness, along with losing volume, she says. Fine, straight hair is also more prone to tangling, knotting and matting. To combat this, she suggests avoiding heavy overnight hair products, like oils or creams, since they can encourage oil production and greasiness. \u201cUsing a silk pillowcase to reduce friction can help with overall hair health and stopping breakage,\u201d she says. Putting your hair in loose braids can also help you to avoid morning knots and keep your hair voluminous overnight.Wavy, curly and natural hair types all run the risk of getting frizzy overnight, for which Malhotra suggests using a light leave-in conditioner. \u201c[It] can keep hair hydrated while you sleep and help keep the shape of the waves, [which reduces] frizz,\u2019 she says.",

      "Once again, the best hairstyle for sleeping will depend on your hair type and current style. However, here are a few tips Malhotra and Hill suggest keeping in mind:",
      "For wavy and long hair, Malhotra suggests using a satin scrunchie or hair accessory to pull the hair into a high ponytail, a loose high bun, or a loose braid (this will help avoid unwanted creases and tangling, and make it easier to style the next morning).Fine or short hair tends to do well when kept down at night, since it reduces pulling/tension on the scalp, while thick, textured hair would benefit from sleeping in two braids to minimize tangles, says Hill.If you\u2019re putting your hair up, avoid any styles that may pull your hair too tightly, since it\u2019ll lead to increased breakage. For tightly coiled or curly hair, Hill recommends gathering the hair to the crowd of your head with a silk scarf (also known as \u201cpineappling\u201d).",

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/oregon-cram-fire-rcna219392",
    "published": "Sun, 20 Jul 2025 19:32:33 GMT",
    "summary": "The Cram Fire in central Oregon has burned more than 95,000 acres, becoming the nation's largest wildfire this year.",
    "story": [
      "The country's largest wildfire this year has burned over 95,740 acres, fire officials in central Oregon said Sunday, as ground crews made progress to partially contain a blaze that could still intensify to become a so-called megafire.",
      "The size of the Cram Fire was adjusted slightly downward from Saturday after \"more accurate mapping\" was completed, officials said. They added that the massive blaze \u2014 which has drawn more than 900 fire personnel, destroyed a handful of homes and prompted evacuations in two counties \u2014 was 49% contained after crews struggled to keep back the flames last week.",
      "\"Yesterday was another favorable day with us with the weather, and so a lot of good work was done,\" Scott Stutzman, operations section chief of the Oregon State Fire Marshal, said Sunday in a Facebook video. \"We'll have those crews out there continuing to maintain a presence mopping up, and also assisting our wildland partners on the perimeter.\"",
      "Cooler temperatures and higher humidity over the weekend are expected to continue early this week, potentially aiding firefighting efforts, but the sheer size of the fire has been staggering: If it grows to at least 100,000 acres, it would be classified as a megafire, becoming the first one in the U.S. in 2025, said Stanton Florea, a spokesman with the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, which coordinates the country's wildland firefighting operations.",
      "Oregon saw six wildfires reach megafire status last year, federal data shows.",
      "The phenomenon is considered rare, but it has grown in frequency as wildfires in general become more widespread and intense.",
      "Megafires \"are more common now,\" Florea said. \"We're having longer fire seasons \u2014 what we're calling, the 'fire year.' And more intense fires that are lasting longer.\"",
      "So far this year, there have been 40,934 wildfires, the highest year-to-date total in at least a decade, according to National Interagency Fire Center data.",
      "But of the 1.6 million wildfires that have occurred since 2000, just 254 exceeded 100,000 acres burned, and only 16 were at least 500,000 acres, a Congressional Research Service report said in 2023.",
      "\"A small fraction of wildfires become catastrophic, and a small percentage of fires accounts for the vast majority of acres burned,\" the service said. \"For example, about 1% of wildfires become conflagrations \u2014 raging, destructive fires \u2014 but predicting which fires will 'blow up' into conflagrations is challenging and depends on a multitude of factors, such as weather and geography.\"",
      "The higher chance of extreme weather conditions, such as prolonged drought and strong winds, is being fueled by human-caused global warming, recent reports indicate. That means wildfires may not only ignite suddenly, but also strengthen in magnitude at a furious pace.",
      "The Cram Fire, which led to evacuations in parts of Jefferson and Wasco counties, began a week ago, exploding amid extremely hot, dry and windy conditions in the West. The cause remains under investigation.",
      "Florea said the Pacific Northwest is the highest-priority area in the country at the moment, with the country's wildland firefighting resources being directed there, including to help battle at least nine large fires burning in Oregon.",
      "Such heavy demand means officials must prioritize how resources are used. An increase in the number of wildfires strains the system and the fatigued crews who work around-the-clock shifts, Florea added.",
      "While 88 engines and eight helicopters continue to be deployed to prevent the Cram Fire from spreading, the Oregon State Fire Marshal said Sunday it would begin modifying its response as containment improves.",
      "At least four homes and two other structures have been destroyed so far. The fire is no longer threatening residences to the same degree, officials said.",
      "Kyle Butler, whose home in rural Jefferson County was nearly burned in the blaze, said one neighbor fled the flames with her life, but returned to find her home severely damaged.",
      "\"Everything's gone,\" Butler told NBC affiliate KGW in Portland. \"Her house is pretty much in shambles.\""

      "Photos posted by the sheriff\u2019s office show a hazard sign warning visitors of the waterfall nearby and indicating paddlers should wear life jackets.",
      "The office, along with its search-and-rescue arm and Bend Fire and Rescue, responded Saturday. Bend police provided drones to help the search.",

Soon after it was discovered, Elizabeth Small went back to the name Weber, breaking off things with both her ex-husband and Joel.",
      "For a while.",
      "Even though Joel felt terrible in the wake of the affair, he couldn\u2019t get Weber out of his head or heart.",
      "\u201cShe was \u2014 different,\u201d Joel recalled in Fred Schruers\u2019 2015 book, \u201cBilly Joel: The Definitive Biography.\u201d \u201cShe wasn\u2019t like a lot of the other girls I knew at that time who had taken home ec and cooking classes. She was a very bright woman, and she wasn\u2019t afraid to show how smart she was. I suppose that made her kind of exotic. Intelligent and not afraid to speak her mind, but could also be seductive. Almost like a European type \u2014 not a typical American girl.\u201d",
      "Joel and Weber eventually rekindled their relationship (just as Joel and Small eventually renewed their friendship). And in 1973, Weber became both Joel\u2019s wife and his manager.",
      "The hit maker told Schruers that Weber became his muse, inspiring much of his music around the time of his 1977 album \u201cThe Stranger.\u201d",
      "The couple parted ways in 1982.",
      "Christie Brinkley (1985\u20131994)",
      "Not long after his split from Weber, Joel met supermodel Christie Brinkley.",
      "\u201cWe were friends first,\u201d Joel explained in biographer Hank Bordowitz\u2019s \u201cBilly Joel: The Life and Times of an Angry Young Man.\u201d \u201cI was nuts about her, but it took her a while to reciprocate.\u201d",
      "In the same book, Brinkley said it was Joel's \u201cheart and soul\u201d that finally drew her in and made her \u201cwant to marry him.\u201d",
      "But before they swapped vows, they celebrated their relationship in song with Joel\u2019s 1983 hit, \u201cUptown Girl,\u201d written in part about Brinkley and starring her in the accompanying music video.",
      "The pair went on to wed in March 1985, and in December of that same year, they welcomed a child together, daughter Alexa Ray Joel.",
      "Though Joel and Brinkley divorced in 1994, they remain close friends. She even consulted him before writing about some of their more difficult days together in her 2025 memoir, also titled \u201cUptown Girl.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018Just say what you need to say,\u2019\u201d Brinkley shared in an interview with TODAY.",
      "Katie Lee (2004\u20132009)",
      "The \u201cYou May Be Right\u201d singer met chef, food critic and cookbook author Katie Lee in 2002, and the pair quickly struck up a friendship. Lee, at the time, had to brush up on Joel's work to really find out about her pal.",
      "\u201cI went out and bought the greatest hits album, and I was like, \u2018Oh, I know \u201cStill Rock and Roll,\u201d I know \u201cMy Life\u201d \u2014 I love these songs,\u2019\u201d she noted in \u201cBilly Joel: The Definitive Biography.\u201d",
      "She added that, eventually, she learned every word to all his songs.",
      "Lee was 23 when she and Joel said their \u201cI dos\u201d in an October 2004 ceremony outside at his Long Island mansion.",
      "But by 2009, Joel and Lee broke up.",
      "\u201cAfter nearly five years of marriage, Billy and Katie have decided to separate,\u201d a statement from Joel\u2019s rep read. \u201cThe decision is the result of much thought and consideration. Billy and Katie remain caring friends, with admiration and respect for each other.\u201d",
      "Alexis Roderick (2015\u2013present)",
      "That same year, Joel met the woman who would become his most enduring partner in life, Alexis Roderick or, as he likes to call her, \u201cA-Rod.\u201d",
      "The equestrian and former finance executive, who\u2019s 33 years Joel\u2019s junior, gave the music icon a ride home following their happenstance introduction at a restaurant. That led to a piano performance for one and maybe something more.",
      "\u201cI may have got a little fresh,\u201d Joel later confessed to The New Yorker.",
      "Months after that, they officially started dating and soon, they moved in together. But unlike some of his earlier relationships, there was no rush to the altar.",
      "Joel and Roderick waited until July 15, 2015 to wed. The following month, they welcomed their first child together, daughter Della Rose Joel. They expanded their family two years later with the arrival of another daughter, Remy Anne Joel.",
      "Joel and his fourth wife have remained by each other\u2019s side since, through health and happiness and through hard times.",
      "In May 2025, Joel revealed he\u2019d been diagnosed with a rare but reversible brain disorder, a form of dementia called normal pressure hydrocephalus. In response to his announcement, Alexis Roderick Joel took to the singer\u2019s Instagram account to share a message with his fans on behalf of her and their daughters.",
      "\u201cThank you for the outpouring of love and support,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe are so grateful for the wonderful care and swift diagnosis we received. Bill is beloved by so many, and to us, he is a father and husband who is at the center of our world.\u201d"

      "Her cover of Kim Carnes\u2019 1981 song neared the top of the U.K pop charts, but has also been met with a mix of fascination and bewilderment online. TikTokers are creating versions of their own \u201cBette Davis Eyes,\u201d wearing a version of the 1950s-inspired blue top she wears in the video and re-creating her raspy voice.",
      "\u201cSome of them, I die laughing,\u201d Siwa tells TODAY.com in a Zoom interview. \u201cThen there\u2019s some that I\u2019m like, \u2018Where do people get the audacity? Why do people feel OK to sleep at night?' There\u2019s a fine line of comedy and fine line of trashing.\u2019\u201d",
      "Siwa says she was walking recently and a man around her age came up to her singing \u201cBette Davis Eyes\u201d in a \u201cfake raspy voice.\u201d",
      "\u201cI turn around at him and said, \u2018Nice singing,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cHe ran off. I was just like \u2014 I wish I would\u2019ve pulled him aside and said, \u2018Look. If you\u2019re going to make fun of me, the least you could do is have a conversation with me.\u2019 I probably would have taken him to go buy a Gucci bag.\u201d",
      "Love it or hate it, \u201cBette Davis Eyes\u201d has become a cultural moment \u2014 which is ironic, considering Siwa didn\u2019t want to sing it in the first place. The idea came from a producer on her music team.",
      "\u201cShe played \u2018Bette Davis Eyes\u2019 and said, \u2018I bet you don\u2019t even know this song, but your voice would be incredible on it,'\u201d Siwa recalls. Siwa was born in 2003, over two decades after Kim Carnes\u2019 song spent nine consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and became an \u201880s anthem.",
      "After receiving criticism for her performances on Season 3 of \u201cThe Masked Singer,\u201d the \u201cDance Moms\u201d star was hesitant to make a cover her next career step.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely not. Never. Nope, nope, not happening. I got too shy, too insecure,\u201d she remembers saying.",
      "The conversation was tabled until she was planning her set at the Tecate Emblema music festival in Mexico City and had 20 minutes left to fill. Siwa\u2019s mom brought up \u201cBette Davis Eyes.\u201d Still unsure, Siwa says she \u201cactually started crying\u201d over the idea of singing it onstage.",
      "\u201cMy mom was like, \u2018You can. You\u2019re saying you can\u2019t, but you can,\u2019\u201d she remembers her mom saying. \u201cShe told me, \u2018Do something that makes you want to sing the song.\u2019\u201d",
      "This advice inspired the viral moment where Siwa changed the lyrics of \u201cBette Davis Eyes\u201d to \u201cChris Hughes's eyes\u201d onstage.",
      "Those following Siwa\u2019s personal life would know exactly what that means. It\u2019s a reference to her boyfriend, former \u201cLove Island\u201d contestant Chris Hughes. The two met on \u201cBig Brother UK.\u201d Siwa entered the show in a relationship with Kath Ebbs, an Australian influencer who identifies as a \"gender queer lesbian.\" The night the show ended, Siwa and Ebbs split up. Weeks later, Siwa and Hughes made things official. (In fact, he interrupted Siwa's conversation with TODAY.com with his rendition of \u201cYou Are My Sunshine.\u201d)",
      "After performing the song live for the first time, she was struck and surprised by the feedback. \u201cThe response to it was unreal,\u201d Siwa says. \u201cPeople had so much good to say about it \u2026 people actually want this.\u201d",
      "Siwa teased a recorded version on her TikTok twice then released the full cover on July 10 \u2014 and the reactions, some of them more negative, poured in.",
      "Siwa says she\u2019s come to expect commentary \u2014 it happened last summer after she released \u201cKarma,\u201d which at the time seemed like an edgy rebrand from her time as a child star.",

      "Carnes later clarified her statement to TMZ, saying she \u201cstrongly rejects(s) the kind of hate and personal attacks I\u2019ve seen online\u201d but also believes \u201cartists have the right to speak openly about how something makes them feel \u2014 especially when it\u2019s as personal as your voice.\u201d",
      "Carnes said Siwa's rendition \"felt a bit too close\" to her version, including \u201cthe phrasing, the tone, even the little inflections.\"",
      "\u201cKim kind of came out and said some stuff, but it actually fascinates me, what she said,\u201d Siwa tells TODAY.com. \u201cAs an artist, what you want to do is inspire people, and I think the most beautiful thing is to have another artist be inspired by you.\u201d",
      "Other artists who covered the song, like Taylor Swift, didn\u2019t use rasp like Carnes. Siwa defends keeping the rasp in her cover. For one, Siwa says she has \u201cvery broken vocal chords\u201d that make it possible to \u201ckind of replicate\u201d Carnes\u2019 singing style.",
      "She also \u201cdidn\u2019t want to sing the song like a natural beauty \u2014 I wanted to sing the song the way it inspired me,\u201d she says. \u201cYou want that rasp in there.\u201d",
      "During the recording session, she asked for no water. \u201cThe raspier I get, the better it is. So my voice is just screwed after, but worth it absolutely. Now I\u2019ll incorporate that super raspy tone into more,\u201d she says.",
      "Less natural was the look for the music video. Siwa says she \u201cabsolutely hates\u201d changing up her look.",
      "\u201cI put the costume on and I put the wig on and I was laughing at myself in the mural. Like, there\u2019s there\u2019s no way this is happening. This is hysterical. I look in the mirror and I\u2019m cackling at myself,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like Halloween.\u201d",
      "Beyond Siwa\u2019s cover, \u201cBette Davis Eyes\u201d is having a moment this summer \u2014 Ethel Cain also covered it and it figured prominently in Episode 7 of \u201cAnd Just Like That\u201d Season 3. Siwa says she missed the feature, as she spends most of her leisure time listening to the \u201cHamilton\u201d soundtrack or watching sports with Hughes.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve really found that I\u2019ve got a clear sense of vision again, in my personal life, but especially in my career.\u201d",
      "The moment inspired Siwa for her next chapter. She\u2019s now working on a new single inspired by \u201cBette Davis Eyes,\u201d set to release in August.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s interesting, because, for the first time, I\u2019ve actually enjoyed writing a song,\u201d Siwa says about the potential new single.",

Her bold energy and intense approach to connections made her one of the season\u2019s most talked-about contestants, generating equal parts admiration and criticism from viewers who couldn\u2019t look away. She threw herself into villa life with the kind of all-or-nothing intensity that reality TV thrives on, but that same intensity would soon become her biggest challenge.",
      "Her relationship with Jeremiah Brown started like a wildfire \u2014 passionate, consuming, and ultimately destructive. What began as one of the villa\u2019s strongest couples quickly devolved into something viewers and fellow Islanders alike recognized as toxic, marked by love-bombing, explosive fights and drama that extended far beyond their personal bubble. It was messy, it was painful and it was all happening under the unforgiving gaze of cameras and public opinion.",
      "Then came the Heart Rate Challenge, the moment that would spark conversations that extended far beyond the show. A fan-favorite challenge, the Heart Rate Challenge tasks Islanders with performing steamy dances to see who can raise heart rates the most, often triggering tension and jealousy.",
      "When Huda decided to do her \u201cbiggest one,\u201d as she puts it to TODAY.com, the performance sent shockwaves through the villa and ignited viral speculation across social media. It was bold, it was controversial, and it was quintessentially Huda \u2014 unapologetic and competitive to her core.",
      "But perhaps the most surprising chapter in her \u201cLove Island USA\u201d journey came at the very end. After a brief romance with Chris, Huda made a decision that stunned viewers: she chose to walk away on her own terms, right before the season finale. For many fans, it wasn\u2019t just an exit \u2014 it was a redemption arc, a moment where she finally listened to her own voice over the noise of expectations and pressure.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to fake something if I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s there,\u201d Huda tells TODAY.com in an exclusive interview.",
      "Now, safely removed from the villa\u2019s pressure cooker environment, she\u2019s ready to unpack it all: the love, the criticism, the personal growth, and the power that comes with choosing to move on.",
      "This interview has been edited for clarity.",
      "How does it feel to be back in the real world?",
      "It\u2019s overwhelming, but in a good way. It really is. I\u2019m honestly so happy that I went through that experience, and I\u2019m so happy to come out of that with so much love, especially while being in there and thinking I\u2019m completely hated. Mind you, like there are people that don\u2019t like me. That\u2019s fine. Everyone\u2019s entitled to their opinion. But just seeing all of the love, which is obviously what I\u2019m focusing on, it\u2019s like, wow \u2014 I\u2019m speechless. Like, it\u2019s overwhelming. I\u2019m trying to get up to date on everything.",
      "In the moment, it was a shock when America voted to pair Iris with Jeremiah when, at the time, you two were probably the strongest couple in the villa. How do you look back on that moment now and how do you look back on your connection overall with Jeremiah?",
      "I think that we were toxic. We were both very toxic. Was I perfect in that? No. Was he perfect in that? No. I can understand why they would have separated us. America\u2019s vote, it took me by surprise in the moment, because I wasn\u2019t seeing things from an outside perspective. But looking at it from a different perspective, I can understand why.",
      "He told me himself, like he was learning through us. Things that I told him to do, he was changing to do it for other women. And I think that people can relate to that. I think a lot of girls, you know, have been the girl that kind of prepared a man to be in a relationship.",
      "Have you spoken to Jeremiah at all since leaving the villa, or do you plan on reconnecting with him?",
      "Naur, no, no. Uh-uh, no no.",
      "I think a lot of women can relate to going through a bad relationship and coming out stronger on the other side, which we saw through your relationship with Jeremiah. What have you learned that you\u2019ll apply in future relationships?",
      "Communicating in more of a mature way. Not letting my emotions get the best of me. Figure out a way to compromise in ways instead of just focusing on getting my point across. Really hearing the other person out.",
      "I think I would hold a lot of things in out of fear. It's better to just say it. Even if it ends things, it\u2019s just better to talk about it. There\u2019s a lot of things \u2014 slowing down in relationships, not getting too physical too fast, really getting to know somebody. It was a good learning experience in all honesty.",
      "The Heart Rate Challenge sparked tension in the villa. Why do you think that specific challenge caused so much fighting?",
      "I went in with a competitive mindset. It's just a challenge. I don\u2019t have feelings towards these guys in that way, but I\u2019m doing it to win. It\u2019s out of my control whether or not I\u2019m raising their heart rate or not. Talk to your man about that, not me.",
      "Everyone had really high expectations for me. Every girl and every guy was like, \u201cHuda, do your big one. Huda, this is your time to shine.\u201d I\u2019m like, OK, cool. But I will do my big one. I did my biggest one. And I mean, everybody consented to everything beforehand. We made sure of that.",
      "The men were enjoying their time until they saw their girlies weren\u2019t enjoying that, and that\u2019s when it was too much.",
      "I\u2019ve had these conversations off camera with certain guys who had agreed with me that yeah, when they saw their girls\u2019 reaction they realized, OK, maybe that was too much. It\u2019s kind of like when your man goes to a bachelor party and the girl\u2019s like, \"I didn\u2019t like that.\" And they\u2019re like, \"Damn, OK, maybe I did f\u2014 up.\"",
      "There were a lot of factors that weren\u2019t even shown that played into my decision at that time. I think everyone was caught off guard, but I\u2019m sure he wasn\u2019t. We knew that that was coming.",
      "Like, he would tell me to shut up. When I\u2019m asking you to compliment me in a meaningful way multiple times, knowing that that\u2019s my love language, I get \u201cgyatt\u201d and \u201csheesh.\u201d So it\u2019s like, why am I settling? Why would I settle for something like that?",
      "He would make commentary on other women. He had a wandering eye, especially off-camera. He would walk past me and not even look at me, he wouldn\u2019t acknowledge me in conversations. And I peeped all of these things. I was catching them and I kept my mouth shut, but I was keeping them in the back of my mind because I wanted him to show me his true self without me having to guide him. That\u2019s the whole thing I played into my final decision and I stand on that.",
      "He wasn\u2019t all bad, but there are things that are really important to me that are non-negotiables. That\u2019s what made me make my decision.",

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Soccer fans know it as \u201challowed ground,\u201d so when Billie Sky Walker walked onto the field at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium two years ago, she achieved a dream held by players around the world.",
      "Before a Community Shield men\u2019s match between Manchester City and Arsenal in August 2023, she proudly donned an official shirt as a representative of the Football Association, the regulatory body for soccer in England, that read, \u201cThe FA is for all.\u201d",
      "Today, the 28-year-old is barred from playing in FA-organized tournaments following a landmark judgment by Britain\u2019s Supreme Court in April that said the legal definition of \u201cwoman\u201d is based on biological sex \u2014 a huge blow to campaigners for transgender rights that could have far-reaching implications for a wide range of life in the U.K., be it admission to changing rooms or decisions on hospital beds, equal pay claims and domestic violence shelters.",
      "After the judgment, a number of sporting governing bodies, including the FA, changed their rules so that only those born biologically female are allowed to play, excluding Walker and 28 other transgender players across England from the association. The Scottish Football Association followed suit, and Northern Ireland\u2019s Irish Football Association appears likely to do the same.",
      "Describing the ruling as \u201cconfusing and upsetting,\u201d Walker said she had been welcomed \u201cinto this space\u201d by her cisgender peers, or women whose gender matches the sex they were assigned at birth.",
      "Calling the decision to bar Walker \u201cheartbreaking,\u201d her former teammate Lucy Leiter, 24, said it was not the case that \u201conly trans women think they should play,\u201d adding, \u201cThe support has been unequivocal from everyone I\u2019ve ever played with.\u201d",
      "Walker, who said she felt that she was a girl from the age of 5 and transitioned at the age of 24, said that playing soccer on a women\u2019s team \u201creally established a huge essence of who I am, because it gave me the safety and comfort and knowledge that I\u2019m enough.\u201d",
      "Intense debate",
      "The Supreme Court ruling came amid intense and sometimes toxic public debate in the U.K. over the intersection of transgender and women\u2019s rights. The debate has also simmered in the U.S., where President Donald Trump has made it one of his signature issues by signing an executive order in February banning trans women from women\u2019s sports at the national level.",
      "In December 2022, Scottish lawmakers approved a bill that allowed anyone over the age of 16 to change their gender identity using gender certificates, removing the need for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria, the medical term for the distress that results from the conflict between someone\u2019s gender identity and sex assigned at birth.",
      "The campaign group For Women Scotland later brought a legal case against the semiautonomous government, arguing that sex-based protections should apply only to people who were born female.",
      "And Britain\u2019s central government blocked the law the following year, invoking for the first time a section of the 25-year-old act that gave the Scottish Parliament control over most of its own affairs.",
      "The For Women Scotland case nonetheless worked its way through the court system, reaching the Supreme Court this spring.",
      "After the court\u2019s 12 justices ruled unanimously in the group\u2019s favor, the presiding judge, Lord Hodge, said the decision should not be seen as \u201ca triumph of one side over the other,\u201d and emphasized that transgender people remain protected under the law.",
      "For Women Scotland campaigners celebrated the verdict with hugs, tears of happiness and Champagne as they left the courtroom.",
      "\u201cThere was elation and disbelief and, yes, I was absolutely thrilled,\u201d Susan Smith, one of the group\u2019s co-founders, told NBC News in a telephone interview last month. \u201cIf people were entitled to say that their sex in law had changed, you can\u2019t control who applies for that.\u201d",
      "For Smith and her group, the issue of legal gender recognition touches on who gets to make decisions about women\u2019s lives and bodies, including their access to spaces from hospital wards to rape crisis centers and prisons."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s increasing turn against his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin has inspired hopes in Ukraine and among its supporters that he is starting to believe what they\u2019ve been telling him all along: Moscow is the antagonist and the only way to stop it is with cash and military equipment.",
      "But while Monday\u2019s apparent U-turn was dramatic, other Ukraine supporters, former officials and other foreign policy experts are wary at least and deeply skeptical at worst.",
      "\u201cThe question that Europeans and Ukrainians are asking,\u201d according to Ivo Daalder, former United States ambassador to NATO, is \u201chow real is this change? And how lasting is this change? And what does it really mean in terms of American policy toward the region?\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the second time that the Trump administration has moved the goal posts,\u201d having briefly cut off aid to Ukraine in February, he said. \u201cSo there are a lot of questions here.\u201d",
      "Trump has previously lavished praise on Putin while scorning Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. But on  Monday in the Oval Office, sitting next to NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, he said he was \u201cvery unhappy\u201d with the Kremlin and that the United States would sell \u201ctop-of-the-line weapons\u201d to NATO allies \u2014 including the much-demanded Patriot missiles \u2014 so that they can be used in Ukraine.",
      "Alongside that, if Putin does not agree to a peace deal in 50 days, Trump said, he will slap 100% tariffs on any country that buys Russian goods. That lag time has been criticized across Europe, with officials and experts asking why Trump is giving additional time to an autocrat who has hardly wavered in his desire to subjugate Ukraine.",
      "The anxiety is fueled further by the widespread perception in Europe and elsewhere that Trump is a president who makes decisions on a whim and is prone to changing them.",
      "Trump himself hinted at this propensity to change his mind quickly. He recalled going home one night and telling first lady Melania Trump, \u201c\u2018I spoke to Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation.\u2019\u201d To which she responded, \u201c\u2018Oh, really, another city was just hit\u2019\u201d in Ukraine by Russia\u2019s missiles.",
      "The exact details of Trump\u2019s new direction are as yet unclear.",
      "He said that the shopping list included Patriot missiles, the state-of-the-art American defensive system that Ukraine says it desperately needs to fend off Russia\u2019s nearly nightly aerial assaults.",
      "European NATO allies were going to buy \u201cbillions of dollars worth of military equipment\u201d from the U.S. \u201cand that\u2019s going to be quickly distributed to the battlefield\u201d in Ukraine, he added.",
      "The Patriot missiles could arrive in Ukraine \u201cvery soon \u2014 within days, actually,\u201d expedited by European nations giving their existing weapons to Ukraine and replacing them with the new systems delivered by the U.S., he said.",
      "\u201cThis is really big,\u201d said Rutte, a man who often heaps praise on Trump. \u201cIt will mean that Ukraine can get its hands on really massive numbers of military equipment, both for air defense, but also missiles, ammunition, etc.\u201d He added, \u201cif I\u2019m Ukraine, I think this is really great news.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy, who has clashed several times with Trump and his team, posted on X thanking the president \u201cfor the willingness to support Ukraine and to continue working together to stop the killings and establish a lasting and just peace.\u201d",
      "Other endorsements came with caveats.",
      "The U.S. has \u201crealized that Russia does not really want peace, so in order to have peace, we need to support Ukraine and we need to put the pressure on Russia,\u201d Kaja Kallas, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, told reporters in Brussels on Tuesday.",
      "However she suggested that waiting almost two months to impose tariffs was too long: \u201cFifty days is a very long time if we see that they are killing innocent civilians every day.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a view also held by Yuriy Boyechko, CEO and founder of Hope for Ukraine, a nonprofit organization based in Roseland, New Jersey, that supports Ukrainian refugees in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThis is way too long,\u201d he said. \u201cUnless significant pressure is applied on Putin and the Russian economy immediately, more innocent civilians will die.\u201d",
      "Russian officials mixed grave condemnation with mockery.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called Trump\u2019s statements \u201cvery serious\u201d because it was \u201caddressed personally to President Putin.\u201d Whereas former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called it a \u201ctheatrical ultimatum\u201d about which \u201cRussia didn\u2019t care.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "An elite Chinese cyberspy group hacked at least one state\u2019s National Guard network for nearly a year, the Department of Defense has found.",
      "The hackers, already responsible for one of the most expansive cyberespionage campaigns against the U.S. to date, are alleged to have burrowed even further than previously known and may have obtained sensitive military or law enforcement information. Authorities are still working to discover the extent of the data accessed.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security memo from June, describing the Pentagon\u2019s findings, said that the group, publicly known by the nickname Salt Typhoon, \u201cextensively compromised a U.S. state\u2019s Army National Guard network\u201d from March 2024 through December. The memo did not say which state.",
      "The report was provided to NBC News through the national security transparency nonprofit Property of the People, which obtained it through a freedom of information request.",
      "The Department of Defense didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. A National Guard Bureau spokesperson confirmed the compromise but declined to share details.",
      "\u201cWhile we cannot provide specific details on the attack or our response to it, we can say this attack has not prevented the National Guard from accomplishing assigned state or federal missions, and that NGB continues to investigate the intrusion to determine its full scope,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "A spokesperson for China\u2019s embassy in Washington did not deny the campaign but said the U.S. has failed to prove China is behind the Salt Typhoon hacks.",
      "\u201cCyberattacks are a common threat faced by all countries, China included,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that the U.S. \u201chas been unable to produce conclusive and reliable evidence that the \u2018Salt Typhoon\u2019 is linked to the Chinese government.\u201d",
      "Salt Typhoon is notorious even by the standards of China\u2019s massive cyberspy efforts because of its ability to jump from one organization to another. Last year, U.S. authorities found that it had hacked at least eight of the country\u2019s largest internet and phone companies, including AT&T and Verizon, using access to spy on the calls and text messages of both the Harris and Trump presidential campaigns, as well as the office of then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.",
      "While part of the Department of Defense, National Guard units are also under the authority of their states; some are deeply integrated with local governments or law enforcement, which may have given the Salt Typhoon hackers the ability to compromise other organizations.",
      "The hack \u201clikely provided Beijing with data that could facilitate the hacking of other states\u2019 Army National Guard units, and possibly many of their state-level cybersecurity partners,\u201d the DHS report found. The National Guard in 14 U.S. states work with law enforcement \u201cfusion centers\u201d to share intelligence, the DHS memo notes. The hackers accessed a map of geographic locations in the targeted state, diagrams of how internal networks are set up, and personal information of service members, it said.",
      "In January, the Treasury Department \u2014 also a recent target of alleged Chinese hacking \u2014 sanctioned a Sichuan company for allegedly helping Beijing\u2019s Ministry of State Security conduct Salt Typhoon operations.",
      "Salt Typhoon can be pernicious and hard to root out once the hackers take hold. In the AT&T case, the company announced in December that it appeared as if they were no longer being affected and Verizon said in January it had \u201ccontained\u201d the incident. Both companies stopped short of saying they were fully protected from the hackers returning. A report from Cisco said that, in at least one instance, Salt Typhoon hackers remained in an affected environment for up to three years."

    "published": "Sat, 19 Jul 2025 09:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Ukranian activists warn about corruption and authoritarianism after police raids against several high-profile anti-corruption campaigners and opposition figures.",
    "story": [
      "Ukraine risks backsliding on its endemic corruption problem \u2014 and even creeping toward authoritarianism \u2014 activists warn, following police raids against a high-profile anti-corruption campaigner and opposition figures.",
      "On July 11, armed police raided the home of Vitaliy Shabunin, the co-founder of Ukraine\u2019s Anti-Corruption Action Center. He has accused President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of \u201ctaking the first, but confident steps toward corrupt authoritarianism,\u201d including backing laws offering amnesty to those accused of corruption in the defense industry, and passing over an independently selected candidate for a key anti-graft role.",
      "The move has perturbed even some of Zelenskyy\u2019s supporters \u2014 people who are simultaneously worried about the heavy-handed and potentially spurious crackdown on dissent, and that such criticisms against the Ukrainian leader might be used in bad faith by opponents in Moscow or Washington.",
      "\u201cThis is the red line which President Zelensky has crossed \u2014 and the red line is in a very wrong direction in terms of the development of Ukraine,\u201d said Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, the Kyiv-based watchdog that Shabunin co-founded. She said the State Bureau of Investigations did not have the necessary court documents for the search.",
      "Shabunin has been charged with evading military service and fraud, with prosecutors alleging that while on secondment from the front lines to continue his activism back in Kyiv, he conducted activities unrelated to his military service. His defense team and supporters say the secondment was all aboveboard and ordered by his superiors, and that the allegations are trumped up and political.",
      "The case has caused grave alarm for many inside Ukraine and abroad, with even some of those who praise Zelenskyy for making progress on corruption flagging it as cause for concern that he may be engaging in some of the same questionable practices they\u2019d hoped he was rooting out.",
      "Zelenskyy pledged to reduce corruption when he was elected in 2019, and many expert observers say he has been effective at doing so, but the tide of criticism around Shabunin\u2019s arrest comes when the president is under intense pressure to fight off Russia and keep alive support from the United States and the West that has been at risk of faltering.",
      "It\u2019s not just Shabunin\u2019s own organization that\u2019s concerned. A group of 59 nongovernmental and civil society organizations, both inside Ukraine and abroad, have signed an open letter to Zelenskyy saying the arrest \u201cbears signs of political motivation, abuse of rights\u201d and either \u201cgross incompetence\u201d or \u201ca deliberate attack to pressure\u201d Shabunin.",
      "NBC News has contacted Zelenskyy\u2019s office and the State Bureau of Investigations for comment but has not received a response.",
      "The president has been a longtime vocal advocate on the issue of fighting corruption, particularly when it comes to suggestions from the U.S. and elsewhere that the billions of dollars in military aid his country is receiving might be being misappropriated.",
      "\u201cWhere we saw risks that something could be happening with weapons, we cracked down hard,\u201d he told the \u201cLex Fridman Podcast\u201d in January.",
      "Last year Shabunin himself dismissed the idea that foreign arms could be embezzled, telling the BBC that \u201call weapons supplied by Western allies end up in the hands of Ukrainian troops who use them effectively. It is impossible to steal Western weapons.\u201d",
      "Shabunin appeared in court Tuesday and was released on \u201crecognizance\u201d \u2014 essentially released without having to post bail \u2014 until the next hearing Aug. 20.",
      "The German Marshall Fund, a Washington think tank and one of the international signatories of the letter to Zelenskyy, said Ukraine had made \u201cmonumental strides\u201d on corruption in the past 11 years.",
      "Nevertheless, \u201cit\u2019s always concerning when a government targets its vocal critics with flimsy charges in politically motivated investigations,\u201d said Josh Rudolph, head of the fund\u2019s malign finance and corruption team. \u201cAlthough this is not a sign of corruption per se, it displays an alarming disregard for the fundamental values of freedom and the rule of law at a time when the international community has been rallying around Ukraine because it is defending those very values from Russia\u2019s brutal assault.\u201d",
      "Shabunin is not the only recent arrest to cause alarm. The opposition UDAR party, headed by former heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, says that a raid in April on the home of Kyiv City Council deputy Dmytro Bilotserkivets \u2014 again, they said, without the necessary documents \u2014 was a clear attempt to put pressure on political dissent.",
      "Corruption in Ukraine is a fraught and delicate topic, ripe for weaponization often in bad faith.",
      "Russia uses it as an example to support its otherwise untrue criticisms \u2014 such as Ukraine being run by neo-Nazis \u2014 while American and European politicians hold up such examples to bolster their pre-existing arguments about whether to support Kyiv\u2019s defense against Moscow.",
      "\u201cThe issue of corruption in Ukraine has long been highly politicized,\u201d said Mariya Omelicheva, a professor at the Pentagon-funded National War College in Washington, D.C.",
      "Ukrainian \u201ccorruption is almost always co-opted \u2014 either by Ukraine\u2019s supporters or, more problematically, by its adversaries,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is particularly sensitive in the current U.S. political climate, where both parties \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 have used Ukrainian corruption narratives for domestic political purposes.\u201d",
      "There is also a feeling among some Ukrainians that President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d focus has allowed officials abroad to act with greater impunity knowing Washington\u2019s hitherto exacting gaze is currently less troubled by world affairs.",
      "\u201cOur international partners, particularly the United States, don\u2019t care anymore about good governance and anti-corruption and reforms,\u201d Kaleniuk said. Washington \u201cfor the last 12 years had a powerful impact on how Ukraine develops, and the U.S. was usually tough on good governance, anti-corruption reforms and developments critical for democracy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now America doesn\u2019t care about that.\u201d",
      "While it\u2019s true Trump historically spoke warmly of Russian President Vladimir Putin and appeared to accept many of his war demands, in recent weeks he has been increasingly hostile to the Kremlin and signaled a renewed support for Ukraine, pledging Patriot missiles for Kyiv and tariffs on Moscow.",
      "It\u2019s also true that Ukraine \u2014 and Zelenskyy \u2014 have achieved some progress in the corruption fight in recent years. Transparency International, the best known international group that tracks this topic, says Ukraine has steadily improved in its annual \u201cCorruption Perceptions\u201d index \u2014 although it still ranks 105 of 180 countries worldwide.",
      "Nevertheless, domestically there are plenty of Ukrainians alarmed at what they see is a negative direction of travel when it comes to corruption in their country. Though the immediate fight is against Russia, the ultimate battle is for their values of liberty and democracy, supporters say, without which the battlefield struggle becomes pointless.",
      "\u201cWe are fighting for freedoms and for dignity,\u201d Kaleniuk said. If those are lost, \u201conly Russia will applaud.\u201d",
      "Alexander Smith and Freddie Clayton reported from London. Erin McLaughlin from Washington, D.C., and Anastasiia Parafeniuk and Daryna Mayer from Kyiv."

      "The probe, announced Tuesday by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, came after an outcry from students at the university, the city's oldest, who said it hadn't done enough to protect them or punish the accused.",
      "\"The images were organized into folders named after the victims, totaling 700+ images (including the original photos),\" read a widely circulated letter that was posted Saturday on Instagram from an account run by three unnamed victims.",
      "The accused, referred to in the letter only as \u201ca male law student,\u201d took photos of the victims from social media and used AI software to generate pornographic images with their faces, according to the letter. The images were discovered on his laptop reported to the university in February. They were not known to have been widely distributed.",
      "In March, the university interviewed some of the victims, and in April informed one of them that the accused student had written a 60-word \"apology letter.\"",

      "\u201cAny conduct that causes harm to others may constitute a criminal offense and may also infringe individual rights and also privacy,\u201d he said.",
      "The university did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News, but it told the South China Morning Post this week that it was conducting a review of the incident and vowed further action if victims demanded more.",
      "\u201cThe university is now further reviewing the case and will take further actions when appropriate to ensure a safe and respectful learning environment,\u201d it said."

      "The Department of Homeland Security resumed third-country deportation flights Tuesday by sending five immigrant detainees, all from different countries, to the small nation of Eswatini in southern Africa.",
      "The five men from Vietnam, Laos, Jamaica, Cuba and Yemen have criminal backgrounds ranging from murder to sexual assault, according to a social media post by DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.",
      "\u201cThis flight took individuals so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back,\u201d McLaughlin wrote.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if the men are in law enforcement custody in Eswatini. Mclaughlin told NBC News, \u201cThat\u2019s up to Eswatini.\u201d",
      "The landlocked country is located between South Africa and Mozambique and occupies an area slightly smaller than New Jersey.",
      "In a statement, the Eswatini government said that the five detainees are being held in a local prison and that it is arranging to send them back to their countries of origin.",
      "Local media has reported that an Eswatini women\u2019s rights organization expressed shock that President Donald Trump \u201cdeports and dumps four convicted murderers and rapists in the tiny Southern African Kingdom.\u201d",
      "ICE put out new guidance last week that its employees are allowed in certain circumstances to deport migrants to countries that are not their own in as little as six hours \u2014 and without assurances from the third countries that they \u201cwill not be persecuted or tortured.\u201d",
      "In other cases, according to the new guidance, ICE must serve the immigrant with a notice of removal that lists what country the federal government intends to deport the person to in a language that the immigrant understands.",
      "ICE officers will not affirmatively ask whether the person is afraid of being sent to that country, according to the memo, but those who voice such a fear will be referred for screening for possible protection within 24 hours. ICE could still attempt to send the person to a different country other than the one the detainee was fearful of being sent to.",
      "The Supreme Court paved the way for DHS to resume swift deportation of migrants to countries that are not their own in late June.",
      "The decision came after a deportation flight with eight migrants left Texas reportedly intended for South Sudan in late May, sparking a legal battle that resulted in the men being held in Djibouti.",
      "In a filing at the Supreme Court, the Trump administration said it had received assurances from South Sudan that the men \u201cwill not be subject to torture\u201d under the United Nations Convention Against Torture."

      "The large-scale, long-range attacks targeted energy infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on X. Power was cut for 80,000 families in his hometown of Kryvyi Rih and other locations in the Dnipropetrovsk region, Ukraine's largest private energy company DTEK said on the Telegram app.",
      "The attacks came hours after Trump told his Ukrainian counterpart not to target Moscow. It followed a report by the Financial Times citing two people familiar with the conversation that he had encouraged Zelenskyy to step up attacks deep inside Russia.",
      "NBC News has not independently confirmed the Financial Times\u2019 reporting, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt later said that Trump \u201cwas merely asking a question, not encouraging further killing.\u201d",
      "Trump, who has previously lavished praise on Vladimir Putin while scorning Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on Monday gave the Russian president 50 days to agree to a peace deal. During a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte at the White House, he also said that he would slap 100% tariffs on any country that buys Russian goods.",

      "President Donald Trump may have expected a Russian shudder of fear after he threatened to impose \u201cvery severe tariffs\u201d if Moscow didn\u2019t agree a ceasefire in Ukraine. Instead, his comments appear to have prompted a collective public shrug.",
      "Calling Trump's statements \u201cvery serious,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that Russia needs \u201ctime to analyze\u201d them.",
      "But investors in the Russian capital who had been gearing up for tougher measures instead embraced a 50-day grace period on tariffs set by Trump on Monday and the Moscow Stock Exchange was up 2.7% after it opened Tuesday morning.",
      "Oil prices also fell by more than $1 after the announcement, hinting that investors don't think Trump will follow through on his threat to impose the tariffs.",
      "Trump \u201cdid not announce any immediate anti-Russian measures or the confiscation of illegally blocked Russian assets,\u201d Leonid Slutsky, a prominent nationalist politician, said on Telegram on  Tuesday, adding that the president was trying to balance Western support for Kyiv while avoiding a confrontation with the Kremlin.",
      "Trump announced the levies along with the shipment of new weapons to Ukraine during a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte at the White House on Monday.",
      "His comments came as a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., made its way through Congress. If passed, it would seek to impose 500% tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil and gas.",
      "Praising Trump\u2019s announcement, Graham and his bill\u2019s co-sponsor,  Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said in a statement that \u201cthe ultimate hammer to bring about the end of this war will be tariffs against countries, like China, India and Brazil, that prop up Putin\u2019s war machine by purchasing cheap Russian oil and gas.\u201d",
      "However, Konstantin Kosachev, the deputy chairman of the Russian Federation Council, the upper house of the country\u2019s parliament, said Graham\u2019s bill made \u201cno sense.\u201d",
      "In 50 days, \u201chow much can change both on the battlefield and in the mood of those in power both in the U.S. and in NATO?\u201d he added.",
      "And former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, a hard-liner who frequently issues over-the-top threats, called Trump\u2019s threat a \u201ctheatrical ultimatum\u201d in a post on X.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don\u2019t have a deal in 50 days, tariffs at about 100%,\u201d Trump said, without providing further details.",
      "After the announcement, a White House official said Trump's threat of 100% tariffs was referring to Russian goods, as well as secondary sanctions on other countries that buy its exports.",
      "The president\u2019s comments signal a marked shift in tone over his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, for whom he has long shown admiration. \u201cI\u2019ve known him for a long time. We\u2019ve always gotten along well,\u201d Trump said in March.",
      "Many Western countries have cut most of their own financial ties to Moscow since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, its smaller neighbor, triggering the first major land war in Europe since World War II.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about tariffs on countries like India and China that are buying their oil,\u201d Matt Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, told reporters Monday after Trump\u2019s announcement. \u201cAnd it really is going to, I think, dramatically impact the Russian economy.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s threats of secondary tariffs are \u201cnever going to go anywhere\u201d as long as he is unwilling to impose costs on Moscow directly, Keir Giles, a senior fellow at the London-based Chatham House think tank, told NBC News on Monday.",
      "The tariffs also risk upending delicate China-U.S. trade talks, according to Liu Baocheng at Beijing's University of International Business and Economics.",
      "The \u201cunilateral imposition of punitive trade measures ... risks creating new and unnecessary complications,\u201d Liu said, adding that the 100% secondary tariffs intended to pressure Moscow could instead \u201cseverely backfire by undermining global economic stability and fragmenting international cooperation.\u201d",
      "Most concerning, Liu added, was that the threat comes at a delicate juncture in U.S.-China trade relations, where secondary tariffs on Chinese companies or sectors that import Russian goods \u201cwould seriously damage the fragile momentum of dialogue.\u201d",
      "Trump's tariff agenda has also raised the stakes for India, which has been negotiating a trade deal with Washington to see tariffs on goods from India drop below 20%.",
      "Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar told reporters Tuesday that his country had \u201cbeen in touch\u201d with Graham over its concerns and interests on energy and security.",
