      "In an unexpected upset, the Jason Statham thriller \u201cA Working Man\u201d has taken the No_ 1 spot at the box office, besting the rapidly declining performance of \u201cSnow White.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- In an unexpected upset, the Jason Statham thriller \u201cA Working Man\u201d took No. 1 at the box office, besting the rapidly declining \u201cSnow White,\u201d according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Even after a lackluster debut, the Walt Disney Co.\u2019s live-action remake was predicted to remain the top film in U.S. and Canadian theaters over the weekend. Instead, \u201cSnow White,\u201d plagued by bad buzz and backlash, nosedived in its second weekend and dropped 66%.",
      "At the same time, Amazon MGM Studios\u2019 \u201cA Working Man,\u201d directed by David Ayer, beat expectations with a $15.2 million debut. Co-written by Sylvester Stallone, \u201cA Working Man\u201d reteams Statham and Ayer following last year\u2019s successful \u201cThe Beekeeper\u201d ($162 million worldwide). This time around, Statham plays a construction worker with an elite military past.",
      "While reviews have been mixed and audiences only gave \u201cA Working Man\u201d a \u201cB\u201d CinemaScore, showing Statham has carved out something rare in the movie industry today: bankability. \u201cA Working Man\u201d opened similarly to \u201cThe Beekeeper,\u201d which launched with $16.5 million.",
      "The bigger headline, though, might have been the fast erosion of ticket buyers' appetite for \u201cSnow White.\u201d The film, directed by Marc Webb and starring Rachel Zegler, had been hoped to lift movie theaters after a painful start to 2025. Produced for more $250 million, the film has turned into a poisoned apple, with a two-week global haul of $143.1 million.",
      "Next weekend, Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d is expected to win the weekend and will, like \u201cSnow White,\u201d target family audiences.",
      "A trio of newcomers \u2013 A24\u2019s \u201cDeath of a Unicorn,\u201d Universal and Blumhouse\u2019s \u201cThe Woman in the Yard,\u201d and the Fathom\u2019s \u201cChosen: The Last Supper\u201d \u2013 also opened over the weekend, though none made a big impact.",
      "\u201cThe Chosen: The Last Supper,\u201d fared the best, with $11.5 million in 2,235 theaters. The Christian TV series, now in its fifth season, has regularly driven ticket sales before streaming. More episodes will roll out in theaters through April.",
      "\u201cDeath of a Unicorn,\u201d a horror comedy starring Jenna Ortega and Paul Rudd, portrays a father and daughter who hit a unicorn on the road while they're driving. The movie collected a modest $5.8 million from 3,050 theaters.",
      "The weekend\u2019s more straightforward horror contender, Blumhouse\u2019s \u201cThe Woman in the Yard,\u201d starring Danielle Deadwyler, debuted with $9.4 million from 2,842 cinemas. In \u201cBlack Adam\u201d director Jaume Collet-Serra\u2019s film, a mysterious woman keeps appearing in a family\u2019s front yard. Though it cost little to make, with a production budget of $12 million, it has been slammed by critics.",
      "One of the weekend\u2019s biggest successes was the 1997 Studio Ghibli classic \u201cPrincess Mononoke.\" The Hayo Miyazaki film grossed $4 million across just 347 IMAX screens. Distributor GKids touted that result as a victory for humanity over technology. Earlier in the week, a new version of ChatGPT allowed users to render images in Studio Ghibli-like animation.",
      "Sony Pictures Classic\u2019s \u201cThe Penguin Lesson,\u201d starring Steve Coogan and Jonathan Pryce, opened with $1.2 million at 1,017 theaters. Coogan plays an Englishman teaching in Argentina in 1976 who rescues a penguin from an oil spill.",
      "With flagging ticket sales overall, Hollywood marked the first quarter of 2025 with a sizeable box-office deficit. Sales are down 11% from the same point in 2024, and nearly 40% from 2019, according to Comscore.",
      "\u201cHopefully \u2018Minecraft\u2019 can help the marketplace level up since after some underwhelming weekends at the box office we need to get some momentum back at the multiplex,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore.",
      "With final domestic figures due Monday, the following list factors in estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:",
      "1. \u201cA Working Man,\u201d $15.2 million",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Richard Chamberlain, the handsome hero of the 1960s television series \"Dr. Kildare\" who found a second career as an award-winning \"king of the miniseries,\" has died. He was 90.",
      "Chamberlain died Saturday night in Waimanalo, Hawaii, of complications following a stroke, according to his publicist, Harlan Boll.",
      "\u201cOur beloved Richard is with the angels now. He is free and soaring to those loved ones before us,\" Martin Rabbett, his lifelong partner, said in a statement. \"How blessed were we to have known such an amazing and loving soul. Love never dies. And our love is under his wings lifting him to his next great adventure.\u201d",
      "Tall, with classic good looks and romantic style, Chamberlain became an instant favorite with teenage girls as the compassionate physician on the TV series that aired from 1961 to 1966. Photoplay magazine named him most popular male star for three years in a row, from 1963-65.",
      "Not until 2003 did he acknowledge publicly what Hollywood insiders had long known, that he was gay. He made the revelation in his autobiography, \"Shattered Love.\"",
      "The actor became known as \"king of the TV miniseries\" in 1978 when he landed the starring role in \"Centennial,\" an epic production 24 hours long and based on James Michener's sprawling novel. He followed that in 1980 with \"Shogun,\" another costly, epic miniseries based on James Clavell's period piece about an American visitor to Japan.",
      "He scored his greatest miniseries success in 1983 with another long-form drama, \"The Thorn Birds,\" based on Colleen McCullough's best-seller. He played Father Ralph de Bricassart, a Roman Catholic priest in Australia who falls in love with beautiful Meggie Cleary (Rachel Ward). The ABC production, which also starred Barbara Stanwyck, reportedly attracted 100 million viewers.",
      "Chamberlain won Golden Globes for his work in \u201cShogun\" and \u201cThe Thorn Birds.\u201d Years earlier, he received one for \u201cDr. Kildare.\u201d",
      "When the public began to lose interest in miniseries, Chamberlain turned to the theater, where he displayed a fine singing voice. He appeared as Henry Higgins in a 1994 Broadway revival of \"My Fair Lady\" and as Captain von Trapp in a 1999 revival of \"The Sound of Music.\"",
      "He reprised his role of de Bricassart in the 1996 TV movie \"The Thorn Birds: The Missing Years.\"",
      "He also appeared in numerous films, including \"The Music Lovers\" (as Tchaikovsky), \"The Madwoman of Chaillot,\" \"The Towering Inferno\" and \"The Three Musketeers\" and its sequels.",
      "The \"Kildare\" series was based on a string of successful 1930s and '40s films that had starred Lew Ayres in the title role.",
      "Chamberlain's hunky, all-American appearance made him an overnight star. Another medical show that debuted the same season, \"Ben Casey,\" also was a smash and made its leading man, the darkly handsome Vince Edwards, a star, too.",
      "The \"Ben Casey shirt\" became a fashion item, both shows' theme songs made the pop Top 40 (the Kildare song performed by Chamberlain himself) and there was even a pop song called \"Dr. Kildare! Dr. Casey! You Are Wanted for Consultation.\"",
      "But in his book, Chamberlain recounted how he was forced to hide his sexuality. He would escort glamorous actresses to movie premieres and other public events at the request of studio executives and dodge reporters' questions about why he had never married with a stock reply: \"Getting married would be great, but I'm awfully busy now.\"",
      "\"When I grew up, being gay, being a sissy or anything like that was verboten,\" he said in an NBC interview. \"I disliked myself intensely and feared this part of myself intensely and had to hide it.\"",
      "The book also described a troubled childhood and an alcoholic father, and Chamberlain said that writing it finally lifted a heavy emotional burden. He also expressed relief that he was no longer hiding his sexuality.",
      "\"I played a cat-and-mouse game with the press. Game over,\" said Chamberlain.",
      "Born George Richard Chamberlain in Beverly Hills on March 31, 1934, the actor originally studied at Pomona College to be a painter. But after returning from the Army, where he had served as an infantry clerk in the Korean War, Chamberlain decided to try acting.",
      "He studied voice and drama, and after appearing in guest roles in a handful of TV shows and in the 1960 film \"The Secret of the Purple Reef,\" he won the Dr. Kildare role.",
      "When \u201cDr. Kildare\u201d was canceled he initially found it difficult to shake the image of the handsome young physician.",
      "He moved to England for a time to find work and hone his acting skills. While there, he appeared in three of director Richard Lester\u2019s films, \u201cPetulia\u201d (1968), \u201cThe Three Musketeers\u201d (1973) and \u201cThe Four Musketeers\u201d (1974). He reunited with Lester in 1989 for \u201cThe Return of the Musketeers,\u201d once more playing Aramis.",
      "In 1969, Chamberlain played the title role in \u201cHamlet\u201d at England\u2019s Birmingham Repertory Company and repeated it in a TV adaptation that appeared on NBC in the United States. He also appeared as Octavius in a film version of \u201cJulius Caesar,\u201d which co-starred Charlton Heston and Jason Robards.",
      "He continued to act well into the 21st century, appearing on such television shows as \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d \u201cThe Drew Carey Show\u201d and \u201cTouched by an Angel.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- After mounting criticism following its initial response to the violent attack on Oscar-winning \u201cNo Other Land\u201d co-director Hamdan Ballal, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences apologized Friday for not acknowledging Ballal by name.",
      "In a letter to academy members, academy CEO Bill Kramer and its president, Janet Yang, said they regretted not issuing a direct statement on Ballal. The director on Monday, witnesses said, was beaten by Israeli settlers in the West Bank and then detained by the Israeli military.",
      "The attack, just weeks after Ballal and his fellow directors won best documentary at the Academy Awards, was widely condemned by numerous film organizations, among others. The academy on Wednesday released a statement condemning \u201charming or suppressing artists for their work or their viewpoints.\"",
      "Yuval Abraham, a journalist and co-director of \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d was highly critical of that response, comparing it to \u201csilence on Hamdan's assault.\"",
      "On Friday, more than 600 of the academy's 11,000 members issued an open letter saying the academy's statement \"fell far short of the sentiments this moment calls for.\u201d Among the signatories were Joaquin Phoenix, Olivia Colman, Riz Ahmed, Emma Thompson, Javier Bardem, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and \u201cThe Zone of Interest\u201d filmmaker Jonathan Glazer.",
      "After a meeting Friday by the academy's board of governors, Kramer and Yang responded with a new statement.",
      "\u201cWe sincerely apologize to Mr. Ballal and all artists who felt unsupported by our previous statement and want to make it clear that the academy condemns violence of this kind anywhere in the world,\u201d they wrote to members. \"We abhor the suppression of free speech under any circumstances.\u201d",
      "After being detained for more than 20 hours, Ballal was released by Israeli soldiers. Ballal and two other Palestinians were accused of throwing stones at a settler, allegations they deny. After being released, Ballal told The Associated Press a settler kicked his head \u201clike a football\u201d during an attack on his village.",
      "\u201cI realized they were attacking me specifically,\u201d Ballal said at a West Bank hospital after his release Tuesday. \u201cWhen they say \u2018Oscar\u2019, you understand. When they say your name, you understand.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a joint Israeli-Palestinian production, chronicles the situation in Masafer Yatta, which the Israeli military designated as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered the expulsion of the residents, mostly Arab Bedouin. Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly come in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards.",
      "After not finding a U.S. distributor despite wide acclaim, \u201cNo Other Land\u201d was self-released in theaters. It still managed to surpass $2 million in North American theaters.",

    "story": [
      "The Sex Pistols will tour North America for the first time since 2003 this fall",
      "NEW YORK -- It wasn't the night punk broke, but it was close. Nearly 50 years ago, the Sex Pistols \u2014 then made up of vocalist Johnny Rotten, guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock \u2014 performed at the 100 Club Punk Special in London, a 140-capacity club, alongside Subway Sect, Siouxsie and the Banshees and The Clash.",
      "The event marked a shift for the subcultural movement; the bands here would soon bring their underground culture to reach mainstream heights.",
      "Now, the 2025 iteration of the Pistols \u2014 Jones, Cooke and Matlock joined by frontman Frank Carter (of Gallows, Pure Love and Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes) \u2014 sit in the same venue to discuss their forthcoming North American tour. \u201cThis is where it all kicked off, really, all the punk,\u201d says Cook.",
      "This fall, the legendary punk band will embark on their first tour of North America since 2003, when they were joined by John Lydon (formerly Rotten.) The 2025 run with Carter begins Sept. 16 at the Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas, Texas \u2014 the site of a particularly hostile show for the band when it first toured the U.S. in 1978.",
      "Jones recalls having \u201cpigs' hooves and bottles and what not slung at us by cowboys.\u201d",
      "It is one of a few dates featured in three \u201cLive in the U.S.A.\u201d albums, documenting the band's '78 run: Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco. The latter will release April 25 and captures the show where the band originally called it quits.",
      "\"We were thinking of breaking up in San Francisco again,\" Jones jokes.",
      "The 2025 tour is currently scheduled to conclude Oct. 16 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles. The band will hit Washington; Philadelphia; Brooklyn, New York; Montreal; Toronto; Cleveland; Detroit; Minneapolis; Denver; Seattle and San Francisco. Additional tour dates will be announced later.",
      "Pre-sale opens April 2 and 3. Tickets go on sale April 4 at 10 a.m. local time.",
      "They will perform the band's sole album, 1977\u2019s \u201cNever Mind the Bollocks, Here\u2019s the Sex Pistols Album\u201d live in its entirety as well as other material.",
      "So, why tour the U.S. and Canada now?",
      "\u201cWhy not?\u201d says Jones.",
      "\u201cI think everybody needs this band right now. I think the world needs this band right now,\u201d says Carter. \u201cAnd I think definitely America is screaming out for a band like the Sex Pistols.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re living in a really, really difficult time. So not only do people want to come and just be entertained, they want to enjoy themselves,\u201d he continued. \u201cPunk is an energetic music. It\u2019s one where you can go and vent and let your hair down, hopefully in a safe manner. Fingers crossed, no bottles or pigs' hooves.\u201d",
      "Carter fronted the Sex Pistols last year for a few U.K. dates. The band says they did not reach out to Lydon to see if he wanted to participate in this reunion tour.",
      "\u201cThe last thing he wants to do is have anything to do with us right now,\u201d says Jones, referring to a previous lawsuit between the singer and the band over music use in their TV series \u201cPistol.\u201d The judge ruled against Lydon's opposition.",
      "\u201cWe wish him the best,\" Jones said.",
      "\u201cGood luck to him,\u201d adds Matlock. \u201cI wish he thinks, maybe, \u2018good luck\u2019 to us. Probably doesn't. But over the years, John (has had) all our phone numbers, and I can't see many missed calls from him.\u201d",
      "As for the 2025 tour: Fans shouldn't expect the violence of their 1978 run, but they should anticipate a tighter performance.",
      "\u201cWe're a bit older but we play just as well, if not better,\u201d says Matlock. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s got a great deal of aplomb that we\u2019re going to bring to the public over there.\u201d",
      "Does this mean there could be new Sex Pistols music in the future? \u201cIt's early days,\u201d says Jones. \u201cLet's see what happens.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "At Hong Kong\u2019s Art Basel, painter Chow Chun-fai\u2019s new works transport viewers back to the night in 1997 when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule, displayed in the very exhibition center where one era ended and another began",
      "HONG KONG -- At Hong Kong\u2019s Art Basel, painter Chow Chun-fai\u2019s new works transport viewers back to the night in 1997 when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule, displayed in the very exhibition center where one era ended and another began.",
      "That transformation in the city's post-colonial era has taken a drastic turn since 2020, when China imposed a national security law that virtually wiped out dissent. The law drove many middle-class families and young professionals, including artists, to emigrate to democracies like Britain, Canada, Taiwan and the U.S. from what was once a haven for free expression in Asia.",
      "But others, like Chow, chose to stay and continue to document their home city despite unclear red lines. His works at Art Basel, which opens to the public on Friday, revisit Hong Kongers\u2019 collective memories of the late 1990s and early 2000s, a time many were proud of the Chinese financial hub\u2019s vibrancy and openness.",
      "\u201cWhile studying art, we\u2019ve learned many artists faced momentous times. Since we are living through such a momentous time ourselves now, I will continue to learn from it,\" he said in an interview ahead of the exhibition.",
      "Chow is perhaps best known to those outside art circles for his witty recreations of classic movie scenes with bilingual subtitles that lead audiences to reflect on Hong Kong's history and identity. He was also in the news when he ran against pro-establishment candidates in the 2012 legislative election and the 2016 election committee race, though he ultimately lost both contests.",
      "At Art Basel, Chow's paintings revisit significant news events, from the 1997 handover and overseas trips made by former top Chinese leaders to the celebration of China becoming the host of the 2008 Olympic Games.",
      "His works center on some of the biggest news stories covered by Sharon Cheung, a former journalist and now local gallery director.",
      "In 2000, late former Chinese President Jiang Zemin berated Cheung for asking what he called \u201ctoo simple, sometimes naive\u201d questions. She'd asked Jiang if his support for then-Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa gave the impression of an imperial-style appointment. One of Chow\u2019s paintings illustrates that scene.",
      "Another set of Chow's paintings that will be shown, titled \u201cPanda,\u201d captures Jiang\u2019s personality from another side, documenting his light-hearted response to a question about pandas during a 2002 U.S. trip. He replied in English with a laugh: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I am an electrical power engineer.\" Zhang said he was not a panda expert and quoted a Confucian saying about the virtue of acknowledging what one doesn\u2019t know.",
      "Chow said he included the work in the exhibition because pandas have become a trending topic in Hong Kong, where twins born last year sparked a bear craze. Jiang's response shows the characteristics of Chinese leaders back then, he said.",
      "Some 20 years later, Chinese leaders no longer have such open exchanges with Hong Kong journalists. Last year, China\u2019s government even eliminated an annual news conference by the premier, one of the rare times a top Chinese leader took questions from journalists.",
      "In Hong Kong, Beijing has doubled down on its control following 2019 anti-government protests. Many leading pro-democracy activists were prosecuted and jailed under the security law. Apple Daily and Stand News, news outlets known for their critical reports of the government, were shut down in 2021 after their top editors were arrested.",
      "The cultural sector has felt the chilling effect.",
      "In 2021, the government introduced amendments to its film censorship law on national security grounds. Some filmmakers have stopped screening their work in the city. Cultural works that diverge from government positions have lost funding. Booksellers practice self-censorship at the city's book fair, and local libraries in 2023 pulled titles related to the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing and some political figures.",
      "Cheung, director of SC Gallery, said people have become more cautious about expressing their thoughts, but that she and Chow will not let fear stop them. Art\u2019s sense of distance allows room for interpretation, Cheung said.",
      "\u201cWe're not trying to tell people something. It's more about what people take away when they look at these images,\u201d she said.",
      "Chow said he never planned to leave Hong Kong despite the city's drastic changes, noting that artists who lived through major changes in the past produced great work.",
      "\u201cToday, finding ourselves in this moment of transformation, how could I, as a creative professional, not be here to witness it personally?\u201d he said.",

      "President Donald Trump has signed an executive order on the Smithsonian Institution that targets funding to programs that contain what he calls \u201cdivisive narratives\u201d and \u201cimproper ideology.\u201d",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Thursday revealed his intention to force changes at the Smithsonian Institution with an executive order that targets funding for programs that advance \u201cdivisive narratives\u201d and \u201cimproper ideology,\" the latest step in a broadside against culture he deems too liberal.",
      "Trump claimed there has been a \u201cconcerted and widespread\u201d effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing \u201cobjective facts\u201d with a \u201cdistorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth,\" adding that it casts the \u201cfounding principles\u201d of the United States in a \u201cnegative light.\u201d",
      "The order he signed behind closed doors puts Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, in charge of overseeing efforts to \u201cremove improper ideology\u201d from all areas of the institution, including its museums, education and research centers, and the National Zoo.",
      "It marks the Republican president's latest salvo against cultural pillars of society, such as universities and art, that he considers out of step with conservative sensibilities. Trump recently had himself installed as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the aim of overhauling programming, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show. The administration also recently forced Columbia University to make a series of policy changes by threatening the Ivy League school with the loss of several hundred million dollars in federal funding.",
      "The executive order also hints at the return of statues and monuments of Confederate figures, many of which were taken down or replaced around the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is detested by Trump and other conservatives.",
      "The order also calls for improvements to Independence Hall in Philadelphia by July 4, 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Trump singled out the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, the Women's History Museum, which is in development, and the American Art Museum for criticism.",
      "\u201cMuseums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn \u2014 not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,\u201d he said.",
      "Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s chief spokesperson, said in an email late Thursday, \u201cWe have no comment for now.\u201d",
      "Under Trump\u2019s order, Vance will also work with the White House budget office to make sure future funding for the Smithsonian Institution isn\u2019t spent on programs that \u201cdegrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.\u201d Trump also wants to ensure that the women\u2019s history museum celebrates women and not \u201crecognize men as women in any respect.\u201d",
      "It also requires the interior secretary to reinstate monuments, memorials, statues and similar properties that have been removed or changed since Jan. 1, 2020, to \u201cperpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.\u201d",
      "The Smithsonian Institution is the world\u2019s largest museum, education and research complex. It consists of 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven museums are located along the National Mall in Washington.",
      "The institution was established by Congress with money from James Smithson, a British scientist who left his estate to the United States to found \u201cat Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.\u201d",

      "Yolanda Sald\u00edvar, 64, was up for parole for the first time since the killing of the singer, known to fans as simply Selena.",
      "One of the first Mexican American artists to break into the mainstream music scene, Selena shattered barriers for women in Latin music. She was 23 years old and on the verge of crossing over into English-language pop superstardom when she was killed.",
      "The singer's family and Chris P\u00e9rez, her widower, expressed gratitude to the Texas Board of Pardon and Paroles.",
      "\u201cWhile nothing can bring Selena back, this decision reaffirms that justice continues to stand for the beautiful life that was taken from us and from millions of fans around the world far too soon,\u201d they said in a statement posted on social media.",
      "In explaining the decision to deny parole, the board said in a statement that the panel found that Sald\u00edvar continues to pose a threat to public safety. It also said the nature of the crime indicated \u201ca conscious disregard for the lives, safety, or property of others.\u201d",
      "Sald\u00edvar, who is serving her sentence in a Gatesville prison, will be eligible to be reviewed again for parole in 2030.",
      "Sald\u00edvar founded Selena\u2019s fan club and was the manager of the singer\u2019s clothing boutiques, Selena Etc., until she was fired in early March 1995 after money was discovered missing.",
      "Selena, a Corpus Christi native, was shot in the back with a .38-caliber revolver at a Days Inn motel in Corpus Christi on March 31, 1995. She was able to run to the motel lobby, where she collapsed, and she was pronounced dead at a hospital an hour later.",

      "More than 50,000 people lined up to view Selena\u2019s body the day before she was laid to rest in Seaside Memorial Park on April 3, 1995, just 13 days before her 24th birthday.",
      "Sald\u00edvar\u2019s trial was moved to Houston because of the publicity surrounding the case. Sald\u00edvar testified that she had intended to kill herself during the confrontation with Selena but the gun misfired.",
      "On Oct. 23, 1995, a jury convicted Sald\u00edvar of first-degree murder. She was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 30 years.",
      "While in prison, Sald\u00edvar, a former nurse, obtained her paralegal and associate degree in criminal justice. She has filed several civil rights complaints alleging mistreatment by the state\u2019s prison system, according to court records, and she also helped other inmates file petitions.",
      "In court documents from 2016, Sald\u00edvar said she was being held in protective custody \u2014 meaning she was segregated from other inmates \u2014 because prison officials were concerned for her safety due to the \u201chigh profile\u201d nature of her case. She filed several appeals of her conviction, but all were rejected.",
      "Known as \u201cthe Queen of Tejano,\u201d Selena rose to stardom and won a Grammy during a Tejano music boom in the early 1990s. Her hits included \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom,\u201d \u201cComo la Flor,\u201d \u201cAmor Prohibido,\u201d \u201cNo Me Queda Mas\u201d and \u201cTu Solo Tu.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- When filmmaker Travis Guti\u00e9rrez Senger reflects on ASCO\u2019s legacy, he quickly notes they were more than an art group; they created a movement, one with remarkable influence on Chicano art history.",
      "\u201cThat movement continues today, and it\u2019s very expansive,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of books, films and things that will be written about ASCO over a period of time. And this was our contribution in some ways.\u201d",
      "He's referring to \u201cASCO: Without Permission,\u201d a documentary that chronicles the story of the 1970s art group founded by multidisciplinary artist Patssi Valdez, muralist Willie Herr\u00f3n III, painter and performance artist Gronk and writer and photographer Harry Gamboa Jr. They met as teens, formed as young adults, and called their group \u201casco\u201d \u2014 \u201cnausea\u201d or \u201cdisgust\u201d in Spanish \u2014 after one of their early DIY exhibits. Their conceptual work and performance art spoke to the exclusion of Chicanos from the mainstream art world and the systemic police brutality endured by the Mexican American community in East Los Angeles.",
      "All four founding members of ASCO became some of the most notable Chicano artists, later exhibiting works in revered museums around the United States. But in their early days, the group was denied access to the notable galleries and museums. They created their own avenues in the form of public performances, murals and more to exhibit their work, their way.",
      "\u201cTo behave badly is the most ethical thing you can do,\u201d said executive producer Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal at the film\u2019s South by Southwest film festival premiere earlier this month. \u201cYou\u2019re building identity and questioning and unmasking the facade and the farce that exists.\u201d",
      "Bernal and Diego Luna executive produced the film under their production company El Corriente del Golfo. The film has yet to find distribution.",
      "Speaking with The Associated Press, Gamboa and Valdez praised Guti\u00e9rrez Senger\u2019s approach to their history. Both members, who appear in the documentary, saw the film for the first time with a crowd of fans and a group of young Chicano artists whose art was inspired by ASCO\u2019s early rebellion.",
      "\u201cI felt the film really kind of captured the essence of all of us working together,\u201d said Gamboa.",
      "Valdez says it was a special moment for her, as the only woman in the founding group, to be given equal time and understanding.",
      "\u201cFor the first time, I was given an equal voice in the group that hadn\u2019t happened before,\u201d she said, citing how previous stories of the group only highlighted her male collaborators.",
      "ASCO emerged at the height of the Chicano civil rights movement in the 1960s and 1970s. It was a time of heightened political and racial tension amid the East LA walkouts, protesting education inequality, and the Chicano Moratorium, an anti-Vietnam War movement during which many Mexican Americans were victims of police brutality.",
      "Muralists and collectives popped up as Latino artists sought to process the systemic injustice taking place in their communities.",
      "\u201cThe response to such violence was to create art,\u201d said Gamboa Jr. He wanted to alter the mainstream perception of Chicanos and present the possibilities and avenues someone can create despite societal constraints.",
      "For Valdez, being the only woman meant she was no stranger to a double dose of both racism in society and the sexism weaved within conservative Latino households, where young women were expected to keep quiet.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand it. So, I was able to act out these forms of censorship through the performance work in ASCO,\u201d said Valdez who once taped herself to a public wall in a piece titled \u201cInstant Mural,\u201d a metaphor on feeling captive.",
      "One of ASCO's most known works is \u201cSpray Paint LACMA.\u201d Gamboa, Gronk and Herr\u00f3n spray painted their names on the side of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art after Gamboa says he was told by a curator, \u201cChicanos are in gangs, they don\u2019t make art.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was another era when people said, \u2018Latinx art, you know, doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s not a thing. It doesn\u2019t belong. It\u2019s not part of American art,\u2019\u201d said Pilar Tompkins-Rivas, the chief curator and deputy director of the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art.",
      "ASCO\u2019s neighborhood performance art would often draw stares, and even crowds. In \u201cStation of the Cross,\u201d the group carried a large cross to the local military recruiting office to protest the Vietnam War.",
      "In 1974, Gamboa took a photo of Gronk posed as the victim of gang violence to bring attention to the media\u2019s sensationalist coverage of crime in East Los Angeles. In the documentary, Gamboa claims that a local news station ran the piece as an actual story.",
      "ASCO\u2019s work as a group remained in obscurity from the mainstream. It was not until 2011 when LACMA mounted \u201cASCO: Elite of the Obscure, A Retrospective, 1972-1887,\u201d the first retrospective to present the group\u2019s performance and conceptual art. On display was an image of Valdez, taken by Gamboa, standing above the graffiti art. Life had presented ASCO with its full-circle moment.",
      "\u201cLatino history has always been erased,\u201d said Guti\u00e9rrez Senger. \u201c\u2018ASCO: Without Permission\u2019 is a story of winning a battle, not a war.\u201d",
      "A 1974 photograph of Valdez shows the artist glammed up in a gold top, holding a golden statue of a cobra. She had won best actress at the Aztlan No Movie Awards \u2014 a fictional award show ASCO created as commentary on the lack of Latino representation in Hollywood.",
      "The group was inspired by Hollywood cinema and popular culture, but knew the likelihood of starring in studio films was limited, unless they wanted to play a maid, cartel leader or gang member.",
      "\u201cHollywood movies, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. That\u2019s what I was about,\u201d said Valdez. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I responded in the way I did with my artmaking.\u201d",
      "Gamboa photographed Herr\u00f3n, Gronk and Valdez using cinema stock to capture the essence of their favorite films. The series was called \u201cNo Movies\u201d and later inspired their satirical award show.",
      "Guti\u00e9rrez Senger was drawn to it and pays homage throughout the documentary by featuring a group of young Chicano artists \u2014 including local Los Angeles artists like Fabi Reyna and San Cha \u2014 in short films inspired by ASCO\u2019s signature DIY style.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a necessary obligation as a Latino if you\u2019re making films to fight very, very hard to put brown people on screen and behind the camera and to try to create films about our history,\u201d said Guti\u00e9rrez Senger. \u201cWe have rich stories, and we have a rich history.\u201d",
      "\u201cASCO: Without Permission\u201d includes testimonials from respected Latino artists, including actor Michael Pe\u00f1a and comedian Arturo Castro, who have broken into the mainstream but know the importance of preserving history.",
      "\u201cOur history as Latinos is not in the history books. The movements that we've had are not in the history books,\u201d Pe\u00f1a says in the documentary.",
      "Although it often feels like progression is slow, Valdez says artists need to continue to voice their opinions and \u201cmisbehave and not ask for permission.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou do not need permission to be yourself. You do not need permission to be creative. You do not need permission to be intellectual,\u201d said Gamboa. \u201cAnd the thing is, you cannot allow yourself to be repressed or silenced and or visually curtailed from presenting works.\u201d",

      "Thirty years ago, Latino music legend Selena Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez was killed by her fan club\u2019s president, Yolanda Sald\u00edvar",
      "Thirty years ago, music legend Selena Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez was killed by her fan club\u2019s president, Yolanda Sald\u00edvar. For the last three decades, Sald\u00edvar has served her life sentence in Texas.",
      "Now 64, Sald\u00edvar has a petition for parole under review, according to Texas Department of Criminal Justice online records. On Sunday, she is up for parole for the very first time.",
      "According to a spokeswoman for the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, her case will be voted on or around then, but there's no exact date for the decision to be released.",
      "Here's everything you need to know about Selena, Sald\u00edvar and the parole process in Texas:",
      "Born in 1971, Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez demonstrated an incredible vocal gift in childhood, fronting Selena y Los Dinos with her siblings A.B. and Suzette Quintanilla.",
      "Her superstardom arrived in the early 1990s, with her unique blend of Tejano, pop, cumbia and other musical styles manifesting in huge hits like \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom,\u201d \u201cComo la Flor,\u201d \u201cAmor Prohibido,\u201d \u201cNo Me Queda Mas\u201d and \u201cTu Solo Tu.\u201d",
      "Known the world over as The Queen of Tejano, or even more simply just as Selena, she broke barriers for women in Latin music. She opened the floodgates for a new generation of contemporary artists of Latin descent who would go on to enjoy huge popularity with mainstream American audiences. She often sang in Spanish and spoke in English, reflecting a cross-cultural identity that resonated with listeners.",
      "She won her first Grammy in 1994 for best Mexican/Mexican-American album for \u201cLive,\u201d becoming the first female Tejano artist to win the category. She was just 23 when she was killed the following year. But her legacy endures for Mexican Americans, Mexicans, Texans, Latinos and beyond.",
      "Her posthumous English-language crossover album released a few months after her death, \u201cDreaming of You,\u201d topped the Billboard 200, featuring hits like \u201cI Could Fall in Love\u201d and \u201cDreaming of You.\" In 1997, a biographical film about her life, \u201cSelena,\" would quickly become a classic, further launching the career of lead Jennifer Lopez.",
      "In 2017, she received a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. At the time, according to a Hollywood Chamber of Commerce spokesperson, the crowd was the largest-ever for a Walk of Fame ceremony, breaking a 1998 record set by onlookers at the unveiling of the star for Mexican singer Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez.",
      "In 2021, she received a posthumous lifetime achievement award from the Grammys. There was no tribute.",
      "Yolanda Sald\u00edvar, a former nurse, was the founder and president of Selena's fan club. She was also a manager of Selena\u2019s clothing boutiques, Selena Etc., but was fired in early 1995 after money was discovered missing.",
      "On March 31, 1995, Selena went to Sald\u00edvar's room at the Days Inn motel in Corpus Christi, Texas, to pick up business records she needed for a tax filing, according to court testimony. A confrontation followed.",
      "Selena was shot in the back with a .38-caliber revolver in the motel room, ran outside and collapsed in the lobby. She was rushed to a nearby hospital and pronounced dead about an hour later.",
      "Motel employees testified Selena named \u201cYolanda\u201d in \u201croom 158\u201d as her attacker.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it. I didn\u2019t mean to kill anybody,\u201d a sobbing Sald\u00edvar said during a 9-hour standoff with police, during which she held a gun to her head. She told police she had bought the .38-caliber revolver to kill herself.",
      "The trial was moved to Houston because of heavy publicity.",
      "Prosecutors contended that Sald\u00edvar shot the 23-year-old after the singer\u2019s family suspected her of embezzling $30,000. The defense argued the gun went off accidentally.",
      "On October 23, 1995, the jury convicted Sald\u00edvar of first-degree murder. She was sentenced to life in prison, with the possibility of parole after 30 years \u2014 beginning in 2025.",
      "Sald\u00edvar did not face the death penalty because the crime contained none of the aggravating circumstances required under Texas law, such as a multiple murder or a murder committed during a robbery.",
      "In 1999, the Court of Criminal Appeals in Austin turned down Sald\u00edvar\u2019s first plea for a new trial. In 2000, her lawyer Bill Berchelmann asked the state to revisit the trial. He argued that prosecutors wrongly dismissed potential jurors because of race, did not disclose the criminal record of a witness and made improper comments in court. He said police also violated Sald\u00edvar's rights by interrogating her after she asked for an attorney.",
      "In 2009, Sald\u00edvar lost an appeal because it was filed in the wrong county. She had asked the court to order an appeal filed nine years earlier in Nueces County to move forward, but the state\u2019s highest criminal appeals court said it should have been filed in Harris County, where she was tried and convicted.",
      "She's incarcerated at the Patrick L. O\u2019Daniel prison unit in Gatesville, Texas, about 90 minutes north of Austin.",
      "In Texas, the parole division of the state\u2019s Department of Criminal Justice identifies inmates six months before the date of their initial parole eligibility and pulls their case file for review. Notice of an inmate\u2019s eligibility for parole is sent to officials involved in the trial, any victims and victims' family members.",
      "An institutional parole officer with the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles interviews an inmate and prepares a summary for the board. The victim or the victim\u2019s family members can provide a written statement and can appear in person before board members.",
      "The inmate\u2019s file is then sent to the parole board and voted on by a three-person panel. The panel will vote on a case just prior to the inmate\u2019s parole eligibility date and a majority of two votes is needed for a final decision.",
      "In Texas, the board does not conduct public parole hearings. Parole release decisions are made independently by each panel member.",
      "Representatives for members of Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez\u2019s family did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for comment this week.",
      "A denial by the panel will include the date of the next time an inmate will be eligible for parole.",
      "Sald\u00edvar was convicted of first-degree murder, one of the crimes where state law dictates that the next review after a denial can be done anywhere from one to five years from the date of the denial.",
      "An approval by the panel could include special conditions the inmate will have to follow while on parole. Processing time for a release differs from case to case. Once a release certificate with an approved residence plan is issued, it will be audited by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\u2019s Classification and Records Department and a release date is calculated. Typically, these processes can take two to six weeks to complete.",
      "The governor cannot veto a parole decision by the pardons board. The governor, upon recommendation by a majority of the pardons board, can grant clemency. That includes pardons, commutations and reprieves.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- June Carter, Kenny Chesney and Tony Brown have been invited to join the Country Music Hall of Fame.",
      "The Country Music Association announced the new 2025 inductees on Tuesday in Nashville, Tennessee.",
      "Carter, the Grammy-winning member of one of country music\u2019s pioneering families and the wife of country giant Johnny Cash, joins as this year's veteran era artist. Chesney, who has won the CMA Awards entertainer of the year four times, joins as the modern era artist. And Brown, a Nashville producer who has supervised a wide array of best-selling hits by Vince Gill, Reba McEntire, George Strait and many others, will join the non-performer category.",
      "The three will be formally inducted during a ceremony in the fall.",
      "Tuesday's celebratory ceremony focused on their contributions to country music over the decades, highlighting their influence, even when they were overlooked at times.",
      "\u201cJohnny once said that his wife was one of the most neglected artists in country music,\u201d said country singer Vince Gill, who introduced the inductees. He said Cash worried that his wife's contributions would \u201cunder-recognized simply because she's my wife.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat changes as she takes her rightful place among family, friends and legends in the Country Music Hall of Fame,\u201d Gill said.",
      "Some of Carter's accomplishments include writing more than 100 songs, including co-writing \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d a top hit for Cash. The two married in 1968 and recorded several Grammy-award winning hits like \u201cJackson\u201d and \u201cIf I Were a Carpenter.\u201d",
      "But Carter had been singing since she was 10, long before marrying Cash. Her mother, Maybelle Carter, was in the Carter Family music act with her cousin Sara Carter and Sara\u2019s husband, A.P. Carter. The family act broke up, but mother and daughters June, Helen and Anita continued on as Mother Maybelle & the Carter Sisters, with little June playing autoharp.",
      "The Carters went on to become staples of the Grand Ole Opry country music show in Nashville.",
      "Carlene Carter described her mother as a \u201cforce of nature\u201d who was \u201canchored in love.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnything that\u2019s good about me is because of that mom,\u201d said Carlene Carter, who continued in the family business as a country singer and songwriter.",
      "Chesney, who grew up in eastern Tennessee, told the crowd on Tuesday that if someone had said he would one day be inducted into the same Hall of Fame class as June Carter Cash, he would have called it \u201cunbelievable.\u201d",
      "Chesney's career includes 16 platinum albums and more than 50 Top Ten country hits. After receiving a standing ovation, he said he was just hoping to spread love and positivity through his music.",
      "\u201dI had a really big dream and I\u2019m still pushing that dream as far as I can,\u201d Chesney said. \u201cI just wanted to record and write songs that reflected the lives of a lot of people that came to our shows.\"",
      "For Brown, getting the call about his induction into the Hall of Fame almost knocked him over. He called it one of the biggest accomplishments of his career.",
      "Every year, the Country Music Hall of Fame chooses just three inductees, one of which rotates between songwriters, recording/touring musicians and non-performers.",
      "Brown backed Elvis Presley until his death in 1977, then played with Emmylou Harris & The Hot Band, as well as Rodney Crowell & The Cherry Bombs. But he's being honored more for his production work, as president of MCA Nashville, with RCA Records and eventually as co-founder of Universal South Records.",
      "\u201cYou make records and you make some money, but this is better than money,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThis is about making an impact.\u201d",

According to complaints and witness statements, he trapped one woman with his legs, grabbed her breasts and waist, and shouted: \u201cI can\u2019t even get it up because of this heat!\u201d before crudely inviting her to touch his \u201cbig parasol.\u201d",
      "He denies all allegations. \u201cNever, but never, have I abused a woman,\u201d he wrote in Le Figaro. \u201cI have only ever been guilty of being too loving, too generous, or having a temperament that is too strong.\u201d",
      "But this is the first time one of the more than 20 accusations against him has reached court.",
      "Once a symbol of France\u2019s creative power, Depardieu\u2019s career now shadows the nation\u2019s delayed reckoning with #MeToo. The courtroom has become the stage for something deeper: a country finally confronting the myths it has long told itself about art, power, and male genius.",
      "Born in 1948 to a working-class family in Ch\u00e2teauroux, Depardieu\u2019s rise was the stuff of legend. A stuttering teen with no formal education, he drifted into acting and exploded onto the French stage with \u201cLes Valseuses\u201d (\"Going Places\"), a 1974 film so provocative it remains banned in some countries.",
      "From there came a blur of hits: \u201cJean de Florette,\u201d \u201cCyrano de Bergerac,\u201d \u201cGreen Card,\u201d \u201cThe Last Metro,\u201d and \u201cDanton.\u201d He won a Golden Globe, an Oscar nomination, and the adoration of millions. He played Columbus, Jean Valjean, and even Ob\u00e9lix in the \u201cAsterix\u201d films. He was prolific, omnipresent \u2014 messy, magnetic, and untouchable.",
      "But the excess was real off-screen too. He crashed his motorcycle while drunk, accepted a Russian passport from Vladimir Putin during a tax dispute, and once urinated in a plane aisle. He boasted of his appetites. France seemed to cheer them on.",
      "That myth \u2014 of the lovable brute \u2014 is now unraveling.",
      "In Hollywood, #MeToo toppled titans. In France, the movement was met with a wary eye. When #BalanceTonPorc (\u201cExpose Your Pig\u201d) emerged in 2017, it rattled the country\u2019s self-image \u2014 particularly in the arts, where seduction and transgression had long been celebrated.",
      "Some warned that #MeToo was killing romance. In 2018, screen legend Catherine Deneuve and 99 other prominent French women published an open letter in Le Monde, scolding the movement for going, in their words, \u201ctoo far.\u201d They championed la libert\u00e9 d\u2019importuner \u2014 \u201cthe freedom to bother\u201d \u2014 as a pillar of French life, defending the right of men to pursue women without fear of consequence. To many, it sounded less like a defense of flirtation than a permission slip for harassment, cloaked in perfume and nostalgia.",
      "Even President Emmanuel Macron echoed the sentiment. In Dec. 2023 \u2014 shortly after a documentary aired footage of Depardieu making sexually suggestive comments about a young girl in North Korea \u2014 Macron defended the actor on national television, condemning the backlash as a \u201cmanhunt.\u201d \u201cG\u00e9rard Depardieu makes France proud,\u201d he said.",
      "The remark sparked national outrage \u2014 not just for its timing, but for what it revealed: the instinct to protect cultural giants, no matter the cost.",
      "France\u2019s reluctance to confront sexual misconduct among its stars has long set it apart.",
      "Roman Polanski, convicted of statutory rape in the U.S. and accused by several other women, continues to work and live freely in France. In 2020, his C\u00e9sar Award win prompted walkouts \u2014 but also a standing ovation. There was little institutional pushback.",
      "In 2022, Johnny Depp was dropped from Disney's \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d franchise after domestic abuse allegations by ex-wife Amber Heard ( he was largely vindicated ).",
      "Yet, in France, he was embraced.",
      "In 2023, he played Louis XV in \u201cJeanne du Barry\u201d, the opening film at the French Cannes Film Festival. French fashion house Dior not only kept him on as the face of its Sauvage fragrance \u2014 it reportedly signed him to a multiyear, seven-figure deal in 2022.",
      "Depardieu\u2019s trial isn\u2019t the only case shaking French cinema. In recent months, a string of high-profile convictions have suggested that the shield of fame may finally be cracking.",
      "In February, director Christophe Ruggia was convicted of sexually abusing actress Adele Haenel when she was a child.",
      "Actor-director Nicolas Bedos was sentenced in 2024 for sexual assault.",
      "The same year, actor-director Judith Godr\u00e8che testified before a parliamentary commission, accusing two renowned directors of exploiting her as a teenager. \u201cThis is not about desire,\u201d she told lawmakers. \u201cIt\u2019s about power. About silence. About a system that protects itself.\u201d",
      "That same commission has since summoned major actors \u2014 including Jean Dujardin of \u201cThe Artist\u201d fame. Some reportedly asked to testify behind closed doors.",
      "Anouk Grinberg, who appeared in \u201cLes Volets Verts,\u201d has publicly supported the two women accusing Depardieu. \u201cWhat I saw on set was not seduction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was shameful.\u201d",
      "The case has become a national mirror \u2014 reflecting everything France has tolerated, denied, and excused.",
      "On the Parisian sidewalks, opinions still diverge. \u201cWe\u2019re losing our culture of flirtation,\u201d said Alain Morel, 62, sipping an espresso at a caf\u00e9 near the Arc de Triomphe. \u201cFlirting isn\u2019t a crime \u2014 it\u2019s part of who we are.\u201d",
      "But across the street, 28-year-old student Yasmine Bensalem shook her head. \u201cWe called it charm,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was always about power.\u201d",
      "The trial continues. Depardieu, who has diabetes and heart disease, attends with medical accommodations. His lawyer claims the case is a political vendetta \u2014 a plot to \u201cmake Depardieu fall.\u201d",
      "But whether he is convicted or not, the deeper judgment is already underway.",
      "For decades, France\u2019s artists were seen as untouchable \u2014 their genius a shield. That shield is cracking. The myth is dying. And in its place, a question rises:",
      "Can France finally hold its most powerful men to account?",
      "This is not just the trial of Depardieu. This is the trial of a country \u2014 and whether its unfinished revolution will finish at last.",

      "A groundbreaking initiative could soon be bringing surgeons closer to patients in Africa's remote corners where the doctor-to-patients ratio is among the lowest in the world",
      "KOFORIDUA, Ghana -- Charles Owusu Aseku has traveled across Ghana and beyond in search of care for the large growth of tissue called a keloid on his neck since 2002. The 46-year-old was growing increasingly frustrated after two unsuccessful surgeries and a trip to South Africa that ended with just a consultation.",
      "Aseku was preparing for yet another medical trip until late February when he joined others in the first trial of 3D telemedicine technology in Ghana powered through computer screens in the back of a van.",
      "Those behind the initiative, developed by Microsoft\u2019s research team in partnership with local doctors and researchers, say the remote assessment will help provide medical consultations for patients awaiting surgery or after an operation, in a region where the doctor-to-patient ratio is among the lowest in the world.",
      "The project builds on earlier trials in Scotland and now works as a portable system with enhanced lighting and camera upgrades.",
      "Once inside the van, cameras will capture a 3D model of each patient and the image is then projected onto a large computer screen. Multiple doctors can join the consultation session online and manipulate the 3D model to assess the patient.",
      "\u201cThe idea behind the van is to allow it to travel to those remote villages that don\u2019t have specialized care ... to perform a pre or post-surgical consult,\u201d said Spencer Fowers, principal software developer and 3D-telemedicine project lead at Microsoft Research.",
      "The initiative also gives patients the opportunity to have multiple opinions. Aseku\u2019s session had doctors from Rwanda, Scotland and Brazil, an experience that he said gave him hope.",
      "\"I see a lot of doctors here and I am very happy because experience will come from each of them and maybe they will find a solution to my problem,\u201d the 46-year-old said.",
      "Researchers hope the trial at the Koforidua Regional Hospital, in Ghana\u2019s eastern region, is the start of a wider project that could expand the service and explore new use cases.",
      "Recent years have seen growing use of telemedicine, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts say such digital tools can benefit patients in Africa the most because there are so few specialist doctors for the continent's 1.4 billion people.",
      "George Opoku, 68, was referred to the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in the capital Accra \u2014 nearly 100 kilometers away from the Koforidua hospital, which is much closer to his home \u2014 where he had first gone to seek care for sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that develops in the bones and soft tissues.",
      "Upon hearing about the 3D telemedicine trial, his doctor decided to register him for the process, saving him the extra expenses and stress of long-distance travel.",
      "\u201cThis time I had to sit in a van and to introduce myself and condition to not only one doctor but several of them. I was able to answer all their questions and I am hopeful that they will discuss and cure me of my condition,\u201d Opku said. \u201cI feel well already and I am hopeful.\"",
      "A key challenge for the project is the lack of stable internet access, a common problem in remote parts of Africa.",
      "At the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, the technology is helping patients in need of plastic surgery. An inadequate number of plastic surgeons means that patients often have to consult with different doctors during each visit.",
      "Dr. Kwame Darko, consultant plastic surgeon at the hospital and one of the principal investigators on the project, said that 3D telemedicine could give patients the chance to be seen by multiple doctors during one session.",
      "The 3D technology could make a difference if replicated in Ghana and elsewhere, according to Dr. Ahensan Dasebre, chief resident doctor at the National Reconstructive Plastic Surgery and Burns Centre at Korle-Bu, who was not part of the project.",
      "\u201cWe are already behind in terms of how many doctors are available to care for a certain number of the population,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIf somebody is in a remote part of town where he doesn\u2019t have access to these specialized services, but needs it, the referring doctor could actually use this telemedicine thing to get access to the best of care.\u201d",

      "The departures were announced at a meeting of agency senior leaders. The Atlanta-based CDC has two dozen centers and offices. The heads of five of them are stepping down, and that follows three other departures in recent weeks. This means close to a third of the agency\u2019s top management is leaving or left recently.",
      "The departures \u2014 described as retirements \u2014 were not announced publicly. The Associated Press confirmed the news with two CDC officials who were not authorized to discuss it and spoke on condition of anonymity.",

But it\u2019s not clear how much, if any, influence that had on the leaders\u2019 decision to leave.

      "The latest departures include:",

      "Adding to that: Kevin Griffis, head of CDC communications, left last week. Robin Bailey, the agency\u2019s chief operating officer, left late last month. So did Dr. Nirav Shah, a former CDC principal deputy director who last year was the agency\u2019s primary voice about an evolving bird flu epidemic in animals that has also sickened at least 70 people in the U.S.",

      "People screamed in the streets on Sunday when another 5.1 magnitude aftershock hit, but there were no immediate reports of further damage.",
      "So far 1,644 people have been reported killed in Myanmar and 3,408 missing, but many areas have not yet been reached, and many rescue efforts so far have been undertaken by people working by hand to try and clear rubble, said Cara Bragg, the Yangon-based manager of Catholic Relief Services in Myanmar.",
      "\u201cIt's mainly been local volunteers, local people who are just trying to find their loved ones,\u201d Bragg said after bring briefed by her colleague in Mandalay.",
      "\u201cI've also seen reports that now some countries are sending search and rescue teams up to Mandalay to support the efforts, but hospitals are really struggling to cope with the influx of injured people, there's a shortage of medical supplies, and people are struggling to find food and clean water,\u201d Bragg added.",
      "The organization was sending a team by road on Sunday to assess peoples' most pressing needs so that it could target its own response.",
      "With the Mandalay airport damaged and the control tower toppled in the capital Naypitaw's airport, all commercial flights into the cities have been shut down.",
      "Still, two Indian C-17 military transport aircraft were able to land late Saturday at Naypitaw with a field hospital unit and some 120 personnel who were then to travel north to Mandalay to establish a 60-bed emergency treatment center, according to the country's Foreign Ministry. Other Indian supplies were flown into Yangon, Myanmar's biggest city, which has been the hub of other foreign relief efforts.",
      "On Sunday, a convoy of 17 Chinese cargo trucks carrying critical shelter and medical supplies was expected to reach Mandalay, after making the arduous journey by road from Yangon.",
      "The 650-kilometer (400-mile) journey has been taking 14 hours or longer, with clogged roads and traffic diverted from the main highway to skirt damage from the earthquake.",
      "At the same time, the window of opportunity to find anyone alive is rapidly closing. Most rescues occur within the first 24 hours after a disaster, and then survival chances drop as each day passes.",
      "An initial report on earthquake relief efforts issued Saturday by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs noted the severe damage or destruction of many health facilities, and warned that a \u201csevere shortage of medical supplies is hampering response efforts, including trauma kits, blood bags, anesthetics, assistive devices, essential medicines, and tents for health workers.\u201d",
      "China said it has sent more than 135 rescue personnel and experts along with supplies like medical kits and generators, and pledged around $13.8 million in emergency aid. Russia\u2019s Emergencies Ministry said it had flown in 120 rescuers and supplies to Yangon, and the country\u2019s Health Ministry said Moscow had sent a medical team to Myanmar.",
      "In neighboring Thailand, the quake rocked much of the county, bringing down a high-rise building under construction in Bangkok, some 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) away from the epicenter.",
      "So far, 10 people have been found dead at the construction site near the popular Chatuchak market, where 83 people are unaccounted for and the latest body was recovered from the rubble early Sunday morning. A total of 17 people have been reported killed by the quake in Thailand so far.",
      "In Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, rescue efforts so far are focused on Mandalay and Naypyitaw, which are thought to have been the hardest hit, but many other areas were also impacted and little is known so far about the damage there.",
      "\u201cWe're hearing reports of hundreds of people trapped in different areas,\u201d said Bragg. \u201cRight now we're at 1,600 (known fatalities) and we don't have a lot of data coming out but you've got to assume it will be increasing in the thousands based on what the impacts are. This is just anecdotal information at this point.\u201d",
      "Beyond the earthquake damage, rescue efforts are complicated by the bloody civil war roiling much of the country, including in quake-affected areas. In 2001, the military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking what has since turned into significant armed resistance.",
      "Government forces have lost control of much of Myanmar, and many places are dangerous or impossible for aid groups to reach. More than 3 million people have been displaced by the fighting and nearly 20 million are in need, according to the United Nations.",
      "The government military has been fighting long-established militias and newly formed pro-democracy People's Defense Forces, and has heavily restricted much-needed aid efforts to the large population already displaced by war even before the earthquake.",
      "On Saturday, Myanmar\u2019s opposition shadow National Unity Government, to which the PDF militias are loyal, announced a unilateral partial ceasefire to facilitate earthquake relief efforts.",
      "The military did not immediately comment on the announcement and it continued airstrikes even after the earthquake.",
      "The Three Brotherhood Alliance, a group of three of Myanmar's most powerful and well-armed militias that launched a combined offensive in October 2023 that broke a strategic stalemate with the military regime, didn't mention a ceasefire in a statement Saturday, but said it was ready to help.",
      "\u201cWe will promptly provide assistance to those affected by the earthquake to the best of our ability, with a spirit of humanity, unit and brotherhood,\u201d the group said.",

It was not clear whether they were already included in the official count of casualties.",
      "Tun Kyi said some 60 mosques were damaged or destroyed when the earthquake struck, and videos posted on The Irrawaddy online news site showed several mosques toppling during the quake, and people fleeing from the areas.",
      "The true number of people killed and injured across the regions hit is thought to be possibly many times the official figures, but with telecommunication outages and extreme challenges to movement around the country, little is known about the damage in many areas.",

      "TOKYO -- U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called Japan on Sunday an \"indispensable partner\" in deterring growing Chinese assertiveness in the region and announced upgrading the U.S. military command in Japan to a new \"war-fighting headquarters.\"",
      "Hegseth, who is on his first Asia trip with Japan as his second stop, also stressed the need for both countries to do more to accelerate the strengthening of their military capability as the region faces China\u2019s assertive military actions and a possible Taiwan emergency.",
      "\u201cJapan is our indispensable partner in deterring Communist Chinese military aggression,\u201d Hegseth said at the beginning of his talks with Japan\u2019s Defense Minister Gen Nakatani in Tokyo. \"The US is moving fast, as you know, to reestablish deterrence in this region and around the world.\"",
      "His comments come as an assurance at a time when Japan has been worried about how U.S. engagement in the region may change under President Donald Trump's \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy, Japanese defense officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity, citing protocol. Trump has also threatened to impose trade tariffs on Japan, a key U.S. ally, sparking more concern.",
      "The two sides agreed to accelerate plans to jointly develop and produce missiles such as Advanced Medium-Range Air to Air Missiles, or MRAAM, and consider producing SM-6 surface-to-air missiles, to help ease a shortage of munitions, Nakatani said. The ministers also agreed to speed up the process involving the maintenance of U.S. warships and warplanes in Japan to strengthen and complement Japanese and U.S. defense industries.",
      "Japan and the U.S. decided in July to upgrade the command and control of the Japanese military as well as U.S. forces in the East Asian country, under the Biden administration, a major structural change aimed at bolstering joint operational and response capabilities. Japan is home to more than 50,000 U.S. troops.",
      "Tokyo last week launched the Japan Joint Operations Command, or JJOC, whose mission is to coordinate Japanese Ground, Maritime and Air Self-Defense Forces, in a significant action to further strengthen capabilities to respond to contingencies and better cooperate with the U.S.",

      "Relief efforts from Friday\u2019s devastating 7.7 magnitude earthquake will be especially complicated with the country in embroiled in civil war, which began after the army seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021.",
      "The main resistance movement against military rule has issued a statement saying it is unilaterally initiating a two-week ceasefire beginning Sunday in areas of the country affected by the quake.",
      "There was no immediate reaction from the military government, which even before the earthquake \u2014 in addition to employing massive repression and state violence \u2014 heavily restricted much-needed aid to the more than 3 million people displaced by war.",
      "The army\u2019s ability to facilitate or block food and other assistance has been described as a way of weaponizing aid. Critics of the military government have called repeatedly for outside assistance to be delivered directly to areas under control of the resistance.",
      "The military, which has directly or indirectly ruled Myanmar most of the time since independence, seized power from Suu Kyi\u2019s government as it was about to begin a second five-year term. She and leaders of her National League for Democracy party were jailed, and security forces put down pro-democracy demonstrations with deadly force, leading to the growth of armed resistance, and the army in turn escalating its violence.",
      "Despite a massive disadvantage in weaponry and manpower, pro-democracy fighters allied with ethnic minority groups seeking greater autonomy have successfully battled back, and analysts believe they control a much greater share of territory.",
      "The resistance is coordinated by the self-styled National Unity Government, whose claim to legitimacy is that it was formed by elected lawmakers. The NUG, which operates underground, has an armed wing called the People's Defense Force.",
      "The PDF is largely a conglomeration of locally formed defense groups, poorly armed but usually with the advantage of fighting on home ground. Their ethnic allies are much more experienced and have even managed in some cases to manufacture their own weapons.",
      "The National Unity Government said in an announcement Saturday the People\u2019s Defense Force will implement a two-week pause in offensive military operations starting Sunday in earthquake-affected areas, while retaining the right to self-defense.",
      "It said it would collaborate with the U.N. and international NGOs \"to ensure security, transportation, and the establishment of temporary rescue and medical camps,\u201d in the areas it controls. It also offered to provide healthcare professionals loyal to its resistance movement to work with international humanitarian organizations to deliver emergency rescue and medical services in areas under the military\u2019s control if provided with safety guarantees.",
      "The PDF fighters rarely mount large-scale offensives, sticking mainly to defense and ambush-style attacks, so its ceasefire would be largely symbolic. By taking the moral high ground, it gives its supporters a stronger argument to push for the unrestricted distribution of aid.",
      "Although the military government has made the rare gesture of soliciting foreign emergency aid, its critics are skeptical it will deploy it fairly and effectively.",
      "The military\u2019s record is discouraging. For instance, it initially refused to allow in foreign rescue teams or many emergency supplies after Cyclone Nargis in 2008, which resulted in well over 100,000 deaths, and tens of thousands more left unaccounted for. Even after it agree to accept foreign help, it was with severe restrictions.",
      "When Cyclone Mocha ripped into the coast in May 2023, the military's relief efforts were again tardy, and as in 2008, private relief missions were discouraged, as was reporting. Property damage was heavy and while 145 deaths were officially acknowledged, independent accounts put the total over 400.",
      "There are examples in other countries when the effort to rebuild after natural disasters have played a part in helping to restore peace to areas torn by conflict, most notably in Indonesia\u2019s Aceh province after it was devastated by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.",

      "A judge is set to rule on whether Le Pen and her National Rally party embezzled European Parliament funds. She and 24 other party officials are accused of having used money intended for European Union parliamentary aides to instead pay staff who worked for the party between 2004 and 2016, violating the 27-nation bloc\u2019s regulations.",
      "Le Pen, 56, and other co-defendants denied wrongdoing during the nine-week trial that took place in late 2024.",
      "Le Pen\u2019s greatest concern is that she could be declared ineligible to seek public office, if found guilty.",

      "That could prompt another possible headache for the far-right leader. If she appeals, she will automatically be granted a new trial, but it will likely take place in 2026, just months before the presidential election.",
      "Le Pen appears to be anticipating a guilty verdict, telling the panel of three judges: \u201cI feel we didn\u2019t succeed in convincing you.\u201d",
      "During the trial, prosecutors requested a two-year prison sentence for Le Pen and a five-year period of ineligibility. They \u201cwant my political death,\u201d Le Pen then said.",
      "In a key decision on Friday, the Constitutional Council ruled that a period of ineligibility with immediate effect is in line with the French Constitution.",
      "But it also stressed that it\u2019s up to the judges to assess the consequences of imposing such a ban right away and make sure the ruling is \u201cproportionate\u201d and takes into consideration \u201cthe preservation of voters\u2019 freedom.\u201d",
      "The Constitutional Council rendered its ruling in a separate case that has no direct link with Le Pen's.",
      "Yet its conclusions have been scrutinized as they provide legal guidance that judges are likely to take into consideration.",
      "The Constitutional Council also underlined that the court can decide to not impose any period of ineligibility immediately. In that case, the ban would be suspended pending appeal.",
      "For over a decade, Le Pen has worked at making her party more mainstream, dulling its extremist edge to broaden its appeal to voters.",
      "She led the National Rally from 2011 to 2021. She changed its name from the National Front, as part of her efforts to distance it from the period when her father ran it and it carried a heavy stigma of racism and antisemitism.",
      "Now a lawmaker in the National Assembly, the French parliament's powerful lower house, she has already positioned herself as a candidate to succeed President Emmanuel Macron, having twice finished runner-up to him.",
      "In 2022, Macron won with 58.5% of the vote to Le Pen\u2019s 41.5% \u2014 significantly closer than when they first faced off in 2017 and the best score ever of the French far right in a presidential bid.",
      "Ineligibility \u201cwould have the effect of depriving me of being a presidential candidate,\" she pleaded during the trial. \"Behind that, there are 11 million people who voted for the movement I represent. So tomorrow, potentially, millions and millions of French people would see themselves deprived of their candidate in the election.\u201d",
      "Jordan Bardella, 29, succeeded Le Pen in 2021 at the helm of the party. He would likely be her prime minister if she were to become president.",
      "That makes him widely perceived as her natural successor if she were barred from running.",
      "Yet observers say there's no guarantee he would be able to convince as many voters as she does. In recent months, some inside the party have criticized his management as too focused on his personal career.",
      "Since joining the party at age 17, Bardella has risen quickly through the ranks, serving as spokesperson and president of its youth wing, before being appointed vice president and becoming the second-youngest member of the European Parliament in history, in 2019.",

      "The chairperson of an African charity co-founded by Prince Harry has accused him of orchestrating a bullying and harassment campaign to try to force her out",
      "LONDON -- The chairperson of an African charity co-founded by Prince Harry accused the royal on Sunday of orchestrating a bullying and harassment campaign to try to force her out as she pushed back following his abrupt resignation from the organization.",
      "Sophie Chandauka, the Sentebale chair, took several shots at Harry on Sky News in which she described how the prince\u2019s Netflix deal interfered with a scheduled fundraiser and how an incident with his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, became a source of friction.",
      "The Duke of Sussex cited a breakdown in the relationship between board members and Chandauka when he resigned Tuesday as a patron of the charity he co-founded nearly 20 years ago in memory of his late mother, Princess Diana.",
      "Harry and co-founder Prince Seeiso of Lesotho said in a joint statement that they quit \u201cwith heavy hearts\u201d as patrons in support of the trustees in their dispute with Chandauka.",
      "\u201cIt is devastating that the relationship between the charity\u2019s trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation,\u201d the princes said. \u201cIn turn, she sued the charity to remain in this voluntary position, further underscoring the broken relationship.\u201d",
      "Chandauka said she reported Sentebale\u2019s trustees to the Charity Commission in the U.K. and filed papers in a British court to prevent her removal.",
      "She alleged there was misconduct at the charity without naming anyone or offering any details in a statement Tuesday. It said she had tried to blow the whistle on \u201cabuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny and misogynoir,\u201d the latter word referring to a combination of racism and misogyny directed toward Black women.",
      "Chandauka told Sky that Harry\u2019s resignation had caught her blindsided and was \u201can example of harassment and bullying at scale.\u201d She said he also had interfered with her whistleblower complaint.",
      "\u201cSo it\u2019s a cover-up, and the prince is involved,\" she said.",
      "Chandauka said there was a significant drop in donors after Harry and Meghan left official royal duties in January 2020, and eventually settled in California.",
      "The charity, whose name means \u201cdon\u2019t forget me\u201d in the Sesotho language of Lesotho and South Africa, was founded to help youths affected by AIDS in the small mountainous nation and in Botswana. But it is now moving to address youth health, wealth and climate resilience in southern Africa.",
      "The biggest risk to the charity was the \u201ctoxicity of its lead patron\u2019s brand,\" Chandauka told the Financial Times.",
      "In the Sky interview, she said that a polo fundraiser scheduled in Miami last year almost fell apart when Harry asked to bring a camera crew along that was filming him for a Netflix series on the sport.",
      "The cost of the venue skyrocketed when it became a commercial venture and they scrambled to find another host, which Harry arranged through his connections, she said.",
      "Meghan's surprise appearance at the event led to an awkward moment during the trophy presentation after the match, Chandauka said.",
      "In a video clip circulated on social media, Chandauka tried to pose next to the duke as he held the trophy in one hand and had his other wrapped around Meghan. But the duchess appeared to gesture that Chandauka move farther from Harry, forcing her to duck under the silver cup to get into the photo.",
      "\u201cThe international press captured this, and there was a lot of talk about the duchess and the choreography on stage and whether she should have been there and her treatment of me,\" Chandauka said.",
      "She said she rejected Harry's request that she issue a statement in support of Meghan, because \"we cannot be an extension of the Sussexes.\u201d",
      "Sky News said it contacted Harry and Meghan and they declined to offer a formal response. An emailed request by The Associated Press seeking comment from their spokespeople was not immediately returned.",

      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- The usual festive mood of Eid al-Fitr holiday to mark the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan has been subdued in Indonesia this year as people grapple with soaring prices for food, clothing and essential goods.",
      "Consumer spending ahead of the biggest religious holiday for Muslims, which was celebrated on Sunday in Indonesia, has declined compared to the previous year, with a predicted slowdown in cash circulation due to fewer travelers.",
      "Each year in Indonesia, nearly three-quarters of the population of the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority country travel for the annual homecoming known locally as \u201cmudik\u201d that is always welcomed with excitement.",
      "People pour out of major cities to return to villages to celebrate the holiday with prayers, feasts and family gatherings. Flights are overbooked and anxious relatives weighed down with boxes of gifts form long lines at bus and train stations for the journey",
      "But this year the Transportation Ministry said Eid travelers reached 146 million people, a 24% drop from last year\u2019s 194 million travelers.",
      "The Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry projects that money circulation during Eid will reach 137.97 trillion rupiah ($8.33 billion), down from 157.3 trillion last year.

      "Bhima Yudistira, executive director of the Center for Economic and Law Studies, or Celios, said those trends indicate the economy is under strain, driven by economic hardship, coupled with currency depreciation and mass layoffs in manufacturing.",

      "He said the festive spirit has been stifled by harsh economic realities, as soaring prices and dwindling incomes force residents to prioritize survival over celebration.",
      "Traditionally household consumption is a key driver of Indonesia\u2019s GDP. It contributed over 50% to the economy last year, helping push annual growth to 5.11%. However, consumer spending in 2025 is expected to be more subdued, Yudistira said.",
      "Despite the downturn, the government remains optimistic that the Ramadan and Eid momentum will support economic growth in the first quarter of 2025.",
      "\u201cEid usually boosts the economy through increased spending,\u201d Chief Economic Affairs Minister Airlangga Hartarto said ahead of the Islamic holiday.",
      "The government recently introduced incentives to stimulate economic activity, including airfare and toll road fee discounts, nationwide online shopping events, direct cash assistance for 16 million households, electricity bill reductions for low-consumption customers, and tax exemptions for labor-intensive sectors.",
      "\u201cWith these programs in place, the government hopes to sustain consumer spending and support economic stability,\u201d Hartarto said.",
      "The situation has also affected Endang Trisilowati, a mother of four, who said her family had to scale down their festivities budget.",
      "\u201cHonestly, the economic hardship is affecting us,\u201d Trisilowati said. She described how she used to cook different dishes every Eid and invite neighbors, but now she can only afford a simple meal for her family.",
      "\u201cMany have resorted to just finding a way to eat on that festivity, but the spirit is low,\u201d she said.",
      "In India, Muslims are marking the celebration of Eid with special prayers, family gatherings and festive meals.",
      "The holiday comes as the minority community faces vilification by hardline Hindu nationalists. Muslim groups are also protesting against a proposal by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government to change laws governing Muslim land endowments.",
      "The government says it wants to weed out corruption and mismanagement in hundreds of thousands of Muslim land endowments. But Muslim groups say the proposal pending approval in India\u2019s parliament is discriminatory.",
      "Muslims, who comprise 14% of India\u2019s 1.4 billion population, are the largest minority group in the Hindu-majority nation.",

      "The full extent of the damage and possible casualties wasn\u2019t immediately clear. The attacks followed a night of airstrikes early Friday that appeared particularly intense compared to other days in the campaign that began March 15.",
      "The strikes around Sanaa, Yemen's capital held by the Houthis since 2014, also wounded four others, the rebels said. Their al-Masirah satellite news channel aired footage of broken glass littering homes after the concussive blast of the bombs, but continued not to show the targets of the attacks \u2014 suggesting the sites had a military or intelligence function.",
      "An Associated Press review has found the new American operation against the Houthis under President Donald Trump appears more extensive than those under former President Joe Biden, as the U.S. moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel as well as dropping bombs in cities.",
      "The new campaign of airstrikes, which the Houthis now say have killed at least 59 people, started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting \u201cIsraeli\u201d ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels in the past loosely defined what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning other vessels could be targeted.",
      "The Houthis had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships, though none has been hit so far.",
      "The attacks greatly raised the Houthis\u2019 profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen\u2019s decadelong stalemated war that has torn apart the Arab world\u2019s poorest nation.",

      "For four weeks, Israel has shut off all sources of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies for the Gaza Strip\u2019s population of more than 2 million Palestinians. It\u2019s the longest blockade yet of Israel\u2019s 17-month-old campaign against Hamas, with no sign of it ending. Many are going hungry during the normally festive Eid al-Fitr, a major Muslim holiday.",

It has hit humanitarian facilities, the U.N. says. New evacuation orders have forced more than 140,000 Palestinians to move yet again.",
      "But Israel has not resumed the system for aid groups to notify the military of their movements to ensure they were not hit by bombardment, multiple aid workers said.

      "But nothing has entered Gaza since Israel cut off that flow on March 2. Israel says the siege and renewed military campaign aim to force Hamas to accept changes in their agreed-on ceasefire deal and release more hostages.",
      "Fresh produce is now rare in Gaza\u2019s markets. Meat, chicken, potatoes, yogurt, eggs and fruits are completely gone, Palestinians say.",
      "Prices for everything else have skyrocketed out of reach for many Palestinians. A kilo (2 pounds) of onions can cost the equivalent of $14, a kilo of tomatoes goes for $6, if they can be found. Cooking gas prices have spiraled as much as 30-fold, so families are back to scrounging for wood to make fires.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s totally insane,\u201d said Abeer al-Aker, a teacher and mother of three in Gaza City. \u201cNo food, no services. \u2026 I believe that the famine has started again. \u201d",
      "At the distribution center in Jabaliya, Rema Megat sorted through the food ration box for her family of 10: rice, lentils, a few cans of sardines, a half kilo of sugar, two packets of powdered milk.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to last a month,\u201d she said. \u201cThis kilo of rice will be used up in one go.\u201d",
      "The U.N. has cut its distribution of food rations in half to redirect more supplies to bakeries and free kitchens producing prepared meals, said Olga Cherevko, spokesperson for the U.N. humanitarian agency, known as OCHA.",
      "The number of prepared meals has grown 25% to 940,000 meals a day, she said, and bakeries are churning out more bread. But that burns through supplies faster.",
      "Once flour runs out soon, \u201cthere will be no bread production happening in a large part of Gaza,\u201d said Gavin Kelleher, with the Norwegian Refugee Council.",
      "UNRWA, the main U.N. agency for Palestinians, only has a few thousand food parcels left and enough flour for a few days, said Sam Rose, the agency's acting director in Gaza.",

      "He gave no indication of whether the siege could be lifted but said Gaza had enough supplies, pointing to the aid that flowed in during the ceasefire.",
      "Because its teams can\u2019t coordinate movements with the military, Save the Children suspended programs providing nutrition to malnourished children, said Rachael Cummings, the group\u2019s humanitarian response leader in Gaza.",
      "\u201cWe are expecting an increase in the rate of malnutrition,\u201d she said. \u201cNot only children \u2014 adolescent girls, pregnant women.\u201d",

      "Pope Francis\u2019 frailty was on full view as he left Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital after five weeks battling pneumonia that nearly killed him",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis\u2019 frailty was on full view as he left Rome\u2019s Gemelli hospital last Sunday after five weeks battling pneumonia that nearly killed him. He could barely lift his arms to bless the crowd. His eyes were sunken, face bloated. And he visibly gasped for breath as he was wheeled back inside from the balcony.",
      "Throughout history, the powerful have concealed their weaknesses. Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, the most photographed figure of his era, took pains to hide his lame arm. Franklin Delano Roosevelt concealed the use of a wheelchair. More recently, former President Biden shook off concerns about his cognitive abilities.",
      "By contrast, Francis, a spiritual and not political leader, has never been shy about showing his weakness. For many, his willingness to be seen in all his infirmity serves as an example to young and old alike that fragility is part of the human condition \u2014 and should be embraced.",
      "\u201cWho cares if he had sunken eyes, who cares if he looks bloated. It is part of his life story. He knows it is going to end. I saw him as living his life. He wants to keep doing what he does best,\u2019\u2019 said S. Jay Olshansky, a gerontologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago.",
      "Francis\u2019 frailty is integral to his ministry of inclusion, which preaches against treating people on the margins as disposable, said Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia, president of the Pontifical Council for Life.",
      "\u201cFragility for us believers is not to be avoided or excluded. On the contrary it is a great teaching,\u2019\u2019 Paglia said in an interview. \u201cIt is in sharp contrast with an efficiency-oriented culture, with a performance culture.''",
      "\u201cThis is not a state, or a company, it is a community of the faithful, a family. And in a family it is possible to give an authoratative leadership, also if not up to full physical strength,'' Paglia said. He added that it was an important lesson also for young people \u201cwho should understand that they too are fragile, otherwise they close themselves off.\u2019\u2019",
      "Paglia this week opened a longevity summit at the Vatican, during which he underlined that as the population of elderly grows, there must be an attitude shift so that the longer life span is to be lived to its fullest.",
      "\u201cWe need to rethink the idea of retirement. These 20, 30 years more must have also a cultural, human and spiritual weight for all the other ages. They are not disposable,\u2019\u2019 he said.",
      "Dr. Francesco Vaia, an advocate of rights for the disabled, also said the pope\u2019s message is especially crucial in an aging world.",
      "\u201cThe theme is not only to get older, but to be active, that is to give more quality to our longer lives,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWe are moving towards an inclusive society,\u2019\u2019 which is in contrast with a \"throw-away world in which the weak, the disabled, the elderly are pushed aside.''",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s overcome the superman and superwoman theory. We are men and women with our fragility, and disabilities,\u2019\u2019 Vaia said. \"This pope can continue being pope.",
      "Even the fact of seeing Francis with the nasal breathing tubes as he was driven to the Vatican normalizes a fact of life for many elderly who live with oxygen tanks. \u201cWe should not be ashamed of this,\u2019\u2019 Vaia said.",
      "Pope John Paul II, too, was often praised for showing his suffering during his long bout with Parkinson\u2019s disease. But the Vatican also went to great lengths to conceal his frailty. He was never seen in a wheelchair, for example, instead he was pushed on a rolling wooden chair or upon a moving platform.",
      "Francis by contrast arrives at events in wheelchairs, and is seen lifted into a more formal seat for Masses or to address the faithful.",
      "He did not shy away from showing his weakened state from the hospital. An audio recording of his barely audible, labored voice was played in St. Peter\u2019s Square three weeks into his hospitalization as a first sign of life. It was followed by a photograph of him co-celebrating Mass, taken from behind in his personal hospital chapel.",
      "While Francis\u2019 appearance on the hospital balcony did not necessarily project vitality, the doctor who coordinated his hospital treatment saw it as a sign of his strength.",
      "\u201cYou saw when he looked out, he is fragile. But his strength is that he could give, even with some difficulty, the blessing,\u2019\u2019 Dr. Sergio Alfieri said. \u201cHe looked at the square, and he welcomed the lady with the yellow flowers, as if to say, \u2018I am maintaining a good mood.\u2019 He is strong in this sense, a strong spirit.\"",

      "Russia has effectively rejected a U.S. proposal for an immediate and full 30-day halt in the fighting, and the feasibility of a partial ceasefire on the Black Sea was thrown into doubt after Kremlin negotiators imposed far-reaching conditions.",

      "South Africa is unleashing weevils imported from the United States in a bid to fight off the sprouting growth of Salvinia minima, an alien species of aquatic plant native to South America that is choking up dams and rivers",
      "HARTBEESPOORT, South Africa -- Dozens of tiny black weevils cling onto a fern plant as it is tossed onto a leafy green mat coating the surface of South Africa's Crocodile River.",
      "Those weevils aren't tossed into the river by accident: scientists hope that the insects and their larvae will munch their way through the green mat, which is made up of an unwanted, invasive South American aquatic plant called Salvinia minima.",
      "The plant is steadily taking over freshwater bodies in the northern region of South Africa, suffocating aquatic life, including on the Crocodile River and the Hartbeespoort Dam it flows into.",
      "The weevils, which have been used effectively elsewhere in the world to fight water weeds, are now leading South Africa\u2019s charge against the life-sucking plants threatening ecosystems in at least three northern provinces and creeping into neighboring countries.",
      "After the weevils helped control the spread of salvinia in parts of the United States, scientists from both countries worked together on a project to gather a starter population in South Africa.",
      "The 1-millimeter-long (0.03 inches) insects were brought over 8,700 miles from Louisiana. Rearing stations are being set up near several dams to grow the weevil population.",
      "Once released at an infested site, the beetles make themselves at home on the salvinia, the only thing they eat, without damaging the local ecosystem, scientists say.",
      "\u201cThey lay eggs on this plant, feed on this plant and die on this plant. If this plant dies, they will die as well,\u201d said professor Julie Coetzee, the principal scientist at the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity. \u201cThey damage certain tissues, those tissues become waterlogged and then those plants sink to the bottom.\u201d",
      "Hartbeespoort Dam north of Johannesburg, the location for the pilot project, is an important source of irrigation for nearby farms and a popular recreation site.",
      "\u201cWhen we bought the property there was this beautiful little floating plant on the dam and I thought well that\u2019s quite nice,\u201d said 53-year-old resident and business operator Max Moller. \u201cLittle did I realize this little floating fern was an absolute menace.\u201d",
      "Moller, the owner of Mogi\u2019s hiking trail, said the salvinia have clogged up and damaged boat engines and also hurt fishing communities over the nine years that he has lived in the area.",
      "South Africa\u2019s already vulnerable freshwater systems face a significant threat from salvinia, scientists say. The plants have had two major growth spurts in 2021 and 2022, surviving on the high nitrate contents in the water.",
      "The plant initially surfaced more than a decade ago at the dam, which has also long been battling with a water hyacinth invasion, another problematic species.",
      "\u201cIf you pull the hyacinth away, this plant is lurking,\u201d said Coetzee. The invasive plants block out the sunlight, which means no oxygen in the water, she said.",
      "\"If there is no oxygen, there\u2019s no fish, there\u2019s no crab, there\u2019s no insects and so you completely destroy or alter the aquatic ecosystem,\u201d she said.",
      "Salvinia has a rapid growth rate and its spread has been most notable across Gauteng province, where South Africa's biggest city of Johannesburg and its capital, Pretoria, are located. The plant is compounding existing water supply problems by depleting the oxygen and sapping the supply in a country that's already struggling with increasing demand and deteriorating water infrastructure.",
      "While releasing the weevils will help combat salvinia, experts warn that there could be unintended side-effects.",
      "Anthony Turton, a water expert and researcher at South Africa\u2019s University of the Free State, cautioned that their introduction could turn rivers and dams into more suitable homes for bacteria and dangerous organisms.",
      "That includes poisonous blue-green algae, known as cyanobacteria, which flourish in nutrient-rich, contaminated waterways and already affect almost 60% of the nation\u2019s dams.",
      "\u201cWith more light and less competition for nutrients, those cyanobacteria will go into a condition known as a bloom,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is exponential population growth that radically populates the entire water column.\u201d",

      "\u201cUnless there are efforts to reduce the inflow of nutrients from sewage flows, then we are only creating space for cyanobacteria to grow without competition from floating weeds,\u201d he said.",
      "The weevils aren't the first insects to be introduced to curb an invasive threat in South Africa. The country brought in a bug in the 1930s to control the spread of a hardy cactus native to Mexico that was hurting ecosystems. That project was viewed as a success.",

      "Coetzee said that salvinia was popping up on the confluence of the Crocodile and Limpopo rivers in the far north of South Africa.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean police plan to question a 56-year-old man on suspicion of starting at least one of the wildfires that recently devastated the country\u2019s southern regions, killing 30 people and burning more than 119,000 acres of land.",
      "The North Gyeongsang provincial police department said the unidentified man may have used fire while clearing overgrown grass at a family grave on a hill in the southeastern town of Uiseong, one of the areas hardest hit by the wildfires.",
      "Police investigators examined the grave site on Monday morning and plan to question the man soon. The police department did not immediately say whether others would also be questioned over suspected links to the wildfires, which fire officials believe may have been sparked by multiple human errors, also including burning trash and sparks from welding work.",
      "Fueled by dry and windy conditions, the wildfires raged for a week, destroying thousands of homes, and leaving mountains covered in ash, before firefighters, aided by rain, brought them under control on Friday.",
      "The 30 people killed were mostly in their 60s or older. They include a pilot whose helicopter crashed during firefighting efforts and four firefighters and other workers who died earlier after being trapped by fast-moving flames. At least 45 people were injured, including nine seriously.",
      "The fires damaged or destroyed more than 6,000 structures, including over 1,000 homes each in the southeastern city of Andong and the nearby coastal town of Yeongdeok, as well as more than 330 homes in Uiseong.",
      "The fires in Uiseong damaged about 20 of the 30 structures at the Gounsa temple complex, said to have been originally built in the 7th century. Among them were two state-designated \u201ctreasures\u201d: a pavilion overlooking a stream that dates to 1668, and a Joseon dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king.",

      "French media said that the letter received by major French companies was signed by an officer of the U.S. State Department who is on the staff at the U.S. Embassy in Paris. The embassy didn't respond to questions this weekend from The Associated Press.",
      "Le Figaro daily newspaper published what it said was a copy of the letter.

    "story": [
      "There is plenty of nostalgia at Black Mountain, New Hampshire's oldest ski area",
      "JACKSON, N.H. -- A skier since age 4, Thomas Brennick now enjoys regular trips to New Hampshire\u2019s Black Mountain with his two grandchildren.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s back to the old days,\u201d he said from the Summit Double chairlift on a recent sunny Friday. \u201cIt's just good, old-time skiing at its best.\u201d",
      "Behind the scenes, the experience is now propelled by a high-tech system designed to increase efficiency at the state\u2019s oldest ski area. And while small, independent resorts can\u2019t compete on infrastructure or buying power with conglomerates like Vail, which owns nearby Attitash Mountain Resort and seven others in the Northeast alone, at least one entrepreneur is betting technology will be \u201ca really great equalizer.\u201d",
      "That businessman is Erik Mogensen, who bought Black Mountain last year and turned it into a lab for his ski mountain consultancy, Entabeni Systems. The company builds systems that put lift tickets sales, lesson reservations and equipment rentals online while collecting detailed data to inform decisions such as where to make more snow and how much.",
      "\u201cA lot of general managers will go out and look at how many rows of cars are parked, and that\u2019s kind of how they tell how busy they are,\u201d Mogensen said. \u201cWe really want to look at that transactional data down to the deepest level.\u201d",
      "That includes analyzing everything from the most popular time to sell hot dogs in the lodge to how many runs a season pass holder makes per visit.",
      "\u201cThe large operators, they can do a lot of things at scale that we can\u2019t. They can buy 20 snow cats at a time, 10 chairlifts, those types of things. We can\u2019t do that, but we\u2019re really nimble,\u201d Mogensen said. \u201cWe can decide to change the way we groom very quickly, or change the way we open trails, or change our (food and beverage) menu in the middle of a day.\u201d",
      "Mogensen, who says his happiest moments are tied to skiing, started Entabeni Systems in 2015, driven by the desire to keep the sport accessible. In 2023, he bought the company Indy Pass, which allows buyers to ski for two days each at 230 independent ski areas, including Black Mountain. It's an alternative to the Epic and Ikon multi-resort passes offered by the Vail and Alterra conglomerates.",
      "Black Mountain was an early participant in Indy Pass. When Mogensen learned it was in danger of closing, he was reminded of his hometown's long-gone ski area. He bought Black Mountain aiming to ultimately transform it into a cooperative.",
      "Many Indy Pass resorts also are clients of Entabeni Systems, including Utah's Beaver Mountain, which bills itself as the longest continuously-run family owned mountain resort in the U.S.",
      "Kristy Seeholzer, whose husband\u2019s grandfather founded Beaver Mountain, said Entabeni streamlined its ticketing and season pass system. That led to new, lower-priced passes for those willing to forgo skiing during holiday weeks or weekends, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of our season pass holders were self-limiting anyway. They only want to ski weekdays because they don\u2019t want to deal with weekends,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could never have kept track of that manually.\"",
      "Though she is pleased overall, Seeholzer said the software can be challenging and slow.",
      "\u201cThere are some really great programs out there, like on the retail side of things or the sales side of things. And one of the things that was a little frustrating was it felt like we were reinventing the wheel,\u201d she said.",
      "Sam Shirley, 25, grew up skiing in New Hampshire and worked as a ski instructor and ski school director in Maine while attending college. But he said increasing technology has drastically changed the way he skis, pushing him to switch mostly to cross-country.",
      "\u201cAs a customer, it\u2019s made things more complicated,\u201d he said. \"It just becomes an extra hassle.\u201d",
      "Shirley used to enjoy spur-of-the-moment trips around New England, but has been put off by ski areas reserving lower rates for those who buy tickets ahead. He doesn\u2019t like having to provide detailed contact information, sometimes even a photograph, just to get a lift ticket.",
      "It's not just independent ski areas that are focused on technology and data. Many others are using lift tickets and passes embedded with radio frequency identification chips that track skiers' movements.",
      "Vail resorts pings cell phones to better understand how lift lines are forming, which informs staffing decisions, said John Plack, director of communications. Lift wait times have decreased each year for the past three years, with 97% under 10 minutes this year, he said.",
      "\u201cOur company is a wildly data-driven company. We know a lot about our guest set. We know their tastes. We know what they like to ski, we know when they like to ski. And we\u2019re able to use that data to really improve the guest experience,\u201d he said.",
      "That improvement comes at a cost. A one-day lift ticket at Vail's Keystone Resort in Colorado sold for $292 last week. A season pass cost $418, a potentially good deal for diehard skiers, but also a reliable revenue stream guaranteeing Vail a certain amount of income even as ski areas face less snow and shorter winters.",
      "The revenue from such passes, especially the multi-resort Epic Pass, allowed the company to invest $100 million in snowmaking, Plack said.",
      "\u201cBy committing to the season ahead of time, that gives us certainty and allows us to reinvest in our resorts,\" he said.",
      "Mogensen insists bigger isn\u2019t always better, however. Lift tickets at Black Mountain cost $59 to $99 per day and a season's pass is about $450.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t just come skiing to turn left and right. You come skiing because of the way the hot chocolate tastes and the way the fire pit smells and what spring skiing is and what the beer tastes like and who you\u2019re around,\u201d he said. \u201cSkiing doesn\u2019t have to be a luxury good. It can be a community center.\u201d",
      "Brennick, the Black Mountain lift rider who was skiing with his grandchildren, said he has noticed a difference since the ski area was sold.",
      "\u201cI can see the change,\u201d he said. \u201cThey're making a lot of snow and it shows.\u201d",

      "Mexico says a government-sponsored junk food ban in schools has taken effect as the country tries to tackle one of the world\u2019s worst obesity and diabetes epidemics",
      "MEXICO CITY -- A government-sponsored junk food ban in schools across Mexico took effect on Saturday, officials said, as the country tries to tackle one of the world\u2019s worst obesity and diabetes epidemics.",
      "The health guidelines, first published last fall, take a direct shot at salty and sweet processed products that have become a staple for generations of Mexican schoolchildren, such as sugary fruit drinks, packaged chips, artificial pork rinds and soy-encased, chili-flavored peanuts.",
      "Announcing that the ban had become law, Mexico's Education Ministry posted on X: \u201cFarewell, junk food!\u201d It encouraged parents to support the government's crusade by cooking healthy meals for their kids.",
      "\u201cOne of the core principles of the new Mexican school system is healthy living,\" said Mario Delgado, the public health secretary. \u201cThere's a high level of acceptance of this policy among parents.\u201d",
      "Mexico's ambitious attempt to remake its food culture and reprogram the next generation of consumers is being watched closely around the world as governments struggle to turn the tide on a global obesity epidemic.",
      "In the United States, for instance, the Trump administration\u2019s health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has vowed to upend the nation's food system and \u201c Make America Healthy Again \" by targeting ultra-processed foods to curb surging obesity and disease.",
      "Under Mexico's new order, schools must phase out any food and beverage displaying even one black warning logo marking it as high in salt, sugar, calories and fat. Mexico implemented that compulsory front-of-package labeling system in 2020.",
      "Enforced from Monday morning, the start of the school week, the junk food ban also requires schools to serve more nutritious alternatives to junk food, like bean tacos, and offer plain drinking water.",
      "\u201cIt is much better to eat a bean taco than a bag of potato chips,\u201d said Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has championed the ban.",
      "Mexico\u2019s children consume more junk food than anywhere else in Latin America, according to UNICEF, which classifies the nation\u2019s childhood obesity epidemic as an emergency. Sugary drinks and highly processed foods account for 40% of the total calories that children consume in a day, the agency reports.",
      "\u201cAt my daughter's school, they told us that future activities wouldn't have candy, it would be completely different, with fruit, vegetables and other food that's healthy for kids,\u201d said Aurora Mart\u00ednez, a mother of two. \u201cIt will help us a lot.\u201d",
      "One-third of Mexican children are already considered overweight or obese, according to government statistics.",
      "School administrators found in violation of the order face stiff fines, ranging from $545 to $5,450.",
      "But enforcement poses a challenge in a country where previous junk food bans have struggled to gain traction and monitoring has been lax across Mexico\u2019s 255,000 schools, many of which lack water fountains \u2014 even reliable internet and electricity.",
      "It also wasn't immediately clear how the government would forbid the sale of junk food on sidewalks outside school campuses, where street vendors typically hawk candy, chips, nachos and ice cream to kids during recess and after the school day ends.",
      "\u201cIt will be difficult,\u201d said Abril Geraldine Rose de Le\u00f3n, a child therapist. \u201cBut it will be achieved in the long run.\u201d",

      "The protesters were trying to escalate a movement targeting Tesla dealerships and vehicles in opposition to Musk\u2019s role as the head of the newly created Department of of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he has gained access to sensitive data and shuttered entire agencies as he attempts to slash government spending. The biggest portion of Musk\u2019s estimated $340 billion fortune consists of his stock in the electric vehicle company, which continues to run while also working alongside Trump.",
      "After earlier demonstrations that were somewhat sporadic, Saturday marked the first attempt to surround all 277 of the automaker\u2019s showrooms and service centers in the U.S. in hopes of deepening a recent decline in the company\u2019s sales.",
      "By early afternoon crowds ranging from a few dozen to hundreds of protesters had flocked to Tesla locations in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Maryland, Minnesota and the automaker's home state of Texas.

      "\u201cWe're living in a fascist state,\u201d said Dennis Fagaly, a retired high school teacher from neighboring Oakland, \u201cand we need to stop this or we'll lose our whole country and everything that is good about the United States.\u201d",
      "The Tesla Takedown movement also hoped to rally protesters at more than 230 locations in other parts of the world. Although the turnouts in Europe were not as large, the anti-Musk sentiment was similar.",
      "About two dozen people held signs lambasting the billionaire outside a dealership in London as passing cars and trucks tooted horns in support.",
      "One sign displayed depicted Musk next to an image of Adolf Hitler making the Nazi salute \u2014 a gesture that Musk has been accused of reprising shortly after Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. A person in a Tyrannosaurus rex costume held another sign with a picture of Musk's straight-arm gesture that said, \u201cYou thought the Nazis were extinct. Don\u2019t buy a Swasticar.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe just want to get loud, make noise, make people aware of the problems that we\u2019re facing,\u201d said Cam Whitten, an American who showed up at the London protest.",
      "Tesla Takedown was organized by a group of supporters that included disillusioned owners of the automaker\u2019s vehicles, celebrities such as actor John Cusack, and at least one Democratic Party lawmaker, Rep. Jasmine Crockett from Dallas.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to keep screaming in the halls of Congress. I just need you all to make sure you all keep screaming in the streets,\u201d Crockett said during an organizing call this month.",
      "Another Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Pramila Jaypal, showed up at a protest in Seattle, which she represents in Congress.",
      "Some people have gone beyond protest, setting Tesla vehicles on fire or committing other acts of vandalism that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has decried as domestic terrorism. In a March 20 company meeting, Musk indicated that he was dumbfounded by the attacks and said the vandals should \u201cstop acting psycho.\u201d",
      "Crockett and other Tesla Takedown supporters have been stressing the importance of Saturday\u2019s protests remaining peaceful.",
      "But police were investigating a fire that destroyed seven Teslas in northwestern Germany in the early morning. It was not immediately clear if the blaze, which was extinguished by firefighters, was related to the protests.",
      "In Watertown, Massachusetts, local police reported that the side mirror of a black pickup struck two people at a protest outside a Tesla service center, according to the Boston Herald. The suspect was promptly identified by police at the scene, who said there were no serious injuries.",
      "A growing number of consumers who bought Tesla vehicles before Musk took over DOGE have been looking to sell or trade them in, while others have slapped on bumper stickers seeking to distance themselves from him.",
      "But Musk did not appear concerned about an extended slump in new sales in the March meeting, during which he reassured the workers that the company\u2019s Model Y would remain \u201cthe best-selling car on Earth again this year.\u201d He also predicted that Tesla will have sold more than 10 million cars worldwide by next year, up from about 7 million currently.",
      "\u201cThere are times when there are rocky moments, where there is stormy weather, but what I am here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting,\u201d Musk said.",
      "After Trump was elected last November, investors initially saw Musk\u2019s alliance with the president as a positive development for Tesla and its long-running efforts to launch a network of self-driving cars.",
      "That optimism helped lift Tesla\u2019s stock by 70% between the election and Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, creating an additional $560 billion in shareholder wealth. But virtually all those gains have evaporated amid investor worries about the backlash, lagging sales in the U.S., Europe and China, and Musk spending time overseeing DOGE.",
      "\u201cThis continues to be a moment of truth for Musk to navigate this brand tornado crisis moment and get onto the other side of this dark chapter for Tesla,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a recent research note.",

      "The protests started after a concrete canopy collapsed in November at a train station in northern Serbia, killing 16 people. The tragedy drew focus on rampant government corruption, triggering demands for accountability and political changes.",
      "Protests have put pressure on an increasingly authoritarian Vucic, who is formally seeking European Union membership for Serbia but maintains close relations with Russia and China.",
      "Vucic has promised a \u201ccounterrevolution\u201d against the protests. Authorities have threatened legal action against university professors, including calls for the arrest of Vladan Djokic, the head dean at Belgrade University.",

      "Around the world, plastics are finding their way into farm fields",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- In Uganda's Mbale district, famous for its production of arabica coffee, a plague of plastic bags locally known as buveera is creeping beyond the city.",
      "It's a problem that has long littered the landscape in Kampala, the capital, where buveera are woven into the fabric of daily life. They show up in layers of excavated dirt roads and clog waterways. But now, they can be found in remote areas of farmland, too. Some of the debris includes the thick plastic bags used for planting coffee seeds in nurseries.",
      "Some farmers are complaining, said Wilson Watira, head of a cultural board for the coffee-growing Bamasaba people. \u201cThey are concerned \u2013 those farmers who know the effects of buveera on the land,\u201d he said.",
      "Around the world, plastics find their way into farm fields. Climate change makes agricultural plastic, already a necessity for many crops, even more unavoidable for some farmers. Meanwhile, research continues to show that itty-bitty microplastics alter ecosystems and end up in human bodies. Scientists, farmers and consumers all worry about how that's affecting human health, and many seek solutions. But industry experts say it\u2019s difficult to know where plastic ends up or get rid of it completely, even with the best intentions of reuse and recycling programs.",
      "According to a 2021 report on plastics in agriculture by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, soils are one of the main receptors of agricultural plastics. Some studies have estimated that soils are more polluted by microplastics than the oceans.",
      "\u201cThese things are being released at such a huge, huge scale that it\u2019s going to require major engineering solutions,\u201d said Sarah Zack, an Illinois-Indiana Sea Grant Great Lakes Contaminant Specialist who communicates about microplastics to the public.",
      "Micro-particles of plastic that come from items like clothes, medications and beauty products sometimes appear in fertilizer made from the solid byproducts of wastewater treatment \u2014 called biosolids \u2014 which can also be smelly and toxic to nearby residents depending on the treatment process used. Some seeds are coated in plastic polymers designed to strategically disintegrate at the right time of the season, used in containers to hold pesticides or stretched over fields to lock in moisture.",
      "But the agriculture industry itself only accounts for a little over 3% of all plastics used globally. About 40% of all plastics are used in packaging, including single-use plastic food and beverage containers.",
      "Microplastics, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration defines as being smaller than five millimeters long, are their largest at about the size of a pencil eraser. Some are much smaller.",
      "Studies have already shown that microplastics can be taken up by plants on land or plankton in the ocean and subsequently eaten by animals or humans. Scientists are still studying the long-term effects of the plastic that's been found in human organs. Early findings suggest possible links to a host of health conditions including heart disease and some cancers.",
      "Despite \u201csignificant research gaps,\u201d the evidence related to the land-based food chain \u201cis certainly raising alarm,\u201d said Lev Neretin, environment lead at the FAO, which is currently working on another technical report looking deeper into the problem of microplastic pollution in soils and crops.",
      "A study out this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that microplastics pollution can even impact plants' ability to photosynthesize, the process of turning light from the sun into energy. That doesn't \u201cjustify excessive concern\u201d but does \u201cunderscore food security risks that necessitate scientific attention,\u201d wrote Fei Dang, one of the study's authors.",
      "The use of plastics has quadrupled over the past 30 years. Plastic is ubiquitous. And most of the world's plastic goes to landfills, pollutes the environment or is burned. Less than 10% of plastics are recycled.",
      "At the same time, some farmers are becoming more reliant on plastics to shelter crops from the effects of extreme weather. They're using tarps, hoop houses and other technology to try to control conditions for their crops. And they're depending more on chemicals like pesticides and fertilizers to buffer against unreliable weather and more pervasive pest issues.",
      "\u201cThrough global warming, we have less and less arable land to make crops on. But we need more crops. So therefore the demand on agricultural chemicals is increasing,\u201d said Ole Rosgaard, president and CEO of Greif, a company that makes packaging used for industrial agriculture products like pesticides and other chemicals.",
      "Extreme weather, fueled by climate change, also contributes to the breakdown and transport of agricultural plastics. Beating sun can wear on materials over time. And more frequent and intense rainfall events in some areas could drive more plastic particles running into fields and eventually waterways, said Maryam Salehi, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Missouri.",
      "This past winter, leaders from around the world gathered in South Korea to produce the first legally binding global treaty on plastics pollution. They didn't reach an agreement, but the negotiations are scheduled to resume in August.",
      "Neretin said the FAO produced a provisional, voluntary code of conduct on sustainable management of plastics in agriculture. But without a formal treaty in place, most countries don't have a strong incentive to follow it.",
      "\u201cThe mood is certainly not cheery, that's for sure,\u201d he said, adding global cooperation \u201ctakes time, but the problem does not disappear.\u201d",
      "Without political will, much of the onus falls on companies.",
      "Rosgaard, of Greif, said that his company has worked to make their products recyclable, and that farmers have incentives to return them because they can get paid in exchange. But he added it's sometimes hard to prevent people from just burning the plastic or letting it end up in fields or waterways.",
      "\u201cWe just don\u2019t know where they end up all the time,\u201d he said.",
      "Some want to stop the flow of plastic and microplastic waste into ecosystems. Boluwatife Olubusoye, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Mississippi, is trying to see whether biochar, remains of organic matter and plant waste burned under controlled conditions, can filter out microplastics that run from farm fields into waterways. His early experiments have shown promise.",
      "He said he was motivated by the feeling that there was \u201cnever any timely solution in terms of plastic waste\" ending up in fields in the first place, especially in developing countries.",
      "Even for farmers who care about plastics in soils, it can be challenging for them to do anything about it. In Uganda, owners of nursery beds cannot afford proper seedling trays, so they resort to cheaply made plastic bags used to germinate seeds, said Jacob Ogola, an independent agronomist there.",
      "Farmers hardest hit by climate change are least able to reduce the presence of cheap plastic waste in soils. That frustrates Innocent Piloya, an agroecology entrepreneur who grows coffee in rural Uganda with her company Ribbo Coffee.",

      "U.S. states are positioning themselves to compete for newer, cheaper nuclear reactors being developed as communities and tech giants compete in a race for electricity",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- With the promise of newer, cheaper nuclear power on the horizon, U.S. states are vying to position themselves to build and supply the industry's next generation as policymakers consider expanding subsidies and paving over regulatory obstacles.",
      "Advanced reactor designs from competing firms are filling up the federal government's regulatory pipeline as the industry touts them as a reliable, climate-friendly way to meet electricity demands from tech giants desperate to power their fast-growing artificial intelligence platforms.",
      "The reactors could be operational as early as 2030, giving states a short runway to roll out the red carpet, and they face lingering public skepticism about safety and growing competition from renewables like wind and solar. Still, the reactors have high-level federal support, and utilities across the U.S. are working to incorporate the energy source into their portfolios.",
      "Last year, 25 states passed legislation to support advanced nuclear energy and this year lawmakers have introduced over 200 bills supportive of nuclear energy, said Marc Nichol of the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade association whose members include power plant owners, universities and labor unions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen states taking action at ever-increasing levels for the past few years now,\u201d Nichol said in an interview.",
      "Smaller reactors are, in theory, faster to build and easier to site than conventional reactors. They could be factory-built from standard parts and are touted as flexible enough to plunk down for a single customer, like a data center or an industrial complex.",
      "Advanced reactors, called small modular reactors and microreactors, produce a fraction of the energy produced by the conventional nuclear reactors built around the world for the last 50 years. Where conventional reactors produce 800 to 1,000 megawatts, or enough to power about half a million homes, modular reactors produce 300 megawatts or less and microreactors produce no more than 20 megawatts.",
      "Tech giants Amazon and Google are investing in nuclear reactors to get the power they need, as states compete with Big Tech, and each other, in a race for electricity.",
      "For some state officials, nuclear is a carbon-free source of electricity that helps them meet greenhouse gas-reduction goals. Others see it as an always-on power source to replace an accelerating wave of retiring coal-fired power plants.",
      "Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee last month proposed more than $90 million to help subsidize a Tennessee Valley Authority project to install several small reactors, boost research and attract nuclear tech firms.",
      "Long a proponent of the TVA's nuclear project, Lee also launched Tennessee's Nuclear Energy Fund in 2023, designed to attract a supply chain, including a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment plant billed as the state's biggest-ever industrial investment.",
      "In Utah, where Gov. Spencer Cox announced \u201cOperation Gigawatt\u201d to double the state's electricity generation in a decade, the Republican wants to spend $20 million to prepare sites for nuclear. State Senate President J. Stuart Adams told colleagues when he opened the chamber's 2025 session that Utah needs to be the \u201cnation\u2019s nuclear hub.\"",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared his state is \u201cready to be No. 1 in advanced nuclear power\" as Texas lawmakers consider billions in nuclear power incentives.",
      "Michigan lawmakers are considering millions of dollars in incentives to develop and use the reactors, as well as train a nuclear industry workforce.",
      "One state over, Indiana lawmakers this month passed legislation to let utilities more quickly seek reimbursement for the cost to build a modular reactor, undoing a decades-old prohibition designed to protect ratepayers from bloated, inefficient or, worse, aborted power projects.",
      "In Arizona, lawmakers are considering a utility-backed bill to relax environmental regulations if a utility builds a reactor at the site of a large industrial power user or a retired coal-fired power plant.",
      "Still, the devices face an uncertain future.",
      "No modular reactors are operating in the U.S. and a project to build the first, this one in Idaho, was terminated in 2023, despite getting federal aid.",
      "The U.S. Department of Energy last year, under then-President Joe Biden, estimated the U.S. will need an additional 200 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity to keep pace with future power demands and reach net-zero emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases by 2050 to avoid the worst effects of climate change.",
      "The U.S. currently has just under 100 gigawatts of nuclear power operating. More than 30 advanced nuclear projects are under consideration or planned to be in operation by the early 2030s, Nichol of the NEI said, but those would supply just a fraction of the 200 gigawatt goal.",
      "Work to produce a modular reactor has drawn billions of dollars in federal subsidies, loan guarantees and more recently tax credits signed into law by Biden.",
      "Those have been critical to the nuclear industry, which expects them to survive under President Donald Trump, whose administration it sees as a supporter.",
      "The U.S. remains without a long-term solution for storing radioactive waste, safety regulators are under pressure from Congress to approve designs and there are serious questions about industry claims that the smaller reactors are efficient, safe and reliable, said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists.",
      "Plus, Lyman said, \u201cthe likelihood that those are going to be deployable and instantly 100% reliable right out of the gate is just not consistent with the history of nuclear power development. And so it\u2019s a much riskier bet.\u201d",
      "Nuclear also has competition from renewable energies.",
      "Brendan Kochunas, an assistant professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Michigan, said advanced reactors may have a short window to succeed, given the regulatory scrutiny they undergo and the advances in energy storage technologies to make wind and solar power more reliable.",
      "Those storage technologies could develop faster, bring down renewables' cost and, ultimately, make more economic sense than nuclear, Kochunas said.",
      "The supply chain for building reactors is another question.",
      "The U.S. lacks high-quality concrete- and steel-fabrication design skills necessary to manufacture a nuclear power plant, Kochunas said.",
      "That introduces the prospect of higher costs and longer timelines, he said. While foreign suppliers could help, there also is the fuel to consider.",
      "Kathryn Huff, a former top Energy Department official who is now an associate professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said uranium enrichment capacity in the U.S. and among its allies needs to grow in order to support reactor production.",

      "A federal judge has halted the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to dismantle the Voice of America, the eight-decade-old U.S. government-funded international news service",
      "NEW YORK -- The Voice of America can\u2019t be silenced just yet.",
      "A federal judge on Friday halted the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to dismantle the eight-decade-old U.S. government-funded international news service, calling the move a \u201cclassic case of arbitrary and capricious decision making.\u201d",
      "Judge James Paul Oetken blocked the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which runs Voice of America, from firing more than 1,200 journalists, engineers and other staff that it sidelined two weeks ago in the wake of President Donald Trump ordered its funding slashed.",
      "Oetken issued a temporary restraining order barring the agency from \u201cany further attempt to terminate, reduce-in-force, place on leave, or furlough\u201d employees or contractors, and from closing any offices or requiring overseas employees to return to the U.S.",
      "The order also bars the Agency for Global Media from terminating grant funding for its other broadcast outlets, including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Afghanistan. The agency said Thursday it was restoring Radio Free Europe\u2019s funding after a judge in Washington, D.C. ordered it to do so.",
      "\u201cThis is a decisive victory for press freedom and the First Amendment, and a sharp rebuke\u201d to the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cutter disregard for the principles that define our democracy,\u201d said the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyer Andrew G. Celli Jr.",
      "At a hearing Friday in Manhattan, Oetken faulted the Trump administration for \u201ctaking a sledgehammer to an agency that has been statutorily authorized and funded by Congress.\u201d",
      "The judge criticized the agency\u2019s leadership, including special adviser Kari Lake, for pulling the plug \u201cseemingly overnight\u201d on the U.S. government\u2019s global, soft-power megaphone with \u201cno consideration of the effects.\u201d",
      "Oetken ruled after a coalition of Voice of America journalists, labor unions and the nonprofit journalism advocacy group Reporters Without Borders sued the Trump administration last week to block the cuts. Ultimately, they seek to have VOA return to the air.",
      "The plaintiffs argued the shutdown violated a court\u2019s finding during Trump\u2019s first term that VOA journalists have a free-speech firewall protecting them from White House interference. Their absence from the airwaves has left a vacuum that\u2019s being filled by \u201cpropagandists whose messages will monopolize global airwaves,\u201d the plaintiffs said.",
      "Trump and other Republicans have accused Voice of America of a \u201cleftist bias\u201d and failing to project \u201cpro-American\u201d values to its worldwide audience, even though it is mandated by congress to serve as a non-partisan news organization.",
      "Voice of America went off the air soon after Trump issued an executive order on March 14 that pared funding to the Agency for Global Media and six other unrelated federal entities \u2014 part of his campaign to shrink government and align its with his political agenda.",
      "The White House called the service \u201cThe Voice of Radical America\u201d and said Trump\u2019s order would \u201censure that taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda.\u201d It cited coverage it said was \u201ctoo favorable\u201d to former President Joe Biden, as well as stories about white privilege, racial profiling and transgender migrants seeking asylum.",
      "Congress has appropriated nearly $860 million for the Agency for Global Media for the current fiscal year.",
      "Three federal lawsuits in Washington, D.C. are challenging other aspects of the cuts, including one brought by Voice of America\u2019s director and three journalists. Oetken said he\u2019ll rule at a later date on the government\u2019s request to move his case there.",
      "Voice of America has operated since World War II, beaming news into authoritarian countries that don\u2019t have a free press. It began as a counterpoint to Nazi propaganda and played a prominent role in the U.S. government\u2019s Cold War efforts to curb the spread of communism.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Voice of America employees were told to finish their live broadcasts on March 15, then vacate the building. Soon after, the lawsuit said, they lost access to agency computer systems, including email. Voice of America\u2019s news website hasn\u2019t been updated since.",
      "Lake, a former TV news anchor and political candidate, said she has been determining how many people are required to operate some of these outlets at the minimum staffing levels allowed by law.",
      "Some people have been brought back to work and at least one service \u2014 Radio Marti in Cuba \u2014 has returned to the air, Lake told One America News Network in an interview posted Thursday on X.",

      "The fine, issued on Thursday, is the second-largest handed down by the Nevada Gaming Commission, which has authority over disciplinary action.",

      "David Childs, the lead architect of the One World Trade Center skyscraper that rose from the site where the Twin Towers collapsed in New York City during the 9/11 attacks, has died. He was 83.",
      "Childs died on Wednesday in Pelham, New York, from Lewy body dementia, which had been diagnosed in September, his son, Nicholas Childs said.",
      "While he was perhaps best known for his work on One World Trade Center, considered to be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, Childs also was instrumental in other important projects, including a new master plan for the National Mall in Washington, D.C., an expansion of Dulles International Airport in Virginia and the 7 World Trade Center building in Manhattan, according to his firm, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.",
      "\u201cDavid\u2019s contribution to the firm was extensive and profound, and we will always be grateful to David for his leadership, his impact, and his friendship,\u201d Skidmore, Owings & Merrill said in a statement. \u201cWe will miss him dearly and extend our condolences and deepest sympathies to his family.\u201d",
      "A fond memory that Nicholas Childs has was when his father drew a rendering of what the One World Trade Center property would look like while they were out having lunch in New York, some years after 9/11 but well before the plans were finalized.",
      "\u201cHe picked up a paper napkin, took out a pen, and drew what became the ultimate design of the building on the napkin for me,\u201d Nicholas Childs said in a phone interview Friday, adding that he still has the drawing.",
      "He said his father was a civic-minded architect who would often use a quote by 20th century American-German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe \u2014 \u201cGod is in the details.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe cared deeply about those details and making something beautiful,\u201d Nicholas Childs said. \u201cBut he also wanted to make sure, I think as any great architect, that it was a balance of form and function, that it worked for people.\u201d",
      "The 1,776-foot-tall (540-meter-tall) One World Trade Center, once known as the Freedom Tower, is the centerpiece of the redevelopment of ground zero, along with the memorial pools placed where the Twin Towers stood. Opened in 2014, it sports a steel and glass structure that rises into the sky with a tapered, eight-triangle body, topped by a 408-foot-tall (124-meter-tall) needle.",
      "The final design was produced after contentious negotiations between Childs and Daniel Libeskind, who designed the overall plan for the site, and arguments between government officials over what should be built at ground zero and objections by some relatives of 9/11 victims to the design of the Trade Center memorial.",
      "Libeskind had drawn the first plans for building, a twisting glass skyscraper with an off-center spire meant to invoke the Statue of Liberty.",
      "Childs produced a sleeker version of Libeskind\u2019s design, then reworked it after police expressed concerns that the building was not sturdy enough to withstand a truck bomb.",
      "In announcing the new design plans, Childs said the One World Trade Center tower is \u201ciconic, simple and pure in its form, a memorable form that will reclaim the resilience and the spirit of our democracy.\u201d",
      "He also called it \u201cthe safest building in the world,\u201d with features including wider staircases, a separate stairway and elevator for firefighters, \u201cblast-resistant glazing\u201d and more public stairways with direct access to the street.",
      "Childs was born in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1941 and grew up in his early childhood years in Washington, D.C., before moving to Mount Kisco, New York. He attended the private Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Massachusetts, before going to Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, where he earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in architecture.",
      "He was hired by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in 1971 for its Washington, D.C., office, where he worked on projects including a new master plan for the National Mall, the Constitution Gardens park along the mall and the Four Seasons Hotel.",
      "He transferred to the firm's New York City office in 1984 and had a hand in significant projects in the city, including 1 Worldwide Plaza in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan and the Deutsche Bank Center, formerly called the Time Warner Center, with its twin skyscraper towers at Columbus Circle.",
      "Childs also worked on the U.S. embassy in Ottawa, Canada, the Canary Wharf development in London and King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.",
      "In 2004, he was honored with a Rome Prize for architecture, awarded by the American Academy in Rome for innovative work in the arts and humanities.",
      "Childs is survived by his wife, Annie; three children, Nicholas, Joshua and Jocelyn; and several grandchildren.",
      "The family is planning a small, private memorial in the coming weeks, followed by a larger service around May, Nicholas Childs said.",

      "The company promoted itself as a way for financially needy students to obtain more aid faster, in return for a few hundred dollars in fees. Javice appeared regularly on cable news programs to boost Frank\u2019s profile, once appearing on Forbes\u2019 \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list before JPMorgan bought the startup in 2021.",
      "JPMorgan executives testified that she told them she had over four million clients and would have about 10 million by year\u2019s end, but it turned out there were only about 300,000 customers.",
      "Javice\u2019s lawyer, Jose Baez, told the jury that JPMorgan knew what it was getting in the deal, and made up the fraud allegations due to buyer\u2019s remorse after government regulatory changes made the data it received in the deal useless to its hopes of gaining new young customers.",

      "If you know or suspect you can\u2019t pay the taxes you owe this tax season, you should still file a return with that information, or file for an extension",
      "NEW YORK -- If you know or suspect you can't pay the taxes you owe this tax season, you should still file a return with that information or file for an extension. That's the top piece of advice that tax professionals want you to know.",
      "\u201cThe IRS wants to work with you,\u201d said Tom O\u2019Saben, director of tax content and government relations at the National Association of Tax Professionals. \u201cBut if you're asking the IRS for some help, they have to know something about you. So the first thing is to have that return filed. The number one takeaway is that owing money is not a reason not to file.\u201d",
      "If you don't file a return or ask for an extension, then interest and penalties begin to accrue immediately. Those costs are largely avoidable if you share the information about your circumstances with the IRS in a timely way. Filing a return without paying taxes owed in full is preferable to not filing.",
      "To be clear, if you don't pay all the taxes you owe by the April 15 filing deadline, interest will accrue even if you've been granted an extension to October, but that interest will be more manageable than fees that add up when you pay no taxes at all.",
      "\u201cThe worst case scenario is that you don\u2019t file and end up being liable for penalties later on,\u201d said Emily DiVito, senior advisor for economic policy at the nonprofit Groundwork Collaborative and former U.S. Treasury advisor. \u201cThat\u2019s not good for anyone. But there are opportunities to ask for extensions and to go on payment plans.\u201d",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "In addition to tacking on interest and penalties, the IRS can eventually garnish your wages, place a lien on your property, or even place a hold on your passport. But if you file for an extension, or if you file your return with your financial information, you can avoid these consequences. Even if you don't have the money to pay what you owe in full by April 15, paying just a small part when you file.",
      "Yes. Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sites across the country are staffed with volunteers who will help you file a return or arrange for an extension for free. These volunteers can help you set up an installment payment plan of as many as 72 months to pay off any owed taxes. The IRS Direct File program is also free to use.",
      "\u201cWhile the question mark when you go to click the button to pay can be intimidating, we want to make sure that taxpayers get the money you\u2019re owed, too,\u201d said DiVito. \u201cMost taxpayers \u2014 certainly most working taxpayers \u2014 get money back. But the way that a lot of the tax credits function, you only get that refund if you file your taxes in the first place.\u201d",
      "If you've experienced unusual hardship, and you share that with the IRS, the IRS can sometimes put your account in \u201ccurrently-not-collectible\u201d status. To do that, you share information about your income and living expenses, and the IRS determines if you qualify.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019ve been ill, and you lost your job from illness, and you have serious medical bills. You\u2019ve had all the bad luck, and things happened outside of your control, and you need some relief,\u201d said O\u2019Saben. \u201cThen the IRS can place you in uncollectable status. But all of this requires conversation and communication. No one wants to admit they\u2019re having economic problems, but the IRS will work with you if you do.\u201d",
      "There are also rare circumstances in which the IRS will settle your tax debt for less than the amount owed, called an \u201coffer in compromise.\u201d VITA tax professionals can also help you see if you're eligible, or you can use a free IRS tool online.",
      "That's OK. Start now.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been doing taxes for more than 35 years,\u201d said O'Saben. \u201cThe number one reason people don't file is that they have a feeling they may owe \u2014 which could be wrong \u2014 and they don\u2019t want to face it. But it's not a problem that's going to go away. So tell the IRS the truth of the situation. And they will work with you.\u201d",
      "Miklos Ringbauer, a CPA and tax professional in California, echoed this.",
      "\u201cIt's perfectly okay,\u201d he said. \u201cThe IRS deals with every single taxpayer. They have dealt with this before. There's nothing they haven't seen.\u201d",

      "China remains a major exporter of products to countries around the world and boasts a domestic market of 1.4 billion people. However, massive overbuilding in the property sector has tied up trillions of dollars in capital, sapping business and consumer confidence and depriving the economy of its past vitality, while a tariff war unleashed by the U.S. is compounding those problems.",
      "Private businesses, which provide a large share of growth and jobs in the country\u2019s state-dominated economy, have borne much of the burden after years of regulatory crackdowns have shaken the confidence of entrepreneurs and other investors.",
      "China's unprecedentedly tough response to the COVID-19 outbreak also shut down business for much of three years and some sectors of the economy have yet to recover, particularly where global supply chains are involved.",
      "Yet, Xi, considered something a sceptic when it comes to inviting in overseas businesses, said foreign investors could have confidence that \u201cthe door of opening up will only open wider and wider. The policy of utilizing foreign investment has not changed and will not change,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cChina contains huge investment and consumption potential,\u201d he added.",
      "China has set an economic growth target of about 5% for this year, the same as last year and a level that analysts said would be difficult to achieve.",
      "The government has said it would attempt to stimulate the roughly $20 trillion economy by borrowing more money for a slew of initiatives, such as giving 300 billion yuan ($41.3 billion) in rebates to consumers who trade in old cars and appliances for new ones. But much of the borrowing will go to supporting the housing market and local governments weighed down by debt.",
      "What is clear is that a trade war with the United States has left the outlook for the coming months uncertain. Trump has raised tariffs on imports from China twice since taking office in January, leaving them at 20% across-the-board. China has shown no sign of backing down, retaliating with tariffs on U.S. goods.",
      "Xi did not mention the tariffs directly, but appeared to be referring to the importance of stable trade terms by saying: \u201cBlowing out other people\u2019s lights will not make your own lights brighter. Blocking other people\u2019s paths will eventually block your own paths.\u201d",
      "For now, however, China is seeking to portray itself as \u201can ideal, safe and promising investment destination for foreign investors,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cGoing with China is going with opportunities. Believing in China is believing in tomorrow. Investing in China is investing in the future,\u201d the president, who has made himself leader for life and also heads the ruling Communist Party, said.",
      "Others in attendance Friday included Amin H. Nasser, president of Saudi Aramco; Sherard Louis Cowper-Coles, the chair of China-Britain Business Council; Oliver Zipse, BMW CEO and Ray Dalio, chief investment officer of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates.",

      "JARAMANA, Syria -- Rana Al-Ahmad opens her fridge after breaking fast at sundown with her husband and four children during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.",
      "Apart from eggs, potatoes and some bread, it\u2019s empty because state electricity in Syria only comes two hours a day.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t leave our food in the fridge because it will spoil,\u201d she said.",
      "Her husband, a taxi driver in Damascus, is struggling to make ends meet, so the family can\u2019t afford to install a solar panel in their two-room apartment in Jaramana on the outskirts of the capital.",
      "Months after a lightning insurgency ended over half a century of the Assad dynasty\u2019s rule in Syria, the Islamist interim government has been struggling to fix battered infrastructure after a 14-year conflict decimated much of the country. Severe electricity shortages continue to plague the war-torn country.",
      "The United Nations estimates that 90% of Syrians live in poverty and the Syrian government has only been able to provide about two hours of electricity every day. Millions of Syrians, like Al-Ahmad and her family, can\u2019t afford to pay hefty fees for private generator services or install solar panels.",
      "Syria's new authorities under interim leader Ahmad Al-Sharaa have tried to ease the country's electricity crisis, but have been unable to stop the outages with patchwork solutions.",
      "Even with a recent gas deal with Qatar and an agreement with Kurdish-led authorities that will give them access to Syria's oil fields, the country spends most of its days with virtually no power. Reports of oil shipments coming from Russia, a key military and political ally of Assad, shows the desperation.",
      "At Al-Ahmad\u2019s home, she and her husband were only able to get a small battery that could power some lights.",
      "\u201cThe battery we have is small and its charge runs out quickly,\u201d said Al-Ahmad, 37. It\u2019s just enough that her children can huddle in the living room to finish their homework after school.",
      "And the family is not alone. Everywhere in Syria, from Damascus to Daraa in the south, neighborhoods turn pitch black once the sun sets, lit only from street lamps, mosque minarets and car headlights.",
      "The downfall of Assad in December brought rare hope to Syrians. But the new interim authorities have scrambled to establish control across the country and convince Western nations to lift economic sanctions to make its economy viable again.",
      "The United States in January eased some restrictions for six months, authorizing some energy-related transactions. But it doesn\u2019t appear to have made a significant difference on the ground just yet.",
      "Washington and other Western governments face a delicate balance with Syria\u2019s new authorities, and appear to be keen on lifting restrictions only if the war-torn country\u2019s political transition is democratic and inclusive of Syrian civil society, women and non-Sunni Muslim communities.",
      "Some minority groups have been concerned about the new authorities, especially incidents of revenge attacks targeting the Alawite community during a counter-offensive against an insurgency of Assad loyalists.",
      "Fixing Syria\u2019s damaged power plants and oil fields takes time, so Damascus is racing to get as much fuel as it can to produce more energy.",
      "Damascus is now looking towards the northeastern provinces, where its oil fields under Kurdish-led authorities are to boost its capacity, especially after reaching a landmark ceasefire deal with them.",
      "Political economist Karam Shaar said 85% of the country\u2019s oil production is based in those areas, and Syria once exported crude oil in exchange for refined oil to boost local production, though the fields are battered and bruised from years of conflict.",
      "These crucial oil fields fell into the hands of the extremist Islamic State group, which carved out a so-called caliphate across large swaths of Syria and Iraq from 2014 to 2017.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s during that period where much of the damage to the (oil) sector happened,\u201d said Shaar, highlighting intense airstrikes and fighting against the group by a U.S.-led international coalition.",
      "After IS fell, the U.S.-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces took control of key fields, leaving them away from the central government in Damascus. The new authorities hope to resolve this in a landmark deal with the SDF signed earlier this month.",
      "Kamran Omar, who oversees oil production in the Rmeilan oil fields in the northeastern city of Hassakeh, says shortages in equipment and supplies and clashes that persisted with Turkey and Turkish-backed forces have slowed down production, but told the AP that some of that production will eventually go to households and factories in other parts of Syria.",
      "The fields only produce a fraction of what they once did. The Rmeilan field sends just 15,000 of the approximately 100,000 barrels they produce to other parts of Syria to ease some of the burden on the state.",
      "The authorities in Damascus also hope that a recent deal with Qatar that would supply them with gas through Jordan to a major plant south of the capital will be the first of more agreements.",
      "Syria's authorities have not acknowledged reports of Russia sending oil shipments to the country. Moscow once aided Assad in the conflict against armed Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham that toppled the former president, but this shows that they are willing to stock up on fuel from whoever is offering.",
      "Interim Electricity Minister Omar Shaqrouq admitted in a news conference that bringing back electricity to Syrian homes 24 hours a day is not on the horizon.",
      "\u201cIt will soon be four hours, but maybe some more in the coming days.\u201d",
      "Increasing that supply will be critical for the battered country, which hopes to ease the economic woes of millions and bring about calm and stability. Shaar, who has visited and met with Syria\u2019s new authorities, says that the focus on trying to bring fuel in the absence of funding for major infrastructural overhauls is the best Damascus can do given how critical the situation is.",
      "\u201cElectricity is the cornerstone of economic recovery,\u201d said Shaar. \u201cWithout electricity you can\u2019t have a productive sector, (or any) meaningful industries.\u201d",

      "PARIS -- The monthslong trial of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy over the alleged illegal financing of his 2007 presidential campaign is shedding light on France's back-channel talks with the government of then-Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.",
      "Family members of terrorist attacks sponsored by Gadhafi's regime have told the court they suspect that Sarkozy was willing to sacrifice the memories of their loved ones in order to normalize ties with Libya almost two decades ago.",
      "French prosecutors on Thursday requested a seven-year prison sentence for the 70-year-old former leader. Sarkozy, who was president from 2007 to 2012, has denied all wrongdoing.",
      "The trial, which started in January, is to continue until April 8, with Sarkozy's lawyers to plead on the last day. The verdict is expected at a later date.",
      "Some key moments in the trial have focused on talks between France and Libya in the 2000s, when Gadhafi was seeking to restore diplomatic ties with the West. Before that, Libya was considered a pariah state for having sponsored attacks.",
      "French families of victims of a 1989 plane bombing told the court about their shock and sense of betrayal as the trial questioned whether promises possibly made to Gadhafi\u2019s government were part of the alleged corruption deal.",
      "In 1988, a bomb planted aboard a Pam Am flight exploded while the plane was over the Scottish town of Lockerbie, killing 270 people from 21 countries, including 190 Americans.",
      "The following year, on Sept. 19, 1989, the bombing of UTA flight 772 over Niger killed 170 people, including 54 French nationals on board, after an in-flight explosion caused by a suitcase bomb.",
      "Both French and U.S. investigations have tied both bombings to Libya, whose government had engaged in long-running hostilities with the U.S. and other Western governments.",
      "Now, families of victims are wondering whether French government officials close to Sarkozy promised to forget about the bombings in exchange for business opportunities with the oil-rich nation and possibly, an alleged corruption deal.",
      "\u201cWhat did they do with our dead?\u201d Nicoletta Diasio, the daughter of a man who died in the bombing, has told the court, saying she wondered if the memories of the victims \u201ccould have been used for bartering\u201d in talks between France and Libya.",
      "During the trial, Sarkozy has said he has \u201cnever ever betrayed\u201d families of victims. \u201cI have never traded their fate for any compromise, nor pact of realpolitik,\u201d he said.",
      "Libya was long a pariah state for its involvement in the 1980s bombings.",
      "In 2003, it took responsibility for both the 1988 and 1989 plane bombings and agreed to pay billions in compensation to the victims\u2019 families.",
      "Gadhafi also announced he was dismantling his nuclear weapons program, which led to the lifting of international sanctions against the country.",
      "Britain, France and other Western countries sought to restore a relationship with Libya for security, diplomatic and business purposes.",
      "In 2007, Sarkozy welcomed Gadhafi to Paris with honors for a five-day official visit, allowing him to set up a bedouin tent near the Elysee presidential palace. Many French people still remember that gesture, feeling Sarkozy went too far to please a dictator.",
      "Sarkozy said during the trial he would have preferred to \u201cdo without\u201d Gadhafi\u2019s visit at the time but it came as a diplomatic gesture after Libya\u2019s release of Bulgarian nurses who were imprisoned and facing death sentences for a crime they said they did not commit.",
      "On July 24, 2007, under an accord partially brokered by first lady Cecilia Sarkozy and EU officials, Libya released the five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor.",
      "The medics, who had spent over eight years in prison, faced death sentence on charges they deliberately infected hundreds of children with the AIDS virus in the late 1990s \u2014 an allegation they denied.",
      "The release of the medics removed the last major obstacle to Libya\u2019s rejoining the international community.",
      "Sarkozy travelled to the capital, Tripoli, for talks with Gadhafi the day after the medics were returned to Bulgaria on a French presidential plane.",
      "In court has spoken of his \u201cpride to have saved those six persons.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you did not discuss with Gadhafi, you\u2019d not get the release of the nurses,\u201d he said.",

      "An international arrest warrant was issued for him and five other suspects.",
      "Financial prosecutors have accused Sarkozy of having promised to lift the arrest warrant targeting al-Senoussi in exchange for alleged campaign financing.",
      "In 2005, people close to Sarkozy, who was at the time the interior minister, including his chief of staff Claude Gu\u00e9ant and junior minister Brice Hortefeux, travelled to Tripoli, where they met with al-Senoussi.",

      "Al-Senoussi told investigative judges that millions of dollars were provided to support Sarkozy\u2019s campaign. Accused of war crimes, he is now imprisoned in Libya.",
      "Sarkozy has strongly denied that.",
      "Gadhafi's son, Seif al-Islam, told the French news network RFI in January that he was personally involved in giving Sarkozy 5 million dollars in cash.",
      "Seif al-Islam sent RFI radio a two-page statement on his version of events. It was the first time he talked to the media about the case since 2011.",
      "He said Sarkozy initially \u201creceived $2.5 million from Libya to finance his electoral campaign\u201d during the 2007 presidential election, in return for which Sarkozy would \u201cconclude agreements and carry out projects in favour of Libya.\u201d",
      "He said a second payment of $2.5 million in cash was handed over without specifying when it was given.",

      "\u201cYou\u2019ll never find one Libyan euro, one Libyan cent in my campaign,\" he said at the opening of the trial in January. \u201cThere\u2019s no corruption money because there was no corruption.\"",
      "The Libyan civil war started in February 2011, with army units and militiamen loyal to Gadhafi opposing rebels.",
      "Sarkozy was the first Western leader to take a public stance to support the rebellion.",
      "On Feb. 25, 2011, he said the violence by pro-Gadhafi forces was unacceptable and should not go unpunished. \u201cGadhafi must go,\u201d he said at the time.",
      "On March 10 that year, France was the first country in the world to recognize the National Transitional Council as the legitimate government of Libya.",
      "\u201cThat was the Arab Spring,\u201d Sarkozy told the court. \u201cGadhafi was the only dictator who had sent (military) aircrafts against his people. He had promised rivers of blood, that\u2019s his expression.\u201d",

      "The rate fell to 6.65% from 6.67% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.79%.",
      "This is the first decline in the average rate after rising two weeks in a row. The average rate has been mostly trending lower since mid-January, when it climbed to just over 7% \u2014 a welcome trend for aspiring homebuyers struggling to afford a home after years of soaring home prices.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, rose this week, however, pushing the average rate to 5.89% from 5.83% last week. A year ago, it averaged 6.11%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including bond market investors\u2019 expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions.",
      "The overall decline this year in the average rate on a 30-year mortgage loosely follows the moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The yield, which was nearing 4.8% in mid-January, has mostly fallen since then, reflecting rising unease over the Trump administration\u2019s escalating tariffs on imported goods, which economists warn could drive inflation higher, hurting economic growth. The yield was at 4.37% in midday trading Thursday.",
      "Bond investors demand higher returns as long as inflation remains elevated, so if inflation ticks upward that could translate into higher yields on the 10-year Treasury note, pushing up mortgage rates.",
      "For now, the economic uncertainty is helping lower mortgage rates, just as the spring homebuying season ramps up.",
      "The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump dating back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes fell last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years.",
      "Easing mortgage rates and more homes on the market nationally helped drive home sales higher in February from the previous month, though they were down year-over-year.",

      "Lebanon has appointed asset manager Karim Souaid to the post of central bank governor Thursday as the government tries to reform the economy after months of war and decades of mismanagement and corruption",
      "BEIRUT -- Lebanon appointed asset manager Karim Souaid to the post of central bank governor Thursday as the government tries to reform the economy after months of war and decades of mismanagement and corruption.",
      "The country's economy has been in crisis for five years and desperately needs reforms to unlock international aid, and on top of that, Israel\u2019s 14-month war with Hezbollah caused what the World Bank estimates was $11 billion in damages and economic losses.",
      "The appointment was announced by Prime Minister Nawaf Salam, the International Court of Justice jurist who was named Lebanon\u2019s premier in January following the election of President Joseph Aoun earlier that month.",
      "Salam said that Souaid was chosen by more than two-thirds of the 24 members of Lebanon's reformist Cabinet, though the prime minister said he himself did not support the decision. \u201cThe Lebanese have asked us for reforms and we insist on reforms,\u201d Salam told reporters after the government meeting.",
      "Souaid, an asset manager who previously was a senior executive at HSBC bank, is seen by critics as being sympathetic to the stance on economic reform taken by the country's banks, and fear he might sell what\u2019s left of Lebanon\u2019s state assets to bail them out.",
      "An unproductive economy and decades of corruption by Lebanon\u2019s political and financial leaders that drained state resources eventually led to a run on the banks in 2019. Covid-19, the massive Beirut Port blast in August 2020 and the monthlong Israel-Hezbollah war furthered compounded the country\u2019s economic woes.",
      "Lebanon has been running on a cash economy, with most of its electricity coming from private suppliers, leading to inflation and pulling almost half the population into poverty, according to the World Bank.",
      "The country has struggled to reach an International Monetary Fund-approved deal to unlock aid to make the economy viable again, with the international financial institution asking Lebanon to end waste, crack down on corruption and financial crimes, and restructure its banking sector.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s commercial banks have been hesitant to implement some of these reforms, as it would burden them with the country\u2019s tens of billions of dollars in economic losses, experts and activists say. The banks believe the state should carry most of that burden, blaming them for defaulting on paying back the state\u2019s massive debt in 2020 and for its wasteful spending.",
      "Souaid had the backing of President Aoun, while Salam and a handful of ministers have remained skeptical of him.",
      "\u201cKarim Souaid was not my candidate and I abstained with some ministers because of my concerns regarding the rights of depositors,\u201d Salam told reporters after the Cabinet meeting, referring to concerns that large amounts of bank deposits might not be given back to depositors. \u201cHe will have to abide by the financial policy of our reformist Cabinet.\u201d",
      "Souaid succeeds Riad Salameh, the embattled former governor of 30 years whose term ended with several international corruption cases lodged against him and for embezzlement and other financial crimes. Salameh was appointed in 1993, when Lebanon was scrambling to bounce back after a 15-year civil war.",
      "Salameh, who is currently in detention, was heralded as a financial genius for preventing hyperinflation and keeping the Lebanese currency stable through years of political tensions and conflict, and then left his post widely perceived as a key architect of the country\u2019s financial downfall.",

      "NEW YORK -- Shares of major automakers slumped following President Donald Trump's announcement that he will place 25% tariffs on auto imports.",
      "Automakers have spread out their supply chains and production facilities throughout North America. Parts and production steps often cross one or more borders during the process. That means it will cost the major automakers more money to build their cars and trucks.",
      "The tariffs will take effect April 3.",
      "\u201cThere are still a lot of unknowns, but if this remains in place, there will clearly be some pain for the companies to digest,\u201d said Joseph Spak, analyst at UBS, in a note to investors.",
      "Higher costs will likely force companies to raise prices on new vehicles at a time when consumers are already faced with near record-high car prices. The tariffs could boost inflation overall, hurting consumers who are growing more worried about the economy.",
      "General Motors slumped 8.2%. The Detroit automaker could fare the worst among its peers under broad tariffs, as it sources about 40% of vehicles sold in the U.S. from Mexico and Canada, according to analysts at JPMorgan.",
      "Ford, which slipped 4.2%, is less exposed with under 10% of vehicles sourced outside of the U.S., JPMorgan said.",
      "Stellantis, which is based in the Netherlands but has significant manufacturing operations in North America, fell 2.5%.",
      "Honda shares traded in the U.S. fell 2.7% and Toyota shares traded in the U.S. fell 2.4%.",
      "The exception was Tesla. The cars it sells in the U.S. are produced domestically. Its shares rose more than 5%.",
      "Auto parts suppliers also lost ground. Autoliv fell 3.7%, Aptiv slipped 5.6% and Gentex fell 1.7%.",
      "Many automakers have been preparing for tariffs to impact their operations since Trump first announced plans to impose the taxes earlier this year. General Motors and others have worked to get more inventory into the U.S. ahead of any tariffs.",

      "BOSTON -- Maxim Naumov came to a stop in the middle of the ice, looked up at the sky and patted his heart. Then he mouthed a few words, in Russian, to his parents:",
      "\u201cThis is for you guys. You guys are with me. I love you both.\u201d",
      "Former world pairs champions Vadim Naumov and Evgenia Shishkova died in January when their plane crashed into a military helicopter on approach to Washington, D.C., and fell into the icy Potomac River. A total of 67 people were killed, including more than two dozen who were returning from a development camp following the U.S. figure skating championships in Wichita, Kansas.",
      "Maxim Naumov, who finished fourth at nationals, already had returned home. Since the crash, he has become in many ways the face of the tragedy \u2014 or at least its effect on the skating community.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve walked through a hallway and haven\u2019t given a hug since. And I feel that support and love,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s been beyond anything that I could have ever even imagined. And it helps so much to get through this day.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it makes my heart so full.\u201d",
      "Naumov, 23, skated in a benefit in Washington earlier this month that raised more than $1.2 million for the victims\u2019 families. Speaking to reporters Sunday after performing at the world championships gala, Naumov said the time that he is on the ice gives his mind a chance to escape the tragedy.",
      "\u201cAs soon as I hit the ice, my brain just \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s focus or just calmness or stillness or what, but it feels like I tune everything out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m just talking with them, and they\u2019re helping me.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t hear the crowd. I don\u2019t hear the announcers, I don\u2019t hear anything. I just have this internal dialogue and I\u2019m just able to almost be calm and just be in my heart,\u201d Naumov said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re always there, too. And every time I think of them, especially when I\u2019m on the ice, it really, really helps me get through.\u201d",
      "The world championships, which had previously been scheduled at the home of Boston's Celtics and Bruins, brought renewed attention to the plane crash and the century-old Skating Club of Boston that has been a home for Olympians and recreational skaters alike.",
      "There was a tribute on Wednesday, sandwiched between the day's two sessions, and frequent reminders of the tragedy.",
      "Alisa Efimova and Misha Mitrofanov, who finished sixth in pairs this weekend, held up pictures of the Boston club members who died in the crash: two young skaters, their mothers and the two coaches. Reigning U.S. champion Amber Glenn wore a T-shirt honoring the memory of all the young skaters who were lost.",
      "Ilia Malinin, the \u201cQuad God\u201d who won his second straight world championship on Saturday night, finished the show on Sunday with a performance that he said was dedicated to the plane crash victims. He came to the end, red-eyed and choking back tears.",
      "Naumov\u2019s introduction on Sunday identified him as a member of the Boston club and included his three fourth-place finishes at nationals. It didn\u2019t mention the crash, but many in the crowd surely knew his connection: He received not only the polite applause that greeted most of the other skaters, but a second wave, with individuals standing to cheer him on.",
      "Wearing unadorned black pants and a sparkly black top, a gold chain flopping around his neck as he glided across the ice, Naumov gave a gala performance aimed more at emotion than proof of athletic prowess.",
      "The choice of music, Mac Miller\u2019s posthumous 2020 release \u201cThat\u2019s on Me,\u201d was intentional. Miller died of an accidental drug overdose in 2018.",
      "\u201cLately, for some reason \u2014 well, not for some reason \u2014 but lately I\u2019ve just been listening to Mac Miller\u2019s album \u2018Circles.\u2019 Like just over and over and over,\u201d Naumov said. \u201cAnd knowing the unfortunate story about him as an artist, it\u2019s been very relatable.",
      "\u201cI relate to it, and I feel really deeply and emotionally what he\u2019s talking about in those songs. And it\u2019s also been really helpful for me to almost get my emotions out in that way personally.\u201d",
      "When his skate was over, Naumov took a deep breath, patted his heart again and waved in each direction. His bows were deep and poignant. Leaving the ice after a one-minute standing ovation, he made the sign of the cross.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of emotions just right now, and it\u2019s hard to even put a name to what I\u2019m feeling currently,\" he said. \"I just feel so much support, and it\u2019s very overwhelming.",
      "\u201cI have so much gratitude,\" Naumov said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m thankful for each and every single one of those fans.\u201d",

      "The Toronto Blue Jays put right-hander Max Scherzer on the 15-day injured list Sunday because of inflammation in his right thumb",
      "TORONTO -- The Toronto Blue Jays put right-hander Max Scherzer on the 15-day injured list Sunday because of inflammation in his right thumb. The move comes one day after the three-time Cy Young Award winner left his debut start with Toronto after three innings because of right lat soreness.",
      "Toronto recalled left-hander Easton Lucas and selected lefty Mason Fluharty, both from Triple-A Buffalo. Left-hander Richard Lovelady, who allowed four runs in relief of Scherzer and took the loss against Baltimore on Saturday, was designated for assignment.",
      "Following Saturday\u2019s 9-5 defeat, the 40-year-old Scherzer said his lat soreness was directly related to lingering thumb pain that forced him to push back a spring training start earlier this month.",
      "Calling himself \u201cfrustrated,\u201d Scherzer said solving the thumb issue is his top priority.",
      "\u201cThis thumb is absolutely critical to your arm health,\u201d he said after Saturday's game. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get this 100% before I pitch again.\u201d",
      "Scherzer signed a $15.5 million, one-year contract in February. He went 2-4 with a 3.95 ERA in nine starts for Texas last season, starting the year on the injured list while recovering from lower back surgery. He also had a stint on the IL with shoulder fatigue and didn\u2019t pitch after Sept. 14 because of a left hamstring strain.",
      "Scherzer allowed two runs and three hits Saturday, including two solo home runs. He threw 45 pitches, 28 for strikes. He struck out one and walked none.",

      "Villa hasn\u2019t won a trophy since capturing the English League Cup in 1996 but has a great chance in the FA Cup this season, with many of the country\u2019s top teams already eliminated.",
      "Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest advanced on Saturday, while Manchester City plays away against Bournemouth in the remaining quarterfinal match later Sunday.",
      "In the draw for the semifinals, Palace was paired with Villa while Forest takes on the winner of the Bournemouth-Man City match.",
      "If City loses, Villa will likely be the favorite given the team is back in the big time under Spanish manager Unai Emery, even reaching the Champions League quarterfinals this season.",
      "Villa has won the FA Cup seven times, but not since 1957. It lost 4-0 to Arsenal in the 2015 final.",
      "Preston, the only non-Premier League team in the last eight, was playing its first FA Cup quarterfinal match since the 1965-66 season.",

      "There is plenty of nostalgia at Black Mountain, New Hampshire's oldest ski area",
      "Jackson, N.H. -- A skier since age 4, Thomas Brennick now enjoys regular trips to New Hampshire\u2019s Black Mountain with his two grandchildren.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s back to the old days,\u201d he said from the Summit Double chairlift on a recent sunny Friday. \u201cIt's just good, old-time skiing at its best.\u201d",
      "Behind the scenes, the experience is now propelled by a high-tech system designed to increase efficiency at the state\u2019s oldest ski area. And while small, independent resorts can\u2019t compete on infrastructure or buying power with conglomerates like Vail, which owns nearby Attitash Mountain Resort and seven others in the Northeast alone, at least one entrepreneur is betting technology will be \u201ca really great equalizer.\u201d",
      "That businessman is Erik Mogensen, who bought Black Mountain last year and turned it into a lab for his ski mountain consultancy, Entabeni Systems. The company builds systems that put lift tickets sales, lesson reservations and equipment rentals online while collecting detailed data to inform decisions such as where to make more snow and how much.",
      "\u201cA lot of general managers will go out and look at how many rows of cars are parked, and that\u2019s kind of how they tell how busy they are,\u201d Mogensen said. \u201cWe really want to look at that transactional data down to the deepest level.\u201d",
      "That includes analyzing everything from the most popular time to sell hot dogs in the lodge to how many runs a season pass holder makes per visit.",
      "\u201cThe large operators, they can do a lot of things at scale that we can\u2019t. They can buy 20 snow cats at a time, 10 chairlifts, those types of things. We can\u2019t do that, but we\u2019re really nimble,\u201d Mogensen said. \u201cWe can decide to change the way we groom very quickly, or change the way we open trails, or change our (food and beverage) menu in the middle of a day.\u201d",
      "Mogensen, who says his happiest moments are tied to skiing, started Entabeni Systems in 2015, driven by the desire to keep the sport accessible. In 2023, he bought the company Indy Pass, which allows buyers to ski for two days each at 230 independent ski areas, including Black Mountain. It's an alternative to the Epic and Ikon multi-resort passes offered by the Vail and Alterra conglomerates.",
      "Black Mountain was an early participant in Indy Pass. When Mogensen learned it was in danger of closing, he was reminded of his hometown's long-gone ski area. He bought Black Mountain aiming to ultimately transform it into a cooperative.",
      "Many Indy Pass resorts also are clients of Entabeni Systems, including Utah's Beaver Mountain, which bills itself as the longest continuously-run family owned mountain resort in the U.S.",
      "Kristy Seeholzer, whose husband\u2019s grandfather founded Beaver Mountain, said Entabeni streamlined its ticketing and season pass system. That led to new, lower-priced passes for those willing to forgo skiing during holiday weeks or weekends, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of our season pass holders were self-limiting anyway. They only want to ski weekdays because they don\u2019t want to deal with weekends,\u201d she said. \u201cWe could never have kept track of that manually.\"",
      "Though she is pleased overall, Seeholzer said the software can be challenging and slow.",
      "\u201cThere are some really great programs out there, like on the retail side of things or the sales side of things. And one of the things that was a little frustrating was it felt like we were reinventing the wheel,\u201d she said.",
      "Sam Shirley, 25, grew up skiing in New Hampshire and worked as a ski instructor and ski school director in Maine while attending college. But he said increasing technology has drastically changed the way he skis, pushing him to switch mostly to cross-country.",
      "\u201cAs a customer, it\u2019s made things more complicated,\u201d he said. \"It just becomes an extra hassle.\u201d",
      "Shirley used to enjoy spur-of-the-moment trips around New England, but has been put off by ski areas reserving lower rates for those who buy tickets ahead. He doesn\u2019t like having to provide detailed contact information, sometimes even a photograph, just to get a lift ticket.",
      "It's not just independent ski areas that are focused on technology and data. Many others are using lift tickets and passes embedded with radio frequency identification chips that track skiers' movements.",
      "Vail resorts pings cell phones to better understand how lift lines are forming, which informs staffing decisions, said John Plack, director of communications. Lift wait times have decreased each year for the past three years, with 97% under 10 minutes this year, he said.",
      "\u201cOur company is a wildly data-driven company. We know a lot about our guest set. We know their tastes. We know what they like to ski, we know when they like to ski. And we\u2019re able to use that data to really improve the guest experience,\u201d he said.",
      "That improvement comes at a cost. A one-day lift ticket at Vail's Keystone Resort in Colorado sold for $292 last week. A season pass cost $418, a potentially good deal for diehard skiers, but also a reliable revenue stream guaranteeing Vail a certain amount of income even as ski areas face less snow and shorter winters.",
      "The revenue from such passes, especially the multi-resort Epic Pass, allowed the company to invest $100 million in snowmaking, Plack said.",
      "\u201cBy committing to the season ahead of time, that gives us certainty and allows us to reinvest in our resorts,\" he said.",
      "Mogensen insists bigger isn\u2019t always better, however. Lift tickets at Black Mountain cost $59 to $99 per day and a season's pass is about $450.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t just come skiing to turn left and right. You come skiing because of the way the hot chocolate tastes and the way the fire pit smells and what spring skiing is and what the beer tastes like and who you\u2019re around,\u201d he said. \u201cSkiing doesn\u2019t have to be a luxury good. It can be a community center.\u201d",
      "Brennick, the Black Mountain lift rider who was skiing with his grandchildren, said he has noticed a difference since the ski area was sold.",
      "\u201cI can see the change,\u201d he said. \u201cThey're making a lot of snow and it shows.\u201d",

      "In his letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press, Marks said he was \u201cwilling to work\u201d to address the concerns expressed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., about the safety of vaccinations. But he concluded that wasn't possible.",
      "\u201cIt has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Marks was offered the choice of resigning or being fired by Kennedy, according to a former FDA official familiar with the discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he didn\u2019t have permission to discuss the matter publicly.",
      "Kennedy has a long history of spreading anti-vaccine misinformation, although during his Senate confirmation hearings he seemed to say he would not undermine vaccines. He promised the chair of the Senate health committee that he would not change existing vaccine recommendations.",
      "Since becoming commissioner, Kennedy has vowed to scrutinize the safety of childhood vaccinations, despite decades of evidence they are safe and have saved millions of lives.",
      "Marks oversaw the agency\u2019s rapid review and approval of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments during the pandemic.",
      "Marks is credited with coining the name and concept for \u201cOperation Warp Speed,\u201d the effort under President Donald Trump to rapidly manufacture vaccines while they were still being tested for safety and efficacy. The initiative cut years off the normal development process.",
      "Despite the project\u2019s success, Trump repeatedly lashed out at the FDA for not approving the first COVID shots even sooner. Trump told confidants after his 2020 loss that he would have been re-elected if the vaccine had been available before Election Day.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, criticized what he called the \u201cfiring\u201d of Marks.",
      "\u201cRFK Jr.\u2019s firing of Peter Marks because he wouldn\u2019t bend a knee to his misinformation campaign now allows the fox to guard the hen house,\" Offit said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day for America\u2019s children.\u201d",
      "Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said the issues raised in Marks' resignation letter \u201cshould be frightening to anyone committed to the importance of evidence to guide policies and patient decisions.\u201d",
      "\u201cI hope this will intensify the communication across academia, industry and government to bolster the importance of science and evidence,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The resignation follows news Friday that HHS plans to lay off 10,000 workers and shut down entire agencies, including ones that oversee billions of dollars in funds for addiction services and community health centers across the country.",
      "In a post on social media Thursday, Kennedy criticized the department he oversees as an inefficient \u201csprawling bureaucracy.\" He also faulted the department\u2019s 82,000 workers for a decline in Americans\u2019 health.",
      "The resignation is the latest blow to the beleaguered health agency, which has been rocked for weeks by layoffs, retirements and a chaotic return-to-office process that left many staffers without permanent offices, desks or other supplies. Last month, Jim Jones, the FDA\u2019s deputy commissioner for foods, resigned, citing \u201cthe indiscriminate firing\u201d of nearly 90 staffers in his division, according to a copy of his resignation letter obtained by the AP.",
      "Marks, who could not be reached for comment, also raised concerns in his letter about \u201cefforts currently being advanced by some on the adverse health effects of vaccination are concerning\u201d as well as the \u201cunprecedented assault on scientific truth that has adversely impacted public health in our nation.\u201d",
      "He went on to detail the historic benefits of vaccinations dating back to George Washington and pointed to the ongoing measles outbreak as proof of what can happen when doubts about science take hold.",
      "\u201cThe ongoing multistate measles outbreak that is particularly severe in Texas reminds us of what happens when confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being is undermined,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The measles outbreak, which could go on for months, has now spread to Kansas and Ohio after sickening more than 370 in Texas and New Mexico.",
      "If it hits other unvaccinated communities across the U.S., as may now be the case in Kansas, the outbreak could endure for a year and threaten the nation\u2019s status as having eliminated the local spread of the vaccine-preventable disease, public health experts said.",

      "A major 7.7 magnitude earthquake that originated near Mandalay, Myanmar shook the Earth as far as Bangkok",
      "Early Friday, a major 7.7 magnitude earthquake that originated near Mandalay, Myanmar, shook the Earth as far as Bangkok, about 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) away.",
      "Two hard-hit cities in Myanmar suffered extensive damage, with images from the capital, Naypyidaw, showing rescue crews pulling victims from the rubble of collapsed buildings. Authorities in Bangkok said deaths had occurred at three construction sites, including a high-rise that collapsed.",
      "Experts say the earthquake, which occurred along the Sagaing Fault, was close to the Earth's surface, generating intense seismic forces. Preliminary estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey show that nearly 800,000 people in Myanmar may have been within the zone of the most violent shaking and that death tolls exceeding 1,000 people, and perhaps much higher, are probable.",
      "The Earth's crust is broken up into several pieces called tectonic plates, which fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.",
      "This formation is \u201cmostly stable, but along the edges they are moving,\u201d Columbia University geophysicist Michael Steckler said.",
      "Pressure builds up when sliding plates get stuck, increasing \u201cvery slowly for decades or for hundreds of years, and then all of a sudden the rock plates will jump,\" triggering shaking that causes an earthquake, Steckler said.",
      "Earthquakes typically occur along edges of tectonic plates. But their impacts may be felt in a broader region.",
      "Earthquakes that occur in the ocean don't always attract attention, but those that occur close to where people live can cause deaths and injuries, most often from collapsed buildings.",
      "Scientists have a good idea of where earthquakes are likely to occur, \"but we can't predict when they'll occur,\u201d USGS seismologist Will Yeck said.",
      "However, after the initial big earthquake, researchers are able to project that other smaller earthquakes nearby, called aftershocks, are likely.",
      "Aftershocks are triggered \u201cbecause of changes to stress in the Earth from the main shock,\u201d Yeck said.",
      "Given the magnitude of the quake in Myanmar, \u201cyou will probably see aftershocks for the next several months,\u201d Steckler said.",
      "In regions of the world with known active fault lines, including California and Japan, building codes are often designed to withstand earthquakes. But that's not true everywhere.",
      "\u201cIf you feel shaking, the guidance depends on where you are in the world,\u201d Yeck said.",
      "In many countries, including the United States, if you're inside when an earthquake occurs, it's advisable to drop to the ground, cover your head \u2014 for example, by crawling under a desk or other sturdy structure \u2014 and hold onto that structure, he said. Try to avoid areas near glass windows and don't use building elevators.",
      "If you're outside, try to remain in an area away from buildings or trees that could fall.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Fans of Studio Ghibli, the famed Japanese animation studio behind \u201cSpirited Away\u201d and other beloved movies, were delighted this week when a new version of ChatGPT let them transform popular internet memes or personal photos into the distinct style of Ghibli founder Hayao Miyazaki.",
      "But the trend also highlighted ethical concerns about artificial intelligence tools trained on copyrighted creative works and what that means for the future livelihoods of human artists. Miyazaki, 84, known for his hand-drawn approach and whimsical storytelling, has expressed skepticism about AI's role in animation.",
      "Janu Lingeswaran wasn't thinking much about that when he uploaded a photo of his 3-year-old ragdoll cat, Mali, into ChatGPT's new image generator tool on Wednesday. He then asked ChatGPT to convert it to the Ghibli style, instantly making an anime image that looked like Mali but also one of the painstakingly drawn feline characters that populate Miyazaki movies such as \u201cMy Neighbor Totoro\u201d or \u201cKiki's Delivery Service.\u201d",
      "\u201cI really fell in love with the result,\u201d said Lingeswaran, an entrepreneur who lives near Aachen, Germany. \u201cWe're thinking of printing it out and hanging it on the wall.\u201d",
      "Similar results gave the Ghibli style to iconic images, such as the casual look of Turkish pistol shooter Yusuf Dikec in a T-shirt and one hand in his pocket on his way to winning a silver medal at the 2024 Olympics. Or the famed \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d meme of a 4-year-old turning to the camera with a slight smile as a house fire rages in the background.",
      "ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which is fighting copyright lawsuits over its flagship chatbot, has largely encouraged the \u201cGhiblification\u201d experiments and its CEO Sam Altman changed his profile on social media platform X into a Ghibli-style portrait. In a technical paper posted Tuesday, the company had said the new tool would be taking a \u201cconservative approach\u201d in the way it mimics the aesthetics of individual artists.",
      "\u201cWe added a refusal which triggers when a user attempts to generate an image in the style of a living artist,\u201d it said. But the company added in a statement that it \u201cpermits broader studio styles \u2014 which people have used to generate and share some truly delightful and inspired original fan creations.\u201d",
      "Studio Ghibli in Japan declined to comment Friday.",
      "As users posted their Ghibli-style images on social media, Miyazaki\u2019s previous comments on AI animation also began to resurface. When Miyazaki was shown an AI demo in 2016, he said he was \u201cutterly disgusted\u201d by the display, according to documentary footage of the interaction. The person demonstrating the animation, which showed a writhing body dragging itself by its head, explained that AI could \u201cpresent us grotesque movements that we humans can\u2019t imagine.\u201d It could be used for zombie movements, the person said.",
      "That prompted Miyazaki to tell a story.",
      "\u201cEvery morning, not in recent days, I see my friend who has a disability,\u201d Miyazaki said. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard for him just to do a high five; his arm with stiff muscle can\u2019t reach out to my hand. Now, thinking of him, I can\u2019t watch this stuff and find it interesting. Whoever creates this stuff has no idea what pain is.\u201d",
      "He said he would \u201cnever wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cI strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself,\u201d he added.",
      "Josh Weigensberg, a partner at the law firm Pryor Cashman, said that one question the Ghibli-style AI art raises is whether the AI model was trained on Miyazaki or Studio Ghibli\u2019s work. That in turn \u201craises the question of, \u2018Well, do they have a license or permission to do that training or not?\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "OpenAI didn\u2019t respond to a question Thursday about whether it had a license.",
      "Weigensberg added that if a work was licensed for training, it might make sense for a company to permit this type of use. But if this type of use is happening without consent and compensation, he said, it could be \u201cproblematic.\u201d",
      "Weigensberg said that there is a general principle \u201cat the 30,000-foot view\u201d that \u201cstyle\u201d is not copyrightable. But sometimes, he said, what people are actually thinking of when they say \u201cstyle\u201d could be \"more specific, discernible, discrete elements of a work of art,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cA \u2018Howl\u2019s Moving Castle' or \u2018Spirited Away,\u2019 you could freeze a frame in any of those films and point to specific things, and then look at the output of generative AI and see identical elements or substantially similar elements in that output,\u201d he said. \u201cJust stopping at, \u2018Oh, well, style isn\u2019t protectable under copyright law.\u2019 That's not necessarily the end of the inquiry.\u201d",
      "Artist Karla Ortiz, who grew up watching Miyazaki\u2019s movies and is suing other AI image generators for copyright infringement in a case that\u2019s still pending, called it \u201canother clear example of how companies like OpenAI just do not care about the work of artists and the livelihoods of artists.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s using Ghibli\u2019s branding, their name, their work, their reputation, to promote (OpenAI) products,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cIt\u2019s an insult. It\u2019s exploitation.\u201d",
      "Ortiz was further enraged when President Donald Trump\u2019s administration jumped into the meme trend Thursday, using the White House\u2019s official X account to post a Ghibli-style image of a weeping woman from the Dominican Republic recently arrested by U.S. immigration agents. The White House and OpenAI didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment on how the image was made.",
      "\u201cTo see something so brilliant, as wonderful as Miyazaki\u2019s work be butchered to generate something so foul,\u201d Ortiz wrote on social media, adding that she hoped Studio Ghibli sues \u201cthe hell out of\u201d OpenAI for this.",

      "The governing body of figure skating has embarked on an ambitious plan called \u201cVision 2030,\u201d and the idea is simple: Make the sport cool again",
      "BOSTON -- Ashley Wagner and Ben Agosto know what it's like to step off the ice at the figure skating world championships and feel as though they've conquered the sport. And what it feels like when the notoriously fickle sport bites back.",
      "So when the International Skating Union put in motion its ambitious \u201cVision 2030\u201d plan, which is designed to grow and expand the sport through improved fan engagement, it made sense that they would call Wagner, a three-time U.S. champion and former world silver medalist, and Agosto, who won an Olympic silver medal with ice dance partner Tanith Belbin.",
      "If anyone was going to interview athletes at this week's world championships at such an emotionally raw moment, the minute after their programs have concluded, it ought to be someone who has been through it themselves.",
      "\u201cI would have loved this when I was an athlete, to have the post-skate interviews right in the kiss-and-cry, when the emotions are so fresh,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cThat's something being brought into this production. We've never seen anything like it.\u201d",
      "Look closely, and you might notice a lot of things never seen before at this week's worlds: cutting-edge LED dasher boards surrounding the rink, grand entrances for the athletes, and more energetic music \u2014 like the rocked-out version of \u201cI'm Shipping Up to Boston\u201d by the Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys that keeps blaring inside TD Garden.",
      "The idea is simple: The ISU wants to make figure skating feel cool again.",
      "Or at least, cool to more people.",
      "Those who love the intricate, nuanced sport \u2014 the spins and jumps, the brilliant landings and bitter falls \u2014 tend to follow it year-round. But there are just as many fans that tune in once every four years, during the Winter Olympics, when like a shooting star the athletes spring onto the public consciousness and then fizzle as soon as it ends.",
      "\"Skaters are the reason why this sport exits,\" explained ISU president Jae Youl Kim, who granted The Associated Press a behind-the-scenes tour of the world championship setup Thursday, shortly before the start of the men's short program.",
      "\u201cWe are so proud of our athletes and we want to make sure we shine a brighter, stronger spotlight on our skaters.\u201d",
      "That is why those brilliant LED dasher boards are showcasing each athlete's social media tag, and why each is being introduced individually for the first time, something track and field and other Olympic sports have embraced over the years.",
      "The ISU wants to create a spectacle for the 14,000-plus fans in the arena, along with the millions watching around the world.",
      "\u201cThere's much more to come. I mean, we can brainstorm here a lot about potential marketing and sponsorship activations as well,\u201d said Wieland L\u00fcders, who manages the world championships for the ISU. \u201cEach skater has their own partners, potentially, so there are many more thoughts. But for now, we are just at the beginning. This is the basic concept.\u201d",
      "In the future, the Vision 2030 plan hopes to improve the TV presentation, simplify the sport\u2019s complex rules, increase sponsorship and expand revenue streams. It will also promote skating through grassroots initiatives, reimagine the season-long calendar, and explore new technology that could help to usher the sport into the modern era.",
      "The athletes aren't just benefiting from increased exposure, and the potential boon for their pocketbooks, but also from back-of-the-house upgrades that are a part of Vision 2030. In Boston, an expansive lounge is off limits to everyone but competitors, and back at their hotel, there is a calming room complete with a rotating cast of therapy dogs.",
      "Kim visited it this week. Nobody paid any attention to the ISU president because everybody wanted to see Penny, the dog.",
      "If the calming room is meant to destress, the new hot seat in the arena will probably do the exact opposite.",
      "Much like the time trial in Olympic cycling, where the leader sits uncomfortably on a throne until someone else takes the lead, the ISU has created the same thing at the world championships. But rather than some roped-off backstage area, where leaders have waited for decades, the hot seat is right next to the kiss-and-cry area in the heart of the arena.",
      "The athletes who are coming off the ice after their performance can't help but stare down whomever is in the lead.",
      "\u201cWe want the fans to see how that person is reacting when he or she climbs over to take the throne, or how they are reacting when they cannot make it,\u201d L\u00fcders said. \u201cThey could have interactions with each other, some hugging or high-fives, something like this. So we hope we get more engagement between the two skaters.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, more engagement with the fans, too.",

The drone has a land and sea version.",

      "A Chinese patient is the third person in world known to be living with a gene-edited pig kidney. And the same research team also reported an experiment implanting a pig liver into a brain-dead person.",

Two initial xenotransplants in the U.S. \u2014 two pig hearts and two pig kidneys \u2013 were short-lived. But two additional pig kidney recipients so far are thriving \u2013 an Alabama woman transplanted in November and a New Hampshire man transplanted in January. A U.S. clinical trial is about to begin.",

      "But Wang pointed to a potential next step in xenotransplantation \u2014 learning to transplant pig livers. His team reported Wednesday in the journal Nature that a pig liver transplanted into a brain-dead person survived for 10 days, with no early signs of rejection. He said the pig liver produced bile and albumin \u2014 important for basic organ function \u2014 although not as much as human livers do.",

      "In the U.S. last year, surgeons at the University of Pennsylvania attempted that sort of \u201cbridge\u201d support by externally attaching a pig liver to a brain-dead human body to filter blood, much like dialysis for failing kidneys. U.S. pig developer eGenesis is studying that approach.",

      "Defense attorney Jose Baez urged an acquittal of his 32-year-old client, calling the proof \u201cincredibly flawed.\" He urged the jury to \u201clook at evidence, lack of evidence and the conflict of the evidence\u201d to exonerate Javice.",
      "As he spoke, Javice smiled at times and turned her chair to face the jury.",
      "Prosecutors said the Miami Beach, Florida, resident who appeared on the Forbes 2019 \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list would have earned $45 million from the fraud.",
      "The defense presentation came after Chiuchiolo cited emails, text messages and phone calls to convince jurors that Javice repeatedly lied to JPMorgan in the summer of 2021 to secure a buyout that would earn her millions of dollars.",
      "The company Javice founded once seemed like a pioneer among businesses that cater to college-age students, who banks encourage to open checking or credit card accounts in the hopes they'll become lifelong customers.",
      "Frank, established in 2017 as TAPD Inc., was created to simplify filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, a federal government form used by students to apply for financial aid for college or graduate school.",
      "Chiuchiolo said Javice, who was arrested in April 2023 and is free on bail, sought to sell the company in 2021, when it had about 400,000 customers, claiming it had over 4.25 million clients.",
      "When JPMorgan Chase sought to verify the client list, Javice first approached her company's head of engineering, asking if he could produce \u201csynthetic data\u201d to show the company had over 4 million customers, the prosecutor said.",
      "But the employee refused, saying he \u201cwould not do anything illegal,\u201d Chiuchiolo said.",
      "\u201cThey're going to call him a liar,\u201d he predicted of the defense's characterization of his testimony. \u201cBecause if you believe him, the defendants are guilty.\u201d",
      "Javice eventually hired an outside data scientist for $105,000 to create a synthetic data set showing over 4.2 million students, prosecutors said.",
      "Javice did not testify during the five-week trial. The jury was expected to begin deliberations on Thursday.",

    "story": [
      "Businesses and lawmakers are trying to address the U.S. affordable housing crisis by turning to alternative ways to build homes",
      "DENVER -- As Americans struggle under backbreaking rental prices, builders are turning to innovative ways to churn out more housing, from 3D printing to assembling homes in an indoor factory to using hemp \u2014 yes, the marijuana cousin \u2014 to make building blocks for walls.",
      "It's a response to the country's shortfall of millions of homes that has led to skyrocketing prices, plunging millions into poverty.",
      "\"There\u2019s not enough homes to purchase and there\u2019s not enough places to rent. Period,\" said Adrianne Todman, the acting secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under former President Joe Biden.",
      "One way to quickly build more is embrace these types of innovations, Todman said. \u201cI can only imagine what our housing situation would be like now if we could have made a decision to be more aggressive in adopting this type of housing.\"",
      "So what are these new ways of building homes? And can they help reduce the cost of new housing, leading to lower rents?",
      "In a cavernous, metal hall, Eric Schaefer stood in front of a long row of modular homes that moved through the plant, similar to a car on an assembly line.",
      "At a series of stations, workers lay flooring, erected framing, added roofs and screwed on drywall. Everything from electrical wiring to plumbing to kitchen countertops were in place before the homes were shrink-wrapped and ready to be shipped.",
      "The business in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, Fading West, has pumped out more than 500 homes in its just over three years of operation, each taking just five to seven days to build, even in the coldest winter months, Schaefer said.",
      "Once assembled in the plant, the narrow townhouse-style homes with white trim, balconies and front porches, are about 90% done. At their final destination they are move-in ready within six weeks, Schaefer said.",
      "The company works with towns, counties and housing nonprofits to help address the shortage of affordable homes, mostly for workers who've been squeezed out by sky-high prices in ritzy mountain towns.",
      "That includes Eagle, Colorado, not far from the Vail ski resort, where Fading West worked with Habitat for Humanity to install modular homes at affordable rents for teachers and other school district employees. The homes tend to be on the smaller side, but can be multifamily or single family.",
      "\u201cYou can build faster. The faster you build \u2014 even at a high quality \u2014 means the lower the price,\u201d Schaefer said. \u201cWe see this as one of the pieces to the puzzle in helping solve the affordable housing crisis.\"",
      "There's a hefty upfront cost to build the factory, and part of the challenge is a lack of state and federal investment, he said. A patchwork of building codes governing how a structure can be built also makes it difficult, requiring changes to the construction depending on the town or county it is being sent to.",
      "Manufactured housing is similar to modular housing, but the units are constructed on a chassis \u2014 like a trailer \u2014 and they aren't subject to the same local building codes. That's part of the reason they are used more broadly across the U.S.",
      "Roughly 100,000 manufactured homes were shipped to states in 2024, up from some 60,000 a decade earlier, according to Census Bureau data. Estimates of modular homes built annually often put them below 20,000.",
      "Yes, there's technology to 3D print homes.",
      "A computer-controlled robotic arm equipped with a hose and nozzle moves back and forth, oozing lines of concrete, one on top of the other, as it builds up the wall of a home. It can go relatively quickly and form curved walls unlike concrete blocks.",
      "Grant Hamel, CEO and co-founder of VeroTouch, stood inside one of the homes his company built, the wall behind him made out of rolling layers of concrete, distinct to a 3D printer. The technology could eventually reduce labor costs and the time it takes to build an abode, but is farther off than manufactured or modular methods from making a dent in the housing crisis.",
      "It's \u201ca long game, to start chipping away at those prices at every step of the construction process,\u201d Hamel said.",
      "The 3D printers are expensive, and so are the engineers and other skilled employees needed to run them, said Ali Memari, director of the Pennsylvania Housing Research Center, whose work has partly focused on 3D printing. It's also not recognized by international building codes, which puts up more red tape.",
      "The technology is also generally restricted to single-story structures, unless traditional building methods are used as well, Memari said",
      "It's \u201ca technology at its beginning, it has room to grow, especially when it is recognized in code,\u201d Memari said. \u201cThe challenges that I mentioned exist, and they have to be addressed by the research community.\u201d",
      "Hemp \u2014 the plant related to marijuana \u2014 is being used more and more in the construction of walls.",
      "The hemp is mixed with other materials, most importantly the mineral lime, forming \"hempcrete,\" a natural insulation that's mold- and fire-resistant and can act as outer wall, insulation and inner wall.",
      "Hempcrete still requires wood studs to frame the walls, but it replaces three wall-building components with just one, said Memari, also a professor at Penn State University's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Memari is now helping oversee research into making hempcrete that doesn't need the wood studs.",
      "As much as a million hemp plants to be used for hempcrete can grow on one acre in a matter of months as opposed to trees, which can take years or decades to grow.",
      "The plant is part of the cannabis family but has far less of the psychoactive component, THC, found in marijuana. In 2018, Congress legalized the production of certain types of hemp. Last year, the International Code Council, which develops international building codes used by all 50 states, adopted hempcrete as an insulation.",
      "Confusion over the legality of growing hemp and the price tag of the machine required to process the plant, called a decorticator, are barriers to hempcrete becoming more widespread in housing construction, Memari said.",
      "Still, he said, \u201chempcrete has a bright future.\"",

      "Just hours after the state Supreme Court rejected Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul's effort to block Elon Musk from handing out $1 million checks on Sunday night, the billionaire took the stage at a town hall in Green Bay and gave away two $1 million checks to attendees in his latest effort to support conservative candidate Brad Schimel.",
      "Urging the crowd to back Schimel, Musk cast Tuesday as \"a vote for which party controls the House of Representatives\" and implied \"the future of civilization\" is at stake.",

      "Notably, the court also rejected a bid from Musk's lawyers to ask two justices, who had campaigned for Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Susan Crawford, to recuse themselves.",
      "The ruling came after an appeals court on Saturday denied Kaul's emergency motion to stop the giveaway from taking place.",

      "However, the judge assigned to the case, the Honorable Columbia County Circuit Court Judge W. Andrew Voigt, refused to hear the lawsuit before Sunday's Green Bay rally with Musk -- prompting Kaul's emergency motion asking a Court of Appeals to take action.",

      "The lawyers also framed the planned Sunday night giveaways as \"spokesperson agreements\" for spokespeople for the PAC.",
      "In the initial lawsuit, shared by Kaul's office, Kaul argued that \"Musk's announcement of his intention to pay $1 million to two Wisconsin electors who attend his event on Sunday night, specifically conditioned on their having voted in the upcoming April 3, 2025, Wisconsin Supreme Court election, is a blatant attempt to violate\" state law, which \"forbids anyone from offering or promising to give anything of value to an elector in order to induce the elector to go to the polls, vote or refrain from voting, or vote for a particular person.\"",
      "The suit asked for a restraining order \"prohibiting Defendants from any further promotion of the million-dollar gifts to attendees of the planned Sunday March 30, 2025,\" as well as a temporary restraining order \"prohibiting Defendants from making any payments to Wisconsin electors to vote,\" and injunctive relief to \"restrain and prohibit all actions by Defendants taken in furtherance of a planned violation\" of the state law.",

      "\"For several weeks now, there has been a U.S. proposal for an unconditional ceasefire,\" Zelenskyy continued. \"And almost every day, in response to this proposal, there are Russian drones, bombs, artillery shelling and ballistic strikes.\"",
      "\"Russia deserves increased pressure -- all the tough measures that can break its capacity to wage war and sustain the system that wants nothing but war,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Sanctions against Russia are essential. More air defense for Ukraine is essential. More cooperation and unity among all partners is essential.\"",
      "President Donald Trump on Sunday hinted at his apparent frustration with the lack of progress toward a peace deal in Ukraine, telling NBC News he was \"very angry\" at Putin after the Russian leader again criticized Zelenskyy and called for his removal in favor of a transitional government.",
      "Trump added that he would consider applying new sanctions on Russia's lucrative oil exports and on any nations purchasing its oil. China and India are among the most significant customers for Russian oil products.",

      "Lithuanian officials say a U.S. armored vehicle that went missing during a training exercise has been retrieved from a swamp after a six-day search but there is still no information about the fate of the four American soldiers who were on board",
      "VILNIUS, Lithuania -- A U.S. armored vehicle that went missing in Lithuania has been retrieved from a swamp after a six-day search but there is still no information about the fate of the four American soldiers who were on board, Lithuanian officials said Monday.",
      "\"The armored vehicle was pulled ashore at 4:40 a.m., the towing operation is complete, Lithuanian Military Police and US investigators continue their work,\u201d Defense Minister Dovil\u0117 \u0160akalien\u0117 said Monday morning in a post on Facebook.",
      "The soldiers were on a training exercise at the massive General Silvestras \u017dukauskas training ground in the town of Pabrad\u0117 when they and their vehicle were reported missing in the early hours of Tuesday morning, the U.S. army said.",
      "\u201cUntil the investigators have more details, we need to stay calm and focused, and keep in mind the sensitivity of the situation and the concerns of the soldiers\u2019 families,\u201d \u0160akalien\u0117 posted on Facebook.",
      "She made clear to reporters that the first information about fate of the soldiers will be delivered by the U.S. army.",
      "The soldiers, all from 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, were conducting tactical training when they went missing.",
      "Hundreds of Lithuanian and U.S. soldiers and rescuers took part in the search through the thick forests and swampy terrain around Pabrad\u0117, which lies just 10 kilometers (6 miles) west of the border with Belarus. The M88 Hercules armored vehicle was discovered on Wedneday submerged in 4.5 meters (15 feet) of water.",
      "A large-scale recovery operation got underway but \u201cwater, thick mud and soft ground around the site have complicated recovery efforts and have required specialized equipment to drain water from the side and stabilize the ground\u201d in order to pull the 70-ton vehicle ashore, the army said.",

    "story": [
      "On \u201cThis Week,\u201d Sen. Mark Warner talks about the Signal chat fallout.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said on Sunday that if information had been leaked from top Trump national security officials' Signal chat discussing plans to strike the Houthis in Yemen, American lives could have been lost.",
      "\"I was, yesterday, down in Hampton Roads. I did two big town halls, Virginia Beach and Chesapeake. There are people in the town hall who are either friends or relatives of folks who are on the [aircraft carrier USS Harry S.] Truman. Those folks were saying if their friends or loved ones were flying those jets and that information had been released and the Houthis were able to change their defensive posture, we could have lost American lives,\" Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in an interview with co-anchor Martha Raddatz on ABC News' \"This Week.\"",
      "On Monday, The Atlantic's editor-in-chief revealed that national security adviser Mike Waltz had inadvertently included him in the chat with top Trump officials discussing plans for the Yemen attack. The Trump administration has pushed back against claims that the information included in the chat was classified information.",
      "Warner said, \"There is no question, regardless of agency, that this was classified ... and those folks who are obfuscating and giving them the benefit of the doubt, I think they're lying about they should know this is classified.\"",
      "Republican Rep. Mike Turner, a former chair of the House Intelligence Committee, and former NATO Supreme Allied Commander James Stavridis also weighed in on the Signal chat on \"This Week.\"",
      "Here are highlights from Warner, Turner and Stavridis' interviews:",
      "Warner on whether the information in the chat was classified",
      "Raddatz: \"There have been very strong denials from the administration that there was anything classified. So quite simply, was this classified information or not?\"",
      "Warner: \"Absolutely. It was of such a nature when you were doing the actual battle plans and the timing, what type of aircraft were being sent out. If you had been a traditional military officer or a CIA caseworker, and you were this sloppy and careless with this classified information, you would be fired, no doubt about it.\"",
      "Warner on Bondi's response",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News that she believes Signal is a secure way to communicate and cannot be hacked by foreign adversaries.",
      "Raddatz: \"Is that true?\"",
      "Warner: \"Signal is safer than your normal cell phones. It is encrypted. But if Ms. Bondi had looked at any of the guidance from the intelligence community which states explicitly do not use Signal for classified information.\"",
      "Raddatz: \"Do you use Signal?\"",
      "Warner: \"I use Signal to talk to someone because it is safer. I actually encourage people to use Signal, but that still doesn't mean because it's safer, you can put classified information. Matter of fact, again, if Ms. Bondi knew anything about her job, she would know that we have reports of China and Russia both trying to break in to Signal.\"",
      "Turner on whether the information in the chat was classified",
      "Raddatz: \"So let me ask you specifically what I asked Senator Warner. Do you think this -- that some of those messages, particularly ones Pete Hegseth sent, were classified?\"",
      "Turner: \"Well, clearly, the subject matter that's being discussed, the status of ongoing military operations, should be and considered classified information. And the -- and it's surprising to find it in an unclassified manner, to find it in this way is -- is surprising. It is not however war plans and at The Atlantic and -- and Goldberg certainly --\"",
      "Raddatz: \"But, is that sort of a word game in a way? They were attack plans. I mean, they said when the -- he said when the F-18s would launch, so is that, you know, war plans, attack plans?\"",
      "Turner: \"They weren't really attack plans. You know they were -- they were on discussions of ongoing military operations. But in that, The Atlantic and Goldberg really did oversell. They really did lose some -- some credibility. But beyond that, it does go to the issue of whether or not, you know, the White House has said that there was no, classified information being discussed. And I think it is surprising, people are struggling with the information that's there because this information really has at its roots, you know, classified content.\"",
      "Raddatz: \"So you say that's possible -- so you're saying it is possible that Pete Hegseth says, when he wrote those messages, it was classified, and then since he said, 'Oh, it's not classified,' and everyone else, it had been declassified?\"",
      "Turner: \"It -- he would have been within his authority. It's something the inspector general will look at.\"",
      "Turner on Hegseth's ability to declassify information",
      "Raddatz: \"So -- so you would say it is classified? Or not?\"",
      "Turner: \"I would say that the White House perhaps it is being legalistic and that the -- the individuals that are discussing this information, certainly, have the ability to declassify the information. And as they made the decision to enter into a declassified conversation, it was perhaps declassified. And that's something I think that goes to --\"",
      "Raddatz: \"By -- by Hegseth?\"",
      "Turner: \"Perhaps. And that goes to the issue of the -- of perhaps what we're going to see in this inspector general investigation that the Senate Armed Services Committee has requested. They've actually asked both the -- to look into the -- the use of Signal across agencies, but also the source of this information. Was this information, when it was given to the individuals, classified in its -- in its nature? How was it given to them? And then what decisions were made? Because it also goes to the issue of judgment. Was it classified when it was given to them? Did they declassify it? But also, what decisions were made, should it have been used in the Signal?\"",
      "Turner on Mike Waltz and Pete Hegseth",
      "Raddatz: \"Do you think there should be some accountability? And do you have confidence in Secretary Hegseth and Mike Waltz going forward?\"",
      "Turner: \"Absolutely. Absolutely. I think they're doing an excellent job. They're incredibly important to our -- our national security. And certainly, there were no -- there was no impact on this operation. It was a great operation and I think they're doing an -- an excellent job.\"",
      "Stavridis on foreign implications on Signal app",
      "Raddatz: \"Admiral, you've had so many important jobs over the years, including senior military assistant to [former Secretary of Defense] Donald Rumsfeld. So, when you look at what happened with that Signal app, do you think that could have put lives at risk?\"",
      "Stavridis: \"I have no doubt that it could have. Anytime you reveal tactical information, you don't know where it ends up. Potentially, Russia, China, could they talk to Iran, which could talk to the Houthis -- absolutely, it would put lives at risk.\"",
      "Raddatz: \"Do you think there should be accountability?\"",
      "Stavridis: \"I believe that's up to the commander in chief himself, the president. I think what there should be immediately is a thorough public and transparent investigation. Where are those cell phones now? What other information, what other conversations were conducted upon them?\"",

    "story": [
      "The costs of the border operation are expected to continue to rise.",
      "The southwestern border mission and the detention operations at Guantanamo Bay have cost close to $330 million through mid-March, according to a U.S. official familiar with information briefed to Congress, as President Donald Trump attempts to fulfill his campaign promise to crack down on illegal immigration in the United States.",
      "The deportation flights and detention operations at Guantanamo Bay, which only held a few hundred detainees at its peak, have cost nearly $40 million of that total.",
      "There are only a few dozen deported migrants currently being held at Guantanamo Bay.",
      "The estimated costs of the operations at the border and at Guantanamo Bay have not been previously reported.",
      "The costs of the southwestern border operation are expected to continue to rise now that additional active-duty forces have continued to move to the border, where there are now more than 10,000 active duty troops as part of the mission on the border with Mexico.",
      "Additional costs will likely include those associated with the new deployments of two U.S. Navy destroyers to that mission.",
      "As of March 12, 2025, the military services had provided a total of $328.5 million in support for the border mission, including deportation flights and deployments to the border, according to a U.S. official familiar with the information briefed to Congress. Of that total, $289.2 million was for border security operations and $39.3 million was for the operations at Guantanamo Bay.",
      "The cost at Guantanamo Bay is extremely high given the only several hundred detainees have been sent there -- even though Trump had said tent cities there could hold as many as 30,000 deported migrants.",
      "\"There's a lot of space to accommodate a lot of people,\" Trump said of using Guantanamo Bay to house migrants on Feb. 4 after he signed an executive order to send migrants there on Jan. 29. \"So we're going to use it. ... I'd like to get them out. It would be all subject to the laws of our land, and we're looking at that to see if we can.\"",
      "Detainees with criminal records were housed at the detention facility that had been used to house enemy combatants from the War on Terror, and others were placed at the Migrant Operations Center that could only house 50 migrants.",
      "Plans called for a tent city adjoining that migrant facility to be built that could house the numbers mentioned by Trump and other senior administration officials.",
      "However, operations have come nowhere close to that as the phased construction initially envisioned building tent facilities for 2,500 people -- but only 195 tents capable of housing 500 people have been built. And they have not been used at all because they did not meet U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention standards, such as including air conditioning.",
      "On Friday, a delegation of Senate Democrats visited the migrant detention operations at Guantanamo Bay and later criticized what they called the \"scale and wastefulness of the Trump Administration's misuse of our military.\"",
      "\"The staggering financial cost to fly these immigrants out of the United States and detain them at Guantanamo Bay -- a mission worth tens of millions of dollars a month -- is an insult to American taxpayers,\" Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee, who sponsored the visit, said in a statement.",
      "\"President Trump could implement his immigration policies for a fraction of the cost by using existing ICE facilities in the U.S., but he is obsessed with the image of using Guantanamo, no matter the cost,\" it added.",
      "ICE has its own fleet of chartered aircraft that are used for deportation flights that cost about $8,577 an hour, according to its website. In contrast, the flights to Guantanamo Bay were conducted on C-130Js and C-17s.",
      "The U.S. Transportation Command said it costs $20,000 per flight hour for C-130Js and $28,500 per flight hour for C-17s -- and a one-way flight Guantanamo from El Paso, Texas is about 4 1/2 hours on a C-17 and six hours on a C-130J, allowing costs to add up quickly.",
      "U.S. Transportation Command has also carried out deportation flights to Honduras, Guatemala, Ecuador, Peru, India and Panama. The most recent military flight occurred on Friday, when a military deportation flight landed in Guatemala.",
      "ABC News reported last week that 21 deported migrants had been sent to Guantanamo Bay aboard a civilian flight coordinated by ICE, the first detainees to arrive there since the earlier removal of all 41 detainees at Guantanamo Bay to a detention center in Louisiana.",
      "In late February, the 178 detainees at Guantanamo Bay at that time were flown out, with 176 returning to their home country of Venezuela and two others returned to the United States.",

      "Federal judges in D.C. on Friday partially blocked two executive orders signed by President Donald Trump targeting the Jenner and Block and WilmerHale law firms -- temporarily halting Trump's attempts to punish prominent law firms associated with his political foes.",
      "In a lawsuit brought by Jenner and Block, D.C. District Judge John Bates described Trump's executive order \u2014 which aims to strip the firms' attorneys of any security clearances they may hold and severely restrict any business they may have before the federal government \u2014 as \"troubling\" and \"disturbing.\" He said it targets the firm's and its employees' First Amendment rights and rights to due process.",
      "Bates, an appointee of former President George W. Bush, temporarily enjoined the administration from enforcing aspects of the order that seek to restrict government officials from engaging with officials from Jenner and Block, after he said the government failed to provide any substantive answers as to how employees from the firm threaten national security.",
      "The judge said that attorneys representing Jenner and Block showed that they were likely being targeted on the basis of their protected free speech rights, and that they would suffer irreparable economic harm if it were fully implemented.",
      "Later Friday, Judge Richard Leon also granted a temporary restraining order partially enjoining another executive order signed by Trump targeting the law firm WilmerHale.",
      "Leon, also an appointee of former President George W. Bush, said several parts of Trump's order clearly show \"retaliatory actions based on perceived viewpoint\" of employees of WilmerHale.",
      "\"There is no doubt this retaliatory action chills speech and legal advocacy, or that it qualifies as a constitutional harm,\" Leon said in his written order, following a hearing late Friday.",
      "Leon is now the third federal judge to largely accept arguments from law firms targeted by Trump that his orders are likely unconstitutional \u2014 and that if implemented, Leon said, WilmerHale \"faces crippling losses and its very survival is at stake.\"",
      "Both law firms filed suit in D.C. federal court on Friday to block the executive orders -- the same day another major law firm struck a $100 million deal to preemptively avoid a similar Trump executive order.",
      "The lawsuits accuse Trump of engaging in a sweeping campaign to intimidate major law firms who have represented plaintiffs currently suing the administration, or who have represented or at one point employed those he dislikes.",
      "The Trump executive order threatened their futures as well as \"the legal system itself,\" Jenner and Block said in its lawsuit.",
      "\"These orders send a clear message to the legal profession: Cease certain representations adverse to the government and renounce the Administration's critics -- or suffer the consequences,\" the Jenner and Block suit said. \"The orders also attempt to pressure businesses and individuals to question or even abandon their associations with their chosen counsel, and to chill bringing legal challenges at all.\"",
      "The two firms are the latest firms seeking to counter what has been a rapid onslaught by the White House seeking to target individual firms that have hired or otherwise represented Trump's political enemies.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump said on Friday that the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom struck a deal to avoid one of his executive orders by providing $100 million in pro bono work during the Trump administration -- among other guarantees.",
      "The move has sent shockwaves through the legal community. The White House is prepared to target more big law firms, sources tell ABC News, and there are ongoing discussions among top advisers on strategy associated with possibly entering into negotiations with more of them.",
      "Legal scholars have said there is little legal precedent for Trump's war on Big Law, which has created a chilling effect across the legal community, and most will certainly have a chilling effect on his opponents who will need legal representation against him.",
      "The firms' legal actions come on the heels of successful effort by the law firm Perkins Coie, which earlier this month secured a court order blocking similar executive action signed by Trump.",

    "summary": "Denmark is open to discussions with the U.S. on how to \"fix\" the status quo in Greenland, the country's foreign minister said, after Vice President JD Vance's visit.",
    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance said Denmark had failed to ensure Greenland's security.",
      "LONDON -- Denmark is open to discussions with the U.S. on how to \"fix\" the status quo in Greenland, the country's foreign minister said, after Vice President JD Vance accused Copenhagen of failing to adequately protect the Arctic island during a controversial visit on Friday.",
      "In a post to X addressed to Denmark's \"dear American friends\" late Friday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said his nation agrees that the \"status quo\" in the Arctic \"is not an option.\"",
      "\"So let's talk about how we can fix it -- together,\" Rasmussen wrote.",
      "In a video statement, Rasmussen acknowledged the \"many accusations and many allegations\" about Greenland. \"Of course, we are open to criticism, but let me be completely honest -- we do not appreciate the tone in which it's being delivered.\"",
      "\"This is not how you speak to your close allies,\" Rasmussen continued, \"and I still consider Denmark and the United States to be close allies.\"",
      "Danish and Greenlandic leaders have pushed back on Trump's desire to gain control of Greenland. They have simultaneously criticized his perceived overreach while seeking to ease tensions by proposing deeper military and economic cooperation on the Arctic landmass.",
      "\"We respect that the United States needs a greater military presence in Greenland, as Vice President Vance mentioned this evening. We -- Denmark and Greenland -- are very much open to discussing this with you,\" Rasmussen said in his statement.",
      "The existing bilateral defense agreement -- signed in 1951 -- \"offers ample opportunity for the United States to have a much stronger military presence in Greenland,\" Rasmussen said. \"If that is what you wish, then let us discuss it.\"",
      "President Donald Trump has repeatedly -- both in his first term and since returning to office for his second -- expressed his ambition to take control of the island. Rasmussen's appeal for dialogue came shortly after Vance completed his visit to Greenland, which is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.",
      "Speaking to American service members at the U.S. Pituffik Space Base on the northwestern coast of Greenland, Vance said, \"Well, the president said we have to have Greenland. And I think that we do have to be more serious about the security of Greenland.\"",
      "\"We can't just ignore this place,\" he continued. \"We can't just ignore the president's desires.\"",
      "Vance said Trump's administration \"respects the self-determination of the people of Greenland,\" but suggested the island would be safer under the U.S. security umbrella.",
      "Greenland is already covered by the Article 5 collective defense clause that underpins NATO, of which both Denmark and the U.S. are members.",
      "\"Yes, the people of Greenland are going to have self-determination,\" Vance said. \"We hope that they choose to partner with the United States because we're the only nation on Earth that will respect their sovereignty and respect their security -- because their security is very much our security.\"",
      "Vance accused Denmark of failing to provide adequate security against \"very aggressive incursions from Russia, from China and from other nations.\"",
      "\"Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland. You have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change,\" he said.",
      "Rasmussen said that both Denmark and the U.S. had done too little in the Arctic since the end of the Cold War. \"We all acted on the assumption that the Arctic was and should be a low tension area, but that time is over,\" he said. \"Status quo is not am option.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly expressed his ambition to acquire Greenland, despite fierce criticism from leaders in Greenland, Denmark and Europe. There appears little support among Greenlanders for his proposal. A January poll by Verian, commissioned by the Danish paper Berlingske, showed that only 6% of Greenlanders are in favor of becoming part of the U.S., with 9% undecided.",
      "The island sits in a strategic position facing the northern coast of Russia across the Arctic Ocean and close to two shipping routes -- the Northeast and Northwest passages. Greenland is also thought to be home to a large amount of valuable mineral deposits. Both the shipping routes and minerals are expected to become more accessible as the warming climate causes sea ice to recede further.",
      "\"We have to have Greenland. It's not a question of: Do you think we can do without it? We can't,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Friday. \"If you look at Greenland right now, if you look at the waterways, you have Chinese and Russian ships all over the place, and we're not going to be able to do that.\"",
      "\"We're not relying on Denmark or anybody else to take care of that situation,\" he added. \"And we're not talking about peace for the United States.\"",
      "\"Greenland's very important for the peace of the world -- not us, the peace of the entire world,\" the president said. \"And I think Denmark understands it. I think the European Union understands it. And if they don't, we're going to have to explain it to them.\"",

    "summary": "The judge's order requires the Trump administration to reinstate terminated CFPB employees among other steps.",
    "story": [
      "The agency has been targeted for elimination by President Donald Trump.",
      "A federal judge is blocking the dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, finding the Trump administration acted \"completely in violation of law\" when it attempted to quickly shutter the organization.",
      "Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued a preliminary injunction Friday afternoon that requires the Trump administration to reinstate any terminated CFPB employees, rescind the cancellation of any contracts, allow the workforce to access their computers and return to the office, resume statutorily required work and maintain any records held by the organization.",
      "\"If the defendants are not enjoined, they will eliminate the agency before the Court has the opportunity to decide whether the law permits them to do it, and as the defendants' own witness warned, the harm will be irreparable,\" Judge Jackson wrote.",
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, created by Congress to safeguard Americans against unfair business practices in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, has been targeted for elimination by President Donald Trump as part of his efforts to slash the federal government.",
      "Trump has said the CFPB is \"very important to get rid of\" and that the organization was \"set up to destroy some very good people.\"",
      "In her ruling, Judge Jackson said the Trump administration acted in \"complete disregard\" for Congress when it attempted to unilaterally dismantle the agency.",
      "Their efforts to dismantle the organization continued even after Judge Jackson in February ordered the Trump administration to not fire the majority of the agency's employees, she wrote.",
      "\"Absent an injunction freezing the status quo \u2013 preserving the agency's data, its operational capacity, and its workforce \u2013 there is a substantial risk that the defendants will complete the destruction of the agency completely in violation of law well before the Court can rule on the merits, and it will be impossible to rebuild,\" she wrote.",
      "Judge Jackson also criticized the Trump administration for scrambling to change course after she began examining the effort to wind down operations.",
      "According to Jackson, the government's claim that the CFPB was still performing its legally required duties was \"nothing more than window dressing\" to hide what was happening to shutter the organization.",
      "\"The defendants are still engaged in an effort to implement a Presidential plan to shut the agency down entirely and to do it fast,\" Judge Jackson.",
      "In court proceedings, Trump administration officials claimed the stop-work order that sent the vast majority of employees home was a \"common practice at the beginning of a new administration\" and Justice Department lawyers insisted the Trump administration is trying to improve the CFPB, not destroy it.",
      "Judge Jackson specifically called out the irreparable harm done to one of the plaintiffs who brought the lawsuit, Pastor Eva Steege, who sought help from the CFPB to forgive her public service loans before she died. With the Trump administration dismantling the CFPB as she requested help, Steege never got an appointment with the CFPB, according to her lawyers.",
      "\"If I do not receive public service loan forgiveness and the large refund that I am owed before my death, my family could be forced to pursue a death discharge that will not provide them with the refund that they are counting on so that they can use the money for basic needs after I pass,\" Steege said in a sworn declaration.",
      "She died on March 15, and her loans were never discharged.",
      "\"The irreparable harm that has already come to pass for Pastor Eva Steege is enough to grant preliminary relief,\" Judge Jackson wrote.",

You have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change,\" he said.",
      "The vice president and second lady Usha Vance arrived in Greenland on Friday for a scaled-back visit to the Pituffik Space Base, where he delivered remarks and received briefings after the couple greeted U.S. service members stationed there. While meeting with service members, J.D. Vance noted he is the first vice president to visit Greenland, saying it is \"a pretty cool thing,\" before giving an overview of the visit.",
      "\"We're talk to the command and some of the Guardians about what exactly the base does and all the important ways it contributes to national security. We're going to get a briefing, of course, about, you know, what you guys do every day,\" he said.",
      "The vice president said he was told that assignment to the base was a one-year, unaccompanied assignment, meaning service members are not able to bring their families along.",
      "\"So I know it's a lot of sacrifices, spending a year away from your families, but the mission is really important,\" he added. \"The Trump administration, the president is really interested in Arctic security. As you all know, that's a big issue, and it's only going to get bigger over the coming decades. So thanks for doing what you do.\"",
      "The Vances were joined on the trip by national security adviser Mike Waltz, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Sen. Mike Lee. The trip was originally planned as a visit by the second lady to attend a dogsled race, but that plan was scrapped after heavy criticism.",
      "Wright told Fox News on Thursday that Greenland has tried for years to interest U.S. mining companies to develop resources there because there's not enough infrastructure to make mining economical.",
      "\"So, heck, maybe that is going to happen,\" he said. \"I think that is in the best interest of Greenland and Greenlanders, and they have expressed that for years. If the United States can have the right cooperation, I think capital can flow there, which would bring jobs and economic opportunity to Greenland and critical minerals and resources to the United States -- a win for both sides.\"",
      "The idea of Greenland becoming part of the U.S. is opposed by many in Greenland and Denmark, of which Greenland is an autonomous territory.",
      "Usha Vance was originally scheduled to make the trip to learn about Greenland's cultural heritage and attend the race before it was announced that the vice president, Waltz and Wright would join her. The trip was later scaled back to just a visit to the space base.",
      "J.D. Vance and Waltz are at the center of the scandal over the purported conversation discussing the attack on Houthi rebels in Yemen over the commercially available Signal app that inadvertently included The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg, who reported details of the conversation on Monday.",

      "A New Mexico court is weighing whether to block the disclosure of an array of records from an investigation into the deaths of actor Gene Hackman and wife, Betsy Arakawa",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- A New Mexico court is weighing whether to block the disclosure of an array of records from an investigation into the deaths of actor Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, at the request of the couple\u2019s estate.",
      "Santa Fe-based Judge Matthew Wilson scheduled a hearing Monday to consider a request from estate representative Julia Peters to seal photos, video and documents to protect the family\u2019s constitutional right to privacy. The court put a temporary hold on the release of records pending the hearing.",
      "The partially mummified remains of Hackman and Arakawa were found in their Santa Fe home on Feb. 26, when maintenance and security workers showed up at the home and alerted police. Authorities have confirmed Hackman, 95, died of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease about a week after his wife's death. Hackman may have been unaware Arakawa, 65, was dead.",
      "Her cause of death was listed as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which is a rare, rodent-borne disease.",
      "New Mexico\u2019s open records law blocks public access to sensitive images, including depictions of dead bodies. Experts also say some medical information is not considered public record under the state Inspection of Public Records Act.",
      "Peters has emphasized the possibly shocking nature of photographs and video in the investigation and potential for their dissemination by media in the bid to block them from being released.",
      "The Hackman family estate's lawsuit also seeks to block the release of autopsy reports by the Office of the Medical Investigator and death investigation reports by the Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office.",
      "The bulk of death investigations by law enforcement and autopsy reports by medical investigators are typically considered public records under state law in the spirit of ensuring government transparency and accountability.",
      "Authorities unraveled the mysterious circumstances of the couple's deaths and described their conclusions at a March 7 news conference without releasing most related written and photographic records.",
      "One of the couple\u2019s three dogs, a kelpie mix named Zinna, also was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Arakawa. Two other dogs survived.",
      "The written request to seal the records notes the couple placed \u201ca significant value on their privacy and took affirmative vigilant steps\u201d to safeguard it during their lives, including after they moved to Santa Fe and Hackman retired. The state capital is known as a refuge for celebrities, artists and authors.",
      "Arakawa had no children, while Hackman is survived by three children from a previous marriage. Privacy likely also will play a role as the couple\u2019s estate is settled. According to probate court documents, Hackman signed an updated will in 2005 leaving his estate to his wife, while the will she signed that same year directed her estate to him. With both of them dying, management of the estate is in Peters' hands.",
      "A request is pending to appoint a trustee to administer assets in two trusts associated with the estate. Without trust documents being made public, it\u2019s unclear who the beneficiaries are and how the assets will be divided.",
      "Attorneys who specialize in estate planning in New Mexico say it\u2019s possible more details could come out if there were any legal disputes over the assets. Even then, they said, the parties likely would ask the court to seal the documents.",

      "\u201cThis is extremely concerning and painful, not only to the City of New York in general, but specifically to a very close knit community,\u201d Adams said. \u201cA mother gone for a simple stroll on a sunny day was struck and killed.

      "Wisconsin\u2019s attorney general has asked the liberal-controlled state Supreme Court to stop billionaire Elon Musk from handing over $1 million checks to two voters",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Wisconsin's attorney general on Sunday asked the liberal-controlled state Supreme Court to stop billionaire Elon Musk from handing over $1 million checks to two voters, an appeal that came hours before President Donald Trump's ally planned the giveaway at an evening rally.",
      "An appeals court on Saturday rejected the legal challenge by Democrat Josh Kaul, who argues that Musk's offer violates a state law prohibiting giving anything of value in exchange for a vote.",
      "Wisconsin's tightly contested Supreme Court election, where ideological control of the court is at stake, is on Tuesday. Liberals currently hold a 4-3 majority.",
      "At Musk's rally scheduled in Green Bay at 7:30 p.m. EST, he promised to hand over a pair of $1 million checks to voters who signed an online petition against \u201cactivist\u201d judges.",
      "Trump and Musk are backing Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel in the Supreme Court race, while Democrats are behind Dane County Judge Susan Crawford. Trump and groups he supports have spent more than $20 million to help Schimel get elected.",
      "Crawford's campaign declined to comment Sunday on the appeal.",
      "The justices who are being asked to decide the matter include the liberal incumbent whose retirement this year set up the race for an open seat and control of the court. The contest has shattered national spending records for a judicial election, with more than $81 million in spending.",
      "Musk\u2019s political action committee used a nearly identical tactic before the presidential election last year, offering to pay $1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states who signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. A judge in Pennsylvania said prosecutors failed to show the effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day.",
      "The appeals court said Saturday that the attorney general, in a \u201cminimally developed legal argument,\u201d failed to show that he was entitled to an order blocking Musk. The court also noted that Kaul alleged that the Columbia County Circuit Court had refused to hear his lawsuit, but he provided no details about the court\u2019s action.",
      "There is no entry for the county court's decision in the state\u2019s online court database and neither Kaul\u2019s office nor the state court office has provided any documentation to The Associated Press of the court\u2019s actions which came after business hours on Friday night.",
      "\u201cWe are not permitted to be the first court to decide whether the respondents are engaged in the conduct that is alleged, or to decide the legal status of that conduct,\u201d the appeals court said.",
      "Musk on Friday initially said in a post on his social media platform, X, that he planned to \u201cpersonally hand over\u201d $2 million to a pair of voters who have already cast their ballots in the race.",
      "Musk later posted a clarification, saying the money would go to people who will be \u201cspokesmen\u201d for an online petition against \u201cactivist\u201d judges. After first saying the event would only be open to people who had voted in the Supreme Court race, he said attendance would be limited to those who have signed the petition.",
      "Also on Friday, Musk\u2019s political action committee identified the recipient of its first $1 million giveaway \u2014 a Green Bay man who had donated to the Wisconsin GOP and the conservative candidate in the court race, and who has a history of posting support for Trump and his agenda.",
      "The judicial election comes as Wisconsin's highest court is expected to rule on abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting rules that could affect the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election in the state.",

    "story": [
      "In the early part of his second term, President Donald Trump has taken action against individuals, law firms, private corporations, media companies and universities he regards as adversaries",
      "WASHINGTON -- The executive order directed at one of the country's most prestigious law firms followed a well-worn playbook as President Donald Trump roared down the road to retribution.",
      "Reaching beyond government, Trump has set out to impose his will across a broad swath of American life, from individuals who have drawn his ire to institutions known for their own flexes of power and intimidation.",
      "Which is how the Paul Weiss, a storied New York law firm that since its 1875 birth has advanced the cause of civil rights, shepherded the legal affairs of corporate power brokers and grown into a multi-billion-dollar multinational enterprise, came to learn it was in trouble. The reason: One of its former attorneys had investigated Trump as a Manhattan prosecutor.",
      "Trump ordered that federal security clearances of the firm's attorneys be reviewed for suspension, federal contracts terminated and employee access to federal buildings restricted. Yet the decree was soon averted in the most Trumpian of ways: with a deal.",
      "After a White House meeting with the firm's chairman yielded a series of commitments, including $40 million worth of legal work to support administration causes, the executive order was rescinded, but not without a backlash from a legal community that saw the resolution as a capitulation.",
      "The episode showed not only Trump's use of the power of the presidency to police dissent and punish adversaries but also his success in extracting concessions from law firms, academia, Silicon Valley and corporate boardrooms. These targets were suddenly made to fear for their futures in the face of a retribution campaign that has been a defining feature of his first two months in office.",
      "Just one day after Paul Weiss' deal, Columbia University disclosed policy changes under the threat of losing billions of dollars in federal money. A week later, the venerable law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom cut a deal of its own before it could be hit by an executive order. Before that, ABC News and Meta reached multi-million-dollar settlements to resolve lawsuits from Trump.",
      "\u201cThe more of them that cave, the more extortion that that invites,\u201d said Ty Cobb, a White House lawyer in Trump\u2019s first term who has since become a sharp critic. \u201cYou\u2019ll see other universities and other law firms and other enemies of Trump assaulted and attacked into submission because of that.\"",
      "Some within the conservative legal community, by contrast, say the Republican president is acting within his right.",
      "\u201cIt's the president's prerogative to instruct the executive branch to do business with companies, law firms or contractors that he deems trustworthy \u2014 and the converse is true too,\u201d said Jay Town, a U.S. attorney from Alabama during Trump's first term. \u201cThe president, as the commander in chief, can determine who gets a clearance and who doesn't. It's as simple as that.\u201d",
      "Some targets have not given in, with two law firms since the Paul Weiss deal suing to block executive orders. Yet no matter their response, the sanctioned firms have generally run afoul of the White House by virtue of association with prosecutors who previously investigated Trump.",
      "If the negotiations have been surprising, consider that Trump telegraphed his approach during the campaign. \u201cFor those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution,\" he told supporters in March 2023.",
      "Less clear was: Retribution for what exactly? Against whom? By what means?",
      "The answers would come soon enough.",
      "Fresh off surviving four federal and state indictments that threatened to sink his political career, and investigations that shadowed his first term in office, Trump came straight for the prosecutors who investigated him and the elite firms he saw as sheltering them.",
      "His Justice Department moved almost immediately to fire the members of special counsel Jack Smith's team and some prosecutors who handled cases arising from the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "The White House followed up with an executive order that stripped security clearances from the lawyers at the law firm of Covington & Burling who have provided legal representation for Smith amid the threat of government investigations. Covington has said it looks forward to \"defending Mr. Smith's interests.\"",
      "A subsequent order punished Perkins Coie for its representation of then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign and its part in funding opposition research on Trump that took the form of a dossier containing unsubstantiated allegations about Trump's ties to Russia.",
      "Its business hanging in the balance, Perkins Coie hired Williams & Connolly, a Washington firm with an aggressive litigation style, to challenge the order. A federal judge said the administration\u2019s action sent \u201cchills down my spine\" and blocked portions of it from taking effect. That decision could have been a meaningful precedent for other beleaguered firms.",
      "Except that's not what happened next.",
      "The chairman of Paul Weiss said it, too, was initially prepared to sue over a March 14 order that targeted the firm in part because a former partner, Mark Pomerantz, had several years earlier overseen an investigation into Trump\u2019s finances on behalf of the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office.",
      "But the firm also came to believe that even a courtroom victory would not erase the perception among clients that it was \u201cpersona non grata\u201d with the administration, its chairman, Brad Karp, later told colleagues in an email obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The order, Karp said, presented an \u201cexistential crisis\u201d for a firm that has counted among its powerhouse representations the NFL and ExxonMobil. Some of its clients signaled they might abandon ship. The hoped-for support from fellow firms never materialized and some even sought to exploit Paul Weiss' woes, Karp said.",
      "\u201cIt was very likely that our firm would not be able to survive a protracted dispute with the Administration,\u201d he wrote.",
      "When the opportunity came for a White House meeting and the chance to cut a deal, he took it, pledging pro bono legal services for causes such as the fight against antisemitism as well as representation without regard to clients' political affiliation. In so doing, he wrote, \u201cwe have quickly solved a seemingly intractable problem and removed a cloud of uncertainty that was hanging over our law firm.\u201d",
      "The outcry was swift. Lawyers outside the firm ridiculed it. More than 140 Paul Weiss alumni signed a letter assailing the capitulation.",
      "\u201cInstead of a ringing defense of the values of democracy, we witnessed a craven surrender to, and thus complicity in, what is perhaps the gravest threat to the independence of the legal profession since at least the days of Senator Joseph McCarthy,\" the letter said.",
      "Within days, two other firms, Jenner & Block and WilmerHale, were confronted with executive orders over their affiliation with prosecutors on Robert Mueller's special counsel team that investigated Trump during his first term. Both sued Friday. WilmerHale, where Mueller is a retired partner, said the order was an \u201cunprecedented assault\u201d on the legal system. After hearing arguments, judges blocked enforcement of key portions of both orders.",
      "Yet that very day, the White House trumpeted a fresh deal with Skadden Arps in which the firm agreed to provide $100 million of pro bono legal services and to disavow the use of diversity, employment and inclusion considerations in its hiring practices.",
      "Trump has expressed satisfaction with his pressure campaign, issuing a directive to sanction lawyers who are seen as bringing \u201cfrivolous\u201d litigation against the government. Universities, he marveled, are \u201cbending and saying \u2018Sir, thank you very much, we appreciate it.'\u201d",
      "As for law firms, he said, \u201cThey\u2019re just saying, \u2018Where do I sign?\u2019 Nobody can believe it.'\u201d",
      "Uptown from Paul Weiss's Midtown Manhattan home base, another elite New York institution was facing its own crucible.",
      "Trump had taken office against the backdrop of disruptive protests at Columbia University tied to Israel's war with Hamas. The turmoil prompted the resignation of its president and made the Ivy League school a target of critics who said an overly permissive campus environment had let antisemitic rhetoric flourish.",
      "The Trump administration this month arrested a prominent Palestinian activist and legal permanent resident in his university-owned apartment building and opened an investigation into whether Columbia hid students sought by the U.S. over their involvement in the demonstrations.",
      "In a separate action, the administration pulled $400 million from Columbia, canceling grants and contracts because of what the government said was the school's failure to stamp out antisemitism and demanding a series of changes as a condition for restoring the money or for even considering doing so.",
      "Two weeks later, the then-interim university president, Katrina Armstrong, announced that she would implement nearly all of the changes sought by the White House. Columbia would bar students from protesting in academic buildings, she said, adopt a new definition of antisemitism and put its Middle East studies department under new supervision.",
      "The university's March 21 rollout of reforms did not challenge the Trump administration's coercive tactics, but nodded to what it said were \u201clegitimate concerns\u201d raised about antisemitism. The White House has yet to say if it will restore the money.",
      "The Columbia resolution was condemned by some faculty members and free speech advocates.",
      "\u201cColumbia\u2019s capitulation endangers academic freedom and campus expression nationwide,\u201d Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement at the time.",
      "Armstrong on Friday night announced her exit from the position and her return to her post atop the school\u2019s medical center.",
      "Columbia is not Trump's sole target in academia. Also this month, the administration suspended about $175 million in federal funding for the University of Pennsylvania over a transgender swimmer who last competed for the school in 2022.",
      "Trump had not even taken office on Jan. 20 when one legal fight that could have followed him into office abruptly faded.",
      "In December, ABC News agreed to pay $15 million toward Trump\u2019s presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos\u2019 inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "The following month, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, agreed to pay $25 million to settle a lawsuit filed by  Trump against the company after it suspended his accounts following the Jan. 6 riot.",
      "The agreement followed a visit by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to Trump's private Florida club to try to mend fences. Such a trip may have seemed unlikely in Trump's first term, or after the Capitol siege made him, briefly, a pariah within his own party. But it's something other technology, business and government officials have done.",
      "The administration, meanwhile, has taken action against news organizations whose coverage it disagrees with. The White House last month removed Associated Press reporters and photographers from the small group of journalists who follow the president in the pool and other events after the news agency declined to follow Trump\u2019s executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico; a suit by the AP is pending.",
      "And the administration has sought to dismantle Voice of America, a U.S. government-funded international news service. On Friday, a federal judge halted plans to fire more than 1,200 journalists, engineers and other staff who were sidelined after Trump ordered a funding cut.",

      "President Donald Trump says \u201cLiberation Day\u201d is coming",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump says Wednesday will be \u201cLiberation Day\" \u2014 a moment when he plans to roll out a set of tariffs that he promises will free the United States from foreign goods.",
      "The details of Trump's next round of import taxes are still sketchy. Most economic analyses say average U.S. families would have to absorb the cost of his tariffs in the form of higher prices and lower incomes. But an undeterred Trump is inviting CEOs to the White House to say they are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in new projects to avoid the import taxes.",
      "It is also possible that the tariffs are short-lived if Trump feels he can cut a deal after imposing them.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m certainly open to it, if we can do something,\" Trump told reporters. \"We\u2019ll get something for it.\u201d",
      "At stake are family budgets, America's prominence as the world's leading financial power and the structure of the global economy.",
      "Here's what you should know about the impending trade penalties:",
      "He wants to announce import taxes, including \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs that would match the rates charged by other countries and account for other subsidies. Trump has talked about taxing the European Union, South Korea, Brazil and India, among other countries.",
      "As he announced 25% auto tariffs last week, he alleged that America has been ripped off because it imports more goods than it exports.",
      "\u201cThis is the beginning of Liberation Day in America,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs, taking our wealth, taking a lot of things that they\u2019ve been taking over the years. They\u2019ve taken so much out of our country, friend and foe. And, frankly, friend has been oftentimes much worse than foe.\u201d",
      "In an interview Saturday with NBC News, Trump said it did not bother him if tariffs caused vehicle prices to rise because autos with more U.S. content could possibly be more competitively priced.",
      "\"I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars,\" Trump said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less because if the prices on foreign cars go up, they\u2019re going to buy American cars.\u201d",
      "Trump has also suggested that he will be flexible with his tariffs, saying he will treat other nations better than they treated the United States. But he still has plenty of other taxes coming on imports.",
      "The Republican president plans to tax imported pharmaceutical drugs, copper and lumber. He has put forth a 25% tariff on any country that imports oil from Venezuela, even though the United States also does so. Imports from China are being charged an additional 20% tax because of its role in fentanyl production. Trump has imposed separate tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico for the stated reason of stopping drug smuggling and illegal immigration. Trump also expanded his 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs to 25% on all imports.",
      "Some aides suggest the tariffs are tools for negotiation on trade and border security; others say the revenues will help reduce the federal budget deficit. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick says they will force other nations to show Trump \u201crespect.\u201d",
      "Nothing good, according to most economists. They say the tariffs would get passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices for autos, groceries, housing and other goods. Corporate profits could be lower and growth more sluggish. Trump maintains that more companies would open factories to avoid the taxes, though that process could take three years or more.",
      "Economist Art Laffer estimates the tariffs on autos, if fully implemented, could increase per vehicle costs by $4,711, though he said he views Trump as a smart and savvy negotiator. The investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the economy will grow this quarter at an annual rate of just 0.6%, down from a rate of 2.4% at the end of last year.",
      "Mayor Andrew Ginther of Columbus, Ohio, said on Friday that tariffs could increase the median cost of a home by $21,000, making affordability more of an obstacle because building materials would cost more.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has suggested that tariffs would be a one-time price adjustment, rather than the start of an inflationary spiral. But Bessent's conclusion rests on tariffs being brief or contained, rather than leading other countries to retaliate with their own tariffs or seeping into other sectors of the economy.",
      "\u201cThere is a chance tariffs on goods begin to filter through to the pricing of services,\u201d said Samuel Rines, a strategist at WisdomTree. \u201cAuto parts get move expensive, then auto repair gets more expensive, then auto insurance feels the pressure. While goods are the focus, tariffs could have a longer-term effect on inflation.\u201d",
      "Most foreign leaders see the tariffs as destructive for the global economy, even if they are prepared to impose their own countermeasures.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Trump's tariff threats had ended the partnership between his country and the United States, even as the president on Friday talked about his phone call with Carney in relatively positive terms. Canada already has announced retaliatory tariffs.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said the tariffs were \u201cnot coherent\u201d and would mean \"breaking value chains, creating inflation in the short term and destroying jobs. It\u2019s not good for the American economy, nor for the European, Canadian or Mexican economies.\u201d Yet Macron said his nation would defend itself with the goal of dismantling the tariffs.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has avoided the tit-for-tat responses on tariffs, but she sees it as critical to defend jobs in her country.",
      "The Chinese government said Trump's tariffs would harm the global trading system and would not fix the economic challenges identified by Trump.",
      "\u201cThere are no winners in trade wars or tariff wars, and no country\u2019s development and prosperity are achieved through imposing tariffs,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said.",
      "Based off Trump's public statements, April 2 is at least the third \u201cliberation day\u201d that he has identified.",
      "At a rally last year in Nevada, he said the day of the presidential election, Nov. 5, would be \u201cLiberation Day in America.\u201d He later gave his inauguration the same label, declaring in his address: \u201cFor American citizens, Jan. 20, 2025, is Liberation Day.\u201d",
      "His repeated designation of the term is a sign of just how much importance Trump places on tariffs, an obsession of his since the 1980s. Dozens of other countries recognize their own form of liberation days to recognize events such as overcoming Nazi Germany or the end of a previous political regime deemed oppressive.",
      "Trump sees his tariffs as providing national redemption, but the slumping consumer confidence and stock market indicate that much of the public believes the U.S. economy will pay the price for his ambitions.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see anything positive about Liberation Day,\" said Phillip Braun, a finance professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. \u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt the U.S. economy. Other countries are going to retaliate.\u201d",

      "At least half of U.S. states now outlaw devices that can convert pistols into machine guns",
      "In New Mexico, police and prosecutors backed an effort to outlaw devices that convert pistols into machine guns. In Alabama, the governor made it a priority.",
      "Lawmakers in both states \u2014 one led by Democrats, the other by Republicans \u2014 responded this year with new laws making so-called Glock switches illegal.",
      "At least half of U.S. states now have similar laws prohibiting the possession of such devices, a list that has grown over the past decade as law enforcement officers have found more of the tiny yet powerful devices attached to guns.",
      "States are mimicking federal law, which for for decades has generally prohibited machine guns and any parts that can transform semiautomatic weapons into automatic ones.",
      "U.S. law defines a machine gun as a weapon that automatically fires more than one shot with a single pull of a trigger. The definition also includes any parts designed to convert a weapon into a machine gun.",
      "Federal law prohibits possessing machine guns made after 1986, with some exceptions for law enforcement, the military and certain licensed dealers. Nearly all conversion devices are illegal because they were made more recently.",
      "People convicted of possessing machine guns and conversion devices can face up to 10 years in prison.",
      "A Glock switch is one type of a machine gun conversion device. It's a metal or plastic piece, about the size of a coin, that attaches to the back of Glock pistol, a brand that is popular with both police and criminals. The switch interferes with a gun's internal trigger components so that it fires continuously when the trigger is pulled back and held.",
      "A gun outfitted with a switch can fire dozens of bullets in mere seconds, similar to a factory-made machine gun.",
      "Other brands of pistols that mimic Glocks also can be converted to machine guns. So can some semiautomatic rifles. Such conversion devices also are referred to as auto sears, selector switches or chips.",
      "The use of auto sears spiked in the past decade, partly because they can be made inexpensively with 3D printers.",
      "From 2012 to 2016, just 814 machine gun conversion parts were taken into custody by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. That swelled to 5,454 from 2017-2021.",
      "In January, former President Joe Biden's administration said 12,360 suspected machine gun conversion devices had been recovered in the U.S. and submitted to the ATF during a roughly 34-month period ending in October 2024.",
      "Five states including Florida, Illinois, Texas, Montana and North Dakota accounted for nearly half that total.",
      "Alabama is the latest state to outlaw Glock switches. A law signed this month by Republican Gov. Kay Ivey makes possessing parts designed to convert pistols into machine guns a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison.",
      "The bipartisan push in Alabama came after police said they believed conversion devices had been used in fatal shootings, including one in September that killed four and injured 17 people outside a Birmingham lounge.",
      "Democratic New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed a law in February making possession of a weapon conversion device a felony punishable by up to three years in prison.",
      "Similar legislation passed the New Jersey General Assembly last week and now heads to the Senate. Bills also are pending in other states.",
      "Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed a law last year making auto sears illegal. But Youngkin vetoed legislation this past week that would have broadened an existing ban on \u201ctrigger activators\u201d to cover additional devices that increase firing rates of semiautomatic weapons.",
      "Groups such as Everytown for Gun Safety say state laws provide a sometimes easier alternative to federal prosecution for possessing Glock switches. But they want to go further.",
      "Everytown for Gun Safety is backing legislation in California, Maryland and New York that would make it illegal to sell pistols that could be transformed into machine guns.",
      "\u201cThat really puts the pressure where it belongs \u2014 on the manufactures that are making money off of guns that they know can be readily turned into machine guns,\u201d said Nick Suplina, senior vice president for law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety.",
      "Several cities and states including Baltimore, Chicago, Minnesota and New Jersey have sued Glock for making pistols that can be converted by others to automatic weapons.",
      "The National Rifle Association notes U.S. attorneys already can prosecute people for misusing gun conversion devices without the need for state laws.",

      "Norfolk Southern wants two other companies to help pay for the $600 million class-action settlement it agreed to over its disastrous 2023 train derailment near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border and the toxic chemicals that were released and burned.",
      "The railroad filed the motion that is set to go to trial starting Monday to force the railcar owner GATX and the chemical manufacturer OxyVinyls to share the cost of the settlement because Norfolk Southern believes those companies are partly responsible for what happened in East Palestine, Ohio, on Feb. 3, 2023.",
      "This lawsuit won't change anything about how much money residents will receive from the settlement or any payments the village or anyone else is set to receive because those are all established in various settlement agreements. This case will only affect which company has to write the checks to pay for the class-action settlement.",
      "Residents are still waiting to receive most of the money from the settlement because of pending appeals, although some payments have started to go out.",
      "An assortment of chemicals spilled and caught fire after the train derailed in East Palestine. Three days later, officials blew open five tank cars filled with vinyl chloride because they feared those cars might explode, generating a massive black plume of smoke that spread over the town and forced evacuations.",
      "Many residents still worry today about potential health consequences from those chemicals.",
      "The derailment was the worst rail disaster since a crude oil train devastated the small Canadian town of Lac-Megantic and killed 47 people in 2013. It prompted the U.S. to focus on rail safety and reforms, which were proposed in Congress before stalling without passing.",
      "Norfolk Southern already lost a similar lawsuit last year when it tried to force GATX and OxyVinyls to help pay for the environmental cleanup after the derailment that has cost the Atlanta-based railroad more than $1 billion. It is making similar arguments again to try to get help paying for the class-action settlement.",
      "\u201cNorfolk Southern alone has paid the costs relating to the derailment despite ample evidence that other parties share in the responsibility. This trial is about reinforcing the role shippers and railcar owners play in transportation safety and ensuring everyone responsible pays their fair share,\" the railroad said in a statement.",
      "Norfolk Southern, like most railroads, doesn\u2019t own most of the cars it hauls, and the railroad says everyone involved in shipping hazardous chemicals bears some responsibility for ensuring their safety under federal regulations.",
      "Norfolk Southern argues GATX bears some responsibility for the derailment because it owned the railcar filled with plastic pellets that caused the derailment when its bearing overheated, caught fire and failed that night, sending 38 cars off the rails.",
      "Norfolk Southern also said it believes OxyVinyls should pay because the railroad says chemical manufacturer provided inconsistent and inaccurate information about its vinyl chloride before officials decided to release and burn it.",
      "Both GATX and OxyVinyls say it would be ridiculous to hold them responsible for the derailment when Norfolk Southern operated and inspected the train and all the cars and was responsible for delivering the cargo safely.",
      "\u201cNorfolk Southern\u2019s claims against GATX are baseless,\" the railcar owner said in a statement.",
      "GATX said it complied with all the relevant regulations for taking care of its railcars. The company said that even if the car was damaged six years earlier by standing parked in the middle of floodwaters from Hurricane Harvey, the railroad should have spotted the problem and repaired it, sending GATX the bill for the repairs.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board said the crash was caused by the failure of an overheating bearing on GATX's railcar. The railroad\u2019s sensors spotted the bearing starting to heat up in the miles before the derailment, but it didn\u2019t reach a critical temperature and trigger an alarm until just before the derailment. That left the crew scant time to stop the train.",
      "Norfolk Southern recommended the vent-and-burn operation to release the vinyl chloride based partly on information about the chemical that OxyVinyls had published beforehand suggesting a chemical reaction could happen and cause the tank cars to explode.",
      "But the NTSB confirmed in its investigation that was unnecessary because the tank cars were starting to cool off and the railroad failed to listen to the advice from OxyVinyls' experts or share their opinions with the officials who made the decision.",
      "\u201cThis trial is nothing more than Norfolk Southern\u2019s continued attempt to shift the blame, attention, and financial responsibility for its train derailment, response, and vent and burn decision to anyone other than itself,\u201d the Texas-based company said. \u201cOxyVinyls did not cause the derailment, its tank cars did not breach, and it did not make the decision to vent and burn the VCM (vinyl chloride monomer) cars.\u201d",
      "The trial is expected to last two to three weeks.",

    "summary": "Many women are in prison for killing their abusive partners",
    "story": [
      "Many women are in prison for killing their abusive partners",
      "ATLANTA -- Mary Favors is still plagued by nightmares from the days her husband beat her, choked her and verbally and sexually abused her. Now, she is in prison for killing him.",
      "Their disagreements often turned physical, and five times he was convicted of abusing her. Then one night in April 2011, court records show, Troy Favors began shouting and hitting her before chasing her to their bedroom.",
      "She quickly closed the door, alone inside, tying the bedroom door with a string because he had kicked it down before. She grabbed a knife in case he did that again, just before he burst in. When she told him to back off, he refused and, according to Favors, he jumped on the knife. Prosecutors accused her of stabbing him.",
      "\u201cIt happened so fast,\u201d Favors, 58, told The Associated Press from prison in Georgia, later adding, \u201cI felt my life was at risk.\u201d",
      "Between 74% and 95% of incarcerated women have survived domestic abuse or sexual violence, according to the Georgia Coalition Against Domestic Violence. Many were tried without fair opportunities to prove the scope of the abuse and how it led them to act in self-defense, while others were coerced into crimes, according to advocates, who add that certain laws disproportionately criminalize abused women.",
      "At other times, they say, people simply don\u2019t believe women\u2019s stories, with women of color like Favors who survive abuse especially likely to end up in prison.",
      "But under the Georgia Survivor Justice Act, which passed the state House overwhelmingly with bipartisan support and still awaits Senate consideration ahead of the session\u2019s end this week, abuse survivors could secure early release from prison.",
      "The bill calls for judges to resentence those who are incarcerated and impose shorter sentences on those who are convicted if they can tie their crimes to domestic abuse. It also would expand what can be presented as supporting evidence.",
      "It's all part of a broader move toward reform that has gained momentum nationwide. New York, California, Illinois and Oklahoma have already passed laws intended to reduce sentences for victims of abuse who face charges or were convicted. Missouri, Connecticut and Massachusetts are considering similar legislation.",
      "Facing possible life in prison for charges including murder, Favors pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter and three other offenses. She received the maximum of 20 years in prison for the killing and five years of probation for having the knife. Many incarcerated survivors are serving life sentences.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this blurring of the lines between victim and suspect when girls and women are criminalized for the sexual violence that they experience,\u201d said Rebecca Epstein, executive director of the Center on Gender Justice and Opportunity at Georgetown Law.",
      "After her husband's death, Favors transported the body and left it elsewhere. Research shows similar snap decisions by victims in response to trauma can taint how jurors, judges and prosecutors see defendants, said Leigh Goodmark, a University of Maryland law professor who studies the criminalization of domestic violence.",
      "Goodmark hopes efforts like Georgia\u2019s will help judges and prosecutors \u201csee that victimization is much more complicated than they want it to be.\"",
      "Current Georgia law is strict about how lawyers can bring in evidence of domestic abuse, said Ellie Williams, legal director with the Georgia Coalition Against Domestic Violence. She is spearheading the legislation, which would loosen some restrictions, and said the strict guidelines reflect outdated understandings of abuse.",
      "\u201cThings that we don\u2019t always take seriously matter, and we explicitly and implicitly require things that don't adequately allow for the actual dynamics of abuse to be considered,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Under Georgia's bill, if a judge determines family violence, dating violence or child abuse contributed to a crime with a minimum sentence of life in prison, the judge, in most cases, would have to impose a sentence of 10 to 30 years in prison.",
      "For other felonies, judges would not be able to sentence the defendant to more than half of the maximum sentence they could have otherwise gotten. People in prison could also request resentencing under the rules if the act ultimately becomes law.",
      "Georgia\u2019s bill would also make it easier for courts to consider domestic violence in cases involving self-defense or victims being coerced into committing a crime, which is common.",
      "The bill is \u201cnot a get out of jail free card,\u201d said bill sponsor Rep. Stan Gunter, a Republican.",
      "The day the House voted on it, several district attorneys contacted their representatives to oppose it.",
      "Randy McGinley, district attorney for the Alcovy Judicial Circuit, said during a committee hearing that families may become upset if the person who killed their loved one walks free from prison early. The Prosecuting Attorneys' Council, which McGinley was representing, is taking a neutral stance after persuading lawmakers to make some changes.",
      "Under New York's 2019 bill, The Survivors Justice Project said at least 71 people have received a reduction and 85 applications were denied.",
      "A few have gone home under The Oklahoma Survivors' Act, passed last year. But a bill failed this year that could have provided some sentencing relief for women who were convicted under Oklahoma's \u201cfailure to protect\u201d law for not protecting children from their abusers. They often receive sentences equal to or more than their abusers.",
      "Born in New Jersey, Favors liked to ice skate and go to school when she was young. She spoke of feeling unloved as an adopted child and found it hard to leave men even when they treated her badly.",
      "Favors tears up when she talks about her husband, whom she still loves. She drove him to work every day and wishes they had had resources to overcome mental health battles and their drug addictions.",
      "Now drug-free, Favors dreams of working at a battered women's shelter. In prison, she earned her high school diploma and took classes about abuse. To heal, she prays, fasts, reads her Bible and meets with others in a prison ministry, sharing what God did for them.",
      "\"I survived from my abuse,\" Favors answers. \u201cI could have been the one that was dead.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "U.S. immigration officials are asking the public and federal agencies to comment on a proposal to collect social media handles from people applying to benefits such as green cards or citizenship, to comply with an executive order from President Donald ...",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- U.S. immigration officials are asking the public and federal agencies to comment on a proposal to collect social media handles from people applying for benefits such as green cards or citizenship, to comply with an executive order from President Donald Trump.",
      "The March 5 notice raised alarms from immigration and free speech advocates because it appears to expand the government's reach in social media surveillance to people already vetted and in the U.S. legally, such as asylum seekers, green card and citizenship applicants -- and not just those applying to enter the country. That said, social media monitoring by immigration officials has been a practice for over a decade, since at least the second Obama administration and ramping up under Trump's first term.",
      "Below are some questions and answers on what the new proposal means and how it might expand social media surveillance.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security issued a 60-day notice asking for public commentary on its plan to comply with Trump's executive order titled \u201cProtecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats.\" The plan calls for \u201cuniform vetting standards\u201d and screening people for grounds of inadmissibility to the U.S., as well as identify verification and \u201cnational security screening.\u201d It seeks to collect social media handles and the names of platforms, although not passwords.",
      "The policy seeks to require people to share their social media handles when applying for U.S. citizenship, green card, asylum and other immigration benefits. The proposal is open to feedback from the public until May 5.",
      "\u201cThe basic requirements that are in place right now is that people who are applying for immigrant and non-immigrant visas have to provide their social media handles,\u201d said Rachel Levinson-Waldman, managing director of the Brennan Center\u2019s Liberty and National Security Program at New York University. \u201cWhere I could see this impacting is someone who came into the country before visa-related social media handle collection started, so they wouldn\u2019t have provided it before and now they\u2019re being required to. Or maybe they did before, but their social media use has changed.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis fairly widely expanded policy to collect them for everyone applying for any kind of immigration benefit, including people who have already been vetted quite extensively,\u201d she added.",
      "What this points to \u2014 along with other signals the administration is sending such as detaining people and revoking student visas for participating in campus protests that the government deems antisemitic and sympathetic to the militant Palestinian group Hamas \u2014 Levinson-Waldman added, is the increased use of social media to \u201cmake these very high-stakes determinations about people.\u201d",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service said the agency seeks to \u201cstrengthen fraud detection, prevent identity theft, and support the enforcement of rigorous screening and vetting measures to the fullest extent possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese efforts ensure that those seeking immigration benefits to live and work in the United States do not threaten public safety, undermine national security, or promote harmful anti-American ideologies,\u201d the statement continued. USCIS estimates that the proposed policy change will affect about 3.6 million people.",
      "The U.S. government began ramping up the use of social media for immigration vetting in 2014 under then-President Barack Obama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. In late 2015, the Department of Homeland Security began both \u201cmanual and automatic screening of the social media accounts of a limited number of individuals applying to travel to the United States, through various non-public pilot programs,\u201d the nonpartisan law and policy institute explains on its website.",
      "In May 2017, the U.S. Department of State issued an emergency notice to increase the screening of visa applicants. Brennan, along with other civil and human rights groups, opposed the move, arguing that it is \u201cexcessively burdensome and vague, is apt to chill speech, is discriminatory against Muslims, and has no security benefit.\u201d",
      "Two years later, the State Department began collecting social media handles from \u201cnearly all foreigners\u201d applying for visas to travel to the U.S. \u2014 about 15 million people a year.",
      "Artificial intelligence tools used to comb through potentially millions of social media accounts have evolved over the past decade, although experts caution that such tools have limits and can make mistakes.",
      "Leon Rodriguez, who served as the director of USCIS from 2014 to 2017 and now practices as an immigration attorney, said while AI could be used as a first screening tool, he doesn't think \u201cwe're anywhere close to where AI will be able to exercise the judgment of a trained fraud detection and national security officer\" or that of someone in an intelligence agency.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also possible that I will miss stuff,\u201d he added. \u201cBecause AI is still very much driven by specific search criteria and it\u2019s possible that the search criteria won't hit actionable content.\u201d",
      "\u201cSocial media is just a stew, so much different information \u2014 some of it is reliable, some of it isn\u2019t. Some of it can be clearly attributed to somebody, some of it can\u2019t. And it can be very hard to interpret,\u201d Levinson-Waldman said. \u201cSo I think as a baseline matter, just using social media to make high-stakes decisions is quite concerning.\u201d",
      "Then there's the First Amendment.",
      "\u201cIt's by and large established that people in the U.S. have First Amendment rights,\u201d she said. This includes people who are not citizens. \u201cAnd obviously, there are complicated ways that that plays out. There is also fairly broad authority for the government to do something like revoking somebody\u2019s visa, if you\u2019re not a citizen, then there\u2019s steps that the government can take \u2014 but by and large, with very narrow exceptions, that cannot be on the grounds of speech that would be protected (by the First Amendment).\"",

      "San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies involved in a 2022 shootout along a California freeway that killed a teenage girl and her fugitive father will not face any criminal charges, state Attorney General Rob Bonta announced Friday.",
      "Bonta released a report compiled by the California Department of Justice following an investigation that included interviews with officers, witnesses who were driving along the road that day and family members who recalled that the man and his daughter had a close relationship. The attorney general called the incident a tragic situation with a tragic outcome.",
      "\u201cThis report was quite difficult to publish, and I sincerely hope it provides the community with the answers they\u2019ve been waiting for,\" Bonta said in a statement. \"The California Department of Justice aims to partner with law enforcement to build a just and equitable legal environment, ensuring that the rule of law is upheld, and justice is accessible to everyone.\u201d",
      "Video and audio released by the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department showed Savannah Graziano, 15, was shot and killed as she approached deputies amid a hail of gunfire on Sept. 27, 2022. The video footage recorded by a sheriff\u2019s helicopter and witness dashboard cameras was released in 2024 in response to public records requests made by The Associated Press and other media outlets.",
      "According to the Department of Justice review, 45-year-old Anthony Graziano drove off with his daughter after he shot and killed Tracy Martinez \u2014 his 45-year-old estranged wife \u2014 as she tried to flee from his pickup truck. Authorities said the teen was in the truck when her mother was shot, and an Amber Alert was issued.",
      "San Bernardino County deputies spotted the truck the next day, and a 41-mile (66-kilometer) pursuit ensued on Interstate 15. As Anthony Graziano was driving, authorities said numerous rounds were fired at deputies from the rear and passenger-side windows of the vehicle. Audio from the deputies' belt recorders included the sounds of rounds hitting their patrol vehicles. One deputy sustained gunshot wounds to his arm and to fingers on both of his hands.",
      "Authorities said shots continued to be fired from Graziano's truck after he drove off the freeway and up an embankment. About 65 spent casings and four firearms were found in the truck. The investigation also determined that 21 deputies returned fire.",
      "The report states that the vehicle came to a stop and the teen \u2014 wearing a tactical helmet and vest \u2014 got out of the front passenger door and initially crouched on the ground. She then got up and moved toward a deputy as he called out to her. She raised her right hand, and that is when other deputies opened fire, according to the report.",
      "Anthony Graziano was found dead in the driver's seat. Autopsy results showed he died from a gunshot wound to the head and also suffered gunshot wounds to his shoulder, lower back and leg. A toxicology report showed he had methamphetamine and amphetamine as well as morphine and hydrocodone in his blood and urine.",
      "No drugs or alcohol were found in Savannah Graziano\u2019s blood or urine. Her cause of death was listed as gunshot wounds.",
      "Gunshot residue was present in samples taken from the hands of both the teen and her father. The report notes that gunshot residue particles can be deposited by firing a firearm, being in proximity of a discharging firearm, or by handling a firearm or ammunition.",
      "The report states \u201cno conclusion\" can be drawn from the residue testing as to whether the teen or her father fired a firearm. But in attempting to recreate multiple shooting positions from inside the truck given the location of powder burns left by the muzzle of a rifle found in the vehicle, investigators found that the driver would not have been able to shoot the rifle and still maintain control of the gas and brake pedals.",
      "Prosecutors noted in the report that evidence suggested that deputies believed both Graziano and his daughter \u2014 who was experienced at handling firearms and had participated in firearms training drills with her father \u2014 posed an imminent threat and that the need to use lethal force was reasonable.",
      "Family members told authorities that Graziano had been living in his truck and that his daughter would often stay with him, sleeping in the truck next to a park. They said the teen was upset about her parents' divorce.",
      "The report also included recommendations related to training and dash-mounted and body-worn camera policies. The attorney general's office said the sheriff's department had implemented the training recommendations following the incident.",

    "story": [
      "Andrew Tate is facing a new lawsuit filed by his ex-girlfriend accusing him of sexual assault and battery",
      "Andrew Tate, a hugely successful social media influencer known for expressing misogynistic views online, is facing a new lawsuit filed by his ex-girlfriend accusing him of sexual assault and battery.",
      "It adds to existing legal trouble for Tate, who\u2019s charged with human trafficking and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women in Romania. His brother, Tristan Tate, is also accused in that case.",
      "In her complaint, Tate\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Brianna Stern, argues that his abusive treatment of her follows a long pattern of making blatant misogyny part of his brand. She said he initially acted effusively loving and generous to lure her into a relationship that later turned abusive.",
      "The lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in Los Angeles, details an encounter earlier this month at the Beverly Hills Hotel when Tate choked and beat her, according to the complaint. Stern said she was later diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome.",
      "Tate\u2019s attorney, Joseph McBride, said his client denies all allegations of violence. McBride accused Stern and her lawyers of taking advantage of the recent controversy surrounding Tate, hoping it could win them a lucrative payout.",
      "\u201cThis is a money grab,\u201d McBride said in a phone interview Saturday morning. \u201cThis is the weaponization of the court system against an innocent man.\u201d",
      "The Tate brothers, who are dual U.S. and British citizens, were arrested in Romania in late 2022 and formally indicted last year. Andrew Tate was also charged with rape. They deny all the allegations against them.",
      "Stern met Tate in July 2024 after the brothers invited her to Romania because they were looking for models to help promote their cryptocurrency meme coin, according to her lawsuit. She said he convinced her the media portrayals of him were untrue, that he was actually a supporter of women. It seemed like \u201ca dream come true,\u201d she said in the complaint.",
      "After she returned to the U.S., Tate\u2019s communications became threatening and manipulative, including calling her his \u201cproperty,\u201d Stern alleges. He sent messages saying he wanted to beat and impregnate her: \u201cYou have an attitude because you\u2019re not hit enough,\u201d he once wrote, according to the complaint.",
      "Tate\u2019s attorney, however, called the messages \u201cdoctored, edited and falsified,\u201d saying he doesn\u2019t believe they\u2019ll be admissible in court.",
      "\u201cNone of it is true,\u201d McBride said. \u201cAll of it is a lie.\u201d",
      "During their last encounter at the hotel, Stern alleges, Tate beat and choked her during sex.",
      "\u201cWhile doing so, Tate told her repeatedly that if she ever crossed him, he was going to kill her,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "Tate, 38, is a former professional kickboxer and self-described misogynist who has amassed millions of followers online, many of them young men and boys drawn in by the luxurious lifestyle he projects. He previously was banned from TikTok, YouTube and Facebook for hate speech, including that women should bear responsibility for getting raped. He and his brother are vocal supporters of President Donald Trump.",
      "The Tate brothers checked in at a police station near Romania\u2019s capital last Monday, complying with judicial control requirements in the human trafficking case that ordered them to return after weeks in the U.S. The American trip was possible because a travel ban against them was lifted last month after a Romanian court found multiple legal and procedural irregularities \u2014 a significant blow to the prosecution and a win for the Tates.",
      "Tate has repeatedly claimed that prosecutors in Romania have no evidence against him and claimed there\u2019s a political conspiracy to silence him.",
      "Days after they arrived in Florida, the state\u2019s attorney general opened a criminal investigation into the brothers.",
      "Four British women are suing Tate in the U.K. after the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute him on sexual violence and other abuse charges. Last March, the brothers appeared at the Bucharest Court of Appeal in a separate case after U.K. authorities issued arrest warrants over allegations of sexual aggression dating back several years. The appeals court granted the U.K. request to extradite them, but only after legal proceedings in Romania have concluded.",
      "Stern said in a statement posted to social media that she\u2019s terrified of how Tate will respond to her public accusations.",
      "\u201cI considered many times just silently leaving Andrew and saying nothing, doing nothing, because I was scared and because it was honestly hard for me to accept that I was being abused,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut I can now see that doing so would be the cowardly approach.\u201d",
      "Her attorney, Tony Buzbee, praised her \u201cincredible courage to come forward and make her voice heard.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump has spent nearly every weekend in Florida since starting his second term",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The sun was shining outside President Donald Trump's West Palm Beach golf course on Saturday morning when Alan Mentser got a call letting him know that police were shutting down a road nearby. It was almost time to \u201cshow the boss a little love.\u201d",
      "Mentser, 65, and a group of hard-core supporters have spent years gathering at the same spot to welcome Trump when he comes to play golf, and they have the routine down. They monitor flight trackers to know when Air Force One arrives and traffic cameras to see if the presidential motorcade is on the move.",
      "It\u2019s an intense commitment of time and resources for a brief glimpse of their political hero. Mentser pointed to a gigantic banner showing Trump giving a thumbs up against an American flag backdrop. He said each one costs $300, and he has about eight of them.",
      "But Mentser said it's worth it at a time when supporters view Trump as a man under siege from his enemies and fabricated controversies.",
      "\"It might give him 30 seconds of seeing, \u2018there\u2019s my people,\u2019\" he said. \u201cBut that 30 seconds matter.\u201d",
      "Now it was time to do it again. The cue was a siren as a police vehicle blocked the road in front of the golf club.",
      "\u201cHere we go!\u201d Mentser said. When he glimpsed the motorcade in the distance, he announced, \u201cattention on deck.\u201d",
      "A member of the group switched the soundtrack on a portable speaker from country music to \u201cYMCA,\u201d the Trump campaign anthem.",
      "The convoy of black cars rolled down the street and turned into the golf club. Trump was wearing his typical red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and white polo shit, and he reached across his chest to wave to the crowd with his left hand.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump! We love you!\u201d shouted Brady Collier, 31, who wore the same hat as the president.",
      "It was over in less than 30 seconds.",
      "A woman with white hair pulled up shortly afterward with her windows down and a dog in the passenger seat. She waved one middle finger at the golf club and another at Trump\u2019s supporters. Someone called her a \u201cbaby killer\u201d before she drove off.",
      "The moment didn\u2019t dampen Collier\u2019s enthusiasm. Despite all the times that he's witnessed Trump's motorcade, he said \u201ctoday was special.\u201d This time, the limo seemed to roll slower and closer to the sidewalk, giving Collier a better glimpse of the president.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing cooler than that,\u201d he said. \u201cOther than Jesus Christ.\u201d",
      "Collier, 31, is from Indiana but spent the winter in Florida, where he\u2019s doing landscaping and food deliveries. It\u2019s also an opportunity to show his support for Trump as often as possible.",
      "Jared Petry, 24, has been doing the same thing. He\u2019s from Ohio and is one of the \u201cFront Row Joes,\u201d a group of superfans that traveled the country supporting Trump at campaign rallies. Petry was in Butler, Pennsylvania, last summer when the president was fired upon in an assassination attempt.",
      "\u201cI heard popping. I didn\u2019t know what was going on,\u201d he said.",
      "Petry was near the front of the audience, and he captured video of Trump, surrounded by Secret Service agents, lurching to his feet and pumping his fist in the air.",
      "\u201cI knew he was OK,\u201d he said.",
      "Now, Petry is outside the golf course every weekend.",
      "\u201cHe never forgets his supporters,\" he said. \u201cHe waves at us.\u201d",
      "The group chatted about going to a nearby restaurant where Fox News host Sean Hannity is sometimes spotted, but something different happened this time. A group of staff members from the golf club came over to invite them in for a meal.",
      "Mentser said that had never happened before. They ate freshly made omelets and blueberry muffins and walked out to the veranda, where they could see Trump playing one of the holes on his golf course.",
      "The group refrained from trying to get Trump's attention, Mentser said.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want to have the president post on Truth Social that \u2018I was lining up my putt and my supporters threw off my game,'\u201d he joked.",
      "The whole experience, Mentser said, was \u201ctremendous.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a small way for him to say thank you, I see you,\" he said.",

      "Hegseth landed on the Japanese island of Iwo Jima, now known as Iwoto, where Japanese and American soldiers faced off in one of the war's fiercest battles. He joined several American veterans who survived the battle and Japanese bereaved families, as well as his Japanese counterpart, Gen Nakatani, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and other officials at Saturdsay's Reunion of Honor event.",

      "Recent polls show the Japanese feel more affinity toward the U.S. than any other country. Most Americans and Japanese alive today were born after Japan surrendered in August 1945.",

    "story": [
      "Stock markets have fallen in Asia after President Donald Trump suggested that new tariffs he is set to announce this week will hit all countries, not just those that have the biggest trade imbalances with the US.",
      "Trump made the comments as he prepares to unveil a massive slate of import taxes on Wednesday, in what he has called America's \"Liberation Day\".",
      "The measures will come on top of tariffs already imposed by Washington on aluminium, steel and vehicles, along with increased levies on all goods from China.",
      "\"You'd start with all countries,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One. \"Essentially all of the countries that we're talking about.",
      "But he said his administration would be \"far more generous\" and \"kinder\" than the countries had been to the US.",
      "With 48 hours to go before the tariffs come into force, the UK is still locked in talks with the US about an exemption.",
      "On Sunday, Downing Street said that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer had had \"productive negotiations\" with Trump in a phone call, adding that talks would \"continue at pace\".",
      "On Saturday, government sources had said that the UK would not hesitate to impose its own tariffs on the US if needed.",
      "Other jurisdictions, such as the European Union and Canada, have already said that they are preparing a range of retaliatory trade measures.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, recently told the Fox Business channel the tariffs would focus on 10 to 15 countries that have the worst trade deficits with the US, but did not name them.",
      "Trump sees trade taxes - which in this case would be paid by the US companies importing goods -  as a way of protecting the American economy from unfair competition and as a bargaining chip for getting better trading terms.",
      "Concerns about a trade war are unsettling markets and creating fears of a recession in the US.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "On Monday, Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark share index closed more than 4% lower, the Kospi in South Korea ended the day down 3% and the ASX 200 in Australia fell 1.7%.",
      "In the UK, the FTSE 100 index opened about 0.9% lower, while Germany's Dax index and France's Cac 40 were both down 1%.",
      "Over the weekend Trump's advisers echoed his view that the planned tariffs could raise trillions of dollars and help create jobs in the US.",
      "His top trade adviser, Pete Navarro, pointed to huge revenues he said the tariffs would raise.",
      "The tax on all car imports could raise $100bn (\u00a377.3bn) a year, Mr Navarro said. All the planned tariffs could raise $600bn annually, about a fifth of the value of total goods imports into the US, he added.",
      "A White House fact sheet published last week suggested a 10% tariff on every import could create nearly three million US jobs.",
      "However, there are concerns that tariffs could fuel inflation - something Trump pledged to reduce during his presidential campaign - if companies choose to pass on the higher cost of importing goods to their customers.",
      "If companies absorb the cost, if could hit profit which in turn could affect investment.",
      "'Counter-productive'",
      "Will Butler-Adams, chief executive of Brompton Bicycle, which makes folding bikes, said US tariffs were creating uncertainty.",
      "While, at the moment, Brompton's products are not facing additional taxes, he said the people interpreting the tariffs are trying to establish how much steel in products might have come from outside the US, which might therefore lead to tariffs.",
      "\"The reality is we don't [know] actually and the people who are on the borders importing goods into the US don't actually entirely understand how some of these tariffs might be put in,\" Mr Butler-Adams said.",
      "About 10% of Brompton's sales come from the US, where it has grown from a staff of four to 40 people and has shops in New York and Washington.",
      "But Mr Butler-Adams said tariffs might prove to be \"counter-productive\".",
      "\"Ironically, if he puts taxes on, it is going to make our product less competitive,\" he said.",
      "\"We won't continue to invest in the same way that we are now. We may even shrink, in the extreme we might pull out.\"",
      "TikTok sale",
      "Separately, Trump said a deal with TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance to sell the  app would be agreed before a deadline on Saturday.",
      "He set the 5 April deadline in January for the short video platform to find a non-Chinese buyer or face a ban in the US on national security grounds.",
      "It had been due to take effect that month to comply with a law passed under the Biden administration."

      "There is nothing much you can do if your council tax is increasing, or you are buying a house and facing a higher stamp duty bill.",

      "The seven bills going up in April",
      "The seven bills going up in April",
      "1. Shop around",
      "For some services you can often get a better deal simply by calling the company you are with and saying you are considering leaving.",
      "\"Shop around for better deals, and haggle with your existing provider,\" says Alice Haine, from professional services group Evelyn Partners.",
      "\"It's always worth haggling. Haggle for everything.\"",
      "That applies to a whole range of bills, including insurance, energy, and broadband.",
      "\"Our research shows that switching providers if you're out of contract can slash broadband, pay TV and mobile bills by up to \u00a3235,\" says Emily Seymour, from consumer group Which?",
      "Gas and electricity are often the biggest bills people face and the price cap set by the regulator is rising by 6%, so it is worth finding the best deal for you.",
      "That may include choosing a fixed rate deal, says Ms Seymour. If you charge an electric vehicle or use appliances overnight, look for a deal with a cheaper night tariff.",
      "\"We'd also recommend taking a meter reading as close to 31 March as possible to ensure you're billed the correct amount for your energy usage,\" she says.",
      "2. Cut back",
      "One surefire way to keep your bills down is to reduce what you use.",
      "Taking shorter showers and putting in a showerhead with a slower flow will save money on your water and energy bills.",
      "\"You have to treat water as an expensive resource,\" Ms Haine says.",
      "Getting a water meter fitted may save you money, she adds.",
      "Smart meters for electricity and gas can also help you keep tabs on what is pushing up your energy bills most, the Energy Saving Trust says.",
      "The trust advises draught-proofing your home, including round floorboards, pipework and old extractor fans, and setting the thermostat to the lowest comfortable temperature. For most people, it says, that is between 18\u00b0C and 21\u00b0C.",
      "MoneySavingExpert says you can save money by using the principle: \"heat the human, not the home\". Using hot water bottles and electric blankets should work out cheaper than turning up the radiators.",
      "You can also change the settings on combi or conventional boilers to save money, says Martin Lewis at MoneySavingExpert.",
      "When it comes to transport bills, you can't avoid the vehicle tax rise unless you ditch the car altogether.",
      "But if you are taking the train it is also worth checking whether a railcard will help, points out Ms Seymour.",
      "\"To cut costs on rail fares, we'd recommend booking tickets in advance and splitting fares where possible,\" she says.",
      "3. Get help",
      "If you are struggling to pay your household bills, don't panic, says Richard Lane, chief client officer at the StepChange Debt Charity. He suggests creating a detailed budget that captures all your income and expenditure.",
      "\"This will allow you to get a clear picture of your finances and see how much you have leftover to pay toward any debts or make savings,\" he says.",
      "Then check what support you are entitled to.",
      "Water companies offer lower \"social\" and hardship tariffs for people on very low incomes, so it is worth calling your provider. People claiming benefits can often also get lower tariffs for broadband.",
      "\"These organisations have a regulatory responsibility to treat customers fairly and will be able to offer you tailored support,\" Mr Lane added.",
      "There is the government's Warm Home Discount, for people with high energy costs on a very low income, including Pension Credit. And people on low incomes are also eligible for a reduction in council tax.",
      "Check if you qualify for a free TV licence. If you are over 75 and on Pension Credit or live with someone who is, then you will.",
      "You may also be able to boost your income. Check which benefits you are entitled to on the independent MoneyHelper website, backed by the government, or using benefits calculators run by Policy in Practice and charities Entitledto and Turn2us.",
      "If you are struggling with debt here are some other organisations that may be able to help."

    "story": [
      "Gothenburg, Sweden's second city, is highlighting its environmental credentials by continuing to put its money on the line.",
      "Back in 2022, the City of Gothenburg, became what is believed to be the first local government in the world to take out a \"sustainability linked loan\" or SLL.",
      "This is a form of financing pegged to a set of annual environmental and social improvements agreed between a borrower and its banks.",
      "Gothenburg's four target areas are efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city's heat production, making the council's own vehicle fleet electric, reducing energy usage in municipality-owned buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and improving the city's poorest neighbourhoods.",
      "Meet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and, for each, Gothenburg gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of 0.1% or around 100,000 kronor ($10,500; \u00a38,000). But miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount.",
      "In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.",
      "However, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.",
      "Fredrik Block, portfolio manager at the City of Gothenburg, says that the local authority deliberately set \"ambitious\" targets.",
      "\"You aim high, and you get the whole organisation to strive towards that target. We are not proceeding as fast as we expected, but we are taking one step at a time. The goal is still to be close to carbon-free by 2030.",
      "\"We're actually not doing it for the money. We're doing it to show the city's important work and that we are making progress every year. We want to show to the world how it is - that these are the problems, and these are the good things.\"",
      "The improvements to the city's poorest areas \u2013 and whether the council has hit its targets - are measured by yearly resident surveys. People are asked about their feelings towards an area's safety and cleanliness.",
      "Key initiatives have included making housing more secure, introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like Hjallbo and Biskopsgarden. Located in the north of the city, they have high levels of crime and unemployment, and large immigrant populations.",
      "Public housing agency Framtiden, which is ultimately owned by the City of Gothenburg, says it takes the improvement work very seriously.",
      "\"For some of these vulnerable areas, we actually own the majority of the housing,\" says its research and development manager, Lars Bankvall.",
      "\"We are more or less the only official body in these areas. There's no one else there, only us.",
      "\"I see us as maybe the most powerful tool that the city has, because we have a lot of financial resources. We are involved in everything.\"",

      "\"What will our children think when they see cameras everywhere in Hjallbo, but none in a Swedish neighbourhood? How will they feel when they are constantly being watched by police?\" she says.",
      "\"What will you tell them? You are showing them there is a difference between them and native Swedes.\"",
      "Ms Awil is also not convinced the resident surveys are effective or accurate. And she feels the city is placing a disproportionate amount of effort into its environmental goals, at the expense of improving conditions in underprivileged areas.",
      "\"People in these areas don't care about the environment. They need to go to school. They need to work. They need to eat,\" says Ms Awil, who migrated from Somalia to Sweden in 1987 as a child.",
      "Negotiating an SLL is a rigorous, complex process - one that took the City of Gothenburg a year to do, with no fewer than six major Nordic banks involved.",
      "Such is the difficulty of acquiring an SLL that the number issued globally fell by 56% in 2023, according to data from financial news provider Bloomberg.",
      "Mats Olausson is senior sustainability advisor at Swedish bank SEB, which is the lead lender of Gothenburg's SLL.",
      "He says SEB has turned down potential SLL borrowers as the client's proposed targets weren't ambitious enough. Yet he adds that SLLs are challenging for companies or local authorities that successfully get one.",
      "\"It's sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an SLL, and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative,\" he says. \"You run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not done a good enough job.",
      "\"It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy.\"",
      "One company that is happy with its SLL is Danish management consultancy Emagine. It borrowed \u00a310m in 2021, funds that helped it to acquire six other firms around the world.",
      "Its binding goals include increasing the number of female leaders in the organisation by 16%, and reducing overall employee turnover by 6% over the seven-year long period. It is doing this through leadership and mentoring programs.",
      "By meeting the targets, Emagine is benefiting from reduced interest rates, says Lars Bloch, the company's chief financial officer.",
      "\"If we didn't meet the goals, we would be landed with interest penalty rates. We also accept that failing to meet sustainability targets could harm the firm's reputation, as we have made a public commitment.",

      "At one table, a teenager tucks into a ham sandwich while on the phone with a friend. She stays for well over half an hour.",
      "At another, an elderly couple chat over a hot meal, while a queue of customers steadily forms at the till.",
      "But this is one of 52 cafes set to close - including others in London, Leeds, Portsmouth and Glasgow - announced this week in a cost-cutting drive that the supermarket chain says is designed to \"renew and reinvigorate Morrisons\" and focus \"investment into the areas that customers really value\".",
      "That came two months after Sainsbury's said it was closing all 61 of its supermarket cafes.",
      "While some see the decline of supermarket cafes as inevitable, shoppers around the country have told BBC News that these cafes give them a cheap, convenient and welcoming place to get a warm meal while catching up with friends.",
      "'Share a meal without the stress of cooking'",
      "Regulars at the Morrisons cafe in Queensbury say they're surprised - and saddened - to hear it's closing.",

      "Philomena says she's \"furious\" about the closure. \"Morrisons was really the only place I would come,\" she says. \"We meet people we know in here.\"",
      "Other regulars at the cafe tell the BBC that the quality is good, prices are low, and it's convenient to grab groceries beforehand. They point to offers such as a free kids meal with an adult's one, free parking, and fish and chips with mushy peas for \u00a38.50.",
      "Morrisons says 344 of its cafes will remain open despite the planned closures but, according to its chief executive Rami Baiti\u00e9h, \"a minority have specific local challenges and in those locations, regrettably, closure and re-allocation of the space is the only sensible option\".",
      "Elsewhere in the country, Ben Hopkins, 32, feels his local Morrisons cafe in Meltham, West Yorkshire, is bustling every time he goes because \"the food is typical of that you'd get in a traditional greasy spoon\".",

      "\"The grocers are desperately trying to navigate significant cost headwinds, while simultaneously competing with discounters like Aldi and Lidl.",
      "\"This is a low-margin industry, so supermarkets need to be utterly ruthless when it comes to cost-cutting.\"",

      "It largely echoes the reasoning Sainsbury's has given for its closures - that \"the majority of [its] most loyal shoppers do not use the cafes regularly\".",

      "\"If it was popular, you'd hear about it,\" like when Pret A Manger changed its subscription service, he says.",
      "And besides, rival supermarket chains Tesco and Marks & Spencer - which have more than 300 cafes each - haven't said anything about closing their cafes.",

      "Mr Springett's online persona developed over time, interacting with other artificial characters, and even went as far as to start its own Beanie Babies [a line of soft toys] collection.",
      "He said it was like AIs were writing their own soap operas inside a simulation.",
      "\"I didn't engage with Butterflies in the same way I do with other platforms,\" Mr Springett told BBC.",
      "\"It felt more like observing than participating. I wouldn't pay for it, but it was interesting enough to keep watching.\"",

      "According to data from Similarweb, a digital market intelligence company, X's daily active users in the UK have dropped by nearly 25% since January 2024.",
      "And it's not just X that has been suffering, mobile and desktop traffic to Facebook has declined over the last few years according to Similarweb.",
      "A report by the Pew Research Centre found that a third of teens use Facebook and X, compared with three quarters a decade ago.",
      "Bluesky is one of the social media firms gaining ground.",
      "Over the past year, Bluesky has gained tens of millions of new users, often at the expense of X.",
      "Apart from just timing, though, BlueSky's success can be largely attributed to its novel architecture, which pairs an X-like experience with a high degree of customization.",
      "Unlike centralized systems, where social media companies have complete control over content and identities, Bluesky users can choose how their feeds are moderated, and what kind of posts the algorithm recommends to them, thanks to the hundreds of options offered by both Bluesky and the community.",
      "Don't like the broader discourse on Bluesky? Jump on the \"popular with friends\" feed to see what the people you follow specifically are talking about.",
      "It will not be simple for Bluesky to scale up to the size of X and Facebook, says Andy Tattersall, an information specialist at the University of Sheffield.",
      "He ways it will have to strike a balance between \"generating revenue, keeping users safe, and moderating content, which is much easier said than done\".",
      "Celebrity-backed foundation, Free Our Feeds, hopes to do that.",
      "It's backed some notable names, including musician Brian Eno and actor Mark Ruffalo, and plans to raise $30m (\u00a323m) over the next three years to support an open social media ecosystem powered by the AT Protocol, the decentralized network powering Bluesky.",
      "\"Bluesky has created a strong foundation for shared social media infrastructure,\" says Robin Berjonone, one of Free Our Feeds' nine custodians, \"but so long as they are the primary operator of this infrastructure the risk remains that it will stop operating in the public interest\".",
      "A bigger worry for these emerging platforms, though, is the network barrier. This can be summed up with Metcalfe's Law, explains Evan Prodromou, co-author and current editor of ActivityPub, another open social media architecture, which is behind popular platforms like Meta's Threads.",
      "The law states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users. That means that bigger social networks have way more resources than smaller ones. They can use those resources to get bigger and bigger and crowd out smaller social media services.",
      "Non-profits like Free Our Feeds and the Social Web Foundation, which Mr Prodromou heads, have a strategy that they hope will help them overcome that Metcalfe's Law.",
      "They hope to replace the current situation, where users of social media hop between their favourite services.",
      "Instead Social Web Foundation is developing a platform which can offer content from all of them.",
      "Threads for example supports a protocol called ActivityPub, which makes it easier to combine services with other social media firms that use that protocol - like Mastodon for instance.",
      "Using this kind of interoperability, Mr Prodromou hopes that services like Social Web Foundation will provide the same value as giant, monolithic platforms.",
      "It's not straightforward, as not all social media firms support the same protocol, for example, BlueSky uses the AT Protocol.",
      "But there are workarounds to that problem, and Free Our Feeds and Social Web Foundation are also working on ways to aggregate sites that use different tech.",
      "\"One thing we've learnt from the past decades is that the last thing the world needs is a one-size-fits all solution for eight billion people,\" says Robin Berjon, one of Free Our Feeds' custodians.",
      "At the other end of the spectrum are those that want to carve a niche out for themselves, rather than replace the incumbents.",
      "In the last couple of years, a cottage industry of unique, new social apps has cropped.",
      "One of those is Mozi, created by Twitter co-founder Ev Williams. Mozi doesn't want you to socialise online at all.",
      "Instead it informs you when you're going to be in the same place (city or event) as someone you know and encourages you to connect with people more often in person.",
      "\"Until Mozi, no combination of apps could tell me what city my friends are in at any given time, or even what my friends locally are up to,\" says Mozi co-founder, Molly DeWolf Swenson.",
      "Mike McCue, the CEO of Flipboard, is convinced such innovation will result in a new era of social networking, where numerous new, more interesting types of social networks will emerge and offer people more choices.",
      "He hopes that Flipboard's app, Surf will help people manage a messy social media ecosystem. It allows users to browse from a centralized feed that can draw posts and content from a variety of platforms, including Threads, Bluesky, and YouTube.",
      "\"In the end,\" says Mr McCue, \"it's unlikely one service will replace the Facebook or Twitter we once knew, but instead several services will start to take our time away from these old-style single feed experiences, our behaviours will shift with these new choices and new generations will expect more.\"",

    "summary": "The chancellor is on track to meet her own fiscal rules, so why is there talk of tax rises in the autumn?",
    "story": [
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set out her plans for the UK economy in her Spring Statement and is on track to meet her self-imposed rules on the public finances, which she has said are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "On the face of it, that sounds like a good thing. So why are people saying that she may struggle to meet them and the only way she may do so is by raising taxes?",
      "It's a complicated picture, but there are essentially five steps to get from where we are now to tax rises.",
      "Not much spare money",
      "Ahead of the Spring Statement, the chancellor had been under pressure, with speculation over how she would be able to meet her self-imposed financial rules, one of which is to not borrow to fund day-to-day spending.",
      "In October, the government's official economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said that Reeves would be able to meet that rule with \u00a39.9bn to spare.",
      "An increase in government borrowing costs since then meant that that room to spare had disappeared. Now big welfare cuts and spending reductions in the Spring Statement have restored it.",
      "Almost \u00a310bn may sound like a lot, but it's a relatively small amount in an economy that spends \u00a31 trillion a year, and raises around the same in tax.",
      "In fact it is the third lowest margin a chancellor has left themselves since 2010. The average headroom over that time is three times bigger at \u00a330bn.",
      "Warning taxes could still rise despite welfare cuts",
      "Warning taxes could still rise despite welfare cuts",
      "\"It is a tiny fraction of the risks to the outlook,\" Richard Hughes from the OBR told the BBC.",
      "He said there were many factors that could \"wipe out\" the chancellor's headroom, including an escalating trade war, any small downgrade to growth forecasts or a rise in interest rates.",
      "Predicting the future is difficult",
      "Which brings us on to the precarious nature of making economic forecasts.",
      "\"All forecasts turn out to be wrong. Weather forecasts also turn out to be wrong,\" says Mr Hughes.",
      "Predicting what will happen in the future, especially in five years' time is hard, and is subject to revisions. You could be forgiven for not predicting a war or a pandemic, for instance.",
      "The respected think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), has already said there is \"a good chance that economic and fiscal forecasts will deteriorate significantly between now and an Autumn Budget\".",
      "A case in point, only hours after Reeves delivered her statement in parliament, US President Donald Trump announced new 25% tariffs on cars and car parts coming into the US.",
      "Car tariffs a sign worse could come",
      "Reeves admitted the car tariffs would be \"bad for the UK\" but insisted the government was in \"extensive\" talks to avoid them being imposed here.",
      "According to the OBR, these import taxes would have a direct impact on goods totalling around 0.2% of GDP.",
      "Before Trump's announcement, the OBR had warned of the risk of an escalating trade war, and while the proposals do not exactly match the watchdog's worst-case scenario, which would see the UK retaliate, Hughes said it had elements of it.",
      "Although 0.2% is a tiny amount, nevertheless it will affect the economy.",
      "And in the OBR's worst-case scenario, 1% would be knocked off economic growth.",

      "Uncertainty can stop firms and people spending",
      "Trump's trade policies and the fact that nobody seems to know whether he will follow through with his threats, U-turn on them, or how he will react to others is just one way his presidency is making the world so uncertain at the moment.",
      "The war in Ukraine continues, despite Trump's pledge to end it.",
      "The UK, along with Germany, has said it will increase defence spending. Trump has long called for European members of Nato to spend more on defence, and there are also fears that if the US does make a deal with Russia to end the war, that could leave Europe vulnerable.",
      "Domestically, businesses are also facing a worrying time as they brace for a rise in costs in April as employers' National Insurance contributions, the National Living wage and business rates are all set to go up.",
      "Some firms have said they have put off investment decisions as a result, and many have warned of price rises or job cuts. If these materialise, then that will knock growth.",
      "Break the rules or raise taxes",
      "Given all of the above, if the chancellor's headroom were to disappear, why would that matter?",
      "Reeves has staked her reputation on meeting her fiscal rules, pledging to bring \"iron discipline\" and provide stability and reassurance to financial markets, in contrast to former Prime Minister Liz Truss, whose unfunded tax cuts spooked the markets and raised interest rates.",
      "So if she is still to meet her rules and not borrow to fund day-to-day spending, that would mean either more spending cuts or tax rises.",
      "The government has already announced big cuts to the welfare bill as well as plans to cut the civil service and abolish several quangos including NHS England.",
      "But as Paul Dale, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, puts it: \"Non-defence spending can only be cut so far.\"",
      "By leaving herself so little wiggle room and with such a precarious economic outlook, \"we can surely now expect six or seven months of speculation about what taxes might or might not be increased in the autumn,\" says Paul Johnson from the IFS.",
      "That speculation itself can cause economic harm, he says.",
      "Reeves has not ruled out tax rises but told the BBC there were \"opportunities\" as well as \"risks\" for the UK economy."

      "Almost half the population, 32.4 million people, has now signed up to apps like Spotify and Apple Music, according to music industry analysts MIDiA Research.",
      "That's vastly more than the 20 million who pay for video streaming, but the number of new subscribers is tailing off. About 1.25 million new customers took out a plan last year, said MIDiA, representing growth of 4%. In 2020, that figure was 9%.",
      "MIDiA says the slowdown will lead to higher prices. \"If you're not growing users, what do you do? You get them to pay more,\" said the company's managing director, Mark Mulligan.",
      "Spotify has already bumped up the price of its premium plan in the UK. After years of being held at \u00a39.99, it increased to \u00a310.99 in summer 2024, and \u00a311.99 last May.",
      "The Swedish company is also reported to be introducing a new high-fidelity streaming option this year, which could cost an extra \u00a35 a month.",
      "Amazon Music, which is the UK's second-biggest streaming platform, also increased its prices in January.",
      "Mulligan said that was just the beginning.",

      "Sony Music's president of global digital business, Dennis Kooker, argues that such increases are vital.",
      "\"Spotify has publicly commented that their intention is to launch a higher price tier. I'm relying on that, and assuming that that is going to happen,\" he said at an event held by the recording industry organisation the IFPI last week.",
      "According to MIDiA, one alternative would be the introduction of \"a really cheap, entry level\" subscription to attract new users; but Kooker rejected that idea.",
      "\"We've really tried with mid-price tiers and, frankly, struggled to get them to work,\" he said.",
      "Users who don't want to pay can already access a \"pretty robust\" offering on ad-supported services like YouTube; while a monthly subscription offers millions of songs to everyone.",
      "\"Finding something in the middle that you can actually explain to consumers and that is different than what's already on offer has been really, really challenging,\" he explained.",
      "Outside of the UK,  MIDiA's latest report showed that the number of people subscribing to music streaming services grew by 11.6% year-on-year.",
      "Most of the growth came from emerging markets in Africa and India. China also extended its lead as the world's biggest streaming market, with 190 million subscribers.",
      "Mulligan predicted that the growth of streaming services outside Europe and America could change the way we listen to music.",
      "\"We'll see a cultural shift where these massive installed bases of streaming users in the global south will shape listening habits in the west.",
      "\"As they become bigger markets, more people [in those countries] will want to become artists, and more people will want to set up record labels.",
      "\"So more music will be made, more music will be exported, and there'll be a sort of cultural rebalancing.\"",
      "The change has already begun. According to the IFPI, Sub-Saharan Africa was the world's fastest-growing music market last year, with revenues surpassing $100 million (\u00a3770,000) for the first time.",
      "Genres like Afrobeats and Amapiano are already hugely popular and, last year, Nigerian star Burna Boy became the first African artist to headline a stadium show in the UK.",
      "South Korea is also a powerhouse - accounting for 45% of all physical albums sold in the last year - while Latin America boasts some of the world's biggest recording artists, including Bad Bunny, Karol G and Peso Pluma.",
      "As a result, the UK's historic musical dominance is waning.",
      "Last year, British musicians failed to appear in the Top 10 of the world's bestselling singles or albums, for the first time in two decades.",
      "\"In basic terms, the democratisation of music that we've seen, thanks to streaming, is wonderful - but it's a very crowded space,\" Victoria Oakley, head of the IFPI, told BBC News.",
      "\"The UK is seeing breakthrough artists like Myles Smith and Lola Young,\" she added, \"but that journey is rarely about overnight success these days.",

      "\"We'd also recommend taking a meter reading as close to 31 March as possible to ensure you're billed the correct amount for your energy usage,\" she says.",
      "2. Cut back",

      "When it comes to transport bills, you can't avoid the vehicle tax rise unless you ditch the car altogether.",

      "If you are struggling to pay your household bills, don't panic, says Richard Lane, chief client officer at the StepChange Debt Charity. He suggests creating a detailed budget that captures all your income and expenditure.",

      "Then check what support you are entitled to.",
      "Water companies offer lower \"social\" and hardship tariffs for people on very low incomes, so it is worth calling your provider. People claiming benefits can often also get lower tariffs for broadband.",
      "\"These organisations have a regulatory responsibility to treat customers fairly and will be able to offer you tailored support,\" Mr Lane added.",

      "The construction project will require a predicted workforce of 7,900, of which about two-thirds will be from outside the area.",
      "About 2,400 workers will be based on site with 500 others living at the former Pontins holiday park at Pakefield, near Lowestoft.",
      "The remaining contractors, however, will have to move into properties in or around the town of Leiston - population 5,508 - where some rents have doubled to more than \u00a33,000 a month.",

      "But she has been served a no-fault eviction notice, which her landlord says is unrelated to Sizewell C.",
      "He says he simply plans to retire, and reduce his outgoings by selling the property.",
      "Nevertheless, it has left Ms Ashford, a single mother who works in holiday lettings and cares for an elderly couple, looking for a new home and worried about what she can afford.",
      "Ms Ashford says: \"My whole life depends on me being here, but the greedy prices and extortionate rents are affecting the rest of the market.",
      "\"I feel very angry and I think what is happening in Leiston is criminal. Landlords are cashing in and the good days are way behind us.\"",
      "According to the ONS, 79.1% of people in East Suffolk aged between 16 and 64 are in paid work.",

      "\"But I am still afraid that 'the market' will trend upward quickly and they will just follow it or change their mind.",
      "\"So yeah, it feels like Sizewell is the feudal lord of the land here with landlords as vassals and we're at their total mercy. 'Uncertainty' is the word.\"",

      "Tim Day, director of Suffolk Coastal Estate Agents and Sizewell Lettings, says much of the current demand is for \"a service solution\" \u2013 a short-term option including bills and cleaning, \"not dissimilar to a holiday letting\".",
      "Although quoted prices may state, for example, \u00a33,000 a month, the tenant may not actually have to stay that long, says Mr Day, 55.",
      "\"There's not much difference between offering a service solution to Sizewell workers and doing Airbnb.",
      "\"We're in the accommodation business and we are responding to demand. But when one looks at that headline rate, it might not tell the true story.\"",

      "The US president's deadline to impose reciprocal tariffs on trading partners will come just days after he hit foreign carmakers with 25% import taxes.",
      "Vietnam could be particularly vulnerable to Trump's latest salvo of levies. It has a large trade deficit with the US and has been a beneficiary of firms moving factories out of China to avoid measures announced during his first term in office.",
      "While some countries have hit back at Washington, Vietnam's Prime Minister, Pham Minh Chinh, has suggested that he may take a more diplomatic approach.",
      "Speaking in January, he said he was willing to visit Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida and \"golf all day long\" if it benefits his country, drawing laughter in the room.",
      "And that idea may not be too far-fetched. The Trump Organization is planning to invest billions of dollars in golf courses, hotels and real estate in Vietnam, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "The first project will reportedly be a residential complex with three 18-hole golf courses, which will break ground in May.",
      "The BBC has contacted the company and its Vietnamese partner for comment.",
      "But could golf diplomacy really work?",
      "'Bamboo' economics",
      "Trump has previously said Vietnam was \"worse than China\" and \"almost the single worst abuser of anybody\".",
      "But he has not yet specifically targeted Vietnam with tariffs, even though it has the third largest trade deficit with the US, after China and Mexico.",
      "Analysts say Vietnam is doing well at engaging with Washington - but its efforts may still not be enough to avoid most of Trump's tariff plans.",
      "\"The Vietnam PM seems to be taking a page from the book of [former Japanese PM] Shinzo Abe, who built a close personal relationship with Trump over their shared love of golf,\" said Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator.",
      "\"I would not however expect any special treatment of Vietnam from a policy point of view. Personal relationships are important to Trump, but in this case, I believe his desire to appear tough on trade will win out.\"",
      "Vietnam has said it doesn't plan to \"restrict trade\" with the US, although it currently taxes some imports from there.",
      "The government said this week that it will allow SpaceX, which is owned by close Trump ally Elon Musk, to operate its Starlink satellite internet service in the country on a trial basis.",
      "Some analysts see this as one of the measures Vietnam has taken to avoid being hit with US tariffs.",
      "Hanoi also said it will lower tariffs on several US imports, including energy and cars, a move aimed at \"improving trade balances\".",
      "It came less than two weeks after Vietnamese and US companies signed more than $4bn (\u00a35.4bn) in deals, in areas including oil and gas exploration.",
      "Steve Norris from the consultancy Control Risks said \"Vietnam is being careful to avoid any moves which would signal any non-cooperation on trade issues\".",
      "This strategy is in line with its foreign policy approach - known as \"bamboo diplomacy\". Like shoots of plants that sway with the wind, Vietnam hopes to be adaptable to foreign pressures.",
      "\"If the US were to increase pressure on Vietnam, the government might respond with offers to facilitate investments in the hospitality and casino industries, undertake advanced machinery purchases, and \u2013 capturing the moment \u2013 consider access to Vietnam's rare earth minerals,\" Mr Norris said.",
      "What about China?",
      "One big factor working against Vietnam is concerns about China's influence.",
      "Vietnam was one of the biggest beneficiaries of US-China tensions during Trump's first term.",
      "In 2018, he hit China with tariffs, causing some businesses to rethink where they made their products. Some chose to shift manufacturing to Vietnam.",
      "This has led to an increase of exports from Vietnam to the US, with Chinese companies that have moved production there contributing to that figure.",
      "Former US trade negotiator Wendy Cutler said Vietnam has emerged as a \"destination for major Chinese investment\".",
      "While the US remains Vietnam's biggest export market, China is its largest supplier of goods, accounting for more than a third of imports, according to the latest official data.",
      "Chinese firms were also behind nearly one in every three new investments in Vietnam last year.",
      "\"These are huge red flags for Trump. My expectation is that Vietnam will at some point be hit hard by tariffs,\" Mr Olson said.",
      "However, tariffs on Vietnam could impact US businesses such as tech firms Apple and Intel, and sportswear giant Nike, which have moved production lines from China to Vietnam.",
      "A recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam found that most US manufacturers there expect to lay off staff if tariffs are imposed.",
      "The US president believes the levies will boost his country's economy by encouraging more businesses to make goods in the US and bring in billions of dollars of taxes.",
      "But many economists have warned that it could force up prices for American consumers and negatively impact global trade.",
      "What comes next?",
      "Washington is also concerned about so-called \"trans-shipments\" - Chinese goods passing through Vietnam on their way to other countries.",
      "US officials have been \"quietly stressing to Vietnam that it must reduce its trade surplus over time and combat the trans-shipment of Chinese goods through the country,\" Mr Norris said.",
      "Vietnam's prime minister has said he is confident that his administration can \"handle the relationship with the US\".",
      "Now that the South East Asian nation has cut some tariffs on US goods they may be more attractive to Vietnamese consumers, increasing America's share of trade with the country.",
      "And then there is golf - playing a game with Trump had worked for the late Japanese leader Shinzo Abe.",
      "Abe and Trump established a friendship, which included many golf games over several years. The friendship arguably helped Abe secure tariff exemptions for Japan's critical car industry at the time.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 00:06:53 GMT",
    "summary": "Shares in technology firms have both fallen and risen sharply over the past year.",
    "story": [
      "We have all heard of carmaker Ford, but what about its one-time rivals Abbot-Detroit, Acme, Adams and Aerocar?",
      "No? Well that is hardly surprising because unlike Ford they all went bust very early on. And they are just some of the failed car companies starting with the letter \"A\".",
      "We only remember the winners who went on to dominate the world's motor industry, and the current high-tech sector is much the same.",
      "A great many investors backed the wrong horseless carriages around a century ago and lost their money. Only a few picked Ford or Chrysler, which is almost exactly what is happening now, only to the tech sector.",
      "Tech shares have been hugely volatile over the past year, as has been widely reported, with share price graphs often looking like rollercoaster rides, even before President Trump's tariffs have caused wider stocks falls.",
      "Nvidia shares sink as Chinese AI app spooks markets",
      "Tesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon Musk",
      "US tech firms feel pinch from China tariffs",
      "A principle reason for this tech sector volatility, according to Elroy Dimson, professor of finance at the University of Cambridge, is that like the once nascent car industry we don't know which tech firms will win in the long run.",
      "\"If you go back to the beginning of the last century there were an awful lot of motor companies, and it was clear that automobiles were going to make a huge difference,\" says Prof Dimson. \"But almost every company went bankrupt, you didn't know which company you should be buying.\"",
      "Then, of course, not all high-tech businesses are making money. The measure of the return on an investment in shares uses two factors, the growth in profits or dividends, and the growth in the value of the shares.",
      "Boring companies might pay reliable dividends and see their shares gradually increase in value. But many high-tech companies are not paying out much if anything in dividends. Instead, they are investing in future growth, and so their share prices fluctuate based on hopes of future profits.",
      "As Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at UK financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, puts it: \"Tech shares are more volatile, they have high valuations and their price-earnings ratios are very high, and growth stocks are more sensitive to interest rate movements.\"",
      "But also, investors in such shares are, as Ms Streeter puts it, gambling on \"not jam today but jam tomorrow\". They are all trying to pick the next future big winner, not the one paying out profits now, but the one that will eventually pay huge dividends sometime in the future.",
      "So, any news or even suggestion that future growth is not going to be as good as previously expected means share values can collapse.",
      "On the other hand, any good news boosts share prices even if current profits, or even losses, don't change at all, as investors pile into what they think is the future winner. The shares are more volatile because they are not underwritten by current profits or dividends.",
      "That means as Prof Dimson puts it, \"that small changes in growth expectation can lead to large changes in share value\", which can effect a large number of companies at the same time.",
      "\"You have companies that are reasonably similar, so when growth rates change it is effecting quite a few companies in a similar way,\" he says.",
      "\"This is not different from the dotcom boom at the beginning of the 2000s. There were companies with huge growth prospects. And when the growth prospects disappeared, these were the companies that disappeared.\"",
      "Also, even today there are not that many really large high-tech companies. In America they are colloquially known as the \"magnificent seven\" - Nvidia, a chipmaker, Alphabet, which owns Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, the parent of Facebook, and Tesla.",
      "So, it does not take much to spook the market, especially since several of these firms are really quite young, and are dominant in sectors where previous leaders have crashed and burned. Anyone remember Ericsson, Boo or Compaq?",
      "Technology, unlike say steel production or food manufacturing, is changing at a very rapid rate, and there is obviously the chance that a new high-tech company will come along and destroy the business model of its most established rivals.",
      "There is simply no guarantee that today's \"magnificent seven\" will remain magnificent or even stay as the same seven firms.",
      "Take Tesla for example, its sales have recently fallen in response to two widely-reported factors. Firstly, some potential customers are opposed to Tesla owner Elon Musk's involvement in President Trump's government. And secondly, Chinese electric car firms such as BYD are increasingly strong competitors.",
      "Meanwhile, Nvidia saw its share price drop sharply at the start of this year following the release of Chinese artificial intelligence chatbot DeepSeek.  This app was reportedly created at a fraction of the cost of its rivals.",
      "The instant popularity of DeepSeek has raised questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning. This concerns Nvidia because it is at the forefront of making microchips for AI processing.",
      "AI is now the biggest tech game in town, and it seems that absolutely everyone is claiming that AI is transforming their industry, their products and their profits. They can't all be right.",
      "Or as Prof Dimon puts it: \"At least in 1910 you knew what automobiles did, but today with AI companies you have to rely on the wisdom of the crowd, and for AI companies that isn't good enough.\"",
      "And not all AI firms can win, adds Robert Whaley, professor of finance at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. \"AI is certainly contributing to tech volatility. The race is on.\"",
      "That means that AI shares are sensitive to predictions. And any sign that a particular firm is lagging in the AI race may mean that lots of investors, most of whom don't understand the subject, abandon it for another that seems to be further ahead.",
      "Then there are investors who seemingly don't seem to care which companies' shares they buy, so long as they are in the \"booming\" high-tech sector, as they are speculating and spreading their risks.",
      "In short, share prices are not always a rational measure of a firm's value, especially in the high-tech sector, or even of its prospects. Instead, they can represent the optimism of investors. And optimism does not always last.",
      "It is often short-lived, passing, and faddish. And sometimes optimism comes face to face with reality or just plain fades away. It is, in short, volatile.",

      "In exchange they are automatically rewarded bitcoin by the network.",
      "We're in the far north-western tip of Zambia near the border with the DRC, and of all the bitcoin mines I've visited - this one is the strangest.",

      "Philip's mine is plugged directly into a hydro-electric power plant that channels some of the Zambezi's torrent through enormous turbines to generate continuous, clean electricity.",
      "More importantly for bitcoin mining - it's cheap.",
      "So cheap it made business sense for Philip's Kenya-based company Gridless to drag its shipping container full of delicate bitcoin mining computers across bumpy narrow roads 14 hours from the nearest major city to set up here.",
      "Each machine makes about $5 (\u00a33.90) a day. More if the price of coins is high, less if it drops.",
      "Occasionally Philip glances down at his smart watch - the home screen showing the ever-changing squiggly line of bitcoin's dollar value.",
      "At the moment it's around $80,000 a coin, but Philip says they can make a profit even when the value of the bitcoin goes low thanks to the cheap electricity on the site and the partnership they have with the energy company.",
      "\"We recognised that in order to get better mining economics we needed to partner with the power company here and give them a revenue share. And so the reason we're willing to come out here somewhere so remote is it allows us to effectively get cheaper power,\" he says.",
      "Zengamina hydro-power plant is huge but technically it's a mini grid - a standalone island of power for the local community.",
      "It was built in the early 2000s thanks to $3m raised from charity donations.",
      "British-Zambian Daniel Rea runs the site after his missionary family led the building project, primarily to power the local hospital.",
      "Now it provides power for around 15,000 people in the local area but the project hasn't been able to make ends meet because of slow take-up from the community.",
      "Allowing the bitcoiners to set up shop here has been transformational to the business.",
      "\"Every day we were wasting over half of the energy we could generate which also meant we're not earning from that to meet our operating expenses. We needed a major user of power in the area and that's where the game-changing partnership with Gridless came in,\" Daniel says.",
      "The bitcoin mine now accounts for around 30% of the plant's revenue allowing them to keep the prices down for the local town.",
      "Bitcoin and its economics are of course far from the minds of the people in Zengamina.",
      "The town itself is a few miles from the plant and comprises not much more than a few dozen shed-like buildings peppering a cross roads.",
      "Only one shop has a fridge and a dozen kids crowd around a communal computer taking turns to choose a song to blare out, causing adults to wince as they go about their day.",
      "Although the hydro-electric plant came online in 2007, it took a few more years to connect it to the local town, and then more time to connect individual homes and businesses.",
      "So, some people like barber Damian are still enjoying the novelty of getting wired up only a year and a half ago.",
      "\"Until I got power I had nothing and couldn't do anything.  When I got power I bought everything at the same time.\"",
      "He's not joking. At night his tiny barber shop is a beacon of power with a TV playing music videos, strings of Christmas lights and the buzz of his hair clipper. Like moths, young people hang out in his barber shop like a youth hostel.",
      "\"Getting power has changed my life,\" he smiles. \"The money I'm earning now from the barbershop is helping me pay for school fees again.\"",
      "Embracing electricity is very much a business decision for Damian. At home he shares one light bulb between the two rooms that make up the small house.",
      "Elsewhere in the town sisters Tumba and Lucy Machayi sit on the crossroads watching the world go by.",
      "Like many young people, they're glued to their phones.",
      "\"Before the town got power, it was basically just the bush,\" says Lucy.",
      "The little electricity they had used to come from small solar panels, they say.",
      "\"No fridge, no TV, no mobile phone network,\" says Tumba.",
      "\"Electricity completely changed the lives of people here,\" Lucy adds.",

      "Zengamina Hydro has secured a large investment to help them expand to more villages and join up to the national grid.",
      "Soon the excess energy the mine was harvesting will be sold back to the national grid and mining bitcoin will no longer be profitable at Zengamina.",
      "Phillip and team are sanguine about this and insist this is good news. They will have had a successful few years here and ultimately they are happy to have helped Zengamina. And made a tidy profit in bitcoin of course.",

      "Gridless already has six sites like this in three different African countries.",

      "But Gridless now plans an ambitious next move - to build their own hydro-plants from scratch to mine for bitcoin and bring electricity to rural areas.",
      "The company's co-founder Janet Maingi says the company is busy raising tens of millions of dollars for the project.",
      "They're focusing on so-called run-of-river hydroelectric models like at Zengamina and the continent has an abundance of \"untapped hydro potential\" she says.",
      "\"A consumer-driven, adaptive energy model is essential for scalable, affordable, and sustainable energy access that meets the needs of African communities,\" she explains.",
      "The company is not a charity and believes that ensuring long-term economic viability for developers and investors can only be done through bitcoin.",
      "Finding locations for a new plant or to tap into existing ones is the easy part though.",
      "The company still faces resistance from some authorities and companies which see bitcoin as an energy-greedy and selfish use of electricity that might otherwise be used by rural people.",
      "But the company insists that the incentive is always to sell to the highest buyer and that will always, they say, be the local community.",
      "History tells us that without incentives or rules in place, bitcoin mining at scale can put strain on public energy grids. In Kazakhstan in 2020-2021 a mining boom increased energy usage in the country by 7% before the government clamped down and clipped the wings of the burgeoning industry.",
      "In the US - bitcoin mining's new mecca - conflicts between miners, locals and residents have been common when electricity is in high demand.",
      "Authorities have created agreements with some mining giants to ensure that they power down their warehouses chock full of computers at times when the grid needs balancing.",
      "For example, Greenidge gas power plant in New York which was renovated to mine bitcoin was mandated to power down mining in January to supply electricity to the grid during a cold snap.",
      "Agreements like these will need to be widespread if President Donald Trump's ambition for bitcoin to be \"mined, minted and made in the USA\" is to be achieved.",
      "The environmental impact of the industry is also a major concern. It's estimated that bitcoin mining uses as much energy as a small country like Poland.",

      "1. Shop around",
      "For some services you can often get a better deal simply by calling the company you are with and saying you are considering leaving.",

      "Gas and electricity are often the biggest bills people face and the price cap set by the regulator is rising by 6%, so it is worth finding the best deal for you.",
      "That may include choosing a fixed rate deal, says Ms Seymour. If you charge an electric vehicle or use appliances overnight, look for a deal with a cheaper night tariff.",
      "\"We'd also recommend taking a meter reading as close to 31 March as possible to ensure you're billed the correct amount for your energy usage,\" she says.",
      "2. Cut back",
      "One surefire way to keep your bills down is to reduce what you use.",
      "Taking shorter showers and putting in a showerhead with a slower flow will save money on your water and energy bills.",
      "\"You have to treat water as an expensive resource,\" Ms Haine says.",
      "Getting a water meter fitted may save you money, she adds.",
      "Smart meters for electricity and gas can also help you keep tabs on what is pushing up your energy bills most, the Energy Saving Trust says.",
      "The trust advises draught-proofing your home, including round floorboards, pipework and old extractor fans, and setting the thermostat to the lowest comfortable temperature. For most people, it says, that is between 18\u00b0C and 21\u00b0C.",
      "MoneySavingExpert says you can save money by using the principle: \"heat the human, not the home\". Using hot water bottles and electric blankets should work out cheaper than turning up the radiators.",
      "You can also change the settings on combi or conventional boilers to save money, says Martin Lewis at MoneySavingExpert.",
      "When it comes to transport bills, you can't avoid the vehicle tax rise unless you ditch the car altogether.",
      "But if you are taking the train it is also worth checking whether a railcard will help, points out Ms Seymour.",
      "\"To cut costs on rail fares, we'd recommend booking tickets in advance and splitting fares where possible,\" she says.",
      "3. Get help",
      "If you are struggling to pay your household bills, don't panic, says Richard Lane, chief client officer at the StepChange Debt Charity. He suggests creating a detailed budget that captures all your income and expenditure.",
      "\"This will allow you to get a clear picture of your finances and see how much you have leftover to pay toward any debts or make savings,\" he says.",
      "Then check what support you are entitled to.",
      "Water companies offer lower \"social\" and hardship tariffs for people on very low incomes, so it is worth calling your provider. People claiming benefits can often also get lower tariffs for broadband.",
      "\"These organisations have a regulatory responsibility to treat customers fairly and will be able to offer you tailored support,\" Mr Lane added.",
      "There is the government's Warm Home Discount, for people with high energy costs on a very low income, including Pension Credit. And people on low incomes are also eligible for a reduction in council tax.",
      "Check if you qualify for a free TV licence. If you are over 75 and on Pension Credit or live with someone who is, then you will.",
      "You may also be able to boost your income. Check which benefits you are entitled to on the independent MoneyHelper website, backed by the government, or using benefits calculators run by Policy in Practice and charities Entitledto and Turn2us.",
      "If you are struggling with debt here are some other organisations that may be able to help."

      "At one table, a teenager tucks into a ham sandwich while on the phone with a friend. She stays for well over half an hour.",
      "At another, an elderly couple chat over a hot meal, while a queue of customers steadily forms at the till.",
      "But this is one of 52 cafes set to close - including others in London, Leeds, Portsmouth and Glasgow - announced this week in a cost-cutting drive that the supermarket chain says is designed to \"renew and reinvigorate Morrisons\" and focus \"investment into the areas that customers really value\".",
      "That came two months after Sainsbury's said it was closing all 61 of its supermarket cafes.",
      "While some see the decline of supermarket cafes as inevitable, shoppers around the country have told BBC News that these cafes give them a cheap, convenient and welcoming place to get a warm meal while catching up with friends.",
      "'Share a meal without the stress of cooking'",
      "Regulars at the Morrisons cafe in Queensbury say they're surprised - and saddened - to hear it's closing.",

      "Morrisons says 344 of its cafes will remain open despite the planned closures but, according to its chief executive Rami Baiti\u00e9h, \"a minority have specific local challenges and in those locations, regrettably, closure and re-allocation of the space is the only sensible option\".",

      "Such outlets can come in handy for parents, too. Lisa Clavering, from St Albans, says she relied on Asda and Morrisons cafes for a \"quick and cheap hot lunch\" when her two sons were younger.",
      "\"As they grew, it was somewhere we could go together and share a meal without the stress of cooking it and cleaning up, where I didn't feel judged by other customers if they made a noise,\" the 42-year-old says.",
      "Lisa says part of the appeal of supermarket cafes is that they feel accessible - a \"warm and welcoming place with no fuss and no surprises\".",
      "\"I do worry that once they go, there's not really a like-for-like to replace them, and other alternatives are typically much more expensive,\" Lisa says.",

      "The closure of Morrisons cafes \"should come as no surprise,\" retail analyst Natalie Berg tells the BBC.",
      "\"The grocers are desperately trying to navigate significant cost headwinds, while simultaneously competing with discounters like Aldi and Lidl.",
      "\"This is a low-margin industry, so supermarkets need to be utterly ruthless when it comes to cost-cutting.\"",
      "When shoppers come into larger supermarkets, they \"want low prices and they want a frictionless experience. In-store cafes work in certain locations, but they're simply not essential for most stores,\" Ms Berg says.",
      "It largely echoes the reasoning Sainsbury's has given for its closures - that \"the majority of [its] most loyal shoppers do not use the cafes regularly\".",
      "Ben Tinca, 19, a student living near the Morrisons store in Queensbury, says he usually meets his friends at fast-food chains like Nando's, KFC and McDonald's.",

      "\"If it was popular, you'd hear about it,\" like when Pret A Manger changed its subscription service, he says.",
      "And besides, rival supermarket chains Tesco and Marks & Spencer - which have more than 300 cafes each - haven't said anything about closing their cafes.",

    "summary": "Why the reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge",
    "story": [
      "I remember 1974 well. With inflation on the rise, the government had been locked in battle with trade unions over worker pay. The government appeared paralysed: stand up to the miners and strikes could shut down the power system, but give in and pay them more money and inflation would rocket.",
      "And then the global oil crisis came out of nowhere. It threw economies, including Britain's, into chaos. The government introduced a three-day week. Power cuts were common - we would be plunged into darkness without warning. And seemingly, the government just expected us to deal with it.",
      "This was also the year I began presenting the BBC's current affairs programme Panorama. We spent a lot of time debating these issues. People came on with all kinds of different ideas of what to do.",
      "There were even suggestions that what the country really needed to take back control from the unions was a military takeover - a coup.",
      "There was another idea out there too. It was proposed by the Conservative politician Keith Joseph and was entirely radical - so removed from the mainstream, in fact, that during filming of Panorama, Joseph turned to the production team and asked exasperatedly if they understood what he meant.",
      "That idea was the free market.",
      "This meant Britain departing from the post World War Two consensus that government should control the economy and that instead if you left the markets alone, they would deliver the country greater prosperity and security.",
      "If, in 2025, the idea sounds anything but radical, that's exactly the point.",
      "What we saw in the UK in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government was just how quickly the free market transitioned from a radical idea into the new reality. Then before long it became what many assumed was the system that would last forever.",
      "US President Donald Trump is a billionaire businessman who has clearly done well financially out of capitalism. But suddenly, thanks in part to him, the free market system finds itself under assault like never before.",
      "It might yet weather the storm. However others are asking, is the free market system fatally flawed and doomed to failure?",
      "The fantasy world of Thatcher's Britain",
      "So much of what Thatcher did in the wake of her 1983 general election victory seems so obvious now. We take it for granted that private companies play a pivotal role in providing our water, electricity, gas, railways, ports and freight.",
      "But at the time few believed it possible to do what she had done - it seemed like a fantasy world, completely detached from how things had been done post war.",
      "I was six when the war ended. There was rationing \u2013 coupons that allowed you to buy meat or clothes, or of course, sweets. But out of these hard times and on the heels of victory, a new vision of society was emerging in Britain.",
      "With Clement Attlee's landslide election victory in July 1945, for the first time in Britain's political history a majority cast their votes for a party ostensibly dedicated to socialism.",
      "But more than that, a new consensus on how the country should run emerged, with those leading the Labour and Conservative parties singing from a broadly similar sheet.",
      "\"We have built our defences against want and sickness, and we're proud of it,\" was uttered not by a Labour prime minister but by Harold Macmillan, Conservative prime minister from 1957 to 1963. This had been how things were done.",
      "However not everyone bought into the consensus. Antony Fisher, who was a chicken farmer, was exasperated by what he saw as the meddling of the Egg Marketing Board. He set up the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, inspired Keith Joseph and he in turn got Thatcher's ear.",
      "Trump's admiration of Thatcher",
      "That the current assault on the free market is coming, in part, from a Republican US president seems all the more ironic given how popular Thatcher's reforms were with the American right.",
      "Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan shared a similar world view, and Trump has spoken of his admiration for the two, albeit with the caveat that he didn't agree with some of Reagan's trade policies.",
      "Thatcher was convinced that the country would be much better off if gas and water and electricity were taken out of the hands of the state. And sold on the open market. The free market. Just like buying a loaf of bread.",
      "The Thatcher government's big idea was that they weren't just going to sell the shares in state-owned utilities to big businesses or investors. They were going to offer them to the British people.",
      "In December 1984 shares in British Telecom (BT) went on sale. The next morning, the numbers were staggering: more than two million Britons were now BT shareholders.",
      "And Thatcher began to realise that selling off these companies wasn't just about breaking the shackles of government control. It could be something bigger - turning every person in Britain into a capitalist and in doing so making capitalism popular.",
      "In Britain, by the end of the 1980s, the scale of transformation was staggering. The sum of \u00a360bn was raised by selling off state run companies. Up to 15 million Britons were now shareholders.",
      "Britain was embracing the free market. This wasn't just an economic shift. It was a cultural revolution. A redefinition of Britain's relationship with money, with government, and with itself.",
      "And if Thatcher's privatisation had given ordinary people the chance to buy shares, her reforms to Britain's financial services sector in 1986, known as the Big Bang, gave ordinary people the chance to sell them too, to get a job in the previously closed world of the City.",
      "There were many on the left for whom the principle alone of these reforms was something to object to. The assault on the free market from some on the right is not about the principles of the reforms, but the consequences.",
      "Offshore business and collapsing communities",
      "At the core of Thatcher's thinking was a belief that free market capitalism could work only if many people had a direct stake in it. And with share ownership of previously state run utilities, many people did. But before long, alarm bells were starting to be rung. And their chime has only gotten louder.",
      "James Goldsmith was a businessman who had made a fortune by buying struggling companies cheaply, reshaping them to maximise efficiency and then selling them at a profit. The 1980s reforms were like manna from heaven for him.",
      "But then he seemed to change his mind about things. In 1994 he told a committee of US senators that its premise contained a fatal flaw - that the system demanded maximum profit but to achieve maximum profit that meant severing the umbilical link with many of your own electorate.",
      "\"You get to a system whereby, to get the best corporate profits, you have to leave your own country. You have to say to your own sales force 'Goodbye, we can't use you anymore - you're too expensive'.",
      "\"You've got unions. You want holidays. You want protection. So we're going offshore.\"",
      "Goldsmith was predicting that companies would take their business wherever they would make the most money. If you are a CEO answerable to shareholders that's literally your job description. And the result, he said, would be job losses in the West, with communities collapsing.",
      "And to make things worse, he argued that Britain had ceded sovereignty to the likes of the European Union and the World Trade Organization, with Britain binding itself to an economic system run by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, only adding to the sense of alienation felt in collapsing communities. And with global markets dictating policy. If an industry wasn't profitable, it was left to die.",
      "Today, the UK may be a global leader in science and financial services but is that of much consolation to communities where we once made things that are now made offshore?",
      "Based on what I often heard in my many years touring the country presenting Question Time, I'm not sure it is.",
      "Goldsmith would end up trying to go into politics. His Referendum Party was trounced in the 1997 general election but he had planted a seed. He had argued that the global free market path that Britain and the rest of the world was going down was dangerous. That it would spread division around the world.",
      "Fast-forward nearly 20 years to 2016 and his warning came to pass. Britain voted to leave the European Union and the verdict could not be clearer: the Leave vote was highest in those left-behind communities, seemingly fuelled by those who felt globalisation was not working for them.",
      "The dream of a nation of shareholders has soured too.",
      "In 1989 Thames Water was privatised. We were promised lower bills, better infrastructure, less red tape and investment in a system fraying at the edges. It was investment that the global capitalist system was supposedly best placed to provide.",
      "What followed was something else entirely. Debt ballooned and dividends flowed to shareholders. The company extracted profit while pipes leaked and sewage poured into rivers. And our bills now pay for interest on that debt - it feels like we've come a long way from Thatcher's nation of shareholders.",
      "Trump's tariffs 'defy easy explanation'",
      "Back in 1994, James Goldsmith had posited that the problem with the free market dream was that it didn't protect the home base.",
      "Now, there is someone else much more powerful who takes that view.",
      "President Trump's methods are so erratic that with him it's hard to tell what is going on. His readiness to slap hugely consequential tariffs on countries that are both traditional foes and supposed friends at times defies easy explanation.",
      "But what we can say is that he is trying to return to ideas that preceded the free market. He is trying to make America strong through protectionism, making it harder for anyone to simply sell anywhere.",
      "There is an argument that if you take the long view then perhaps the free market period is the outlier. Britain itself had a long, long period of protectionism before it embraced free trade.",
      "Tariffs are nothing new in world economic history and in a sense Trump is just trying to return the US to how things were, albeit in quite a chaotic way.",
      "The reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge. But that challenge is coming not from supporters of socialism who ideologically back a big role for the state. Instead, the challenge is coming from Trump, a man who is broadly speaking of the right and has no qualms with capitalism allowing people to become very rich.",
      "That the challenge is coming from within is what makes it so potent.",

      "A series of essential bills are rising at the start of what some commentators have described as \"awful April\".",
      "The exact amount you pay will depend on your individual circumstances, and where you live.",
      "Although minimum wages are also increasing, and wages on average have been outpacing inflation, household finances could still come under extra pressure.",
      "Here are seven ways in which you could be affected from 1 April.",
      "1. Water bills",
      "Water bills for households are going up in England and Wales by \u00a310 more per month on average, but there's a lot of variation depending on the company.",
      "For example, the annual Southern Water bill will jump 47% to \u00a3703, while Anglian Water customers will pay 19% more, or \u00a3626.",
      "Factors including whether households have a meter and how much water used will also impact bills, which are being front-loaded for the next five years, meaning the big increase is coming this year.",
      "Water companies in England and Wales have said the increases are needed to invest in creaking infrastructure, including sewage, and to build more reservoirs.",
      "In Scotland, water bills are rising by almost 10%. Scottish Water, which is a public body, said spending was needed to cope with periods of \"drought and intense rainfall\" brought on by climate change.",
      "Domestic customers in Northern Ireland are not billed for water, with the system funded by the devolved government.",
      "How much will I have to pay for my water?",
      "How much will I have to pay for my water?",
      "2. Energy bills",
      "The annual energy bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity is going up by \u00a3111 a year to \u00a31,849 from April.",
      "Regulator Ofgem increased the energy price cap because of higher wholesale costs and inflation.",
      "The cap is set every three months and limits the amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity, but not the total bill, so if you use more, you will pay more.",
      "It affects 22 million homes in England, Wales and Scotland.",
      "Standing charges - fixed fees to connect to a gas and electricity supply and vary by region - are rising again for gas but dropping for electricity, but it depends on where you live.",

      "3. Council tax",
      "It is likely the tax you pay to your local authority is going up.",
      "In England, local authorities with responsibility for delivering social care can increase council tax every year by up to 4.99% without triggering a referendum or local vote.",
      "Smaller councils without social care duties can increase bills by up to 2.99%.",
      "For 2025-26, the government is allowing Bradford, Newham, Birmingham, Somerset, and Windsor and Maidenhead to bypass the 4.99% cap, meaning they could raise council tax by more.",
      "Council tax rates in Scotland have been frozen or had limited increases since 2007, but they are are going up, in some cases by as much as 10%.",
      "The Scottish government says it is offering local authorities an extra \u00a31bn in 2025-26 to help reduce the scale of any rise.",
      "In Wales, council tax rates could jump by as much 15% in some areas. Local authorities were given \u00a3253m by the Welsh government in its draft budget, but council leaders say more money needed.",

      "4. Car tax",
      "The standard rate of tax for cars registered after April 2017 is rising \u00a35 to \u00a3195 a year. According to the RAC, you may pay less or more if your car was first used before 2017.",
      "The exact amount for your road tax will depend on the year your car was registered and the type of fuel it uses.",
      "One big change is that electric vehicles (EVs) will no longer be tax exempt. EVs registered from April 2025 will pay the lowest rate of \u00a310 in the first year, then move to the standard rate. The standard rate will also apply to EVs first registered after April 2017.",
      "5. Broadband, phone and TV licence",
      "Rule changes introduced by the telecoms regulator this year mean that mobile and broadband providers must now tell customers \"in pounds and pence\" about any price rises, as well as when they occur.",
      "The new rules typically only apply to new customers, so any price rise will depend on when you took your contract out, but prices ususally increase around now.",
      "For instance, under the new rules, someone with a mobile Sim only contract with EE will see their bill go up by \u00a31.50 a month, or \u00a318 a year.",
      "But for the majority of EE customers who took their contract out before 10 April 2024, they will face an increase of 6.4%, which is based on the inflation rate last December together with an additional charge.",
      "Similarly, most Virgin Media broadband customers will face a 7.5% rise in bills, but for anyone who took out a contract after 9 January this year, their monthly bill will go up by \u00a33.50.",
      "The cost of a TV licence is also going up by \u00a35 to \u00a3174.50, and for a black and white TV is going up by \u00a31.50 to \u00a358.50.",
      "6. Stamp duty",
      "House buyers in England and Northern Ireland will start paying stamp duty on properties over \u00a3125,000, instead of over \u00a3250,000.",
      "First-time buyers currently had paid no stamp duty on homes up to \u00a3425,000, but this is dropping to \u00a3300,000.",

      "7. Hidden tax rises",
      "The government has kept in place the freeze on tax thresholds on income tax and National Insurance until 2028, a policy brought in by the previous government.",
      "This is often dubbed a stealth tax - as governments don't explicitly label it as a tax.",
      "But the policy amounts to a tax rise because of a process called \"fiscal drag\", which sees more people \"dragged\" into paying higher rates of tax as wages rises.",
      "The new tax year begins on 6 April.",

      "\"I didn't think you'd leave an animal in the state that room was in,\" he says. \" There was no care at all. You would not leave a vulnerable old man like that.\"",
      "Months earlier, John had vanished. His eldest granddaughter, Amy, had taken control of his welfare and his finances, and stopped any contact between John and the rest of his family, including Barbara, his wife of many years.",
      "With Amy's help, John had changed his will, making her the sole beneficiary, and had then been left to live by himself in a single room, confused and isolated.",
      "John's family was one of hundreds who contacted the BBC after hearing The Willpower Detectives last year.",
      "The series revealed how a partner at an Essex-based law firm was using what's known as Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) to take over the finances of vulnerable clients.",
      "In June, Parliament will debate a private member's bill to provide extra safeguards to LPA. The bill - introduced by the MP Fabian Hamilton - has cross-party support, and is shaped in part by the BBC's investigations and the huge public response to the cases raised.",
      "The story of John Wilcox demonstrates how, in handing over responsibility for their financial assets, vulnerable people can sometimes be put at risk by members of their own family.",
      "After many years of running a successful office-furnishing business in Leeds, John and Barbara Wilcox had retired and were living comfortably in mid-Wales.",
      "Both had been married before. John had no children of his own, but he loved Barbara's son and daughter as his own, as well as her three grandchildren. To each of these, he had given enough money to buy their first homes.",
      "However, everything changed in 2020 when John was diagnosed with dementia.",
      "The condition caused a personality change, and John became delusional and paranoid. He started to accuse Barbara and his own brother Desmond of plotting against him.",
      "Following a collapse at home John was taken to hospital, where - because of Covid restrictions - nobody was allowed to visit.",
      "This isolation fed John's feelings of paranoia, and the suspicion that he had been abandoned by his family.",
      "It was during this time that John's eldest granddaughter, Amy - the one person he still seemed to trust - began to take charge of his life.",
      "At first, no-one in the family was suspicious. John had always been close to Amy.",
      "Unknown to them, John had requested and signed a form banning contact between anyone involved in his care and anyone in his family, apart from Amy.",
      "Even though his medical notes describe him as paranoid and delusional, John was declared as having \"mental capacity\" - this was significant because it meant he could legally grant someone lasting power of attorney over his finances.",
      "Barbara says her efforts to raise concerns with social services were blanked: \"They just didn't want to know. They weren't interested in the letters that we wrote.\"",
      "After three months in hospital, John was discharged into Amy's care. She suggested he could recuperate at a care home at Paignton in Devon, near where she lived, while she readied her house for him to stay there.",
      "At this stage, the other family members thought this was just a temporary arrangement in everyone's best interests. Amy said that it was what John wanted, and it would be a respite for Barbara.",
      "However, Barbara recalls: \"As soon as she got him down there, the vitriol started.\" Amy told the rest of the family they no longer had any say about John's welfare, and they were not to try to contact him.",
      "In response to their pleas, it was agreed that a niece of John's would call him once a week to check that he was alright.",
      "But six weeks after he was admitted to the care home, the niece made her regular call, only to be told that John had left.",
      "The family was devastated - John had disappeared.",
      "They went to the police but were told he had signed a form in hospital instructing that no information should be shared with them. They were only told that John was not living with Amy.",
      "The family discovered that John had signed an LPA document giving Amy power of attorney over all his property and finances.",
      "Meanwhile, a solicitor in Devon contacted Barbara asking about their home and joint assets. Barbara later found out about John's new will, which named Amy as the sole beneficiary.",
      "This development had immediate and stressful consequences. The solicitor asked Barbara to begin the process of selling the home she had shared with John, in order to release his share of their assets.",
      "John's brother, Desmond, took the lead in trying to find out where John now was. It took him several weeks.",
      "He says he rang 50 care homes, trying to track John down. He and Barbara also wrote to Amy asking her to at least tell them how her grandfather was, but they say they never received a reply.",
      "Eventually, Amy's aunt confronted her in person, and found out that John was in a hotel in Torquay.",
      "Desmond knew that in the past, John had lent \u00a3100,000 to a friend who owned several hotels in south-west England.",
      "It appeared that John had been put up at one of these hotels. The owner had made a deal to offset John's bill (a nightly rate of \u00a3265) against his outstanding debt.",
      "Amy's father, David, drove to the hotel. He was horrified by what he found: \"The conditions he was living in were appalling. I was absolutely astounded.\"",
      "John was renting the room only - with no cleaning services or food. There was a fridge and a microwave oven - in which he would heat ready meals supplied by Amy.",
      "For David, it was the ultimate betrayal of a vulnerable man. He says that John was dishevelled and confused: \"He was just abandoned. He hardly went out of that room and it was in a terrible state.\"",
      "Having found John, his family decided they needed to tread carefully. They say they wanted him to understand the truth about what had been done to him, and they were also worried that Amy might try to move him again.",
      "At first, John refused to see Barbara, claiming she had tried to kill him, and that she had never come to see him in hospital.",
      "And then one day, Barbara drove to John's hotel with her son David and his partner Julie. She stayed outside in the car but gave David a tin of flapjacks to take to John in his room.",
      "The touch and smell of a faded everyday item - an old cake tin with some homemade flapjacks inside - seemed to have an effect on him.",
      "\"I know what's in there,\" he said to his stepson.",
      "\"Do you know who made them?\" David remembers asking John.",
      "John replied: \"Yes I do.\"",
      "David then offered to bring Barbara into the hotel room and John agreed.",
      "Barbara says she was heartbroken by her husband's physical and mental deterioration. He weighed only seven-and-a-half stone, and he was so weak that she thinks he would have died if he had been left much longer.",
      "It was a \"very, very emotional\" reunion, she remembers. Before long, they were holding hands and John had agreed to come home with her.",
      "The next day, Barbara and her brother Mike came back to the hotel to pick John up. Mike says it felt like they were \"planning a heist\". He recalls that \"as we drove away and started to get out of Torquay, I said: 'Oh gosh, we got away with that.'\"",
      "Back in Wales, Barbara was able to see John's bank accounts, and discovered that Amy had taken more than \u00a35,000 - there was just 16p left in his account.",
      "But John's story had a happy ending of sorts. He managed to get the power of attorney and the new will cast aside, and lived for nine months with Barbara in Wales, before dying peacefully at home.",
      "His tale highlights the difficulties involved when it comes to deciding who has control of what's often seen as \"family money\", and who will inherit it.",
      "Issues of mental capacity have to be considered in situations like these, according to James Warner, a consultant in old-age psychiatry.",
      "\"Dementia makes people susceptible to manipulation and those involved with overseeing important changes need to be extra-vigilant,\" he says.",
      "The elderly and vulnerable can quickly find themselves in situations where they are extremely vulnerable, he says, and more needs to be done to protect them.",
      "The Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) holds power of attorney records for more than eight million people in England and Wales, but last year it investigated fewer than 1% of the cases brought to its attention.",
      "Labour MP Fabian Hamilton says the OPG can be \"toothless\" for vulnerable elderly people and their families.",
      "Mr Hamilton says changes are needed to provide greater safeguards, and his private member's bill on attorney powers is due for its second reading in June.",
      "The bill - which has cross-party support - would compel banks and regulators to check for issues such as cognitive decline, and greater scrutiny over whether an attorney is abusing their LPA powers.",
      "Barbara thinks that the proposed legislation could have helped in her situation.",
      "\"In cases like John's, where you have this kind of paranoia, solicitors involved with a power of attorney should be making enquiries of the family and verifying,\" she says.",
      "Meanwhile, John's family have had no contact with Amy, unable to forgive the hurt she caused them and what she put her grandfather through.",
      "They say they still do not understand why Amy acted in the way she did. She (along with John's other grandchildren) had already been given money enough to buy a house each, and she stood to inherit more eventually.",
      "In May 2024, Amy accepted a police caution for fraud - which in law is an admission of guilt - specifically because she had taken money from John's account after he had returned to Wales, and was no longer in her care.",
      "When I wrote to Amy about this, she replied that she had only accepted the caution to lift the stress from herself and her family, and didn't regard it as just.",
      "She told me that there were two sides to every story and that all of John's decisions were made by him in the company of his solicitor. She added that the decision not to tell John's family anything was at his request."

      "Clearer advice is needed on how to make campuses inclusive without falling foul of free speech regulations, the National Union of Students (NUS) has said.",
      "The body representing university students has expressed concern after the University of Sussex was fined \u00a3585,000 by the Office for Students (OfS) this week for failing to uphold free speech - the first case of its kind.",
      "The higher education regulator launched an investigation back in 2021 when Professor Kathleen Stock left the university. She had faced protests after saying that biological sex was more important than gender identity.",
      "According to the OfS, the university's policy statement on trans and non-binary equality, including a requirement to \"positively represent trans people\", might have led to staff and students preventing themselves from voicing opposing views.",
      "That has triggered not only the threat of a court showdown, after the university vowed to challenge the OfS's findings, but also put universities across the UK on alert over further free speech-related fines - and leaving some fearing a catch-22 situation.",
      "Universities in England are asking for clarity behind the scenes on how to protect their students from abuse and harassment because the regulator hasn't spelt out what is acceptable.",
      "The regulator told the BBC it would be writing to a handful of institutions to remind them of their duty to protect free speech. Arif Ahmed, from the OfS, warned the University of Sussex fine could have been as high as \u00a33.7m and there was \"potential for higher fines in the future\".",
      "Finding the balance",
      "Commenting for the first time since the fine was issued to Sussex, the NUS said it was concerned about the size of the fine at a time when university finances are under pressure.",
      "Its vice president for liberation and equality Saranya Thambirajah said it was important universities were welcoming places for all marginalised groups of students - and suggested the money could have gone towards improving student welfare instead.",
      "She told the BBC it's \"really unclear\" where the OfS is drawing the line on what is or isn't acceptable.",
      "\"We would say at the NUS, that the line between freedom of harm and freedom of speech right now is not falling in the right place, or at the very least, there is very little clarity from the regulator as to where that line should be falling,\" she said.",
      "The OfS has said it should be possible to express any lawful view on campus - but the trans and non-binary equality policy at the heart of the Sussex row, which was in place until last year, illustrates the potential challenges ahead.",
      "One of the concerns raised by the regulator was a section in the policy which said that harassment or bullying including intrusive behaviour, name calling or derogatory jokes were serious disciplinary offences.",
      "Now, the university has replaced it with a new trans and non-binary policy - but the regulator hasn't told bosses yet whether or not that passes the free-speech test.",
      "Next free speech fine may cost millions, unis told",
      "Government to implement university free speech law",
      "And in another potential point of tension, from 1 August a new regulation comes into force requiring universities in England to go further in showing how they will promote and uphold free speech on campus.",
      "The OfS says this shouldn't include the content of courses or discussions in the lecture hall. All higher education institutions have to meet conditions to register with the OfS in order to charge tuition fees.",
      "But they will also have to show how they are acting to prevent the harassment of students - and universities are required to try to increase applications from underrepresented groups, through initiatives to make them feel more included.",
      "Lawyer Smita Jamdar, who advises universities in England on how to comply with regulations, says that to reduce harassment, universities need to be \"really clear about the behaviour you will and will not tolerate\" and that action will be taken when students \"transgress those boundaries\".",
      "While that has to be balanced against freedom of speech, Ms Jamdar said most people would expect \"the line to be drawn somewhere other than name calling and derogatory jokes\".",
      "When the BBC looked at similar trans equality policies at a number of universities it wasn't entirely clear whether they would be considered a challenge to free speech.",
      "Of course, the implications of the Sussex fine for universities across the country straddle many other free speech debates and groups of students, including all the potential flashpoints of race, religion, ethnicity and conflict which sometimes play out on university campuses.",
      "The impacts of the Sussex fine are unlikely to go away any time soon, with vice-chancellors and students alike calling for more clarity.",
      "One of those major tests would be if University of Sussex's vice-chancellor, Prof Sasha Roseneil, gets her day in court. The university has confirmed it will seek a review by a senior judge of the inquiry.",
      "If the Sussex case gets debated in court, plenty of people on other campuses would be listening closely."

      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said it will help plug \"the significant gaps in provision\".",
      "An estimated 1.7 million school-aged children have special educational needs and disabilities in England.",
      "Those with further needs can receive legal entitlement to more specific support, often in a specialist school, via an education, health and care plan (EHCP).",
      "The number of pupils with an EHCP, who need a place in specialist provision, is forecast by local authorities to rise by 44,000 in the next three years - from 229,000 in 2024-25 to 273,000 in 2028-29.",
      "This is the second year figures on special school capacity have been collected by the Dfe.",
      "It says the reason for the gap in provision is because of the number of schools at or over capacity. However, the figures may not reflect the current pupils attending special schools because of the different and changing needs for which schools cater.",
      "It found there were 92,000 secondary places across special state schools in England, but about 100,000 secondary pupils on the roll in May 2024.",
      "In a highly critical report earlier this year, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) found a Send system \"in disarray\", \"mired in red tape, lacking funding, and failing to produce value for money\".",
      "It warned 40% of councils would be \"staring down bankruptcy\" next year, when a scheme allowing local authorities to keep those deficits off their financial books expires.",
      "The government is encouraging local authorities to help mainstream schools to set up more provision for children with Send within their own schools.",
      "Fewer than one in 10 mainstream schools have SEN units or resourced provision which provide more intensive support for pupils, according to the Dfe.",
      "It hopes to reform the system to be more inclusive so children's need can be identified and met at an earlier point in mainstream schools, and special schools can cater to those with the most complex needs.",
      "Releasing more details on the plans, Phillipson said: \"This investment is a big step towards delivering not only enough school places, but the right school places, supporting all children and particularly those with Send, and plugging the significant gaps in provision we inherited\".",
      "Elsewhere, the figures on school capacity show 16% of primary schools are over capacity, down 1% on last year, and 24% of secondary schools, up 1% on last year.",
      "There has been an increase in 24,000 school places overall, but this is falling because of the reduction in pupil numbers since 2018-19.",
      "It has been predicted the number of children in state nurseries and primary schools would fall by 4.5% over the next four years, but it varies across England.",

      "The University of Sussex was fined \u00a3585,000 after the OfS said its equality policy - which included rules to \"positively represent trans people\" - could prevent staff and students voicing opposing views. Sussex was investigated after Prof Kathleen Stock left the university in 2021 accused of transphobia.",
      "Arif Ahmed, OfS director for freedom of speech, said the fine could have been as high as \u00a33.7m and there was \"potential for higher fines in the future\".",

      "The watchdog said the \"chilling effect\" this would have on anyone wanting to voice an opposing view meant the university failed in its duty to uphold freedom of speech on campus.",
      "Prof Kathleen Stock, who left the university in 2021 after being accused of transphobia for her views on sex and gender issues, has said other universities should pay attention to the record fine issued to Sussex.",
      "Writing for the website Unherd, she said she tried hard to \"raise the alarm\" about the impact of trans policies at universities on free speech, but added many were still in place, describing them as \"dim witted and claustrophobic\".",
      "The University of Sussex plans to legally challenge the OfS findings, vice-chancellor Prof Sasha Roseneil said.",
      "The OfS investigation into the University of Sussex started with the case of Prof Stock in 2021.",
      "The OfS report concluded that Prof Stock \"felt unable to teach certain topics\" and feared disciplinary action as a result of the university's policy.",
      "Describing the judgement as an \"unreasonably absolutist definition of free speech\", the university said the ruling would leave institutions \"powerless to prevent abusive, bullying and harassing speech\".",
      "The OfS, it added, had pursued a \"vindictive and unreasonable campaign\" against the university.",
      "It also said the OfS had failed to respond to the university's requests to engage with its staff in person, with Prof Roseneil describing the investigation as a \"trawl of documents\".",
      "But Dr Ahmed defended the investigation and its ruling on Wednesday, saying that \"we communicated with them and they communicated with us\".",
      "He added: \"I think universities should be looking at their policies and thinking carefully about what they need to do to comply with the law and to comply with regulatory requirements.\"",
      "The report said maximum penalties for universities would be capped at whichever is higher: 2% of a university's annual \"qualifying income\" - the amount they receive from tuition fees and OfS grants - or \u00a3500,000.",
      "Many universities post incomes in the hundreds of millions every year, meaning maximum fines could comfortably reach seven figures.",
      "The University of Sussex fine was capped at \u00a34.6m, the OfS said, adding that an \"appropriate deterrent\" against future breaches could be achieved with the lower fine.",
      "\"Clearly, future cases will not be the first case of their kind, so there will be a potential for higher fines in the future,\" Dr Ahmed said on Wednesday.",
      "The OfS was given the power to issue fines where freedom of speech was not upheld at a university in January.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson described free speech and academic freedom as \"non-negotiables\" in universities, adding that the OfS would get stronger powers to handle such cases so that students and academics are not \"muzzled\" by restraints on free speech.",

      "There is nothing much you can do if your council tax is increasing, or you are buying a house and facing a higher stamp duty bill.",

      "The seven bills going up in April",
      "The seven bills going up in April",
      "1. Shop around",
      "For some services you can often get a better deal simply by calling the company you are with and saying you are considering leaving.",
      "\"Shop around for better deals, and haggle with your existing provider,\" says Alice Haine, from professional services group Evelyn Partners.",
      "\"It's always worth haggling. Haggle for everything.\"",
      "That applies to a whole range of bills, including insurance, energy, and broadband.",
      "\"Our research shows that switching providers if you're out of contract can slash broadband, pay TV and mobile bills by up to \u00a3235,\" says Emily Seymour, from consumer group Which?",
      "Gas and electricity are often the biggest bills people face and the price cap set by the regulator is rising by 6%, so it is worth finding the best deal for you.",
      "That may include choosing a fixed rate deal, says Ms Seymour. If you charge an electric vehicle or use appliances overnight, look for a deal with a cheaper night tariff.",
      "\"We'd also recommend taking a meter reading as close to 31 March as possible to ensure you're billed the correct amount for your energy usage,\" she says.",
      "2. Cut back",
      "One surefire way to keep your bills down is to reduce what you use.",
      "Taking shorter showers and putting in a showerhead with a slower flow will save money on your water and energy bills.",
      "\"You have to treat water as an expensive resource,\" Ms Haine says.",
      "Getting a water meter fitted may save you money, she adds.",
      "Smart meters for electricity and gas can also help you keep tabs on what is pushing up your energy bills most, the Energy Saving Trust says.",
      "The trust advises draught-proofing your home, including round floorboards, pipework and old extractor fans, and setting the thermostat to the lowest comfortable temperature. For most people, it says, that is between 18\u00b0C and 21\u00b0C.",
      "MoneySavingExpert says you can save money by using the principle: \"heat the human, not the home\". Using hot water bottles and electric blankets should work out cheaper than turning up the radiators.",
      "You can also change the settings on combi or conventional boilers to save money, says Martin Lewis at MoneySavingExpert.",
      "When it comes to transport bills, you can't avoid the vehicle tax rise unless you ditch the car altogether.",
      "But if you are taking the train it is also worth checking whether a railcard will help, points out Ms Seymour.",
      "\"To cut costs on rail fares, we'd recommend booking tickets in advance and splitting fares where possible,\" she says.",
      "3. Get help",
      "If you are struggling to pay your household bills, don't panic, says Richard Lane, chief client officer at the StepChange Debt Charity. He suggests creating a detailed budget that captures all your income and expenditure.",
      "\"This will allow you to get a clear picture of your finances and see how much you have leftover to pay toward any debts or make savings,\" he says.",
      "Then check what support you are entitled to.",
      "Water companies offer lower \"social\" and hardship tariffs for people on very low incomes, so it is worth calling your provider. People claiming benefits can often also get lower tariffs for broadband.",
      "\"These organisations have a regulatory responsibility to treat customers fairly and will be able to offer you tailored support,\" Mr Lane added.",
      "There is the government's Warm Home Discount, for people with high energy costs on a very low income, including Pension Credit. And people on low incomes are also eligible for a reduction in council tax.",
      "Check if you qualify for a free TV licence. If you are over 75 and on Pension Credit or live with someone who is, then you will.",
      "You may also be able to boost your income. Check which benefits you are entitled to on the independent MoneyHelper website, backed by the government, or using benefits calculators run by Policy in Practice and charities Entitledto and Turn2us.",
      "If you are struggling with debt here are some other organisations that may be able to help."

Generative AI, for instance, allows computers to learn and solve problems in ways that can seem human \u2013 albeit much faster. And many worry about the technology replacing their jobs as AI is used to generate scripts, animation, locations, voices and human actors.",

    "summary": "The opening night of the star's tour mixes flashes of brilliance with moments that fail to connect.",
    "story": [
      "Usher has kicked off a 10-night residency at London's O2 Arena with a slick, two-hour show that was impressive and frustrating in equal measure.",
      "The US pop star played more than 40 songs, including hits like Yeah, Burn, U Remind Me and OMG, with multiple costume changes and buttery-smooth choreography.",
      "But the show, which comes to the UK after a 62-date run in the US, felt oddly rough around the edges - including a handful of on-stage stumbles and missed musical cues.",
      "The momentum was frequently torpedoed by waffly, overlong video interludes - but Usher's magnetic stage presence just about held the concert together.",
      "Titled \"Past, Present, Future\", the tour is billed as an \"intimate\" look at Usher Raymond IV's 30-year career, as well as \"a glimpse into the future\".",
      "It comes as the star, one of the best-selling artists of the 2000s, is enjoying a career rebirth - following an acclaimed Super Bowl half-time show, and the release of his ninth studio album, Coming Home.",
      "With 10 sold-out shows at the O2, he enters an elite group of artists who've played double-digit residencies at the venue, alongside Queen (10 shows in 2022), Bon Jovi (12 nights in 2010) and Prince (21 nights in 2007).",
      "At its core, Past, Present, Future illustrates the skill with which the 46-year-old has navigated the evolving trends of the music industry.",
      "We see a video clip of him, aged 14, dancing to his debut single, Call Me A Mack, then watch as he transforms into a teenage heartthrob, a confessional balladeer, an EDM party-starter, and an elder statesman of R&B.",
      "He arrives from under the stage in a fog of dry ice and a cone of laser beams, apparently controlling the lights with his bare hands, before dancing to the middle of the arena with the molten fluidity of his idol, Michael Jackson.",
      "Clad in a sparkly raincoat and wide-brimmed Pharrell hat, he races through hits like Coming Home, Hey Daddy and U Make Me Wanna, backed by a funky 10-piece band and a dance team that echoes his every move.",
      "The choreography is a constant highlight. Usher's moves are so effortless that they look unrehearsed, but such ease comes at a cost: Last year, he had to postpone the start of the tour after injuring his neck in practice.",
      "At the O2, that pain seemed a distant memory, as he careened around the U-shaped stage on roller skates, pulling off a flawless moonwalk, and even freeze-framing in a handstand.",
      "He might have fumbled a hat at one point, but it was one of his dancers who came closest to calamity - losing his balance during an elaborate chair routine, sending the chair spinning across the stage.",
      "The band also suffered a mishap, missing Usher's cue to extend the intro to Superstar, and coming in four bars early. Not disastrous, but still unusual for a show on this level.",
      "The hits were punctuated by numerous interludes, narrated by Celeste, a glitch-prone \"computer driven by AI technology to help Mr Raymond tell his story\",  from teen wannabe to global superstar, against a backdrop of infidelity, tabloid infamy, redemption and survival.",
      "The problem was his songs couldn't support the weight of that story. With a few exceptions, Usher mostly sings about lusting after women in the club, and carnal pleasures in the bedroom.",
      "The result was a weirdly disconnected show, where Usher followed a moving video about his absent father with a song about his ex, which he sung while straddling a motorbike.",
      "Priapism was a running theme. Women in the audience were fed with cocktail cherries (\"oh, it's your first time?\" Usher mugged into the camera)  and part of the stage was turned into a strip club, complete with pole dancers, during Bad Girl.",
      "That sort of tongue-in-cheek raunch has been a hallmark of Usher's career, but it felt dated and shallow in a concert that promised an intimate look into his personality.",
      "Perhaps he just wanted us to know that, deep down, he really, really likes sex.",
      "Luckily, the songs still hold up. A trio of quiet storm ballads - Climax, Burn and Confessions Part II - had couples serenading each other, while a trio of women near me took the opportunity to slow dance a security guard who was mopping the floor.",
      "To his credit, Usher sang everything live, with an airy falsetto that's undiminished after 30 years on tour. During U Got It Bad, he held one sustained note for over 10 seconds.",
      "At times, he struggled to hold the audience's attention during the slow jams. The UK has always preferred him in club mode - and it was his three biggest-sellers, Yeah, OMG and DJ Got Us Falling In Love that really set the O2 alight.",
      "Strangely it was one of those empty club anthems, I Am The Party, that ultimately carried the most meaning.",
      "\"Hopefully my [music] has been something to you,\" Usher said over the introduction.",
      "\"Maybe we fell in love together, maybe we had a good time together, but something brought you here. And I just want you to know, I appreciate the connection.\"",
      "\"If I didn't have you to cheer me on, I wouldn't continue to do this.\"",
      "Pop stars say this sort of thing all the time. But as he stood at the O2, drenched in sweat, remembering the father who abandoned him and soaking up the audience's affection, Usher didn't seem to be putting on an act.",
      "By the encore, he'd given up all pretence of being a high-rolling playboy.",
      "Instead, he bounded around the stage, giddily filming the audience on his phone, as they hollered out the chorus to Without You.",
      "If only that performer had shown up earlier."

      "Whether you like the new Snow White film or you hate it, it's hard to escape the debate around its lead actress, Rachel Zegler.",
      "The 23-year-old star has dominated conversation about the film, as people either blame her for its poor reviews or leap to her defence, saying she's being unfairly maligned.",
      "And this debate is not new for Zegler.",
      "Way before Snow White came out, she has been at the centre of the storm, with many criticising her take on the original film and her political views, including those on US President Donald Trump and his voters.",
      "Others defended her, and expressed discomfort at seeing such a young actress suffer a pile-on.",
      "Film critic Kelechi Ehenulo calls Zegler a victim of \"culture wars\", and warns actors from underrepresented backgrounds (Zegler is Latina) often find themselves becoming \"targets for backlash\".",
      "So how did we get to this point \u2013 and where does Zegler go from here?",
      "A blame game",
      "Let's start with the film itself.",
      "Disney's live-action version of the classic fairy tale Snow White was released earlier this month, and has faced a slew of underwhelming reviews (the Observer's Wendy Ide described it as \"toe-curlingly terrible\".) US reviewers have been somewhat more positive \u2013 but despite it topping the North America box office chart, it hasn't made as much money as expected.",
      "On social media, some people have been quick to point their finger at Zegler, arguing she hampered the release.",
      "They include Jonah Platt, the son of Snow White producer Marc Platt. Earlier this week, he took aim at Zegler in a fiery social media post. It has since been deleted, but was screenshotted by multiple outlets including the New York Post.",
      "He said Zegler had \"[dragged] her personal politics\" into the film's promotional campaign, adding: \"Her actions clearly hurt the film's box office.\"",
      "Platt didn't respond to a request for comment from BBC News.",
      "The controversies started much earlier.",
      "Before the film was released, Zegler faced abuse online by people who disagreed with her casting in the role of a character deemed to have skin \"as white as snow\".",
      "Zegler made headlines after her comments, in 2022, about the original film. \"There's a big focus [in the original] on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! So we didn't do that this time.\"",
      "Zegler also said the original film was \"extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power\", adding: \"People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is - because it needed that.\"",

      "Disney holds small-scale Snow White premiere amid controversy",
      "Many saw those words as a rebuke against Disney's tradition.",
      "The Daily Mail branded it a \"woke tirade\" and an article this week in Variety said she \"trashed the beloved original Snow White\".",
      "City AM's film editor Victoria Luxford says criticism of the original film \"was never going to work out well. These films are marketed on nostalgia, on making you feel like you did when you saw the original, so to speak of it negatively seemed puzzling\".",
      "Zegler declined to comment on this piece.",
      "But Anna Smith, film critic and host of the Girls On Film podcast, told BBC News that some of the headlines may have be misleading.",
      "\"Zegler pointed out that times and attitudes have changed, and that the new Snow White has been adapted for the current age. This is the case with many remakes and reboots, many of which do not make the headlines with comments about 'woke' culture.\"",
      "Zegler's political views have also sparked a backlash.",
      "Last summer, she thanked fans for their response to the film's trailer in a post on X, adding, \"and always remember, free Palestine\".",
      "According to the Variety article, Marc Platt - mentioned above - flew to New York to speak directly with Zegler after the post.",
      "Neither Zegler nor Platt have responded to a request for a comment on that.",
      "Zegler also stoked controversy with her views after the 2024 US presidential election. Writing on Instagram, she said she hoped \"Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace\".",
      "She later apologised for what she had said.",
      "Some commend her for speaking her mind. Ehenulo says that she is \"not the first and certainly not the last actor to be speaking about politics\".",
      "And Luxford told me she was \"hard-pressed\" to imagine the film's core audience, children under 10, being swayed by her politics.",
      "But film critic Conor Riley said that her comments about Trump didn't \"help the stability of the movie's release\".",
      "He notes that Gal Gadot, who plays Snow White's stepmother, the Evil Queen, has also faced a backlash from some people. Gadot, who is Israeli, has been vocal in her support of the country.",
      "The timing of the film also didn't help, he added.",
      "\"Ultimately, [Zegler] became a lightning rod for controversy, not just due to her own actions, but because Snow White landed at the intersection of Hollywood's creative stagnation, racial politics, international conflict, and America's deep ideological divide,\" he said.",
      "'Targets for backlash'",
      "Some, like Luxford, argue that some of the pile-on comes from \"a place of prejudice\".",
      "\"She's a young Latina woman with political opinions that don't align with certain groups, who are quick to voice their anger,\" she said.",
      "Zegler is far from the first young female actress to find herself facing a toxic backlash. Recently, Stranger Things actor Millie Bobby Brown criticised press articles about her appearance, saying \"this isn't journalism, this is bullying\".",
      "Smith notes that women in positions of prominence are more likely to be targeted in this way.",
      "\"When women in the public eye are criticised, there is often bias at work. Regardless of the topic, the way it's dealt with, talked about and reported will often differ compared to the way men are treated,\" she said.",
      "Ehenulo, for her part, calls on the industry to do more to protect their stars.",
      "\"What irks me is how easy [people of colour] actors become targets for backlash on social media and yet the culture of silence from studios, news outlets and social media platforms says it all,\" she said.",
      "\"That lack of public protection... means the toxicity continues to fester and rise. It's the Wild West out there and I can't see it getting better when this has been normalised to such an extent.\"",
      "We put those claims to Disney, but they declined to comment.",
      "The big roles keep coming for Zegler. She is now signed up to star in Evita in the West End this summer, and on Friday, she made a splash in a different way - reading a CBeebies Bedtime Story.",
      "At the end of the story, Zegler tells young viewers: \"To be a powerful princess you just need to be wonderful, brilliant you!\" For some, this is a message that encapsulates Zegler herself.",
      "\"I don't know if she's going to be doing another Disney film anytime soon,\" says Luxford, \"but she's 23, she's a Golden Globe winner, and she's a very talented actor.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 30 Mar 2025 00:25:44 GMT",
    "summary": "A 15-year-old teenager discusses Andrew Tate and girl-boy friendships with his parents after watching the Netflix drama.",
    "story": [
      "\"It's just weird to talk about your sexual feelings to your parents,\" says 15-year-old Ben*.",
      "His parents, Sophie and Martin, two professionals in their 40s, nod understandingly. They are discussing the kinds of \"big issues\" Ben's social media usage throws up, and for Ben their conversations about sex and pornography are \"the worst\".",
      "The family \u2013 minus Ben's little sister, who is too young to join the discussion \u2013 are gathered in their living room to dissect the smash-hit Netflix drama Adolescence, which they watched the previous evening.",
      "The series follows the story of 13-year-old protagonist Jamie, who is accused of murdering a female peer after being exposed to misogynistic online material and subjected to cyberbullying.",
      "Both of Ben's parents are concerned their own son's behaviour is being impacted by the material he is exposed to, and Ben, who is worried himself, is trying to set limits on his own phone use.",
      "Given their concerns, and how they overlap with the themes of Adolescence, the family agreed to watch the programme together and allowed BBC News to sit in on their discussion, which ranged from the relevance of Andrew Tate to whether boys and girls can be friends.",
      "'People just call each other virgins'",
      "Ben is sitting on the sofa in the living room scrolling on his phone before the conversation begins.",
      "The parents take their seats looking relaxed despite the difficult subjects they are about to discuss. Photos of loved ones line the bookshelves in the family's living room, and a piano stands against the wall.",
      "Sophie and Martin have worked hard to create a \"very open\" household, Sophie says, where \"all topics are on the table\". While watching the programme, Sophie made a list of things to talk about with Ben.",
      "A confident and outspoken teenage boy, Ben is well-liked by fellow pupils at his single-sex state secondary school. But the qualities that make him popular with his peers often land him in trouble with his teachers, who give him detentions or send him to isolation for making what his mother describes as \"inappropriate comments\".",
      "In the show, Jamie and his peers use language associated with the \"manosphere\" \u2013 websites and online forums promoting misogyny and opposition to feminism \u2013 and incel culture. Incels, short for involuntary celibate, are men who blame women because they are unable to find a sexual partner. It is an ideology that has been linked to terror attacks and killings in recent years.",
      "Perhaps surprisingly, \"incel\" wasn't a familiar term to Ben, and his dad Martin had to explain it as they watched the programme.",
      "\"People just call each other 'virgins'. I've not heard 'incel' before,\" Ben tells his parents. He suggests the term might have \"dropped off\" social media for young people in recent years, reflecting the pace at which the conversation moves online.",
      "Ben tells his parents there are elements of the show he recognises, including its depiction of the fights and cyberbullying at school. But he thinks it is only a \"rough picture\" of what it's like to be a teenager today, and that it was principally made for \"an adult who isn't online\".",
      "For example, it neglects to show the good side of social media alongside its dangers, he says, and some details \u2013 including the secret emoji codes one character claims children use \u2013 ring false.",
      "It is for this reason that Martin, who says he enjoyed the tense drama, also feels the show is playing on every parent's \"worst nightmare\" about their child's phone use, meaning it sometimes favours theatrics over realism in an attempt to \"shock\" adults into action.",
      "Andrew Tate, an influencer and central figure of the shadowy online world of the manosphere, is mentioned by name in the drama and has been the cause of much concern among parents and teachers. But Ben says that while Andrew Tate was \"popular\" at his school about two years ago, he is now \"old news\".",
      "Ben has noticed the way Tate combines health and wellbeing with politics. \"Some of his things, like 'exercise for an hour a day' \u2013 fair enough, that's correct. But then he combines it with far-right ideas, like 'the man should go out and work and the wife should stay at home',\" Ben says.",
      "Both parents agree that Tate is not to blame for misogyny. As far as they're concerned, he is symptomatic of \"a bigger social problem\".",
      "Can boys and girls be friends?",
      "This problem is represented starkly in the bleak picture Adolescence paints of male-female friendships in the social media age. Protagonist Jamie doesn't have any female friends, and appears to view relations with the opposite sex through a lens of dominance and manipulation.",
      "Sophie is concerned that interactions between boys and girls are distant and impersonal in Ben's peer group. She says Ben doesn't have many opportunities to mix with girls his age.",
      "And she worries her son is getting most of his information about how to interact with girls from social media. \"It's really twisted,\" she says. \"They don't know how to behave around each other.\"",
      "She asks her son a question: \"If you don't know how to talk to girls when you're feeling awkward, if you're like, 'Eurgh, I don't know how to dress', where do you go for help?\"",
      "\"Online,\" Ben says.",
      "\"So it goes full circle,\" says his mum. \"That's where they get information.\"",
      "Ben isn't embarrassed that he's \"used ChatGPT for like two years\" to get this sort of advice. \"Or TikTok,\" he adds.",
      "Drama shines light on 'growing problem' - PM",
      "Netflix drama Adolescence hailed as 'flawless' TV",
      "Netflix's Adolescence makes UK TV ratings history",
      "Sophie says Ben learned most about friendship with the opposite sex during a visit to a cousin's house, who attends a mixed school and has female friends.",
      "She recalls Ben's cousin reprimanding him after Ben asked whether the cousin was attracted to a female friend.",
      "\"I don't remember him getting annoyed with me like that, but okay,\" Ben says.",
      "They debate their varying recollections of events until they land on a version on which they can agree: \"His cousin was like, 'No, that's my friend. I don't think of them in that way,'\" Sophie says.",
      "\"That was really eye-opening for him,\" she says. Turning to Ben, she recalls: \"You came back from it, and you were like, 'It's much better [at my cousin's], girls and boys are friends.'\"",
      "Sharing intimate images",
      "In the Netflix drama, it is revealed that Jamie's victim Katie had been subjected to misogynistic bullying after a male classmate shared intimate images of her without her consent.",
      "Jamie's discussion of this incident with a child psychologist, played by Erin Doherty, is pivotal to the programme's acclaimed third episode.",
      "Ben has seen this kind of abuse of trust among his peers too. \"There's a guy near here, and [a picture of] his genitals got leaked on a massive group chat with loads of people,\" he says. \"That was a big thing on TikTok.\"",
      "The series kicks off with an episode in which police question Jamie about the sexualised images of adult women he has shared on his Instagram page, hinting at the ease with which young teenagers can access pornography.",
      "This feels familiar to Ben, who thinks porn is the \"biggest issue\" among his peer group. He knows boys who are \"addicted\" to it: \"They rely on it. There are people in my year who'll have such a bad day unless they watch it.\"",
      "Ben squirms a little while talking about pornography, staring at the wall or fiddling with his phone.",
      "He seems more comfortable talking about the other forms of concerning content young people come across online.",
      "He estimates that \"one in 10\" videos he watches on his phone contain distressing material, including scenes of extreme violence. And Ben's parents are under no illusions that their son is \"safe\" just because he is upstairs on his computer - unlike Jamie's parents in the show.",
      "What can be done?",
      "For Martin and Sophie, the solution lies in giving children better opportunities to \"participate\" in society and build their self-esteem.",
      "They say they are also keen for their son to have \"wide range\" of male role models to learn from. Ben, who has paused to check his phone several times in the course of their discussion, re-engages with the conversation.",
      "He is animated in his praise for his sports coaches, whose \"really strong morals\" he admires.",
      "The parents nod, evidently pleased by his enthusiasm. They say they pack their son's life with activities in an attempt to get him off his phone. But this is expensive, they say, and puts poorer students at a disadvantage.",
      "Sophie says of the show's main character, Jamie: \"He doesn't have sport. He doesn't feel good about himself. His dad looks away when he fails.\"",
      "Adolescence shows that children with limited opportunities to build their self-esteem are more \"vulnerable\" to the predatory messages of misogynistic influencers, Sophie says.",
      "Both parents agree tech companies, the government, schools and families all have a responsibility to offer young people a convincing alternative to the siren call of the manosphere.",
      "They insist parents can't do it alone. As Sophie says: \"It's a tsunami and someone's given me an umbrella.\"",
      "Ben thinks what happens online is too often dismissed by adults as being irrelevant to the real world. He thinks this is a mistake; social media should be treated \"like real life \u2013 because it is real life\", he says.",

    "story": [
      "A forgotten oil-on-canvas masterpiece by Indian painter MF Husain, rediscovered decades later, has rewritten the record books for Indian art.",
      "Husain's Untitled (Gram Yatra), a sprawling 14-foot-wide mural, sold for an unprecedented $13.8m (\u00a310.6m) at a Christie's auction in New York last week. It shattered the previous high for Indian art of $7.4m (\u00a35.7m), fetched by Amrita Sher-Gil's The Story Teller in 2023.",
      "Husain, who died in 2011, aged 95, was a pioneer of Indian modernism and remains a lasting inspiration for Indian artists. In 2006, he left India after death threats from Hindu hardline groups over his depictions of deities.",
      "For nearly five decades, the record-breaking painting unassumingly adorned the walls of a Norwegian hospital, overlooked and undervalued. Now, it stands as a defining work of modern South Asian art.",
      "Husain painted Gram Yatra - meaning \"village journey\", a name it was given later on - in 1954, long before he became an icon.",
      "Its 13 vignettes - vivid snapshots of Indian village life - reflect his distinctive blend of Indian folk traditions and modernist influences. They are reminiscent of narrative paintings in India's miniature tradition, in which small pictures weave a story.",
      "In Gram Yatra, Husain used vibrant, earthy tones to bring the frames to life, depicting women in everyday scenes, such as cooking, caring for children and riding a cart.",
      "In one of the frames, a farmer extends his arm, as if holding the land in the adjoining frame - a nod to the farming roots of Indian society.",
      "\"If you're looking for a single artwork that defines modern South Asian art, this is it,\" said Nishad Avari, head of South Asian Modern and Contemporary Art at Christie's.",
      "The painting, he added, also showed how Husain was influenced by his foreign travels, notably his 1952 trip to China, which introduced him to the calligraphic brushwork of artists like Xu Beihong - traces of which can be seen in the painting's expressive strokes.",
      "In the years following India's independence, he sought inspiration not in Paris or New York, but in India's villages, mirroring Mahatma Gandhi's belief that the heart of the nation lay in its rural roots.",
      "According to Husain's biographer Akhilesh (who uses only one name), the painter's deep engagement with India's cultural fabric helped shape how the country saw itself - \"how people live, what they like and what they think\".",
      "The painting also shows the early signs of Husain's modified cubist style - where geometric shapes and bold lines stood out in his works.",
      "The painting's journey from Delhi to Oslo adds to its mystique.",
      "It was purchased in 1954 for just $295 by Ukrainian doctor Leon Elias Volodarsky, who was in India on a World Health Organization (WHO) mission.",
      "After he took it to Norway, the piece adorned the walls of Oslo University Hospital for nearly half a century, largely unnoticed by the art world.",
      "It stayed that way for several decades until auction house Christie's was alerted to it in 2013 - two years after Husain's death - leading to its global exhibitions before this record-smashing sale.",
      "Ashish Anand, CEO of DAG (formerly the Delhi Art Gallery), believes this will elevate the value of Husain's entire body of work and \"lead to Indian art being viewed beyond just its aesthetic value to a tangible and serious financial asset\".",

      "His dashing good looks won him legions of female fans, and guaranteed him work in a plethora of rather forgettable television movies.",

      "In interviews promoting his 2003 memoir, he advised other handsome leading actors to keep their sexuality to themselves.",

      "George Richard Chamberlain was born on 31 March 1934, in Beverly Hills, California. He died one day before his 91st birthday.",
      "His salesman father had a problem with drink, which affected young Richard's childhood. He described himself as a \"shy, serious, lugubrious kid, painfully thin, with a long, sad face\".",
      "He admitted to being the most \"uncooperative kid in school\" but discovered a taste and a talent for athletics.",
      "At Pomona College, he was bitten by the acting bug - and a role in Bernard Shaw's Arms and the Man convinced him he had found his calling.",
      "Paramount Studios was interested in him, but thoughts of an acting career were put on hold after he was called up, serving 16 months with the US Army, rising to the rank of sergeant while stationed in Korea.",
      "On his discharge, he made a number of cameos in TV shows, including an episode of the popular Western, Gunsmoke.",
      "Not everyone had Chamberlain picked as a future star.",
      "He was handsome enough: with profiles at the time gushing over his \"fine-lined aristocratic face, suggesting a young Florentine noble - straight out of the Renaissance\".",
      "But, he was naturally diffident - which worked in his favour when he auditioned to play Dr James Kildare, a medical intern struggling to learn his profession, in NBC's new primetime medical drama.",
      "\"Perhaps it was inevitable,\" said one friend-and-rival. \"Who else could look so anti-sceptic as Dick?\"",
      "The series ran for nearly 200 programmes across five seasons.",
      "It broke new ground, by raising matters such as drug addiction - which had not previously been shown on US TV.",
      "There was a huge reaction from female fans.",
      "Chamberlain got 12,000 letters a week. In Pittsburgh, 450,000 people turned out to see him at a parade, and in New York, he nearly caused a riot when a child spotted him and called his name.",
      "The studio made the most of this attention, releasing novels, comics and games featuring Chamberlain's image.",
      "Fans would even write in asking \"Dr Kildare\" to solve their various medical problems.",
      "And Chamberlain had an unlikely hit single: Three Stars Will Shine Tonight, where romantic words were added to the show's distinctive opening theme tune.",
      "He won a Golden Globe Award for best TV actor in 1963. But, three years later audiences began to wane, and NBC pulled the plug.",
      "Now an international star, Chamberlain struggled to leave Kildare behind.",
      "In 1966, he hoped to break into films, but reviews slated his performance in the light romantic comedy, Joy in the Morning.",
      "Audiences, they said, laughed in \"all the wrong places\". So, he resolved to ignore Hollywood and make a living on the stage.",
      "He got off to a rocky start when a musical version of Breakfast at Tiffany's - in which he starred opposite Mary Tyler Moore - closed after just four shows.",
      "The production is still seen as one of Broadway's biggest ever turkeys. But a move to England gave him a chance of reinventing himself as a 'serious actor.'",
      "In 1967, there were starring roles in Henry James' Portrait of a Lady and opposite Katherine Hepburn in a satirical comedy called The Madwoman of Chaillot.",
      "And, two years later, he became the first American to play Hamlet at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre since the great John Barrymore in 1925.",
      "This time, the reviews were excellent and he revisited the role of Denmark's most tortured prince for a television version for Hallmark.",
      "But Chamberlain was cast as Tchaikovsky in Ken Russell's overblown biopic, The Music Lovers, in which he starred opposite Glenda Jackson.",
      "The critics rubbished the film, in which great play was made of the relationship between a composer with repressed homosexual tendencies and his nymphomaniac wife, although it later became something of a cult success.",
      "Chamberlain went on to play Lord Byron opposite Sarah Miles in Lady Caroline Lamb and the swashbuckling French swordsman Aramis in Richard Lester's The Three Musketeers.",
      "He also appeared - along with half of Hollywood - in the Towering Inferno, as a crooked electrical engineer whose corner-cutting leads to the spectacular destruction of a 138 floor building.",

      "He beat Roger Moore and Albert Finney to be cast as John Blackthorn - a captive English navigator in 17th Century Japan - in Shogun.",
      "The series was shown on NBC over five nights in 1980, with audiences reaching nearly 30 million.",
      "Having won a Golden Globe, Chamberlain then picked up another as Father Ralph de Bricassart in The Thorn Birds, a priest torn between God and his sexual longing for the actress, Rachel Ward.",
      "It was even more successful than Shogun, winning an audience of 60% of television viewers and 16 Emmy nominations.",
      "In the 1990s, Chamberlain's career began to wane.",
      "There were a succession of solid, rather than outstanding, performances in made-for-TV films and endless guest appearances in other people's shows.",
      "These included a sequel to The Thorn Birds called The Missing Years, with Amanda Donohoe replacing Rachel Ward.",
      "In 2003, long after he had stopped playing romantic leading men, Chamberlain published his biography Shattered Love, in which, for the first time, he confirmed he was gay.",
      "Despite a relationship of more than 30 years with the actor and director Martin Rabbett, with whom he'd once starred in the film Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold, they had kept their private life private.",
      "\"I thought there was something very, very deeply wrong with me,\" he said, \"and I wanted to cover it up. I remember making a pact with myself that I would never, ever reveal this secret, ever.\"",
      "Chamberlain and Rabbett went their separate ways in 2010.",
      "In later years, Chamberlain was happy to play a gay man, notably in Desperate Housewives and Will & Grace.",
      "He continued to perform in musical theatre, including touring productions of Spamalot, My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music.",
      "But he never regretted hiding his sexuality to protect his career.",
      "\"I would have been a happier person being out of the closet and being free,\" he told El Pais in 2024. \"But I had other motives that made me happy. I was a working actor and for me, that was most important.\"",
      "He will be remembered as the king of the TV mini-series: the dashing leading man in everything from Dr Kildare to The Thorn Birds.",
      "Despite attempts to reinvent himself as a serious stage actor, he was at his best on the small screen, entertaining millions watching at home on the sofa.",
      "For, although there were always better actors than Richard Chamberlain, few rivalled his ability to hold a television audience."

      "\"I watched a lot of people, a lot of TikTokkers, make music and there was no meaning behind it. It was just something they decided to do,\" he says.",

      "Even a passing glance at his discography proves him right.",
      "Warren's arena pop anthems are searingly honest, almost to a fault, drawing on his challenging childhood, and fairytale romance with Kouvr.",
      "His father died when he was nine years old, after a long struggle with kidney cancer. The loss sent his mother spiralling into alcoholism, something Warren only realised when he tried to clear up one of her coffee mugs.",
      "\"It turned out to be alcohol,\" he says. \"And the next day it was alcohol, and the next day it was alcohol, and at 4am it was alcohol, and when we were driving, it was alcohol.\"",
      "When he called her out on it, the addiction turned to abuse.",
      "\"Every person struggling with addiction needs someone to blame it on, besides themselves, and I became that person,\" he says.",
      "When he was 18, she kicked him out. He was broke and homeless. Friends let him sleep in their cars \u2013 never their houses, because his mum had convinced their parents he was a trouble-maker.",
      "Around the same time, he was introduced to Instagram model Kouvr Annon by a friend on Snapchat.",
      "\"We just clicked right away,\" he says. \"I felt I could tell her everything, just after our first conversation.\"",
      "Within four months, Kouvr left her family in Hawaii, flew out to California and started living with Warren in a car.",
      "Then, as now, they're an exceptionally cute couple \u2013 tender and funny and clearly besotted with one another. When they started posting videos of their romance online, people wanted to see more. In a span of six months, Warren gained more than a million followers on YouTube.",
      "Combined with the prank videos he'd filmed with his friends, he built a big enough audience to start earning money.",
      "\"When I got my first cheque for $2,000 in a month, I was like, 'Holy cow, this is gonna change my life',\" he recalls.",
      "Some of that money went into the creation of the Hype House in 2019. Warren came up with the name, and moved into the property with Annon and a bunch of young internet stars like Addison Rae, Charlie D'Amelio, Chase Hudson and Thomas Petrou.",
      "The collective introduced themselves in December 2019 with a photoshoot that mimicked Backstreet Boys video for I Want It That Way.",
      "By the end of the day, the hashtag #hypehouse was trending, and the mansion quickly became an incubator for viral videos.",
      "The enterprise thrived during lockdown but, as individual members signed TV deals, or grew tired of the escalating demands for content, it started to fall apart. Warren and Annon left in 2022, citing a desire to \"move on to the next chapter in their lives\".",
      "Since then, rumours have swirled about behind-the-scenes drama at the house, with some members hinting at exploitation and mistreatment.",
      "\"There was falling out,\" Warren told the Zach Sang show in 2023. \"But a lot of us signed NDAs, so no-one's going to talk about it.\"",
      "He did, however, pour his frustrations into music.",
      "\"How do you sleep at night?\" he sings on the angst-ridden Burning Down, a song allegedly targeted at one of the Hype House's co-founders.",
      "\"It scars forever when someone you called your friend / Shows you the truth can be so cold.\"",
      "Warren says he never made money from the Hype House. What it did give him, however, was a built-in audience for his music.",
      "\"I think that's really rare,\" he says. \"Usually, when someone goes from social media to music, they lose that fan base.",
      "\"But I think a lot of people watched my YouTube videos because they were having a rough life and needed an escape. So when I started making music about my rough life, I think they identified with it even more.\"",

      "\"And the next day, I woke up and had 10 million views.\"",
      "His first release was 2021's One More I Love You, a song he started when he was 13 years old and coming to terms with his father's death.",
      "\"I watched my sister go to a daddy-daughter dance without her dad, and that's when I realised, 'Oh, wait, my life is different',\" he recalls.",
      "\"I started mourning for the first time, and I didn't know how to process it, so I just went to the piano and played some chords. And that's kind of where I started learning how to write.\"",
      "Warren's outpouring of grief is powerful in its simplicity, but it has touched people in ways he couldn't have anticipated.",
      "\"The other day, a woman wanted me to sign a Heinz Beans t-shirt,\" he says. \"I giggled because I thought that was funny, then she turned it over, and it was the same t-shirt her son wore right before he died from cancer.",
      "\"One More I Love You was the song that she played at that funeral and the song she listened to help her get over it.\"",

      "Known for her drag aesthetic, extravagant costumes and punchy lyrics, Chappell's also shown she's fearless outside of her music, more than once coming under fire for speaking out on issues close to her heart.",
      "\"I think that's so needed,\" she says. \"To be able to break the rules.\"",
      "And she doesn't think she's alone in pushing the boundaries, saying she admires the likes of Sabrina Carpenter and Charli XCX, who she'll be headlining Primavera festival with this summer.",
      "She describes the three of them as the \"Powerpuff Girls\" of pop.",
      "\"I don't think that any of us were thinking of: 'What's going to change music? What's going to really blow peoples' minds?',\" Chappell, 27, says, about releasing music last year.",
      "\"I think all of us made our albums based on what blows our own minds.",
      "\"That's why I think it works so well for all of us because we're doing our own thing.",
      "\"Let there be a new path for girls who want to break the rules.\"",
      "The US singer's spoken before about being comfortable pushing boundaries, telling the BBC \"I'd be more successful if I wore a muzzle\" after making headlines last year.",
      "She's also sworn at paparazzi on the red carpet, criticised fans' \"creepy\" behaviour, cancelled shows last minute and was branded \"disingenuous\" by a music executive after calling for musicians to get more support from their labels.",
      "But after success over the past year, she feels together with Charli and Sabrina, they can shape the future.",
      "Chappell's debut, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, saw her named best new artist at the Grammy's as well as Radio 1's Sound of 2025.",
      "Charli XCX's summer-defining Brat won best album at the Brits, was recognised at the Grammy's and also earned a Mercury Prize nomination.",
      "Meanwhile singles Espresso and Please Please Please from Sabrina's Short 'n' Sweet album broke records, dominated the charts and won a grammy for best pop vocal album.",
      "Performing alongside them at Primavera Sound in Barcelona was an unmissable opportunity, Chappell says.",
      "\"I came out of retirement to play that show,\" she says.",
      "\"I was like, I'm retiring for half of the year and I decided to come out.",
      "\"It's so cool, it's like a pop girly festival.\"",
      "Comparisons have often been drawn between Chappell Roan and Lady Gaga.",
      "And she says the Abracadabra singer has been a huge inspiration.",
      "\"One of the first songs I downloaded on my iPod was Bad Romance.",
      "\"Talk about fearless.\"",
      "But it was Gaga's 2009 track Alejandro, and accompanying music video full of religious imagery, that Chappell says started her on the route to becoming the artist she is now.",
      "\"I could not believe her,\" she says.",
      "\"Whenever I watched Alejandro, I thought I was doing something bad as a Christian. I was like, 'oh my God, this is a sin'.",
      "\"And then a fire lit in me and I was like, no, this is actually heaven, this is actually where I'm meant to be.\"",
      "Lady Gaga's just announced a tour in the wake of her new album Mayhem, which will mark her first North American and European run since 2022.",
      "\"It was Gaga, and witnessing her at the age that I was, that was a domino effect to where I am now,\" Chappell says.",
      "\"Talk about turning new territory. It's so inspirational.\"",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jgj47zx53o",
    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 17:04:53 GMT",
    "summary": "The BBC correspondent was deported from Turkey this week after covering ongoing mass protests in the country.",
    "story": [
      "I had just sent my family a message saying how happy I was to be back in Turkey, where I used to live, and how it felt like coming home. Then, the phone in my hotel room rang.",
      "\"We have an urgent matter to discuss in person,\" the receptionist said. \"Could you come down?\"",
      "I arrived to find three plain-clothes policemen waiting for me. They asked me for my passport and led me away, trying to prevent my colleagues from filming.",
      "I had been in Istanbul for three days by then, covering the anti-government protests sparked by the arrest of the city's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu.",
      "I was taken first to the police headquarters and held for seven hours. Two colleagues were allowed to be present and lawyers could come in to talk. The atmosphere was generally cordial. Some of the police officers told me they didn't agree with what they said was a state decision. One hugged me and said he hoped for my freedom.",
      "At 9.30pm, I was moved to the foreigners' custody unit of the Istanbul police. There, the atmosphere hardened from a succession of chain-smoking officers, with whom I had to negotiate in my broken Turkish. I was fingerprinted and denied access to lawyers or any contact with the outside world.",
      "In the early hours of Thursday, I was presented with papers to say I was being deported for being \"a threat to public order\". When I asked for an explanation, they said it was a government decision.",
      "One police officer suggested he film me saying that I was leaving Turkey of my own accord, which could help me to return in the future and which he could show his bosses. I politely refused, suspecting it would be given to the government-controlled media to push their version of events.",
      "By 2.30am, I was being moved to a final location \u2013 the foreigners' custody department at the airport. I was put in a room with a few rows of hard chairs and told I could sleep there. Between police officers entering to brush their teeth, planes taking off and the morning call to prayer, no sleep came.",
      "Seventeen hours after my initial detention, I was driven to a waiting plane to board a one-way flight to London. That night, after the case was made public, sparking significant media coverage around the world, the Turkish government press office released a statement saying I had lacked the correct accreditation. At no point had they mentioned this during my detention and it seemed clear that it was an afterthought on their part to attempt to justify my case.",
      "I was never mistreated at any point during the ordeal. And I knew throughout that BBC management and the British Consulate in Istanbul were working hard to secure my release.",
      "So many others who have fallen foul of the Turkish authorities do not have such a safety net. When I lived there as the BBC Istanbul correspondent between 2014 and 2019, Turkey was the world's biggest jailer of journalists. The watchdog Reporters Without Borders ranks Turkey 158th of 180 countries in the Press Freedom Index. Since these latest protests began, eleven journalists are among the two thousand or so people who have been detained.",
      "The latest unrest was sparked by the arrest of Ekrem Imamoglu, Recep Tayyip Erdogan's main political rival, whom opinion polls suggest could unseat the President in an election.",
      "But they have grown into something much wider: a clamour for democracy in a country sliding further into authoritarianism. The clampdown on the media is central to that trajectory, as the government has progressively crushed criticism or debate. I caught a glimpse of that first hand. It ended for me with sadness and sleeplessness. For others, it's been so much worse.",
      "Meanwhile, President Erdogan is digging in, dismissing the protests as \"street terrorism\". He's emboldened by the current international climate of having an ally in the White House and of Turkey's importance to everything from Ukraine to Syria.",
      "The question now is whether the country's biggest demonstrations in over a decade can sustain momentum or whether Turkey's long-time leader can simply brush this off. Those out on the street may be chanting \"enough\" \u2013 but they also know never to write off Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",

    "summary": "The TV couple are opening up their home and their lives in a new reality series for BBC One.",
    "story": [
      "We might feel like we know Stacey Solomon and Joe Swash already. We have seen them live off rice and beans in the Australian rainforest in I'm a Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out of Here! We have watched Joe learn to ice skate in Dancing on Ice and Stacey declutter homes in Sort Your Life Out.",
      "But now the couple are going one step further and allowing viewers inside Pickle Cottage, their family home in Essex, in a new reality series for BBC One.",
      "It is a fly-on-the-wall series - and Stacey says she only realised in the thick of the filming that viewers can see everything, \"and then you panic a bit\", she tells the BBC.",
      "But ultimately, they are just a normal family \"doing our best in every aspect of our lives\", she says.",
      "\"So in the end, you sort of relax with that, and you think, 'Oh well, so they saw us get the hump with each other, or they saw us do something wrong'.",
      "\"That is probably the best thing we could show the world, because everything isn't perfect.\"",
      "There was no point in doing a reality show, says Joe, if they were not going to be honest.",
      "\"We don't want to glamourise anything,\" says Joe. \"Our biggest discussions at the beginning of this were, 'how much are people going to want to watch us take the kids to school and change nappies?' Our lives are not that exciting.\"",
      "Joe, 43, a former EastEnders actor, and Stacey, 35, a former X Factor contestant, met on the set of I'm a Celebrity in 2010 and have been in a relationship since 2016.",
      "They married in 2022 and are raising five children - Zach, Leighton, Rex, Rose and Belle - aged between 17 and two, alongside two dogs and four ducks.",
      "\"When I met Joe, my older children [Zach and Leighton] were four and seven,\" says Stacey, \"so they were little.\"",
      "When people say it is nice to see a blended family, she says she forgets that is what they are. \"To be honest, we're just a family.\"",
      "Joe says he struggles sometimes with the words - blended family, stepdad and stepsons.",
      "\"I love [Zach and Leighton] as much as I love all my other kids,\" he says. \"There's no distinction.\"",
      "When it comes to childcare, the couple do not have a nanny or au pair, but they do have a very supportive family.",
      "\"We've got Dave - my dad - and my sister,\" says Stacey. \"And I always say this, we live like a Kibbutz. We basically all chip in with each other.\"",
      "As well as juggling family and work, viewers will get to see all aspects of Stacey and Joe's lives, which, like any relationship, can include the odd disagreement.",
      "\"We want to show that we love each other, but sometimes we kill each other,\" says Joe. \"It's all part of it, and other couples do the same, so they'll relate to that.\"",
      "Stacey says she found being able to watch back and reflect on a situation quite helpful as she could see it from an outsider's point of view, which she believes is healthy for a relationship.",
      "Viewers will also get to see the love and support Stacey and Joe give each other. Joe describes Stacey as extremely loyal, like a \"mother lion\".",
      "\"Don't go near her cubs, she'll have you,\" he says.",
      "\"She's just the most wonderful person,\" he says. \"She's kind, she's loving. I mean there's nothing about Stacey I would change. People love her in the streets and, imagine me, I'm so lucky, I get to spend the rest of my life with her.\"",
      "Joe has the ability to give everyone a bit of himself, says Stacey, which is \"so magic\" and he has the most incredible amount of empathy, she says.",
      "Their parenting styles, on the other hand, are \"polar opposite\" she says.",
      "\"I'm aware that Stacey takes a lot of the brunt because I let [the children] do something and she's the one that has to say, 'No, you can't do that',\" says Joe. \"So she has to play bad cop quite a lot of the time, which I am aware of, but I just don't know any other way.\"",
      "Stacey believes this stems from the fact that Joe lost his father when he was very young.",
      "\"I think that when that happens to you in your life, obviously you just want to be\u2026 fun, happy. You don't want to create any negative memories,\" she says.",
      "For their family, having young children and teenagers growing up together has created something really magical.",
      "Stacey says the teenage boys can revert to being younger again which is important because they grow up so quickly in the modern world. They have the chance to still play, with the excuse being \"oh, I'm only doing it because it's with my little brother or little sister\", she says.",
      "It also gives the older boys a massive sense of responsibility, she adds.",
      "Raising five children requires military-style organisation, says Stacey, something she learnt after having her first son at the age of 17.",
      "\"I, quite frankly, was probably the most scatty teenager you've ever known,\" says Stacey. \"When I had Zachary, I had this one whole life that I was responsible for, and so many things that I had to do that I'd never had to consider.\"",
      "She says she would get a giro - a welfare cheque - to cash in at a certain time on a Thursday at the Post Office, and she realised she could not be late as she needed the money for groceries.",
      "Stacey relied on Zach and \"asked a lot of him\", she says, needing him to help her.",
      "\"I haven't done that with the younger ones, because I've had Joe,\" she says, \"and that's just the reality of my situation. It's been different through the years.\"",
      "But Zach, now 17 himself, is \"probably one of the most empathetic, caring, emotionally intelligent young teenagers that I know,\" says Stacey.",
      "\"I feel like that has a lot to do with how we grew up together, and how life was for us in the beginning.\"",
      "Having more children is not currently on Stacey's radar, she says, as her body is still recovering from having three children in five years.",
      "\"My pelvic floor is dying,\" she laughs. Although Joe would love to have more.",
      "Stacey still has plans to increase their brood - but this time it is their animals.",
      "\"I literally walked into a conversation the other day and I heard 'cow',\" says Joe, \"and I was like, 'No way, we can't have a cow'.\"",
      "\"We were just throwing a few ideas around,\" says Stacey. \"I would love to have animals and make our own milk and collect our own eggs and grow our own vegetables.",
      "\"That's a dream of mine - but in the future. At the moment, we're still rearing children.\"",
      "Stacey & Joe starts on Tuesday 1 April at 20:00 BST on BBC One and BBC iPlayer."

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxq309kexeo",
    "published": "Wed, 26 Mar 2025 12:33:21 GMT",
    "summary": "NewJeans talk to the BBC in their first interview since a court blocked their attempt to leave their record label.",
    "story": [
      "\"It took a huge amount of courage to speak out,\" NewJeans have told the BBC in their first interview since a court blocked their attempt to leave their record label, in a case that has rocked the K-pop industry.",
      "\"This fight is necessary. Although it will be extremely difficult and arduous, we will keep doing what we have done so far and speak up,\" said Haerin, one of the members of the five-piece.",
      "\"We thought it was important to tell the world about what we've been through. All the choices we've made so far have been the best choices we could have made.\"",
      "NewJeans looked invincible in the charts when they launched what was an unusual rebellion in the high-pressure, tightly-controlled world of K-pop. Hanni, Hyein, Haerin, Danielle and Minji stunned South Korea and fans everywhere with their decision in November to split from Ador, the label that launched them.",
      "They alleged mistreatment, workplace harassment and an attempt to \"undermine their careers\", which Ador denies. It sued to enforce their seven-year contract, which is set to expire in 2029, and sought an injunction against any commercial activities by the group.",
      "On Friday, a South Korean court granted it, ordering NewJeans to stop all \"independent\" activities, including song releases and advertising deals, while the case was still under way. NewJeans has since challenged the injunction in court.",
      "Friday's ruling was a \"shock\", the group told the BBC.",
      "\"Some people think that we're famous enough to do whatever we want and say whatever we please. But the truth is, it's not like that at all,\" Hyein said. \"We held it in for a long time, and only now have we finally spoken up about what we think, what we feel and the unfairness we've experienced.\"",
      "The K-pop industry has repeatedly come under fire for the pressure it puts on its stars not only to perform and succeed, but to appear perfect. But rarely do conflicts spill into the public, exposing stars' grievances and rifts with their labels.",
      "NewJeans' dramatic announcement last year followed a long and public spat with Ador and its parent company, Hybe - South Korea's biggest music label, whose client list includes K-pop royalty such as BTS and Seventeen.",
      "Ador told the BBC in a statement that the contract with NewJeans still stands, adding that \"most of their claims have risen from misunderstandings\". The court said that NewJeans did not \"sufficiently prove\" that Ador had violated the contract, adding that the label had upheld \"most of its duties, including payment\".",
      "The girls were rehearsing for a performance in Hong Kong, when news of the ruling dropped. They found out when Minji got a worried message from her mother: \"She asked me, 'are you okay?' And I was like 'what happened?'\"",
      "\"I was stunned,\" Minji says. So were the others when she told them. \"At first I thought I didn't hear her properly,\" Danielle says. \"We were all kind of in shock.\"",
      "This was their second of two interviews with the BBC in as many weeks. In the first interview, which happened before the ruling, the group had been excited to release their new single, Pit Stop - their first since they announced their break from Ador and renamed themselves NJZ.",
      "They spoke about how they coped with a difficult period, including finding comfort in cooking. \"I'm not really good at it but it's kind of healing,\" Minji had said, before promising to cook an \"amazing dinner\" for the group.",
      "In the second interview, which was 24 hours after the ruling, they seemed disheartened and unsettled, less sure of what was to come. \"If we knew we were gonna go through this, maybe we would have chosen\u2026\" Hanni trailed off as she teared up.",
      "Seconds later, she continued: \"Even if we do everything we can and it doesn't work out the way we hope it does, then we'll just have to leave it to time. I'm sure time would figure it out for us.\"",
      "The following night, they took to the stage in Hong Kong and, despite the court order, performed Pit Stop under their new name. But the evening, which they had pitched to fans as a fresh start, ended in tears as they told the crowd they were going on a hiatus.",
      "\"It wasn't any easy decision to make,\" Hyein said on stage, as each of them took turns to address their fans. \"But at the moment for us, it's about protecting ourselves, so that we can come back stronger.\"",
      "Just three years into their debut, the future of the young stars - they are aged between 16 and 20 - is now in question.",
      "But they tell the BBC that this is not the end of the road for them as they \"find more ways\" forward. With the legal battle expected to last for months, if not years, Minji says that gives them time to plan what they want to do next.",
      "Ever since they debuted in July 2022, NewJeans have delivered remarkable success with each new release - OMG, Ditto, Super Shy, Attention. A year on, they were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world.",
      "Critics called them a \"game-changer\" as their uniquely playful blend of 1990s R&B and sugar-coated pop melodies broke through a K-pop market dominated by electronic beats. And their breezy dance moves stood out among super-synchronised videos.",
      "They were still on the rise when Min Hee-jin - Ador's former boss and their long-time mentor, who launched them - began trading accusations publicly with Hybe. The music label had created Ador, granting Min a minority shareholding and further stock options, before she was removed from her role last August.",
      "Hybe was now accusing her of plotting Ador's takeover and Min, in an emotional press conference, accused them of undermining NewJeans by launching another girl group with a similar style. The fight got uglier and Min left the company, alleging she was forced out.",
      "That's when NewJeans broke their silence - they demanded Min's return in two weeks in a livestream.",
      "They were not able to contact her for a while, Danielle told the BBC in the first interview: \"We didn't know what was happening and we didn't have a way to support her. That itself was a hard thing because she was always there for us and\u2026 in a way a person to look up to.\"",
      "Ador had said Min could not return as CEO, but could continue as an internal director and NewJeans' producer. When Min didn't return, NewJeans announced that they were leaving Ador and accused the label of not meeting other demands: an apology for alleged bullying and actions against what they claimed were controversial internal reports.",
      "Ador, which denies all these allegations, appears to blame Min for their dispute with NewJeans. \"The core of this issue lies in the label's ex-management providing distorted explanations to their artists, leading to misunderstandings. They can be fully addressed and resolved upon the members' return to the label,\" Ador told the BBC in a statement.",
      "In the months since, Hanni, a Vietnamese-Australian, testified in tears to South Korean lawmakers in an inquiry into workplace harassment. \"I came to the realisation that this wasn't just a feeling. I was honestly convinced that the company hated us,\" she told them, after describing several incidents where she said the group felt undermined and bullied.",
      "NewJeans' case was dismissed because the labour ministry said K-pop stars did not qualify as workers and were not entitled to the same rights.",
      "Then in December, NewJeans took another rare step by supporting fans who were calling for the impeachment of South Korea's disgraced president, Yoon Suk Yeol who had briefly imposed martial law - the group provided free food and drinks to fans who showed up at the huge protest rallies.",
      "With each round of publicity, there was also criticism, much of it involving their age. Some said they had \"crossed the line\", while others called them \"stupid and reckless,\" and even \"ungrateful\" for picking a fight with Ador. Others questioned if they were making their own decisions.",
      "Being young doesn't mean they should be taken less seriously, the group says. \"That's an easy way to devalue the fact that we are actually trying to do something,\" Hanni says. \"The decisions we've made in the past year have been decided through a very, very large amount of discussion between us.\"",
      "As the dispute has dragged on, the critics have got louder, dubbing the girls as troublemakers rather than game-changers. Following the ruling, which their critics welcomed, NewJeans say they have been \"very aware of the intense scrutiny and judgment\" ever since they held that press conference last year.",
      "\"There hasn't been a single moment when we've expressed our opinions without worry or tension,\"  Minji says. \"We've thought more than anyone else about how much responsibility each of our actions carries, and we're currently bearing that responsibility ourselves.\"",
      "It's not clear how long their hiatus will last. Ador says it hopes to meet the group soon to discuss the future, but NewJeans insist they don't feel protected enough to go back.",
      "Their lawsuit with Ador will return to the headlines next week when the hearings begin - and so will all five of them.",
      "The one thing that seems constant is their determination to get through this together.",
      "Two weeks ago, Hanni had said: \"We've always said to each other, if one person doesn't want to do it, then we're not going to do it. It has to be all all five of us that agrees to do it. That's how we've gotten here and that's how we are going to get to the end.\"",

      "The government has agreed a new funding package with pharmacy negotiators in England, leading some pharmacies to call off protests that were planned for later this week.",
      "One group representing thousands of local pharmacies was preparing to take action involving cuts to opening hours from Tuesday, but they say that will be delayed while they consider the deal.",
      "Others have said the funding package is a \"step in the right direction\" but it still will not cover all cost increases pharmacies are facing, including a rise in National Insurance.",
      "Announcing the deal, ministers said they were working to turn around a \"decade of underfunding and neglect\".",
      "Community pharmacies have been warning of closures and cutbacks in the face of what they say are unsustainable pressures.",
      "Among these are a rising workload, funding which has not kept pace with inflation and the prospect of higher employer National Insurance contributions.",
      "And all this as they are expected to help more patients with some conditions to take the pressure off GPs.",
      "Government funding for pharmacies in England stood at \u00a32.6bn in 2019/20. But over the next few years that did not go up with inflation.",
      "In the current financial year (2024/25) it has been at \u00a32.7bn.",
      "The government has now announced a new deal for pharmacies in England, which will see funding rise to \u00a33.1bn next year (2025/26).",

      "\"This package of record investment and reform is a vital first step to getting community pharmacies back on their feet and fit for the future.\"",
      "There was a cautious welcome from representatives of High Street chemists but warnings that the extra funding would not be enough to cover rising costs.",
      "Leyla Hannbeck, chief executive of the Independent Pharmacies Association, said the government's announcement was a \"welcome step in the right direction\" but it \"does not alleviate pressures and will not stop closures\".",
      "Community pharmacies in England are \"on life support\", she said, adding the rise in National Insurance and business rates makes the situation \"even more acute\".",
      "Another community pharmacy group, the National Pharmacy Association (NPA), had announced that protest action would begin on Tuesday.",
      "It had previously warned that pharmacists were facing a \"financial cliff edge\" from 1 April, when many of their costs are due to rise.",
      "The NPA advised about 6,000 members in England to start \"working to rule\" from this date.",
      "This was due to involve cutting opening hours to around 40 hours a week \u2013 the minimum required under their contracts \u2013 and would have meant possible weekend closures.",

      "In the 12 weeks since The Thistle opened in the east end of Glasgow, there have been 16 such overdose incidents.",
      "A total of 180 people have visited the unit and more than 1,200 injections of street-bought heroin and cocaine have been supervised.",
      "A total of 27 people have been referred to other services, including housing, by staff.",
      "The service, which follows similar programmes in 18 other countries, seeks to reduce drug-related harm in a hardcore population of injecting users in one of the most deprived communities in Glasgow.",
      "It is hoped that by providing a safer space it will allow medical staff to prevent overdose deaths, reduce blood-borne viruses and clean-up a local area that, historically, has had a major issue with discarded needles and drug debris.",
      "David Clark has been using drugs for 26 years and has spent long periods of his life on the streets.",
      "He allowed BBC Scotland to follow his progress over a three-month period as he attempted to move on from a city centre hostel and stop using heroin and cocaine.",
      "The 47-year-old told Disclosure he used The Thistle service to inject cocaine in February.",

      "She took Disclosure on a tour of Calton's known using spots and said there was evidence of freshly discarded needles.",

      "\"It will also improve the social environment for communities, residents, businesses and visitors to these areas,\" he said.",
      "\"The Thistle will hopefully reduce the drug-related death rates for the population that it serves. But that is a relatively small population compared with Scotland as a whole.",
      "\"Its contribution to the national drug death figures won't be very significant. We have to be honest about that.\"",
      "Dr Priyadarshi said much of the anger emanating from the community related to a lack of resources for other services in the area.",
      "\"Sometimes I worry that the focus on residential rehab or drug consumption rooms, a focus on debates and discussions about this, takes our eyes off the bigger picture,\" he added.",
      "\"What are the key drivers here? The key drivers are communities who experience high levels of deprivation and inequality are the ones that experience the highest rates of drug-related deaths and drug-related harms.\"",
      "The consumption room was first proposed in 2017 as a response to an HIV outbreak among Glasgow's injecting drug users, the worst seen in the UK for 30 years.",
      "Health authorities had hoped that offering a sterile place for users to inject would reduce the risk of blood-borne viruses.",
      "However, critics of the scheme said more money should be provided to other recovery services.",

      "Pip is paid to more than 3.6 million people who have a long-term physical or mental health condition in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
      "There are two elements - a daily living component and a mobility component. Claimants may be eligible for one or both.",
      "Under the government's proposals, assessments for the daily living part will be tightened, which the official forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - says will affect around 800,000 people.",
      "Pip assessments involve questions about tasks like preparing and eating food, washing and getting dressed. Each is scored on a scale from zero - for no difficulty - to 12 - for the most severe - by a health professional.",
      "From November 2026, the government says people will need to score at least four points for one activity, instead of qualifying for support with a score that could describe less severe difficulties (ones and twos) across a broad range of tasks.",
      "For example, needing help to wash your hair, or your body below the waist, would be awarded two points, but needing help to wash between the shoulders and waist would equate to four points.",

      "At present, the payment is made for a fixed period of time between one and 10 years, after which it is reviewed. You may be reassessed sooner if your circumstances change.",
      "The government plans more frequent reassessments for many people claiming Pip. However, those with the highest levels of a permanent condition or disability will no longer face reassessment.",

      "The government has also announced changes to universal credit, which is paid to 7.5 million people.",
      "At present, more than three million recipients have no requirement to find work due to their health, a number that has risen sharply.",
      "The basic level of universal credit is worth \u00a3393.45 a month to a single person who is 25 or over.",
      "But if you have limited capacity to work because of a disability or long term condition, this payment more than doubles, because of an extra top up worth \u00a3416.19.",
      "Under the government's proposals, claimants will not be eligible to get this incapacity top-up until they are aged 22 or over.",
      "New claimants will also see this top-up fall from \u00a397 extra per week in 2025-26 to \u00a350 a week by 2026-27, before being frozen until the end of 2029-30.",
      "The higher rate for existing health-related claimants will also be frozen for the same period.",
      "At the same time, the basic payment level for universal credit will rise. When the government first set out its plans, it said it would rise to \u00a3107 a week by 2029-30, but the Spring Statement confirmed it would go up to \u00a3106.",
      "Who will be affected by the changes?",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) says that it expects 3.2 million families \u2013 a mixture of current and future recipients - to lose out financially as a result of the total package of measures, with an average loss of \u00a31,720 per year.",

      "730,000 future UC recipients who will lose an average of \u00a33,000 per year.",
      "However, these calculations don't take into account the effects of the extra \u00a31bn the government it says it will spend to help those with disabilities and long-term health conditions find work.",
      "It expects this support will mitigate some of the predicted financial losses.",
      "In addition, the DWP says 3.8 million families will gain an average of \u00a3420 a year as a result of the increase in the standard UC allowance and changes to the assessment process.",
      "What is being done to get more people into work?",
      "The government says it wants to help those who can work back into employment, while doing more to protect those with severe conditions who are unable to do so.",
      "As part of this it will invest \u00a31bn in what it calls \"high-quality, tailored and personalised support\" to help people find jobs.",
      "A number of changes have been announced which the government hopes will break the link between trying to get into work and losing benefits.",
      "The work capability assessment, which checks eligibility for the health related top-up to universal credit, will be scrapped by 2028.",
      "Instead, claimants will have to go through the Pip system to claim for a health benefit. The government says they will be assessed on how their disability affects their daily life, rather than on their capacity to work.",
      "While you can receive universal credit or Pip while in employment, universal credit is means-tested and tapers off as earnings increase, while Pip is not affected by how much someone works or their level of savings.",
      "A new \"right to try\" system will mean people will not be financially penalised if they take a job which doesn't work out.",
      "The government will also consult on merging employment and support allowance and jobseeker's allowance into a single time-limited benefit that is not means-tested. This would be more generous but available for a shorter period.",
      "\"If you have paid into the system, you'll get stronger income protection while we help you get back on track,\" Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said.",
      "Why does the government want to cut welfare spending?",
      "Overall, the government currently spends \u00a365bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. Before the government announced the Pip and UC changes, this was projected to increase to \u00a3100bn by 2029.",
      "Pip is the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending due to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30.",
      "When Pip was introduced in 2013, the aim was to save \u00a31.4bn a year by reducing the number of people eligible for payments. However, initial savings were modest and the number of claimants has risen.",
      "About 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions.",
      "That is 44% of all working age claimants, according to the independent economic think-tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).",
      "The OBR now predicts welfare spending on working-age adults will be \u00a372.3bn by 2029-2030. Spending on pensioners and children is expected to be \u00a325.4bn.",
      "How big is the welfare budget and where might cuts fall?",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "Does cutting benefits actually work?"

      "He is the second senior member of Sir Keir's team to leave less than a year after the general election, following Sue Gray walking out of the door as his chief of staff in the autumn.",

      "Sue Gray quits as Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff",
      "Dodds exit shows unease over Starmer's tough decisions",
      "Mr Doyle's decision to quit and leave immediately has caused some surprise, but one special adviser said he \"had been increasingly detached for some time. It was clear that Lyons was actually in charge - and doing an excellent job to be fair\".",
      "The veteran spin doctor has more than a quarter of a century of experience with Labour, beginning as the head of press for the party in 1998, before a brief stint as an adviser to David Blunkett, then the work and pensions secretary.",
      "Moving into Blair's No 10 in 2005, Mr Doyle rose to become deputy head of communications, and carried on working for Blair after he left office for another five years.",
      "He spent a period working at the charity International Rescue with David Miliband, the former Blair-era foreign secretary, and set up his own consultancy.",
      "Mr Doyle joined Sir Keir Starmer's team in the summer of 2021, arguably the lowest point of his leadership, shortly after a humiliating defeat for Labour in a by-election in Hartlepool.",
      "An email from Mr Doyle to colleagues this morning, seen by the BBC, said \"it's time to pass the baton on\".",
      "He added: \"I wanted to let you know that I have informed the prime minister I am standing down as director of communications.",
      "\"When I started working for Keir four years ago, not many people thought we could win a general election and certainly not in the emphatic way we did.",
      "\"That was down to the hard work and determination of so many people and of course Keir's leadership.",
      "\"I am incredibly proud of the part I have played in returning our party to government and the change we are already bringing to the country. Now it's time to pass the baton on.\"",
      "'Away day'",
      "In a statement, Sir Keir said: \"Matthew brought his considerable experience to my team in summer 2021 and has worked tirelessly by my side every day since playing a leading role in Labour's historic election win.",
      "\"On a personal level it has been a real privilege to work with him and on behalf of the entire team I wish him all the very best for his next role.\"",

      "\"Some of this is about us increasing enforcement, but some of this is the prevention action that we need employers to take.\"",
      "'Wrong end'",
      "The Home Office said the change would be made possible by amending the government's Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, which is making its way through Parliament.",
      "The department said a \"full consultation\" with businesses on implementing the checks would then follow, naming construction, food delivery, beauty salons, and couriers among sectors likely to be affected by the new rules.",
      "Elsewhere in her interview, Cooper confirmed the government is reviewing how international human rights law is applied to migration cases, although she did not provide details.",
      "The government has faced pressure from the Conservatives, who have called for a law change to stop those denied the right to stay in the UK challenging their deportation on human rights grounds.",
      "Shadow cabinet office minister Burghart accused Labour ministers of looking at the \"wrong end of the problem\" when it came to illegal working.",
      "He said Labour's decision to scrap the Tories' Rwanda deportation scheme shortly after entering office meant there would be no \"deterrent\" to stop people trying to enter the UK without permission.",
      "The Conservatives announced the plan in 2022, but failed to bring the scheme into effect before they were voted out of office at last year's general election."

    "summary": "The chancellor is on track to meet her own fiscal rules, so why is there talk of tax rises in the autumn?",
    "story": [
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set out her plans for the UK economy in her Spring Statement and is on track to meet her self-imposed rules on the public finances, which she has said are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "On the face of it, that sounds like a good thing. So why are people saying that she may struggle to meet them and the only way she may do so is by raising taxes?",
      "It's a complicated picture, but there are essentially five steps to get from where we are now to tax rises.",
      "Not much spare money",
      "Ahead of the Spring Statement, the chancellor had been under pressure, with speculation over how she would be able to meet her self-imposed financial rules, one of which is to not borrow to fund day-to-day spending.",
      "In October, the government's official economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said that Reeves would be able to meet that rule with \u00a39.9bn to spare.",
      "An increase in government borrowing costs since then meant that that room to spare had disappeared. Now big welfare cuts and spending reductions in the Spring Statement have restored it.",
      "Almost \u00a310bn may sound like a lot, but it's a relatively small amount in an economy that spends \u00a31 trillion a year, and raises around the same in tax.",
      "In fact it is the third lowest margin a chancellor has left themselves since 2010. The average headroom over that time is three times bigger at \u00a330bn.",
      "Warning taxes could still rise despite welfare cuts",
      "Warning taxes could still rise despite welfare cuts",
      "\"It is a tiny fraction of the risks to the outlook,\" Richard Hughes from the OBR told the BBC.",
      "He said there were many factors that could \"wipe out\" the chancellor's headroom, including an escalating trade war, any small downgrade to growth forecasts or a rise in interest rates.",
      "Predicting the future is difficult",
      "Which brings us on to the precarious nature of making economic forecasts.",
      "\"All forecasts turn out to be wrong. Weather forecasts also turn out to be wrong,\" says Mr Hughes.",
      "Predicting what will happen in the future, especially in five years' time is hard, and is subject to revisions. You could be forgiven for not predicting a war or a pandemic, for instance.",
      "The respected think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), has already said there is \"a good chance that economic and fiscal forecasts will deteriorate significantly between now and an Autumn Budget\".",
      "A case in point, only hours after Reeves delivered her statement in parliament, US President Donald Trump announced new 25% tariffs on cars and car parts coming into the US.",
      "Car tariffs a sign worse could come",
      "Reeves admitted the car tariffs would be \"bad for the UK\" but insisted the government was in \"extensive\" talks to avoid them being imposed here.",
      "According to the OBR, these import taxes would have a direct impact on goods totalling around 0.2% of GDP.",
      "Before Trump's announcement, the OBR had warned of the risk of an escalating trade war, and while the proposals do not exactly match the watchdog's worst-case scenario, which would see the UK retaliate, Hughes said it had elements of it.",
      "Although 0.2% is a tiny amount, nevertheless it will affect the economy.",
      "And in the OBR's worst-case scenario, 1% would be knocked off economic growth.",

      "Uncertainty can stop firms and people spending",
      "Trump's trade policies and the fact that nobody seems to know whether he will follow through with his threats, U-turn on them, or how he will react to others is just one way his presidency is making the world so uncertain at the moment.",
      "The war in Ukraine continues, despite Trump's pledge to end it.",
      "The UK, along with Germany, has said it will increase defence spending. Trump has long called for European members of Nato to spend more on defence, and there are also fears that if the US does make a deal with Russia to end the war, that could leave Europe vulnerable.",
      "Domestically, businesses are also facing a worrying time as they brace for a rise in costs in April as employers' National Insurance contributions, the National Living wage and business rates are all set to go up.",
      "Some firms have said they have put off investment decisions as a result, and many have warned of price rises or job cuts. If these materialise, then that will knock growth.",
      "Break the rules or raise taxes",
      "Given all of the above, if the chancellor's headroom were to disappear, why would that matter?",
      "Reeves has staked her reputation on meeting her fiscal rules, pledging to bring \"iron discipline\" and provide stability and reassurance to financial markets, in contrast to former Prime Minister Liz Truss, whose unfunded tax cuts spooked the markets and raised interest rates.",
      "So if she is still to meet her rules and not borrow to fund day-to-day spending, that would mean either more spending cuts or tax rises.",
      "The government has already announced big cuts to the welfare bill as well as plans to cut the civil service and abolish several quangos including NHS England.",
      "But as Paul Dale, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, puts it: \"Non-defence spending can only be cut so far.\"",
      "By leaving herself so little wiggle room and with such a precarious economic outlook, \"we can surely now expect six or seven months of speculation about what taxes might or might not be increased in the autumn,\" says Paul Johnson from the IFS.",
      "That speculation itself can cause economic harm, he says.",
      "Reeves has not ruled out tax rises but told the BBC there were \"opportunities\" as well as \"risks\" for the UK economy."

    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Why the reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge",
    "story": [
      "I remember 1974 well. With inflation on the rise, the government had been locked in battle with trade unions over worker pay. The government appeared paralysed: stand up to the miners and strikes could shut down the power system, but give in and pay them more money and inflation would rocket.",
      "And then the global oil crisis came out of nowhere. It threw economies, including Britain's, into chaos. The government introduced a three-day week. Power cuts were common - we would be plunged into darkness without warning. And seemingly, the government just expected us to deal with it.",
      "This was also the year I began presenting the BBC's current affairs programme Panorama. We spent a lot of time debating these issues. People came on with all kinds of different ideas of what to do.",
      "There were even suggestions that what the country really needed to take back control from the unions was a military takeover - a coup.",
      "There was another idea out there too. It was proposed by the Conservative politician Keith Joseph and was entirely radical - so removed from the mainstream, in fact, that during filming of Panorama, Joseph turned to the production team and asked exasperatedly if they understood what he meant.",
      "That idea was the free market.",
      "This meant Britain departing from the post World War Two consensus that government should control the economy and that instead if you left the markets alone, they would deliver the country greater prosperity and security.",
      "If, in 2025, the idea sounds anything but radical, that's exactly the point.",
      "What we saw in the UK in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government was just how quickly the free market transitioned from a radical idea into the new reality. Then before long it became what many assumed was the system that would last forever.",
      "US President Donald Trump is a billionaire businessman who has clearly done well financially out of capitalism. But suddenly, thanks in part to him, the free market system finds itself under assault like never before.",
      "It might yet weather the storm. However others are asking, is the free market system fatally flawed and doomed to failure?",
      "The fantasy world of Thatcher's Britain",
      "So much of what Thatcher did in the wake of her 1983 general election victory seems so obvious now. We take it for granted that private companies play a pivotal role in providing our water, electricity, gas, railways, ports and freight.",
      "But at the time few believed it possible to do what she had done - it seemed like a fantasy world, completely detached from how things had been done post war.",
      "I was six when the war ended. There was rationing \u2013 coupons that allowed you to buy meat or clothes, or of course, sweets. But out of these hard times and on the heels of victory, a new vision of society was emerging in Britain.",
      "With Clement Attlee's landslide election victory in July 1945, for the first time in Britain's political history a majority cast their votes for a party ostensibly dedicated to socialism.",
      "But more than that, a new consensus on how the country should run emerged, with those leading the Labour and Conservative parties singing from a broadly similar sheet.",
      "\"We have built our defences against want and sickness, and we're proud of it,\" was uttered not by a Labour prime minister but by Harold Macmillan, Conservative prime minister from 1957 to 1963. This had been how things were done.",
      "However not everyone bought into the consensus. Antony Fisher, who was a chicken farmer, was exasperated by what he saw as the meddling of the Egg Marketing Board. He set up the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, inspired Keith Joseph and he in turn got Thatcher's ear.",
      "Trump's admiration of Thatcher",
      "That the current assault on the free market is coming, in part, from a Republican US president seems all the more ironic given how popular Thatcher's reforms were with the American right.",
      "Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan shared a similar world view, and Trump has spoken of his admiration for the two, albeit with the caveat that he didn't agree with some of Reagan's trade policies.",
      "Thatcher was convinced that the country would be much better off if gas and water and electricity were taken out of the hands of the state. And sold on the open market. The free market. Just like buying a loaf of bread.",
      "The Thatcher government's big idea was that they weren't just going to sell the shares in state-owned utilities to big businesses or investors. They were going to offer them to the British people.",
      "In December 1984 shares in British Telecom (BT) went on sale. The next morning, the numbers were staggering: more than two million Britons were now BT shareholders.",
      "And Thatcher began to realise that selling off these companies wasn't just about breaking the shackles of government control. It could be something bigger - turning every person in Britain into a capitalist and in doing so making capitalism popular.",
      "In Britain, by the end of the 1980s, the scale of transformation was staggering. The sum of \u00a360bn was raised by selling off state run companies. Up to 15 million Britons were now shareholders.",
      "Britain was embracing the free market. This wasn't just an economic shift. It was a cultural revolution. A redefinition of Britain's relationship with money, with government, and with itself.",
      "And if Thatcher's privatisation had given ordinary people the chance to buy shares, her reforms to Britain's financial services sector in 1986, known as the Big Bang, gave ordinary people the chance to sell them too, to get a job in the previously closed world of the City.",
      "There were many on the left for whom the principle alone of these reforms was something to object to. The assault on the free market from some on the right is not about the principles of the reforms, but the consequences.",
      "Offshore business and collapsing communities",
      "At the core of Thatcher's thinking was a belief that free market capitalism could work only if many people had a direct stake in it. And with share ownership of previously state run utilities, many people did. But before long, alarm bells were starting to be rung. And their chime has only gotten louder.",
      "James Goldsmith was a businessman who had made a fortune by buying struggling companies cheaply, reshaping them to maximise efficiency and then selling them at a profit. The 1980s reforms were like manna from heaven for him.",
      "But then he seemed to change his mind about things. In 1994 he told a committee of US senators that its premise contained a fatal flaw - that the system demanded maximum profit but to achieve maximum profit that meant severing the umbilical link with many of your own electorate.",
      "\"You get to a system whereby, to get the best corporate profits, you have to leave your own country. You have to say to your own sales force 'Goodbye, we can't use you anymore - you're too expensive'.",
      "\"You've got unions. You want holidays. You want protection. So we're going offshore.\"",
      "Goldsmith was predicting that companies would take their business wherever they would make the most money. If you are a CEO answerable to shareholders that's literally your job description. And the result, he said, would be job losses in the West, with communities collapsing.",
      "And to make things worse, he argued that Britain had ceded sovereignty to the likes of the European Union and the World Trade Organization, with Britain binding itself to an economic system run by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, only adding to the sense of alienation felt in collapsing communities. And with global markets dictating policy. If an industry wasn't profitable, it was left to die.",
      "Today, the UK may be a global leader in science and financial services but is that of much consolation to communities where we once made things that are now made offshore?",
      "Based on what I often heard in my many years touring the country presenting Question Time, I'm not sure it is.",
      "Goldsmith would end up trying to go into politics. His Referendum Party was trounced in the 1997 general election but he had planted a seed. He had argued that the global free market path that Britain and the rest of the world was going down was dangerous. That it would spread division around the world.",
      "Fast-forward nearly 20 years to 2016 and his warning came to pass. Britain voted to leave the European Union and the verdict could not be clearer: the Leave vote was highest in those left-behind communities, seemingly fuelled by those who felt globalisation was not working for them.",
      "The dream of a nation of shareholders has soured too.",
      "In 1989 Thames Water was privatised. We were promised lower bills, better infrastructure, less red tape and investment in a system fraying at the edges. It was investment that the global capitalist system was supposedly best placed to provide.",
      "What followed was something else entirely. Debt ballooned and dividends flowed to shareholders. The company extracted profit while pipes leaked and sewage poured into rivers. And our bills now pay for interest on that debt - it feels like we've come a long way from Thatcher's nation of shareholders.",
      "Trump's tariffs 'defy easy explanation'",
      "Back in 1994, James Goldsmith had posited that the problem with the free market dream was that it didn't protect the home base.",
      "Now, there is someone else much more powerful who takes that view.",
      "President Trump's methods are so erratic that with him it's hard to tell what is going on. His readiness to slap hugely consequential tariffs on countries that are both traditional foes and supposed friends at times defies easy explanation.",
      "But what we can say is that he is trying to return to ideas that preceded the free market. He is trying to make America strong through protectionism, making it harder for anyone to simply sell anywhere.",
      "There is an argument that if you take the long view then perhaps the free market period is the outlier. Britain itself had a long, long period of protectionism before it embraced free trade.",
      "Tariffs are nothing new in world economic history and in a sense Trump is just trying to return the US to how things were, albeit in quite a chaotic way.",
      "The reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge. But that challenge is coming not from supporters of socialism who ideologically back a big role for the state. Instead, the challenge is coming from Trump, a man who is broadly speaking of the right and has no qualms with capitalism allowing people to become very rich.",
      "That the challenge is coming from within is what makes it so potent.",
      "Top image credit: Getty Images",
      "Trump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling",
      "Russia's next move? The countries trying to Putin-proof themselves",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",

      "There is relatively little else actually happening in policy terms. There were no tax rises, no changes to Chancellor Rachel Reeves' borrowing rules and as expected, this was definitely not a Budget.",

      "At this stage this is not about an extra brick being laid or even planning approval, but it is a \"spreadsheet win\" that eased the chancellor's fiscal pain.",

      "At present, more than three million recipients have no requirement to find work due to their health, a number that has risen sharply.",
      "The basic level of universal credit is worth \u00a3393.45 a month to a single person who is 25 or over.",
      "But if you have limited capacity to work because of a disability or long term condition, this payment more than doubles, because of an extra top up worth \u00a3416.19.",
      "Under the government's proposals, claimants will not be eligible to get this incapacity top-up until they are aged 22 or over.",
      "New claimants will also see this top-up fall from \u00a397 extra per week in 2025-26 to \u00a350 a week by 2026-27, before being frozen until the end of 2029-30.",
      "The higher rate for existing health-related claimants will also be frozen for the same period.",
      "At the same time, the basic payment level for universal credit will rise. When the government first set out its plans, it said it would rise to \u00a3107 a week by 2029-30, but the Spring Statement confirmed it would go up to \u00a3106.",

      "730,000 future UC recipients who will lose an average of \u00a33,000 per year.",
      "However, these calculations don't take into account the effects of the extra \u00a31bn the government it says it will spend to help those with disabilities and long-term health conditions find work.",
      "It expects this support will mitigate some of the predicted financial losses.",
      "In addition, the DWP says 3.8 million families will gain an average of \u00a3420 a year as a result of the increase in the standard UC allowance and changes to the assessment process.",
      "What is being done to get more people into work?",
      "The government says it wants to help those who can work back into employment, while doing more to protect those with severe conditions who are unable to do so.",
      "As part of this it will invest \u00a31bn in what it calls \"high-quality, tailored and personalised support\" to help people find jobs.",
      "A number of changes have been announced which the government hopes will break the link between trying to get into work and losing benefits.",
      "The work capability assessment, which checks eligibility for the health related top-up to universal credit, will be scrapped by 2028.",
      "Instead, claimants will have to go through the Pip system to claim for a health benefit. The government says they will be assessed on how their disability affects their daily life, rather than on their capacity to work.",
      "While you can receive universal credit or Pip while in employment, universal credit is means-tested and tapers off as earnings increase, while Pip is not affected by how much someone works or their level of savings.",
      "A new \"right to try\" system will mean people will not be financially penalised if they take a job which doesn't work out.",
      "The government will also consult on merging employment and support allowance and jobseeker's allowance into a single time-limited benefit that is not means-tested. This would be more generous but available for a shorter period.",
      "\"If you have paid into the system, you'll get stronger income protection while we help you get back on track,\" Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said.",
      "Why does the government want to cut welfare spending?",
      "Overall, the government currently spends \u00a365bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. Before the government announced the Pip and UC changes, this was projected to increase to \u00a3100bn by 2029.",
      "Pip is the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending due to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30.",
      "When Pip was introduced in 2013, the aim was to save \u00a31.4bn a year by reducing the number of people eligible for payments. However, initial savings were modest and the number of claimants has risen.",
      "About 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions.",
      "That is 44% of all working age claimants, according to the independent economic think-tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).",
      "The OBR now predicts welfare spending on working-age adults will be \u00a372.3bn by 2029-2030. Spending on pensioners and children is expected to be \u00a325.4bn.",

      "What is the chancellor's Spring Statement and what will be in it?",
      "Loosen the fiscal rules?",
      "At the heart of the political conversation this week are the government's self- imposed \"fiscal rules\".",
      "The government has chosen them in the hope they illustrate financial responsibility,  a trustworthiness on the international stage that the UK can pay its way and service its debts.",
      "The two rules are that day-to-day costs are met by tax revenues and that debt is falling as a share of the economy five years ahead.",
      "They are, ultimately, arbitrary: managing the national finances is complex and multilayered and while governments will often impose limits on themselves in the hope of portraying credibility, precisely what they are can vary significantly.",
      "Former Labour cabinet minister Lord David Blunkett told the BBC at the weekend he \"would like the Chancellor to loosen a little the self-imposed fiscal rules\", adding that they amounted to \"Treasury orthodoxy\u2026at its worst\".",
      "\"I would lift them marginally. I would raise the self-imposed rule by at least \u00a310-15 billion and I would spend a great chunk of it on what we did back in '97 with the new deal for the unemployed,\" the former work and pensions secretary told BBC Radio 4.",
      "Lord Blunkett isn't the only one \u2013 Jagjit Chadha, Professor of Economics at Cambridge University, has written in The Guardian this week of his scepticism about the value of the fiscal rules.",
      "There is another parallel that could be drawn too.",
      "Last week the German parliament voted to allow a massive increase in defence spending.",
      "The new law will exempt spending on defence and security from Germany's strict debt rules.",
      "Could, should, the UK do the same?",
      "Both the German parallel and Lord Blunkett's suggestion get short shrift from senior government figures.",
      "\"When people say change the fiscal rules, that means borrowing more money,\" is how one source put it to me.",
      "\"We have got to be honest about the implications of higher borrowing. If we did what Germany is doing, it could add \u00a34bn to borrowing costs, not far off the prisons budget,\" they added.",
      "It is also pointed out that Germany's national debt is vastly smaller than the UK's as a share of national income.",
      "And there is no appetite to do anything that might provoke the international markets to go wobbly about the UK again, as happened when Liz Truss was prime minister.",
      "What about a wealth tax?",
      "Some on the left of the Labour Party have been calling for this, as have the Green Party and others.",
      "The idea would attempt to do what it said on the tin, but observers such as Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies are cautious about its likely effectiveness as a revenue raiser.",
      "Before the last Budget in the autumn a cross-party group of MPs suggested it, while Labour MP Richard Burgon raised it as an idea at Prime Minister's Questions earlier this month.",
      "Reeves has long distanced herself from the idea, arguing in 2023: \"I don't see the way to prosperity as being through taxation.\"",
      "Reeves and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer are fearful of being portrayed as high taxers and high spenders, an image plenty within Labour think has previously cost them dearly at elections.",
      "But could a one-off such tax ever be tempting as ministers confront awkward spending squeezes in places and that ever growing demand for defence spending?",
      "Other taxes rises in spotlight",
      "What about cranking up income tax, national insurance or VAT?",
      "After all, these are the big levers of revenue raising for any chancellor.",
      "But there is a catch: Labour promised not to in its election manifesto.",
      "They did, nonetheless, put up national insurance, albeit on employers not employees \u2013 a rise that is due to kick in next month and is causing considerable anxiety for many businesses.",
      "So why not ratchet up one of the others?",
      "Some say, for a start, it could further depress an already stagnant economy, as well as further depress the outlook of many on politicians' capacities to keep promises.",
      "On the other hand, increases to these taxes tend to lead to a reliable big uptick in tax revenue and because they reach significant swathes of the population, they don't energise smaller, often well organised sectors who can then vociferously oppose a more targeted and less revenue rich idea.",
      "A good example of this are the dozens of tractors on Whitehall as farmers in their thousands made their views known about changes to inheritance tax.",
      "Thinking about all this was hinted at, alongside changes to the fiscal rules, by the now former international development minister, Anneliese Dodds, in her resignation last month over the cut in the international aid budget to bolster defence spending.",
      "In her resignation letter to the prime minister, she wrote that she had hoped the government would \"collectively discuss our fiscal rules and approach to taxation, just as other nations are doing\".",
      "She added: \"It will be impossible to raise the substantial resources needed just through tactical cuts to public spending. These are unprecedented times, where strategic decisions for the sake of our country's security cannot be ducked.\"",
      "Smashing manifesto promises is not something governments do lightly and Labour would tread particularly carefully around these flagship pledges on the economy, so often for many a perceived weak spot in the party's credibility.",
      "The tax burden, on average, is also generationally high \u2013 another reason these ideas could be a mighty hard sell even if ministers were willing to break their promises.",
      "And if ideas from their own side, like these three, aren't palatable, all of which make an already big State even bigger, there are those suggested by the Conservatives and others.",
      "Reducing benefit spending",
      "Cutting benefits much more is one such idea.",
      "The former Conservative and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell, writing in the Telegraph, suggested closing eight government departments, saving \u00a324bn by cutting the public sector workforce and instituting a two year public sector pay freeze.",
      "He reckoned these ideas alongside others could cut government spending from 45% of national income to 40%.",
      "Many of these might not be instantly palatable to a Labour government, just like those from their own side, but all of this brings us back to where we began: has the world changed? By how much? For how long?",
      "And just how bold might the government have to think \u2013 and soon \u2013 if it really has?",

    "story": [
      "\"Definitely not a Budget\" is the basic message emerging from the Treasury about the chancellor's upcoming economic statement.",
      "There will not just be no red box outside Number 11, there will only be a \"thin book\" of new policies with a \"light scorecard\" of measures with no further tax rises.",
      "So what is the point of this Spring Statement?",
      "It is principally a spring forecast from the government's official forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). In that process it has had to take into account a slower economy than expected, and higher government borrowing costs.",
      "This OBR forecast has wiped out the room for manoeuvre against the \"non-negotiable\" rules Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set on government borrowing in the future. She has made a number of further adjustments to keep the numbers on track.",
      "Essentially low growth and higher borrowing costs have blown the budgetary numbers off course.",
      "We will hear a lot from the chancellor about how \"the world has changed\".",
      "The reality is this course correction is likely to have been required even before US President Donald Trump transformed global diplomacy and trade.",
      "When Reeves begins her statement at the despatch box, we will find out whether the chancellor can continue to rule out having to resort to tax rises, even in this \"changed world\".",
      "And if there is no return to spending austerity, then where does the money come from?",

      "Live: Follow the latest on the chancellor's announcement",
      "Everything you need to know about the Spring Statement",
      "'As a student, \u00a3800 a month is quite tight'",
      "What are Rachel Reeves's borrowing rules?",
      "While no significant tax measures are expected, the chancellor may nonetheless leave the option on the table for the autumn Budget.",
      "Some economists do expect tax rises in the autumn, in particular to meet rising defence spending. There is talk of a \"conversation with the public\" on this matter.",
      "At her first Budget the chancellor rejected, for example, extending the Conservative freeze to income tax thresholds by another two years. The public could get a clear idea around this Spring Statement if that is back as an option.",
      "The \u00a35bn cut to welfare spending already announced is the biggest single welfare cut for a decade. That is likely to be the biggest saving. The chancellor is now set to expand the cuts after being told reforms to the system would save less than planned.",
      "Later on Wednesday, the number of people losing Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit, how much on average, and the split between current or future recipients should be revealed. Hundreds of thousands will lose thousands of pounds worth of health-related benefits.",
      "There is a \u00a32.2bn cut to civil service admin costs, including staffing by 2029-30. A 15% cut is a significant chunk of what is spent by central government on wages and consultants.",
      "However, the chancellor suggested a loss of 10,000 roles, which is only a pruning of a workforce of over half a million - especially as it sees 30-40,000 leavers every year.",
      "The unions say this cannot be done without harming front line services. There is a lot riding here on deployment of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI).",
      "A further fractional trim to the rise in departmental budgets, a crackdown on tax avoidance, and the switch from aid to defence spending should all help restore the chancellor's room for manoeuvre by another few billion pounds.",
      "It will be difficult to characterise this as \"austerity\" given the early injection of significant upfront sums into public spending at the Budget.",
      "Divvying up the increase in defence spending will be a key feature of the Spring Statement.",
      "Defence spending (for example, on jets and tanks) is more capital intensive than aid spending, so more of it is exempted from the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules to limit day-to-day spending only to what is raised in taxes.",
      "Growth downgrade",
      "Understandably there will be a lot of focus on a chunky downgrade to the OBR forecast for the economy in 2025.",
      "The real question for the chancellor has been the extent to which that has carried through to the end of the forecast period, and so permanently dented the economy and tax revenues. It may have not, and therefore not impact the Budget numbers quite so much.",
      "The Treasury has also been trying to get the OBR to give it credit for growth-enhancing reforms such as planning changes.",
      "In theory, higher growth means lower forecast borrowing and more room for manoeuvre - a win-win. But the OBR may have become stricter on this after a recent external review of its methods.",
      "There is a bigger picture here about growth and the government's strategy. Investors and business are still awaiting the infrastructure, industrial and trade strategies of this government eight months since it took power.",
      "The new global reality means further uncertainty, but also creates a potential significant upside for a stable, rules-based advanced economy with cutting-edge frontier science, research and financial services.",
      "This is particularly the case for a nation that can simultaneously keep its trade and investment connections with the US, Europe, China and the Gulf, even amid the tariff tumult. In Cabinet they call it \"the most connected economy in the world\".",
      "Is the world hearing this? UK Government borrowing costs have risen again as markets await the new calendar of bond sales on Wednesday.",
      "UK bond yields went up with the US in January, but when that stopped they also rose in line with Europe after massive debt-fuelled rearmament plans. It's the worst of both worlds for the borrowing forecast.",
      "The Spring Statement might be an opportunity to project the opposite case - that the UK is uniquely placed to be the best of both worlds. Some sort of economic deal with the US is imminent, and talks over the Brexit reset are also progressing.",
      "There are some small signs of the economy breaking out of its recent rut, especially in the service sector. Small businesses in retail and hospitality fearing the rises to National Insurance and the National Living Wage are holding out for some sort of alleviation of the pain.",
      "So Wednesday, while definitely not a Budget, will answer some important questions about the economy."

      "Sewage spilled illegally into England's largest lake on a record number of days last year, an analysis of water company data by campaigners suggests.",
      "The analysis, which the BBC had exclusive access to, used United Utilities operational data to establish when the company was discharging sewage into Windermere when it should by law have been treating some of it.",
      "The campaigners from Windrush Against Sewage Pollution (WASP) and Save Windermere identified 140 illegal spill days in 2024, more than in any of the three previous years.",
      "United Utilities told BBC News that the campaigners' findings were \"inaccurate\" and some of the data \"erroneous\".",
      "The company declined to put in writing, despite repeated requests, any specific examples of mistakes or omissions.",
      "Regulators Ofwat and the Environment Agency are both currently investigating United Utilities operations.",
      "Sewage dumped illegally in Windermere over 3 years",
      "Government vows to clean up England's largest lake",
      "Water firm behind spills says fixes will take time",
      "Part of the Lake District National Park Unesco World Heritage Site, Windermere is home to more than 14,000 people and its scenery attracts an estimated seven million visitors per year.",
      "But its pristine image is under threat. Regular discharges of sewage into Windermere have been blamed for increasing nutrient levels and turning parts of the lake green \u2013 so called \"algal blooming.\"",
      "The BBC has regularly reported on discharges into Windermere. Last October it was revealed that a single pumping station had illegally spilled more than 140 million litres of raw sewage between 2020 and 2023. In 2023 BBC Panorama said United Utilities was misreporting pollution incidents.",
      "Earlier in March environment secretary Steve Reed called the amount of pollution entering the lake \"a disgrace\" and pledged to clean it up.",
      "Last week the Environment Agency said United Utilities had spilled 77,817 times in 2024, the highest figure of all England's water companies.",
      "Many of the spills will have been legal. All water companies are legally allowed to discharge raw sewage to stop the network getting overwhelmed and this now happens regularly during periods of heavy rain.",
      "But almost all pumping stations and treatment plants operate under an environmental permit which specify that they must process or \"pass forward\" a certain amount of sewage and rainwater before spilling starts.",
      "The campaigners cross-referenced United Utilities datasets showing when an asset was spilling against how much sewage it was treating at the time. The campaigners' analysis \u2013 which has been shared with and scrutinised by the BBC -  found days when illegal spills appear to have occurred at each of six sewage facilities around the lake, which combined to 140 days in 2024. That's more than in any of the previous three years, as the chart below shows.",
      "The longest illegal spill the analysis identified was for 10 days from Hawkshead pumping station, which flows into Windermere via Cunsey Beck.",
      "\"This is an indication that their works have not been maintained properly or they're not being watched over properly,\" says Prof Peter Hammond, a mathematican and retired academic from campaign group Windrush Against Sewage Pollution.",
      "Prof Hammond's analysis of water company data has been cited by regulators and he has been praised in Parliament by water company executives for bringing problems to light they were previously unaware of.",
      "The latest analysis covers four years of data from six sites that discharge sewage into the Lake Windermere catchment.",
      "Comparisons over a longer time period are impossible as United Utilities has only had made full data sets available since 2021.",
      "The regulators Ofwat and the Environment Agency have since 2021 been investigating whether the water companies have been treating enough sewage before they start to spill. The EA call it a \"major criminal investigation\" while Ofwat call it \"the largest and most complex Ofwat has ever undertaken\".",
      "Last week Yorkshire Water agreed to a \u00a340m \"enforcement action\" after Ofwat uncovered \"serious failures\" in how it operated its treatment plant and network.",
      "Ofwat declined to comment on the campaigner's findings as their investigation into United Utilities is ongoing.",
      "In response to concerns about United Utilities the Environment Agency last year reviewed all of its environmental permits in the Windermere catchment and says this led directly to the water company tripling its investment plans for the area to \u00a3200m.",
      "\"We are currently carrying out investigations into suspected pollution incidents on the Windermere catchment and are unable to comment on these in detail until they have reached a conclusion,\" an EA spokesperson said when the campaigners' analysis was shared with them.",
      "\"Where we find breaches of environmental permits, we will take the appropriate enforcement action up to and including a criminal prosecution.\"",
      "United Utilities, which provides services to more than seven million people across north-west England, is more than \u00a39bn in debt. Its chief executive Louise Beardmore confirmed to parliament in February that she was last year paid \u00a31.4m including a bonus of \u00a3420,000.",
      "\"The methodology used by the campaigners is different to that used by the Environment Agency for its compliance assessments,\" the water company said in a statement.",
      "\"On top of that, erroneous data has been used, tags and naming conventions in data sets appear to have been misunderstood, and assumptions seem to have been made on whether different types of flow meters have been installed.\"",
      "\"The methodology fails to use other corroborating information from the sites which would prove that spills did not occur. As a result, the numbers quoted are inaccurate.\"",
      "BBC News presented United Utilities with five examples of illegal spills the campaigners' analysis had identified using the company's data and asked for any evidence or explanation as to why they were not illegal. United Utilities repeatedly declined to do so in writing or on camera.",
      "\"What we're seeing is the failure of privatisation. We're seeing a prioritisation of dividend returns over the long-term environmental protection of places like Windermere\" says Matt Staniek from Save Windermere.",
      "\"The bill payer has paid for a service that has never fully been provided, and the illegality demonstrates that for all to see.\"",
      "Over the next five years bills in the United Utilities area will go up by 32% above the rate of inflation. On average that will mean a rise of \u00a386 for the year that starts in April.",
      "Louise Beardmore said the rises will fund the \"largest investment in water and wastewater infrastructure in over 100 years\".",
      "For Windermere that's set to mean nine wastewater treatment works, including two that were included in the campaigners' analysis being upgraded and a reduction in the number of overflows discharging into the lake."

      "Gothenburg, Sweden's second city, is highlighting its environmental credentials by continuing to put its money on the line.",
      "Back in 2022, the City of Gothenburg, became what is believed to be the first local government in the world to take out a \"sustainability linked loan\" or SLL.",
      "This is a form of financing pegged to a set of annual environmental and social improvements agreed between a borrower and its banks.",
      "Gothenburg's four target areas are efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city's heat production, making the council's own vehicle fleet electric, reducing energy usage in municipality-owned buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and improving the city's poorest neighbourhoods.",
      "Meet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and, for each, Gothenburg gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of 0.1% or around 100,000 kronor ($10,500; \u00a38,000). But miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount.",
      "In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.",
      "However, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.",
      "Fredrik Block, portfolio manager at the City of Gothenburg, says that the local authority deliberately set \"ambitious\" targets.",
      "\"You aim high, and you get the whole organisation to strive towards that target. We are not proceeding as fast as we expected, but we are taking one step at a time. The goal is still to be close to carbon-free by 2030.",
      "\"We're actually not doing it for the money. We're doing it to show the city's important work and that we are making progress every year. We want to show to the world how it is - that these are the problems, and these are the good things.\"",
      "The improvements to the city's poorest areas \u2013 and whether the council has hit its targets - are measured by yearly resident surveys. People are asked about their feelings towards an area's safety and cleanliness.",
      "Key initiatives have included making housing more secure, introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like Hjallbo and Biskopsgarden. Located in the north of the city, they have high levels of crime and unemployment, and large immigrant populations.",
      "Public housing agency Framtiden, which is ultimately owned by the City of Gothenburg, says it takes the improvement work very seriously.",
      "\"For some of these vulnerable areas, we actually own the majority of the housing,\" says its research and development manager, Lars Bankvall.",
      "\"We are more or less the only official body in these areas. There's no one else there, only us.",
      "\"I see us as maybe the most powerful tool that the city has, because we have a lot of financial resources. We are involved in everything.\"",
      "But Faduma Awil, a social worker who now provides career coaching at an employment centre in Gothenburg, is concerned that increased cameras and police presence sends the wrong message to youth in Gothenburg's deprived areas - and could see racial profiling increase.",
      "\"What will our children think when they see cameras everywhere in Hjallbo, but none in a Swedish neighbourhood? How will they feel when they are constantly being watched by police?\" she says.",
      "\"What will you tell them? You are showing them there is a difference between them and native Swedes.\"",
      "Ms Awil is also not convinced the resident surveys are effective or accurate. And she feels the city is placing a disproportionate amount of effort into its environmental goals, at the expense of improving conditions in underprivileged areas.",
      "\"People in these areas don't care about the environment. They need to go to school. They need to work. They need to eat,\" says Ms Awil, who migrated from Somalia to Sweden in 1987 as a child.",
      "Negotiating an SLL is a rigorous, complex process - one that took the City of Gothenburg a year to do, with no fewer than six major Nordic banks involved.",
      "Such is the difficulty of acquiring an SLL that the number issued globally fell by 56% in 2023, according to data from financial news provider Bloomberg.",
      "Mats Olausson is senior sustainability advisor at Swedish bank SEB, which is the lead lender of Gothenburg's SLL.",
      "He says SEB has turned down potential SLL borrowers as the client's proposed targets weren't ambitious enough. Yet he adds that SLLs are challenging for companies or local authorities that successfully get one.",
      "\"It's sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an SLL, and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative,\" he says. \"You run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not done a good enough job.",
      "\"It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy.\"",
      "One company that is happy with its SLL is Danish management consultancy Emagine. It borrowed \u00a310m in 2021, funds that helped it to acquire six other firms around the world.",
      "Its binding goals include increasing the number of female leaders in the organisation by 16%, and reducing overall employee turnover by 6% over the seven-year long period. It is doing this through leadership and mentoring programs.",
      "By meeting the targets, Emagine is benefiting from reduced interest rates, says Lars Bloch, the company's chief financial officer.",

    "summary": "Just Stop Oil says it will disband but does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?",
    "story": [
      "The climate action group Just Stop Oil has announced it is to disband at the end of April. Its activists have been derided as attention-seeking zealots and vandals and it is loathed by many for its disruptive direct action tactics. It says it has won because its demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy.  So, did they really win and does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?",
      "Hayley Walsh's heart was racing as she sat in the audience at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane on 27 January this year.",
      "The 42 year-old lecturer and mother of three tried to calm her breathing. Hollywood star Sigourney Weaver was onstage in her West End debut production of Shakespeare's The Tempest.",
      "But Hayley, a Just Stop Oil activist, had her own drama planned.",
      "As Weaver's Prospero declaimed \"Come forth, I say,\" Hayley sprang from her seat and rushed the stage with Richard Weir, a 60-year-old mechanical engineer from Tyneside.",
      "They launched a confetti cannon and unfurled a banner that read \"Over 1.5 Degrees is a Global Shipwreck\" - a reference to the news that 2024 was the first year to pass the symbolic 1.5C threshold in global average temperature rise, and a nod to the shipwreck theme in the play.",
      "It was a classic Just Stop Oil (JSO) action. The target was high profile and would guarantee publicity. The message was simple and presented in the group's signature fluorescent orange.",
      "The reaction of those affected was also a classic response to JSO.  Amid the boos and whistles you can hear a shout of \"idiots\".",
      "\"Drag them off the stage\", one audience member can be heard shouting, \"I hope you [expletive] get arrested,\" another says.",
      "JSO is a UK-based environmental activist group that aims to end fossil fuel extraction and uses direct action to draw attention to its cause. It has been called a \"criminal cult\" and its activists branded \"eco-loons\" by the Sun. The Daily Mail has described it as \"deranged\" and says its members have \"unleashed misery on thousands of ordinary people though their selfish antics\".",
      "The group has thrown soup at a Van Gogh in the National Gallery, exploded a chalk dust bomb during the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, smashed a cabinet containing a copy of the Magna Carta at the British Library, sprayed temporary paint on the stones of Stonehenge and even defaced Charles Darwin's grave.",
      "But it is the group's road protests that have probably caused the most disruption \u2013 and public anger. In November 2022, 45 JSO members climbed gantries around the M25 severely disrupting traffic for over four days. People missed flights, medical appointments and exams as thousands of drivers were delayed for hours. The cost to the Metropolitan Police was put at \u00a31.1 million.",
      "Just Stop Oil was born out of Extinction Rebellion (XR).  XR \u2013 founded in 2018 - brought thousands of people onto the streets in what were dubbed \"festivals of resistance\".  They came to a peak in April 2019, when protestors brought parts of the capital to a halt for more than a week and plonked a large pink boat in the middle of Oxford Circus.",
      "The spectacle and disruption XR caused generated massive media attention, but the police were furious.  Hundreds of officers were diverted from frontline duties and by the end of 2019 the bill for policing the protests had reached \u00a337m.",
      "And behind the scenes XR was riven by furious debates about tactics.  Many inside the movement said it should be less confrontational and disruptive but a hard core of activists argued it would be more effective to double down on direct action.",
      "It became clear that there was room for what Sarah Lunnon, one of the co-founders of Just Stop Oil, calls \"a more radical flank\".  They decided a new, more focused operation was needed, modelled on earlier civil disobedience movements like the Suffragettes, Gandhi's civil disobedience campaigns and the civil rights movement in the US.",
      "The group was formally launched on Valentine's Day, 2022. It was a very different animal to XR. Instead of thousands of people taking part in street carnivals, JSO's actions involved a few committed activists. A small strategy group oversaw the campaign and meticulously planned its activities. A mobilisation team worked to recruit new members, and another team focused on supporting activists after they were arrested.",
      "The dozens of actions the group has carried out generated lots of publicity, but also massive public opposition. There were confrontations between members of the public and protestors and an outcry from politicians across all the main political parties.",
      "The police said they needed more powers to deal with this new form of protest and they got them. New offences were created including interfering with national infrastructure, \"locking on\" \u2013 chaining or gluing yourself to something \u2013 and tunnelling underground. Causing a public nuisance also became a potential crime \u2013 providing the police with a powerful new tool to use against protestors who block roads.",
      "In the four years since it was formed dozens of the group's supporters have been jailed. Five activists were handed multi-year sentences for their role in the M25 actions in 2022. Those were reduced on appeal earlier this month but are still the longest jail terms for non-violent civil disobedience ever issued.",
      "Senior JSO members deny the crackdown had anything to do with the group's decision to \"hang up the hi-vis\" \u2013 as its statement this week announcing the end of campaign put it.",
      "JSO's public position is that it has won its battle. \"Just Stop Oil's initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history,\" the group claimed.",
      "The government has said it does not plan to issue any new licences for oil and gas production but strongly denies its policies have a link to JSO. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's official spokesperson told journalists: \"We have been very clear when it comes to oil and gas that it has a future for decades to come in our energy mix.\"",
      "And the group's wider goal \u2013 to end the production of oil and gas \u2013 has manifestly not been achieved. The members of the group I spoke to for this article all agree the climate crisis has deepened.",
      "In the face of stiffer sentences, some climate campaigners have said they will turn to more clandestine activities. One new group says it plans a campaign of sabotage against key infrastructure. In a manifesto published online it says it plans to \"kickstart a new phase of the climate activist movement, aiming to shut down key actors of the fossil fuel economy.\"",
      "That's not a direction the JSO members I spoke to said they wanted to go. Sarah Lunnon said a key principle of JSO and the civil disobedience movement generally was that activists would take responsibility for their actions. One of the first questions new joiners were asked is whether they would be willing to be locked up.",
      "\"As corporations and billionaires corrupt political systems across the world, we need a different approach.",
      "\"We are creating a new strategy, to face this reality and to carry our responsibilities at this time,\" the group says, suggesting they may be planning to form a new movement.",
      "JSO's most high-profile figure, Roger Hallam, is one of the five activists convicted for their role in the M25 protests. In a message from his prison cell he acknowledged that JSO has only had a \"marginal impact\".",
      "That is \"not due to lack of trying,\" he said. The failure lay with the UK's \"elites and our leaders\" who had walked away from their responsibility to tackle the climate crisis, Hallam claimed. A hint perhaps that the group's new focus might be on the political system itself.",
      "JSO has said its last protest \u2013 to be held at the end of April \u2013 will mark \"the end of soup on Van Goghs, cornstarch on Stonehenge and slow marching in the streets\". But don't believe it. When pressed, the JSO members I spoke to said they may well turn back to disruptive tactics but under a new name and with a new and as yet unspecified objective.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 12:13:45 GMT",
    "summary": "Sewage spilled into England's waterways for a record number of hours last year, the Environmental Agency says.",
    "story": [
      "Water companies released raw sewage into England's rivers and seas for a record 3.61 million hours last year, a slight increase on 2023.",
      "The data released by Environment Agency on Thursday showed that although the number of spills was down each spill lasted longer on average - resulting in a higher total number of hours.",
      "Some spilling can be legal, but concern has been mounting amongst scientists about the harm that regular sewage spilling is causing the country's aquatic life.",
      "Water UK, the industry body, said sewage spills are a \"disgrace\" but has committed to a programme of investment worth \u00a3104bn over the next five years.",
      "How much sewage is spilled near you?",
      "Water company makes case for higher bill increases",
      "\"These figures are disgraceful and are a stark reminder of how years of underinvestment have led to water companies discharging unacceptable levels of sewage into our rivers, lakes, and seas,\" said Environment Secretary Steve Reed.",
      "His views were echoed by Water UK Chief Executive David Henderson: \"Any sewage flowing into waterways is a disgrace. Unfortunately, it's a system fault that we have in our network which mixes rainwater and wastewater. Nobody wants to see any spill of sewage in our waterways.\"",
      "England, like much of the world, has a combined sewage system meaning that rainwater and sewage share the same pipes. In some instances, when there is too much rain, treatment works can be overwhelmed, and sewage is spilled via overflow points into the country's rivers, lakes and seas to prevent a back up to the system.",
      "This practice is legal. But previous investigations by the BBC and Environment Agency have revealed that sewage has also been spilled by water companies under dry conditions in breach of their permits.",
      "Water companies collectively oversee more than 15,000 of these overflow sites and this was the first year where all sites were monitored, revealing for the first time the extent of spilling.",
      "Sewage was spilt for 3.614 million hours in 2024 compared to 3.606 million hours in 2023.",
      "CEO of River Action, James Wallace, said: \"A year on from last year's catastrophic pollution figures, the true scale of the UK's water crisis is only now coming to light. The figures have barely budged, testament to the deepening sewage scandal.\"",
      "In 2022, Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical office for the UK, outlined the serious health risks sewage spills can pose for those using the country's waterways. Chief amongst them is bacteria from human faeces which he said can \"increase the risk of significant infections including antibiotic resistant bacteria\".",
      "Sewage also poses significant environmental risks \u2013 it increases nutrients in the water leading to algal blooms which then eventually denies other wildlife \u2013 like fish - oxygen. These spills also have been shown to introduce microplastics, drugs and sanitary products into rivers and seas.",
      "The River Ver in St Albans is one such location - the banks are littered with condoms, tampon applicators and wet wipes likely from sewage releases from nearby Markyate sewage treatment works owned by Thames Water. This rare chalk stream \u2013 one of around 200 worldwide \u2013 which supports important wildlife like water voles, saw more than 3,300 hours of spills in 2024.",
      "Of the spills a Thames Water spokesperson said: \"The Markyate area experienced one of the wettest years on record in 2024 which has caused excessive amounts of groundwater which has infiltrated into the network. This has resulted in the system being overwhelmed which has led to discharges into the river.\"",
      "Liberal Democrats Leader Ed Davey said the scale of spilling showed that the sector regulator, Ofwat, was not up to the task.",
      "\"This has to be the final nail in the coffin for Ofwat, a regulator that has time and again proven it is completely inadequate to protect customers and our beautiful environment,\" he said.",
      "In October, the government launched an Independent Water Commission, chaired by former deputy Bank of England governor Sir Jon Cunliffe, to look into the sector - including the effectiveness of Ofwat.",
      "An Ofwat spokesperson said: \"Where companies miss their targets, they will be penalised and money will be returned to customers. In parallel, companies will be held to account for past failures through our ongoing enforcement work into the operation and maintenance of sewage works and networks.\"",
      "The Markyate site is one of a number across the country that is due an upgrade as part of a five-year \u00a3104bn investment programme by water companies \u2013 with \u00a324bn going specifically to improving infrastructure.",
      "These upgrades will be paid largely through bill rises \u2013 which are due to take effect from 1 April \u2013 and will see the average annual bill hit \u00a3603. This has angered consumer groups and environmental charities who argue that the burden of upgrades should be carried by shareholders not households.",
      "Prof Ewan McGaughey, Professor of Law at Kings College London, said: \"The water companies have paid over \u00a385bn out to shareholders since privatisation and that means they haven't been able to put the money into infrastructure.\"",
      "Ofwat and the industry have previously denied the figure\u2013 which comes from University of Greenwich research \u2013 is as high, but there is agreement that significant investment is required.",
      "Phillip Clisham, specialist adviser to the Institution of Civil Engineers on water and sanitation, has worked in the industry for more than three decades, and said the challenge of fixing the issue has been \"underestimated\".",
      "He said the two main solutions are building bigger storm tanks \u2013 which produce a huge amount of planet warming emissions in their construction \u2013 or to reduce excess rainwater by increasing green areas and the use of sustainable urban drainage systems.",
      "What are sustainable urban drainage systems?",
      "What are sustainable urban drainage systems?",
      "It is this second solution that is preferable for the environment, he said, but it requires coordination between government, planning officers and housing developers \u2013 and takes longer to implement.",

      "\"Should we have problems with water supply then what's going to happen to those plans for restoration that we've all been working on for the past three years?\"",
      "News broke of the difficulties facing the canal in a letter sent to local businesses by Gland\u0175r Cymru, the Canal and River Trust in Wales, in February.",
      "It explained the canal, which once transported iron and coal to Newport docks, had relied on funnelling water from the River Usk and its tributaries which accounted for 80-90% of its water supply.",
      "Recent changes in legislation, designed in part to protect rivers in the face of climate change, means licences are now required, restricting the amount of water that can be taken.",
      "Last year, Gland\u0175r Cymru lost an appeal against some of the conditions stipulated by environmental regulator Natural Resources Wales (NRW).",
      "The River Usk is a designated special area of conservation protected by law due to its importance for rare wildlife including the Atlantic salmon, which is threatened with extinction from Wales.",
      "\"The canal took around 30% of the total flow of the river in 2022 - which was the last dry year period,\" said Gail Davies-Walsh, chief executive of Afonydd Cymru which represents river groups across Wales.",
      "Limits on abstraction were needed to ensure the species and habitats had sufficient water to survive \"particularly during dry summers and low flow periods,\" she said.",
      "Mark Evans, director of Gland\u0175r Cymru, said the trust accepted it could no longer continue to abstract water from the Usk at the same level as it had in the past.",
      "But recent dry weather highlighted the urgency of finding an alternative supply, he said.",
      "\"The amount of water we can take is starting to really concern us,\" he explained.",
      "\"It's urgent today, looking at the forecast for the next week.",
      "\"At some point we'll have to stop the boats from using the locks,\" he warned, adding that both the canal's users and its wildlife would be impacted as levels fell.",
      "Discussions have been taking place in recent weeks with Welsh Water over whether it could help to support the canal during periods of prolonged dry weather.",
      "But this would come with \"financial implications\" and the potential of having to pay commercial rates for the water, resulting in a considerable bill the charity could not afford, he claimed.",
      "Alasdair Kirkpatrick, owner of Beacon Park Boats, said he had already received phone calls from customers who had booked boat trips asking about the impact on them.",
      "\"I never saw this one coming,\" he said, \"it has really shocked us all.\"",
      "\"All my customers nip down to the local pubs and restaurants, 25% of them fly in from overseas from places like America and Australia, using local taxis and train services and spending a fortune locally,\" he added.",
      "He urged the Welsh government \"to fund Welsh Water to continue to maintain water levels and keep all the operators of this canal in business - it cannot be lost\".",
      "Gavin Bown from Natural Resources Wales said regulating water abstraction was \"a complex, evidence-based process that carefully balances environmental needs with those of local communities\".",
      "\"Our priority is to protect the integrity of the River Usk and the Severn Estuary, both designated as special areas of conservation,\" he explained, adding the regulator would continue to work collaboratively with the Canal and River Trust.",

      "The Melsonby Hoard was discovered in a field near Melsonby, North Yorkshire, by metal detectorist Peter Heads and excavated with the help of Durham University.",
      "It includes more than 800 items, including two cauldrons or vessels, horse harness, bridle bits, ceremonial spears and 28 iron tyres, believed to have been buried about 2,000 years ago.",
      "Historians believe the \"unprecedented\" find could lead to a \"major re-evaluation\" of the wealth and status of the elite living in northern Britain at the time.",
      "After the initial discovery was reported to the authorities in December 2021, the site was excavated in 2022, with the support of the British Museum and a \u00a3120,000 grant from Historic England.",
      "Early analysis of the hoard, released on Tuesday, suggests a lot of the items had been purposefully burnt or broken before being buried as a show of power and wealth.",
      "Tom Moore, head of the department of archaeology at Durham University, said the size and scale of the find was \"exceptional for Britain and probably even Europe\".",
      "He said the hoard showed there was more wealth in the north of England at the time than previously thought.",
      "\"Whoever originally owned the material in this hoard was probably a part of a network of elites across Britain, into Europe and even the Roman world,\" he said.",
      "\"The destruction of so many high-status objects, evident in this hoard, is also of a scale rarely seen in Iron Age Britain and demonstrates that the elites of northern Britain were just as powerful as their southern counterparts.\"",
      "It is thought the objects may have been burnt on a funerary pyre before being buried, though no human remains were found.",
      "Analysis: Danny Savage, BBC News",
      "In the archaeology labs at Durham University there's a real buzz about the unveiling of the Melsonby Hoard. Curators feel this is the discovery of a lifetime.",
      "Hundreds of recovered artefacts are spread out in a climate controlled room on long tables.",
      "You have to use your imagination a bit, Iron Age artefacts from 2,000 years ago have rusted or faded and are far from their original glory.  Some of them were decorated with coral which has bleached over the centuries.",
      "But it's the story they tell that's extraordinary.",
      "Iron Age experts now have evidence that people 2,000 years ago had four wheel wagons as well as two wheel chariots.",
      "They now have proof that Iron Age residents of northern England had trading connections with the continent and the growing Roman Empire.",
      "This will keep experts busy for years.",
      "There's also a bit of secrecy too. The exact location of the discovery is not being revealed over concern that rogue treasure hunters will turn up at night and start looking for other artefacts.",
      "History is valuable - to different people in different ways.",
      "Among the items uncovered were the partial remains of more than seven four-wheeled wagons and/or two-wheeled chariots, including elaborate harnesses for at least 14 ponies, some which were adorned with red, Mediterranean coral and coloured glass, and 28 iron tyres from horse-drawn vehicles, some of which had been intentionally bent out of shape.",
      "They also found three ceremonial spears and two ornate cauldrons or vessels, one that was decorated in both Mediterranean and Iron Age styles and probably used as a wine mixing bowl.",
      "Some of the objects found were most closely related to others found in continental Europe, suggesting people shared technologies over this distance.",
      "The objects were identified using scanning technology at the University of Southampton, which helped the archaeologists figure out how to excavate the objects without causing damage.",
      "Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: \"This is one of the most important and exciting Iron Age period discoveries made in the UK.",
      "\"It sheds new light on Iron Age life in the north and Britain, but it also demonstrates connections with Europe.\"",
      "The Yorkshire Museum has launched a fundraising campaign to secure the hoard for its collections.",
      "Andrew Woods, senior curator at the museum said: \"This Iron Age hoard is an unprecedented find in the north, which will help us to understand more about this remarkable period in our history.",
      "\"We have the exciting opportunity to save the hoard for the nation and the people of Yorkshire.",
      "\"By acquiring the hoard, we will be able to make it accessible to everyone and, working in partnership with others, we can learn more about this fascinating period, why the hoard was buried, how the objects may have been used and to cast light on to whom it may have belonged.\"",

    "summary": "Gothenburg has to pay a financial penalty if it misses certain annual sustainability goals.",
    "story": [
      "Gothenburg, Sweden's second city, is highlighting its environmental credentials by continuing to put its money on the line.",
      "Back in 2022, the City of Gothenburg, became what is believed to be the first local government in the world to take out a \"sustainability linked loan\" or SLL.",
      "This is a form of financing pegged to a set of annual environmental and social improvements agreed between a borrower and its banks.",
      "Gothenburg's four target areas are efforts to make renewable energy the sole source of the city's heat production, making the council's own vehicle fleet electric, reducing energy usage in municipality-owned buildings, such as hospitals and schools, and improving the city's poorest neighbourhoods.",
      "Meet agreed annual improvement levels in these sectors and, for each, Gothenburg gets a discount on the yearly fee it pays for the loan of 0.1% or around 100,000 kronor ($10,500; \u00a38,000). But miss one of the targets by a certain amount and it has to pay a fine of the same amount.",
      "In 2022 and 2023 Gothenburg managed to avoid a financial penalty, but the newly released figures for 2024 show that it missed its target for switching to renewable energy. And so it is about to be fined 150,000 kroner.",
      "However, this is offset by the discounts it is getting for continuing to hit improvement levels for energy usage and social improvement. For electrifying the council's vehicles, while it missed its improvement goal, it didn't do so by enough to be fined.",
      "Fredrik Block, portfolio manager at the City of Gothenburg, says that the local authority deliberately set \"ambitious\" targets.",
      "\"You aim high, and you get the whole organisation to strive towards that target. We are not proceeding as fast as we expected, but we are taking one step at a time. The goal is still to be close to carbon-free by 2030.",
      "\"We're actually not doing it for the money. We're doing it to show the city's important work and that we are making progress every year. We want to show to the world how it is - that these are the problems, and these are the good things.\"",
      "The improvements to the city's poorest areas \u2013 and whether the council has hit its targets - are measured by yearly resident surveys. People are asked about their feelings towards an area's safety and cleanliness.",
      "Key initiatives have included making housing more secure, introducing more surveillance cameras and increasing police presence as a crime prevention measure in areas of the city like Hjallbo and Biskopsgarden. Located in the north of the city, they have high levels of crime and unemployment, and large immigrant populations.",
      "Public housing agency Framtiden, which is ultimately owned by the City of Gothenburg, says it takes the improvement work very seriously.",
      "\"For some of these vulnerable areas, we actually own the majority of the housing,\" says its research and development manager, Lars Bankvall.",
      "\"We are more or less the only official body in these areas. There's no one else there, only us.",
      "\"I see us as maybe the most powerful tool that the city has, because we have a lot of financial resources. We are involved in everything.\"",
      "But Faduma Awil, a social worker who now provides career coaching at an employment centre in Gothenburg, is concerned that increased cameras and police presence sends the wrong message to youth in Gothenburg's deprived areas - and could see racial profiling increase.",
      "\"What will our children think when they see cameras everywhere in Hjallbo, but none in a Swedish neighbourhood? How will they feel when they are constantly being watched by police?\" she says.",
      "\"What will you tell them? You are showing them there is a difference between them and native Swedes.\"",
      "Ms Awil is also not convinced the resident surveys are effective or accurate. And she feels the city is placing a disproportionate amount of effort into its environmental goals, at the expense of improving conditions in underprivileged areas.",
      "\"People in these areas don't care about the environment. They need to go to school. They need to work. They need to eat,\" says Ms Awil, who migrated from Somalia to Sweden in 1987 as a child.",
      "Negotiating an SLL is a rigorous, complex process - one that took the City of Gothenburg a year to do, with no fewer than six major Nordic banks involved.",
      "Such is the difficulty of acquiring an SLL that the number issued globally fell by 56% in 2023, according to data from financial news provider Bloomberg.",
      "Mats Olausson is senior sustainability advisor at Swedish bank SEB, which is the lead lender of Gothenburg's SLL.",
      "He says SEB has turned down potential SLL borrowers as the client's proposed targets weren't ambitious enough. Yet he adds that SLLs are challenging for companies or local authorities that successfully get one.",
      "\"It's sad if a company puts a lot of resources into designing an SLL, and then it turns out that the only publicity they get is negative,\" he says. \"You run the risk of being pulled into the dirt for having not done a good enough job.",
      "\"It's in no one's interest to have targets that are overly ambitious and basically impossible to achieve, or for companies who don't have the right governance in place to implement the actions that will be the building blocks of the actual strategy.\"",
      "One company that is happy with its SLL is Danish management consultancy Emagine. It borrowed \u00a310m in 2021, funds that helped it to acquire six other firms around the world.",
      "Its binding goals include increasing the number of female leaders in the organisation by 16%, and reducing overall employee turnover by 6% over the seven-year long period. It is doing this through leadership and mentoring programs.",
      "By meeting the targets, Emagine is benefiting from reduced interest rates, says Lars Bloch, the company's chief financial officer.",
      "\"If we didn't meet the goals, we would be landed with interest penalty rates. We also accept that failing to meet sustainability targets could harm the firm's reputation, as we have made a public commitment.",
      "\"It shouldn't be about committing to the loan to get a discount on financing - there needs to be ambition behind the goals.\"",
      "Back in Gothenburg, the city's current environmental and social targets run until 2030. Mr Block says that the detailed yearly SLL reporting shows to potential future investors in the city what a difference their money would make.",
      "\"Banks want to give money to sustainable cities, so packaging up our progress in our SLL reporting is how I make the city beautiful for investors,\" he says.",
      "\"I can't change the credit worthiness of the city, but I can change how investors look at our sustainability work, and make it more attractive to them.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 29 Mar 2025 10:56:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Just Stop Oil says it will disband but does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?",
    "story": [
      "The climate action group Just Stop Oil has announced it is to disband at the end of April. Its activists have been derided as attention-seeking zealots and vandals and it is loathed by many for its disruptive direct action tactics. It says it has won because its demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy.  So, did they really win and does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?",
      "Hayley Walsh's heart was racing as she sat in the audience at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane on 27 January this year.",
      "The 42 year-old lecturer and mother of three tried to calm her breathing. Hollywood star Sigourney Weaver was onstage in her West End debut production of Shakespeare's The Tempest.",
      "But Hayley, a Just Stop Oil activist, had her own drama planned.",
      "As Weaver's Prospero declaimed \"Come forth, I say,\" Hayley sprang from her seat and rushed the stage with Richard Weir, a 60-year-old mechanical engineer from Tyneside.",
      "They launched a confetti cannon and unfurled a banner that read \"Over 1.5 Degrees is a Global Shipwreck\" - a reference to the news that 2024 was the first year to pass the symbolic 1.5C threshold in global average temperature rise, and a nod to the shipwreck theme in the play.",
      "It was a classic Just Stop Oil (JSO) action. The target was high profile and would guarantee publicity. The message was simple and presented in the group's signature fluorescent orange.",
      "The reaction of those affected was also a classic response to JSO.  Amid the boos and whistles you can hear a shout of \"idiots\".",
      "\"Drag them off the stage\", one audience member can be heard shouting, \"I hope you [expletive] get arrested,\" another says.",
      "JSO is a UK-based environmental activist group that aims to end fossil fuel extraction and uses direct action to draw attention to its cause. It has been called a \"criminal cult\" and its activists branded \"eco-loons\" by the Sun. The Daily Mail has described it as \"deranged\" and says its members have \"unleashed misery on thousands of ordinary people though their selfish antics\".",
      "The group has thrown soup at a Van Gogh in the National Gallery, exploded a chalk dust bomb during the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, smashed a cabinet containing a copy of the Magna Carta at the British Library, sprayed temporary paint on the stones of Stonehenge and even defaced Charles Darwin's grave.",
      "But it is the group's road protests that have probably caused the most disruption \u2013 and public anger. In November 2022, 45 JSO members climbed gantries around the M25 severely disrupting traffic for over four days. People missed flights, medical appointments and exams as thousands of drivers were delayed for hours. The cost to the Metropolitan Police was put at \u00a31.1 million.",
      "Just Stop Oil was born out of Extinction Rebellion (XR).  XR \u2013 founded in 2018 - brought thousands of people onto the streets in what were dubbed \"festivals of resistance\".  They came to a peak in April 2019, when protestors brought parts of the capital to a halt for more than a week and plonked a large pink boat in the middle of Oxford Circus.",
      "The spectacle and disruption XR caused generated massive media attention, but the police were furious.  Hundreds of officers were diverted from frontline duties and by the end of 2019 the bill for policing the protests had reached \u00a337m.",
      "And behind the scenes XR was riven by furious debates about tactics.  Many inside the movement said it should be less confrontational and disruptive but a hard core of activists argued it would be more effective to double down on direct action.",
      "It became clear that there was room for what Sarah Lunnon, one of the co-founders of Just Stop Oil, calls \"a more radical flank\".  They decided a new, more focused operation was needed, modelled on earlier civil disobedience movements like the Suffragettes, Gandhi's civil disobedience campaigns and the civil rights movement in the US.",
      "The group was formally launched on Valentine's Day, 2022. It was a very different animal to XR. Instead of thousands of people taking part in street carnivals, JSO's actions involved a few committed activists. A small strategy group oversaw the campaign and meticulously planned its activities. A mobilisation team worked to recruit new members, and another team focused on supporting activists after they were arrested.",
      "The dozens of actions the group has carried out generated lots of publicity, but also massive public opposition. There were confrontations between members of the public and protestors and an outcry from politicians across all the main political parties.",
      "The police said they needed more powers to deal with this new form of protest and they got them. New offences were created including interfering with national infrastructure, \"locking on\" \u2013 chaining or gluing yourself to something \u2013 and tunnelling underground. Causing a public nuisance also became a potential crime \u2013 providing the police with a powerful new tool to use against protestors who block roads.",
      "In the four years since it was formed dozens of the group's supporters have been jailed. Five activists were handed multi-year sentences for their role in the M25 actions in 2022. Those were reduced on appeal earlier this month but are still the longest jail terms for non-violent civil disobedience ever issued.",
      "Senior JSO members deny the crackdown had anything to do with the group's decision to \"hang up the hi-vis\" \u2013 as its statement this week announcing the end of campaign put it.",
      "JSO's public position is that it has won its battle. \"Just Stop Oil's initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history,\" the group claimed.",
      "The government has said it does not plan to issue any new licences for oil and gas production but strongly denies its policies have a link to JSO. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's official spokesperson told journalists: \"We have been very clear when it comes to oil and gas that it has a future for decades to come in our energy mix.\"",
      "And the group's wider goal \u2013 to end the production of oil and gas \u2013 has manifestly not been achieved. The members of the group I spoke to for this article all agree the climate crisis has deepened.",
      "In the face of stiffer sentences, some climate campaigners have said they will turn to more clandestine activities. One new group says it plans a campaign of sabotage against key infrastructure. In a manifesto published online it says it plans to \"kickstart a new phase of the climate activist movement, aiming to shut down key actors of the fossil fuel economy.\"",
      "That's not a direction the JSO members I spoke to said they wanted to go. Sarah Lunnon said a key principle of JSO and the civil disobedience movement generally was that activists would take responsibility for their actions. One of the first questions new joiners were asked is whether they would be willing to be locked up.",
      "\"As corporations and billionaires corrupt political systems across the world, we need a different approach.",
      "\"We are creating a new strategy, to face this reality and to carry our responsibilities at this time,\" the group says, suggesting they may be planning to form a new movement.",
      "JSO's most high-profile figure, Roger Hallam, is one of the five activists convicted for their role in the M25 protests. In a message from his prison cell he acknowledged that JSO has only had a \"marginal impact\".",
      "That is \"not due to lack of trying,\" he said. The failure lay with the UK's \"elites and our leaders\" who had walked away from their responsibility to tackle the climate crisis, Hallam claimed. A hint perhaps that the group's new focus might be on the political system itself.",
      "JSO has said its last protest \u2013 to be held at the end of April \u2013 will mark \"the end of soup on Van Goghs, cornstarch on Stonehenge and slow marching in the streets\". But don't believe it. When pressed, the JSO members I spoke to said they may well turn back to disruptive tactics but under a new name and with a new and as yet unspecified objective.",

      "\"We are curious to explore how to showcase our fashion in new creative ways \u2013 and embrace the benefits of new technology \u2013 while staying true to our commitment to personal style,\" said its chief creative officer J\u00f6rgen Andersson in a statement.",

      "Over the past year, Bluesky has gained tens of millions of new users, often at the expense of X.",
      "Apart from just timing, though, BlueSky's success can be largely attributed to its novel architecture, which pairs an X-like experience with a high degree of customization.",
      "Unlike centralized systems, where social media companies have complete control over content and identities, Bluesky users can choose how their feeds are moderated, and what kind of posts the algorithm recommends to them, thanks to the hundreds of options offered by both Bluesky and the community.",
      "Don't like the broader discourse on Bluesky? Jump on the \"popular with friends\" feed to see what the people you follow specifically are talking about.",
      "It will not be simple for Bluesky to scale up to the size of X and Facebook, says Andy Tattersall, an information specialist at the University of Sheffield.",
      "He ways it will have to strike a balance between \"generating revenue, keeping users safe, and moderating content, which is much easier said than done\".",
      "Celebrity-backed foundation, Free Our Feeds, hopes to do that.",
      "It's backed some notable names, including musician Brian Eno and actor Mark Ruffalo, and plans to raise $30m (\u00a323m) over the next three years to support an open social media ecosystem powered by the AT Protocol, the decentralized network powering Bluesky.",
      "\"Bluesky has created a strong foundation for shared social media infrastructure,\" says Robin Berjonone, one of Free Our Feeds' nine custodians, \"but so long as they are the primary operator of this infrastructure the risk remains that it will stop operating in the public interest\".",
      "A bigger worry for these emerging platforms, though, is the network barrier. This can be summed up with Metcalfe's Law, explains Evan Prodromou, co-author and current editor of ActivityPub, another open social media architecture, which is behind popular platforms like Meta's Threads.",
      "The law states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users. That means that bigger social networks have way more resources than smaller ones. They can use those resources to get bigger and bigger and crowd out smaller social media services.",
      "Non-profits like Free Our Feeds and the Social Web Foundation, which Mr Prodromou heads, have a strategy that they hope will help them overcome that Metcalfe's Law.",
      "They hope to replace the current situation, where users of social media hop between their favourite services.",
      "Instead Social Web Foundation is developing a platform which can offer content from all of them.",
      "Threads for example supports a protocol called ActivityPub, which makes it easier to combine services with other social media firms that use that protocol - like Mastodon for instance.",
      "Using this kind of interoperability, Mr Prodromou hopes that services like Social Web Foundation will provide the same value as giant, monolithic platforms.",
      "It's not straightforward, as not all social media firms support the same protocol, for example, BlueSky uses the AT Protocol.",
      "But there are workarounds to that problem, and Free Our Feeds and Social Web Foundation are also working on ways to aggregate sites that use different tech.",
      "\"One thing we've learnt from the past decades is that the last thing the world needs is a one-size-fits all solution for eight billion people,\" says Robin Berjon, one of Free Our Feeds' custodians.",
      "At the other end of the spectrum are those that want to carve a niche out for themselves, rather than replace the incumbents.",
      "In the last couple of years, a cottage industry of unique, new social apps has cropped.",
      "One of those is Mozi, created by Twitter co-founder Ev Williams. Mozi doesn't want you to socialise online at all.",
      "Instead it informs you when you're going to be in the same place (city or event) as someone you know and encourages you to connect with people more often in person.",
      "\"Until Mozi, no combination of apps could tell me what city my friends are in at any given time, or even what my friends locally are up to,\" says Mozi co-founder, Molly DeWolf Swenson.",
      "Mike McCue, the CEO of Flipboard, is convinced such innovation will result in a new era of social networking, where numerous new, more interesting types of social networks will emerge and offer people more choices.",
      "He hopes that Flipboard's app, Surf will help people manage a messy social media ecosystem. It allows users to browse from a centralized feed that can draw posts and content from a variety of platforms, including Threads, Bluesky, and YouTube.",
      "\"In the end,\" says Mr McCue, \"it's unlikely one service will replace the Facebook or Twitter we once knew, but instead several services will start to take our time away from these old-style single feed experiences, our behaviours will shift with these new choices and new generations will expect more.\"",

      "The far-right leader, who is ahead of all her rivals in the 2027 race, will be in court at 10:00 local time (09:00 BST) for the verdict of a party-funding trial targeting her National Rally (RN) party.",
      "At the trial's conclusion in November, the state prosecutor demanded guilty verdicts for Le Pen and 24 others accused of using EU parliamentary money to pay party salaries.",
      "But to general surprise the prosecutor also said that Le Pen's punishment should be not just a \u20ac300,000 (\u00a3250,000) fine and prison term, but also ineligibility from running for public office for five years.",
      "Crucially, he said the ineligibility should kick in straightaway \u2013 and not be suspended pending the appeal that Marine Le Pen is expected to file if convicted.",
      "'My political death'",
      "The three judges are not obliged to follow the prosecutor's recommendations.",
      "But if they do, it would mean Le Pen, who is 56, being barred from standing in a presidential election in which she is tipped as a potential winner.",
      "\"It's my political death they are after,\" she said in November.",
      "Many French commentators \u2013 and not only those who support Le Pen \u2013 have warned of grave consequences for democracy if the judiciary is seen as interfering in the choice of the country's leader.",
      "\"The justice system has the fate of Marine Le Pen in its hands\u2026 For her to be convicted for any wrong-doing is perfectly normal. But stopping her from running in the presidential [election] - that's another matter entirely,\" wrote veteran analyst Franz-Olivier Giesbert in the centre-right Le Point magazine.",
      "\"Is it not hazardous - not to say perilous - to give to judges the task of determining whether this or that candidate has the capacity to run for office?\" said Bruno Jeudi, editor of La Tribune Dimanche newspaper on Sunday.",
      "Marine Le Pen told the same newspaper: \"Personally I'm not nervous.  But I can see why people think I might be. The judges have the power of life or death over the movement.  But I don't think they will go so far as to do it.\"",
      "Various scenarios for the verdict are under scrutiny.",
      "Four ways this could go",
      "First, Le Pen could be cleared of blame in the EU parliamentary money affair. This is widely seen as unlikely.",
      "Second, the judges could convict her but make the ineligibility not automatic. In that case, she would immediately appeal and the ineligibility would not apply until after a second trial (and conceivably a third to the high court of appeal).",
      "That would leave her free to run in 2027, though with the handicap of a conviction for misuse of public money. However it is far from clear that a conviction would do her cause much damage, given the series of party funding scandals that have affected all French parties over the years.",
      "Third, the judges could follow the prosecutor and order automatic ineligibility. In this case she would appeal, and the other parts of the sentence (fine and prison) would be suspended. However she would be unable to run in 2027.",
      "Fourth, the court could give her a shorter term of automatic ineligibility - say one year - making it theoretically possible for her to run.",
      "2027 would be Marine Le Pen's fourth presidential race, and the one offering the greatest chance of victory.",
      "A poll in the right-wing newspaper JDD Sunday gave her between 34-37% of the first round vote, well ahead of any of her possible rivals.",
      "In the last two presidentials, she fell foul of the two-round system which allowed opponents of left, centre and right to rally behind a single candidate \u2013 Emmanuel Macron \u2013 to keep her from power.",
      "But years of \"detoxification\" after she eclipsed her father Jean-Marie Le Pen at the head of the party have made the anti-RN vote far less cohesive than it used to be, while victories for the far-right in other countries have helped lift the taboo of an RN government.",
      "If Le Pen is barred from running, her logical replacement would be Jordan Bardella, the 29-year-old party president who was being groomed to be her eventual prime minister.",
      "However party insiders admit there has been little internal preparation for what would be widely seen as a huge and destabilising political earthquake.",
      "One result of Le Pen being declared unable to run in 2027 could be to weaken still further the minority French government of Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou. With 120 members in the National Assembly, the RN has the power to vote with the left in a vote of no-confidence to bring the government down.",

    "summary": "The US president suggests the new import taxes he is set to announce this week will hit all countries.",
    "story": [
      "Stock markets have fallen in Asia after President Donald Trump suggested that new tariffs he is set to announce this week will hit all countries, not just those that have the biggest trade imbalances with the US.",
      "Trump made the comments as he prepares to unveil a massive slate of import taxes on Wednesday, in what he has called America's \"Liberation Day\".",
      "The measures will come on top of tariffs already imposed by Washington on aluminium, steel and vehicles, along with increased levies on all goods from China.",
      "\"You'd start with all countries,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One. \"Essentially all of the countries that we're talking about.",
      "But he said his administration would be \"far more generous\" and \"kinder\" than the countries had been to the US.",
      "With 48 hours to go before the tariffs come into force, the UK is still locked in talks with the US about an exemption.",
      "On Sunday, Downing Street said that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer had had \"productive negotiations\" with Trump in a phone call, adding that talks would \"continue at pace\".",
      "On Saturday, government sources had said that the UK would not hesitate to impose its own tariffs on the US if needed.",
      "Other jurisdictions, such as the European Union and Canada, have already said that they are preparing a range of retaliatory trade measures.",
      "Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, recently told the Fox Business channel the tariffs would focus on 10 to 15 countries that have the worst trade deficits with the US, but did not name them.",
      "Trump sees trade taxes - which in this case would be paid by the US companies importing goods -  as a way of protecting the American economy from unfair competition and as a bargaining chip for getting better trading terms.",
      "Concerns about a trade war are unsettling markets and creating fears of a recession in the US.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "On Monday, Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark share index closed more than 4% lower, the Kospi in South Korea ended the day down 3% and the ASX 200 in Australia fell 1.7%.",
      "In the UK, the FTSE 100 index opened about 0.9% lower, while Germany's Dax index and France's Cac 40 were both down 1%.",
      "Over the weekend Trump's advisers echoed his view that the planned tariffs could raise trillions of dollars and help create jobs in the US.",
      "His top trade adviser, Pete Navarro, pointed to huge revenues he said the tariffs would raise.",
      "The tax on all car imports could raise $100bn (\u00a377.3bn) a year, Mr Navarro said. All the planned tariffs could raise $600bn annually, about a fifth of the value of total goods imports into the US, he added.",
      "A White House fact sheet published last week suggested a 10% tariff on every import could create nearly three million US jobs.",
      "However, there are concerns that tariffs could fuel inflation - something Trump pledged to reduce during his presidential campaign - if companies choose to pass on the higher cost of importing goods to their customers.",
      "If companies absorb the cost, if could hit profit which in turn could affect investment.",
      "'Counter-productive'",
      "Will Butler-Adams, chief executive of Brompton Bicycle, which makes folding bikes, said US tariffs were creating uncertainty.",
      "While, at the moment, Brompton's products are not facing additional taxes, he said the people interpreting the tariffs are trying to establish how much steel in products might have come from outside the US, which might therefore lead to tariffs.",
      "\"The reality is we don't [know] actually and the people who are on the borders importing goods into the US don't actually entirely understand how some of these tariffs might be put in,\" Mr Butler-Adams said.",
      "About 10% of Brompton's sales come from the US, where it has grown from a staff of four to 40 people and has shops in New York and Washington.",
      "But Mr Butler-Adams said tariffs might prove to be \"counter-productive\".",
      "\"Ironically, if he puts taxes on, it is going to make our product less competitive,\" he said.",
      "\"We won't continue to invest in the same way that we are now. We may even shrink, in the extreme we might pull out.\"",
      "TikTok sale",
      "Separately, Trump said a deal with TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance to sell the  app would be agreed before a deadline on Saturday.",
      "He set the 5 April deadline in January for the short video platform to find a non-Chinese buyer or face a ban in the US on national security grounds.",
      "It had been due to take effect that month to comply with a law passed under the Biden administration."

      "Speaking at a rally Sunday night, Musk said \"we just want judges to be judges\", before handing out two $1m (\u00a3750,000) cheques to voters who had signed a petition to stop \"activist\" judges.",
      "Kaul had tried to argue the giveaway was an illegal attempt buy votes. Musk's lawyers, in response, argued that Kaul is \"restraining Mr Musk's political speech and curtailing his First Amendment rights\".",
      "Musk's lawyers added that the payments were \"intended to generate a grassroots movement in opposition to activist judges, not to expressly advocate for or against any candidate\".",
      "After two lower courts sided with Musk, Kaul begged the state's supreme court for an 11th hour reprieve. But the top court unanimously declined to hear the case.",
      "Musk and President Donald Trump have endorsed a conservative candidate, Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel, in hopes of flipping the liberal-leaning court.",
      "Judge Schimel is running against Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, who has been endorsed by the state Supreme Court's liberal justices.",
      "Lawyers for the tech titan also argued that judges who have publicly endorsed Judge Crawford in the Supreme Court race should be barred from ruling on the matter, arguing that it is a matter of bias.",
      "Wisconsin's Supreme Court race is being seen by political watchers as a referendum on Trump's second term, just months after his inauguration.",
      "It also comes ahead of consequential cases that will land before the court on abortion rights, congressional redistricting and voting rules that could affect the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "Musk himself has framed the election as a chance to stop redistricting which could give Democrats favour in Congress.",
      "He has donated $14m to Judge Schimel's campaign, as the race proves to be the most expensive judicial race in the country's history, with $81m in total spending.",
      "Despite his support, Judge Schimel appeared to distance himself from Musk in recent days, telling the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on Friday he had no plans to be at the rally.",
      "\"I have no idea what he's doing. I have no idea what this rally is,\" Judge Schimel told the newspaper.",
      "This is not the first time Musk has announced a giveaway to voters. Last year, he similarly offered a cash prize of $1m a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states if they signed a petition supporting First and Second Amendment rights.",
      "A judge in Pennsylvania later ruled that the giveaway was legal, saying prosecutors failed to prove it was an unlawful lottery."

      "A 15-year-old girl who was hit by Israeli machine gun fire while riding her bicycle was one of the many wounded children that Dr Perlmutter said he had to operate on.",
      "The Israeli government has said the renewed attacks that its military is carrying out in Gaza are aimed at forcing Hamas to release all the remaining hostages.",
      "Dr Perlmutter spoke to the BBC shortly after the end of his second trip to Gaza - the first one was around a year ago. Critical of Israel's conduct in the Strip, he has previously called for an arms embargo and said its attacks on Gaza constitute genocide, which Israel vehemently denies.",
      "This time, he worked in Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah in the centre of the territory and then in Nasser hospital in the south of Gaza.",
      "He has been working for Humanity Auxilium in Gaza as part of a wider World Health Organization (WHO) programme.",
      "He was in Nasser hospital when it was hit by an Israeli air strike, targeting Ismail Barhoum, the Hamas finance chief.",

      "Dr Perlmutter has told the BBC that Barhoum was in the hospital to receive further medical treatment. He says that as a patient in hospital, Barhoum had a right to be protected under the Geneva Convention.",
      "The human cost of the latest Israeli offensive was exemplified for Dr Perlmutter by two 15-year-olds - including the girl on the bicycle - who were brought into the operating room in each of the hospitals he was working in, a week apart.",
      "\"They were both macerated and shredded by Apache gunships,\" Dr Perlmutter says.",
      "The girl will, in his words, \"be lucky if she keeps three of her limbs\".",
      "Dr Perlmutter says that people at the scene told the ambulance crew who brought the young girl into the hospital that she was hit by gunfire from an Israeli military helicopter.",
      "He says that she had been riding her bicycle by herself and she arrived at the hospital without a backpack or anything else that might have aroused suspicion. Graphic images from the operating table show catastrophic wounds to her leg and arm.",
      "The boy was driving in a car with his grandmother after receiving warnings to evacuate from the north, Dr Perlmutter says.",
      "\"Then the car was attacked by two Apache gunships. The grandmother was shredded at the scene and died,\" he said.",
      "\"The boy came in without a foot on his right side, the vascular repair on his left side took five hours - the nerve repair on his left side failed and he had a blackened hand the next day that required amputation at the level of his elbow - his left leg will require multiple surgeries for reconstruction and he has a chest wound. He may not have survived.\"",
      "Dr Perlmutter has also provided graphic photos of the boy's wounds.",
      "In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it \"does not target uninvolved individuals.\"",
      "\"The IDF operates in accordance with international law, targeting only military objectives while taking feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians,\" it told the BBC.",
      "The statement also said that the IDF had not been provided with \"sufficient information\" to directly address the incidents that Dr Perlmutter described.",
      "\"The IDF takes action to address irregular incidents that deviate from its orders. The IDF examines such incidents and takes appropriate measures where justified,\" it said.",
      "Under such conditions, Dr Perlmutter stressed the commitment and dedication of the Palestinian medical staff - above and beyond the efforts of foreign doctors like himself.",
      "\"The stress levels on us are not even approachable to what happens even to the Palestinian medical students that work with us, whose stress levels are insane, as with the nurses and the techs in the operating room, let alone the Palestinian surgeons,\" he said.",
      "\"They all abandon their families, they volunteer and often work without pay.  They work the same hours that we do - and we get to go home in a month, which they don't. They still have to return to the squalor of their tents where there's often 50 people living in a tent built for 20 - and sharing one toilet.\"",
      "Most hospitals across Gaza are out of operation or barely managing to function. Dr Perlmutter compared the medical facilities in Gaza to where he lives in North Carolina. There are multiple trauma centres there, but they would have been overwhelmed, he says, if they had to deal with the mass influx of casualties that resulted from the first day of Israel's resumption of its war against Hamas.",
      "\"The small community hospital, Al-Aqsa, is a tenth the size of any of the facilities in my home state - maybe smaller - and it did well to manage those horrible injuries - nevertheless, because of lack of equipment, many, many of those patients died, who would certainly not have died at a better equipped hospital,\" he said.",
      "On Saturday the UN's humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher described the current situation in Gaza as dire.",
      "\"All entry points into Gaza are closed for cargo since early March. At the border, food is rotting, medicine expiring and vital medical equipment is stuck,\" he said.",
      "\"If the basic principles of humanitarian law still count, the international community must act to uphold them.\"",
      "On 2 March the Israeli government closed border crossings with Gaza and halted humanitarian aid. It said this was in response to what it called the refusal by Hamas of a new US proposal to extend the first stage of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, rather than negotiating a second phase.",
      "\"When Israel resumed its attacks, it was almost identical to when they bombed incessantly when I was here a year ago,\" Dr Perlmutter says. \"The only difference is now instead of bombing people in buildings, they were bombing people in tents.\"",
      "The Israeli army has regularly claimed that Hamas operates from areas where civilians are taking shelter. It says that it does not target civilians and takes measures to avoid civilian casualties.",
      "The International Criminal Court (ICC) last year issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant over alleged war crimes, saying it found reasonable grounds to believe that \"each bear criminal responsibility... for the war crime of intentionally directing an attack against the civilian population\".",

      "Israeli attacks have killed more than 15,000 Palestinian children in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry has reported.",
      "And since the IDF broke a ceasefire and resumed its strikes on 18 March, 921 Palestinians have been killed, the ministry said.",
      "Dr Perlmutter warns that if there are more mass casualty events in Gaza from Israeli attacks, the lack of supplies in the two hospitals he's been working in means that more Palestinians will die from wounds that could have been treated."

      "To apply for the visa, candidates must first obtain a \"Certificate of Sponsorship\" (CoS) from a UK employer who is licensed by the Home Office. It is the need for CoS documents that is being exploited by rogue relocation agents.",
      "\"The scale of exploitation under the Health and Care Work visa is significant,\" says Dora-Olivia Vicol, CEO of Work Rights Centre, a charity that helps migrants and disadvantaged people in the UK access employment justice.",

      "She says there is \"systemic risk inherent\" in the sponsorship system, because it \"puts the employer in a position of incredible power\" and has \"enabled this predatory market of middlemen to mushroom\".",
      "The BBC sent two undercover journalists to approach relocation agents working in the UK.",
      "One met Dr Kelvin Alaneme, a Nigerian doctor and founder of the agency, CareerEdu, based in Harlow, Essex.",
      "His website states his business is a \"launchpad for global opportunities catering to young Africans\", claiming to have 9,800 \"happy clients\".",
      "Believing the BBC undercover journalist was well connected in the UK care sector, Dr Alaneme tried to recruit her to become an agent for his business, saying it would be very lucrative.",
      "\"Just get me care homes. I can make you a millionaire,\" he said.",
      "As a potential business partner, our journalist was then given unprecedented insight into how immigration scams by agents like Dr Alaneme actually work. Dr Alaneme said he would pay \u00a32,000 ($2,600) for each care home vacancy she was able to procure, and offered \u00a3500 ($650) commission on top.",
      "He then said he would sell the vacancies to candidates back in Nigeria.",
      "Charging candidates for a job is illegal in the UK.",
      "\"They [the candidates] are not supposed to be paying because it's free. It should be free,\" he said, lowering his voice.",
      "\"They are paying because they know it's most likely the only way.\"",
      "The BBC began investigating him following a series of online complaints about his relocation services.",
      "Praise - from south-east Nigeria and in his mid 30s - was one of those who complained, claiming he paid Dr Alaneme more than \u00a310,000 ($13,000) for a job in the UK. He says he was told he was going to be working with a care company called Efficiency for Care, based in Clacton-on-Sea. It was only when he arrived that he realised the job didn't exist.",
      "\"If I had known there was no job, I would have not come here,\" he says. \"At least back home in Nigeria, if you go broke, I can find my sister or my parents and go and eat free food. It's not the same here. You will go hungry.\"",
      "Praise says he messaged Efficiency for Care and Dr Alaneme for months, asking when he could start working. Despite promises of assistance from Dr Alaneme, the job never materialised. Almost a year later, he found a position with another care provider willing to sponsor him to remain in the UK.",
      "Our investigation found that Efficiency for Care employed - on average - 16 people in 2022, and 152 in 2023. Yet a letter sent from the Home Office to the company dated May 2023 - and seen by the BBC - showed it had issued 1,234 Certificates of Sponsorship to foreign workers between March 2022 and May 2023.",
      "Efficiency for Care's sponsorship licence was revoked in July 2023. The care company can no longer recruit from abroad, but continues to operate.",
      "It told the BBC it strongly refutes the allegation it colluded with Dr Alaneme. It said it believed it lawfully recruited staff from Nigeria and other countries. It has challenged the Home Office's revocation of its sponsorship licence, it said, and the matter is now in court.",

      "Outside of the UK - watch on YouTube",
      "In another secretly filmed meeting, Dr Alaneme shared an even more sophisticated scam involving sponsorship documents for jobs that did not exist.",
      "He said the \"advantage\" of having a CoS that is unconnected to a job \"is that you can choose any city you want\".",
      "\"You can go to Glasgow. You can stay in London. You can live anywhere,\" he told us.",
      "This is not true. If a migrant arrives in the UK on a Health and Care Work visa and does not work in the role they have been assigned, their visa could be cancelled and they risk being deported.",
      "In the secret filming, Dr Alaneme also described how to set up a fake payroll system to mask the fact the jobs are not real.",
      "\"That [a money trail] is what the government needs to see,\" he said.",
      "Dr Alaneme told the BBC he strenuously denied services offered by CareerEdu were a scam or that it acted as a recruitment agency or provided jobs for cash. He said his company only offered legitimate services, adding that the money Praise gave him was passed on to a recruitment agent for Praise's transport, accommodation and training. He said he offered to help Praise find another employer free of charge.",
      "The BBC also carried out undercover filming with another UK-based recruitment agent, Nana Akwasi Agyemang-Prempeh, after several people told the BBC they had collectively paid tens of thousands of pounds for care worker positions for their friends and family that, it transpired, did not exist.",
      "They said some of the Certificates of Sponsorship Mr Agyemang-Prempeh gave them had turned out to be fakes - replicas of real CoS issued by care companies.",
      "We discovered Mr Agyemang-Prempeh had then begun offering CoS for UK jobs in construction - another industry that allows employers to recruit foreign workers. He was able to set up his own construction company and obtain a sponsorship licence from the Home Office.",
      "Our journalist, posing as a UK-based Ugandan businessman wanting to bring Ugandan construction workers over to join him, asked Mr Agyemang-Prempeh if this was possible.",
      "He replied it was - for the price of \u00a342,000 ($54,000) for three people.",
      "Mr Agyemang-Prempeh told us he had moved into construction because rules are being \"tightened\" in the care sector - and claimed agents were eyeing other industries.",
      "\"People are now diverting to IT,\" Mr Agyemang-Prempeh told the undercover journalist.",
      "More than 470 licences in the UK care sector were revoked by the government between July 2022 and December 2024. Those licensed sponsors were responsible for the recruitment of more than 39,000 medical professionals and care workers from October 2020.",
      "Mr Agyemang-Prempeh later asked for a downpayment for the Certificates of Sponsorship, which the BBC did not make.",
      "The Home Office has now revoked his sponsorship licence. Mr Agyemang-Prempeh's defence, when challenged by the BBC, was that he had himself been duped by other agents and did not realise he was selling fake CoS documents.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, the Home Office said it has \"robust new action against shameless employers who abuse the visa system\" and will \"ban businesses who flout UK employment laws from sponsoring overseas workers\".",
      "BBC investigations have previously uncovered similar visa scams targeting people in Kerala, India, and international students living in the UK who want to work in the care sector.",
      "In November 2024, the government announced a clampdown on \"rogue\" employers hiring workers from overseas. Additionally, from 9 April, care providers in England will be required to prioritise recruiting international care workers already in the UK before recruiting from overseas.",

      "Lifting the debt cap, allowing the military to borrow \u2013 in theory, without limit \u2013 will give it access to a \"steady line\" of funding to start to address that, General Breuer says.",

    "title": "Trump wants India to buy US corn - but here's why it probably won't",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c204q6n0lzvo",
    "published": "Sun, 30 Mar 2025 22:36:59 GMT",
    "summary": "India feeds over a billion people, yet low yields and poor infrastructure keep agriculture lagging.",
    "story": [
      "Why won't India buy even a single bushel of American corn?",
      "That's the question US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick raised recently while criticising India's trade policies, taking a swipe at its market restrictions.",
      "In another interview, Lutnick accused India of blocking US farmers and urged it to open its agricultural market - suggesting quotas or limits as a possible approach.",
      "Agriculture is a key battleground in US President Donald Trump's escalating trade war, with tit-for-tat or reciprocal tariffs set to kick in on 2 April.",
      "Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.Trump has repeatedly branded India a \"tariff king\" and a \"big abuser\" of trade ties.",
      "For years, Washington has pushed for greater access to India's farm sector, seeing it as a major untapped market. But India has fiercely protected it, citing food security, livelihoods and interests of millions of small farmers.",
      "To be sure, India's transformation from a food-deficient nation to a food-surplus powerhouse is one of its biggest success stories.",
      "In the 1950s and '60s, the country relied on food aid to feed its population, but a series of agricultural breakthroughs changed that. India became self-sufficient in staples, and became the world's largest milk producer. Rapid growth in  horticulture, poultry and aquaculture expanded its food basket.",
      "Today, India is not just feeding its 1.4 billion people but, as the world's eighth-largest agri-produce exporter, also shipping grains, fruits and dairy worldwide.",
      "Yet, despite such major gains, Indian agriculture still lags in productivity, infrastructure and market access. Global price volatility and climate change add to the challenge. Crop yields lag far behind the global best. Small landholdings worsen the problem - Indian farmers work with less than a hectare on average, while their American counterparts had over 46 hectares in 2020.",
      "No surprise then that productivity remains low, even though farming remains India's backbone, supporting over 700 million people, nearly half the country's population. Agriculture employs nearly half of India's workforce but accounts for just 15% of GDP. In comparison, less than 2% of the US population depends on farming. With limited manufacturing jobs, more people are stuck in low-paying farm work, an unusual trend for a developing country.",
      "This structural imbalance also shapes India's trade policies. Despite its farm surplus, India keeps tariffs high to shield its farmers from cheap imports. It maintains moderate to high tariffs - ranging from zero to 150% - on farm imports.",
      "The weighted average tariff - the average duty rate per imported product - in India on US farm products is 37.7%, compared to 5.3% on Indian agricultural goods in the US, according to the Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).",
      "Bilateral farm trade between India and the US is modest, at just $8bn (\u00a36.2bn).",
      "India mainly exports rice, shrimp, honey, vegetable extracts, castor oil and black pepper, while the US sends almonds, walnuts, pistachios, apples and lentils.",
      "But as the two countries work on a trade deal, experts say Washington now wants to push \"big-ticket\" farm exports - wheat, cotton, corn and maize - to narrow its $45bn trade deficit with India.",
      "\"They're not looking to export berries and stuff this time. The game is much bigger,\" says Biswajit Dhar, a trade expert from the Delhi-based Council for Social Development think tank.",
      "Pushing India to lower farm tariffs, cut price support and open up to genetically modified (GM) crops and dairy ignores the fundamental asymmetry in global agriculture, experts argue.",
      "The US, for instance, heavily subsidises its agriculture and protects farmers through crop insurance.",
      "\"In some cases,\" says Ajay Srivastava of GTRI, \"US subsidies exceed 100% of production costs, creating an uneven playing field that could devastate India's smallholder farmers.\"",
      "Abhijit Das, former head of the Centre for WTO Studies at the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, says \"the key thing to remember is that agriculture in the two countries is entirely different\".",
      "\"The US has commercial agriculture, while India relies on intensive, subsistence farming. It's a question of the livelihoods of millions of Indians versus the interests of US agribusiness.\"",
      "But India's agricultural challenges aren't just external. Mr Dhar says much of the sector's struggles are \"its own doing\". Farming has long been underfunded, receiving less than 6% of India's total investment - funds meant for infrastructure, machinery and other long-term assets crucial for growth.",
      "To protect millions of livelihoods, the government shields key crops like wheat, rice and dairy with import duties and price support. \"But even that doesn't inspire confidence,\" he says.",
      "Four years ago, tens of thousands of farmers held protests demanding better prices and legal guarantees of minimum government support-price for staples, mainly wheat and rice.",
      "\"Even relatively well-off farmers selling surpluses don't see a turnaround anytime soon. And if they feel that way, imagine the plight of subsistence farmers,\" says Mr Dhar.",
      "Beyond domestic discontent, trade negotiations add another layer of complexity.",
      "Mr Das says the real challenge for India will be how \"to have an agreement with the US that takes into account US export interest in agriculture while balancing India's interests in the farm sector\".",
      "So what's the way forward?",
      "\"India must not yield to US pressure to open its agriculture sector,\" says Mr Srivastava. He warns that doing so would disrupt millions of livelihoods, threaten food security and flood local markets with cheap imports.",
      "\"India must prioritise its national interest and protect its rural economy. Trade cooperation should not come at the cost of our farmers, food sovereignty or policy autonomy.\"",
      "In the long run, experts say India must modernise its agriculture, making farming more remunerative, and become more competitive to boost exports. Unupom Kausik of agri-business Olam estimates that with top global yields, India could generate a surplus of 200 million metric tonnes of paddy - enough to supply global trade and combat hunger.",
      "\"In a way, Trump is holding up a mirror to us. We've done little to invest in agriculture's productive capacity,\" says Mr Dhar. \"For now, buying time is the best strategy - maybe offering the US cheaper imports of industrial goods as a trade-off.\"",
      "But for the best outcome, he says, India will have to \"play hardball. Basically, tell the US - we're open to negotiations on other fronts, but don't destabilise our agriculture\".",
      "Clearly India's challenge is to negotiate from a position of strength - offering just enough to keep Washington at the table while safeguarding its rural backbone. After all, in global trade as in farming, timing and patience often yield the best harvest. The jury is out on whether Trump is willing to wait."

      "A green shimmer, like a curtain of light being drawn across the night sky, formed beside the impossibly bright stars above Nuuk late on Friday evening.",
      "The appearance of the spectacular northern lights \u2013 a common wonder in these parts \u2013 seemed to mark the end of a hugely significant day in the arctic, one that brought icebound Greenland's hopes and challenges into the sharpest relief.",
      "It was a day in which an acquisitive foreign power had sent an uninvited delegation to the world's largest island with an uncomfortable message.",
      "On a brief visit to a remote US military base in the far north of Greenland, US Vice-President JD Vance may have tried at times to soften his boss's stated aim of simply annexing the autonomous Danish territory.",
      "\"We do not think that military force is ever going to be necessary,\" Vance said, perhaps attempting to sound reassuring.",
      "But the vice-president's overarching message remained stark and intimidating: the world, the climate, and the Arctic region are changing fast, and Greenland needs to wake up to threats posed by an expansionist China; long-standing Western security partnerships have run their course; the only way the island can protect itself, its values and its mineral wealth is by abandoning weak and miserly Danish overlords and turning instead to the muscular and protective embrace of the US.",
      "Ros Atkins on... Trump's plan for Greenland",
      "Greenlanders prepare for uncomfortable visit from US vice-president",
      "Greenland's opposition wins election dominated by independence and Trump",
      "\"We need to wake up from a failed, 40-year consensus that said that we could ignore the encroachment of powerful countries as they expand their ambitions,\" Vance told US troops at America's Pituffik military base.",
      "\"We can't just bury our head in the sand - or, in Greenland, bury our head in the snow - and pretend that the Chinese are not interested in this very large landmass.\"",
      "If you look at a map of the world that has the north pole at its centre, rather than the equator, it is easy to see how Greenland suddenly switches from being an easily overlooked smudge of uninhabited territory and into a key strategic landmass. It is at the heart of what many analysts now accept as an emerging power struggle between China, the US, and Russia, for control of the arctic, its minerals and its shipping lanes.",
      "But the speed and contempt with which the Trump White House has rejected its traditional reliance on Western allies \u2013 Nato in particular \u2013 has left its partners bewildered.",
      "\"Not justifiable,\" was the bristling response of Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen after hearing Vance attack her government as he stood on its sovereign territory.",
      "'Like a threat'",
      "But 1,500km (930 miles) south of the Pituffik base, in Greenland's capital, Nuuk, the American story vied for attention with a very different local event on Friday.",
      "\"We will prevail,\" a smiling crowd sang, at a ceremony to celebrate the formation of a new coalition government for Greenland.",
      "The mood felt mostly joyful and communal, with people locking arms and swaying gently as a band played inside the town's house of culture.",
      "It was a powerful reminder of the shared values that bind Greenland's tiny, and overwhelmingly native Inuit population together - the need for consensus and co-operation in an often hostile natural climate, the desire to protect and celebrate Inuit culture and the wish to be respected by outsiders, be they from familiar but distant Denmark or marginally closer America.",
      "\"There are many ways to say things. But I think the way [Trump] is saying it is not the way. It's like a threat,\" said Lisbeth Karline Poulsen, 43, a local artist attending the ceremony.",
      "Her reaction appeared to capture the broader mood here - a recent poll showed just 6% of the population support the idea of being part of the US.",
      "The journey to independence",
      "Under its new government, and with overwhelming public support, Greenland is beginning a slow, very cautious move towards full independence from Denmark.",
      "It's a process that will likely take many years, and which will involve lengthy dialogue with both Copenhagen and Washington.",
      "After all, Greenlanders well understand that their economy needs to be far more developed if their bid for independence is to stand any realistic chance of success.",
      "But they need to balance that development against realistic fears of exploitation by powerful outside commercial forces.",
      "Which brings us to the fundamental confusion, in Greenland and beyond, about the Trump administration's approach towards their territory.",
      "What does America want?",
      "On his visit, Vance mentioned Greenland's aspirations for independence, and implied that America's real intention was not a sudden annexation of the island, but something far more patient and long-term.",
      "\"Our message is very simple, yes, the people of Greenland are going to have self-determination. We hope that they choose to partner with the United States, because we're the only nation on earth that will respect their sovereignty and respect their security.\"",
      "If that is genuinely the American pitch \u2013 Trump's messaging remains more aggressive than Vance's \u2013 then Greenlanders can surely relax a little and take their time.",
      "There are still large reserves of goodwill towards the US here, and a keen interest in doing more business with American companies.",
      "On the security front, a 74-year-old treaty with Denmark permitting the US to increase its military presence in Greenland at any time \u2013 from new bases to submarine harbours - should surely take care of Washington's concerns about countering the threat from China, just as it did during the Cold War years.",
      "What remains puzzling is Donald Trump's impatience \u2013 the same impatience he's displayed in attempting to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine.",
      "Short of owning Greenland, America could get everything it desires and needs from this vast island without much difficulty. Instead, many people in Nuuk feel they're being bullied.",
      "It's a deeply counterproductive approach, which has already forced Washington into one humiliating climbdown \u2013 cancelling a planned cultural tour by Vance's wife, Usha, to Nuuk and another town in the face of planned local protests.",
      "A slower, more respectful, behind-the-scenes sort of engagement would, surely, make more sense.",
      "But that's not to every politician's taste.",

      "Last month, Deborah Rutter was fired as president of the Kennedy Center after serving for more than a decade. Asked whether the arts institution is broke, Rutter replied, \"The Kennedy Center has the most complicated financial model, and that is true of every nonprofit arts organization.\"",
      "It has a budget of $268 million, with $43 million coming from the federal government. In 2023, the Kennedy Center had a $6 million surplus, even though it is not supposed to be a money-making enterprise. \"We're a nonprofit organization,\" Rutter said. \"It's not intended to make money.\"",

I remember the name of Andrea Bocelli. They wanted to do something about Elvis Presley.\"",

We could have a little marina where in the weekend boats can come, and nice cafes, nice location where they can spend the weekend there and make it like a destination. Other things that I suggested is branch franchises around the world.\"",
      "Another idea? Sending art to the International Space Station. \"My idea was to have, not Michelangelo, not Picasso, but you know, living contemporary artists to create very small pieces of art,\" Zampolli said, \"One that can be displayed inside the ISS.

    "summary": "To young Brandi Carlile, a girl coming of age and struggling with her own sexuality, Elton John was a flicker of hope in a confusing world. Today, the two music superstars are friends and collaborators, recording an album together, \"Who Believes in Angels?\"",
    "story": [
      "Sir Elton John has millions of fans all over the world, but few of them as devoted as a young girl who first heard his music more than 30 years ago.",
      "In 1992, Brandi Marie Carlile was a kid living in a single-wide trailer in rural Washington State, and to her, Elton John was everything. Young Brandi collected everything about him she could get her hands on \u2013 records, photos, even an Elton John book she borrowed from a library 33 years ago, and kept(!). \"The date is still on here. Boulevard Park Library, May 10, 1992. It's all time stamped. And they're gonna have to come and get it!\"",
      "Little Brandi is now music superstar Brandi Carlile, but to a young girl coming of age and struggling with her own sexuality, Elton John was a flicker of hope in a confusing world. She loved him, and said so in writing, covering an entire page front to back with \"I love Elton John.\" \"It's insane,\" she said. \"I look at it now. I just can't believe what happened in my life to get me to where I am now. It's such a strange thing. It makes you wonder, it just makes you wonder. I do love Elton John!\"",
      "As a kid, she never dreamed she'd get to actually meet him one day, but sometimes dreams have a funny way of coming true. Now they're not only friends, but collaborators. It started a few years back when Carlile wrote to John out of the blue, and asked him to play piano on her new record.\u00a0 Long story short, he said yes, and they grew to be the best of friends \u2013 appearing together, performing together, even vacationing together with their families.",
      "And now, they're about to release an album they made together, recorded at Sunset Sound in Hollywood. It's Brandi Carlile's eighth studio album, and Elton John's 33rd.",
      "So, why did they decide to do an entire album together? John said, \"She's someone I wanted to work with for so long because I know how great she is. I know how her voice is, and I knew what she's capable of, and I wanted to push her more. And I wanted her to push me more. So, I wanted to make a record that was full of energy and great songs. And it turned out really brilliantly.\"",
      "There were cameras in the studio to capture all the highs, and a few of the lows. \"I didn't even think of them being there,\" John said.",
      "\"Yeah, I never saw one,\" Carlile said.",
      "It got tense at times (John admits, \"I haven't really seen the footage, but a lotta people say it's really, really very moving. And all of my behavior is not so moving!\"), but for Brandi, it was still the greatest show on Earth. \"It really felt like I was watching Mozart or, like, one of the great composers,\" she said. \"Stream of consciousness through their entire body, create music in a way that I've never seen. And I was so close. I had a front-row seat.\"",
      "John called it \"one of the greatest musical experiences of my life.\"",
      "Elton John and Brandi Carlile perform \"Swing For The Fences\":",
      "The fact that John got through the recording process at all is remarkable. For the past year, he's been fighting a severe eye infection that's left him nearly blind. But he says that, all things considered, he's doing all right. \"Medically, I'm fit as I've ever been,\" he said. \"I have checkups every month. But the eyesight thing is a bit of a bind, because I haven't been able to watch anything for about seven months. I haven't been able to read. I haven't been able to watch television or anything.",
      "\"But you know what? I've come to the conclusion that if we can't find a solution to it, and this is what it's like for the rest of my life, then I'm okay,\" he said. \"I can still play the piano. I can still sing, which is a gift. My life's fantastic. It's still the greatest gift that anyone could have.\"",
      "These days, John, who turned 78 this past week, is counting his blessings. But the final track on the album really struck a nerve: \"When This Old World Is Done With Me,\" co-written by longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin.",
      "He got very emotional in the studio while recording it: \"Well, I started singing, and I thought the verse was really beautiful. But then I had no idea what was coming. And when I got to the chorus, I realized what was coming, and I just broke down. And I sobbed, and I sobbed, and I sobbed, because it's about my death, basically. And when you get to my age, and a certain age, you think about mortality, because I wanna spend so much time with my children and David and my friends, that you want every single moment to count. And so, this was a song about I don't want to die. I wanna be with my children. I wanna be with David forever. And so, it really got to me.\"",
      "David is husband David Furnish. The two were married in 2014. They have two sons, Zachary and Elijah.",
      "Dad might be a global superstar, but there's no doubt where his heart is. Asked what he is most proud of, John replied, \"Yeah, my kids. My husband. That's it. All I want on my gravestone is, 'He was a great dad.' Nothing to do with music. 'He was a great dad.' That's all I care about.\"",
      "Their new album will be released this week, and for Carlile, it's still a little hard to believe: \"Yeah, it's so weird. Is it not? It's brilliant. Like, it's a wonderful thing. I hope everybody can take some hope and beauty and mysticism from the fact that this has happened. If it could happen to 11-year-old single-wide mobile home Brandi Carlile, it could really happen to anyone.\"",
      "Turns out these two friends don't just lean on each other; they push each other to new heights. The title track of their album is \"Who Believes In Angels?\" But maybe Elton John and Brandi Carlile are angels for each other.",
      "Elton John and Brandi Carlile perform \"Who Believes In Angels?\":",
      "John said, \"God, it was a challenge. But that's what life's all about. If you don't have a challenge at 76, then never give up. Never coast. There are so many artists that coast that don't make new songs. They just go around and play their hits, like I did. I didn't wanna do it with this record. I wanted a new start. I want a fresh start.",

    "summary": "President Trump signed an executive order targeting funding for Smithsonian Institution programs that he says contain \"divisive, race-centered ideology.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0targeting funding for programs at the\u00a0Smithsonian Institution\u00a0that contain what he characterizes as \"divisive, race-centered ideology\" in his latest broadside against a liberalism that has critiqued Western culture and values.",
      "The president said in the order that there has been a \"concerted and widespread\" effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing \"objective facts\" with a \"distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.\" He said this narrative has cast the \"founding principles\" of the U.S. in a \"negative light.\"",
      "\"The Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,\" Mr. Trump said in the order. \"This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.\" He pointed to a sculpture exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum representing that \"[s]ocieties including the United States have used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement.\"",
      "The order tasks Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, with overseeing efforts to \"remove improper ideology\" from all areas of the institution, including its museums, education and research centers and the National Zoo.",
      "It marks Mr. Trump's latest salvo against cultural pillars of society, such as universities and art, that he sees as out of step with conservative sensibilities. He recently had himself installed as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the aim of overhauling programming, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show. The administration also recently forced Columbia University to make a series of policy changes by threatening the Ivy League school with the loss of several hundred million dollars in federal funding.",
      "The executive order also hints at the return of statues and monuments of Confederate figures, many of which were taken down or replaced around the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is detested by Trump and other conservatives.",
      "The president directed the secretary of the interior to determine whether, since Jan. 1, 2020, \"public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior's jurisdiction have been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.\"",
      "The order also calls for improvements to Independence Hall in Philadelphia by July 4, 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Mr. Trump singled out the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, the Women's History Museum, which is in development, and the American Art Museum for criticism.",
      "\"Museums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn \u2014 not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,\" he said in the order.",
      "Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution's chief spokesperson, said in an email late Thursday, \"We have no comment for now.\"",
      "Under the order, Vance is to work with the White House budget office to make sure future funding for the Smithsonian Institution isn't spent on programs that \"degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.\" The president also wants to ensure that the women's history museum celebrates women and not \"recognize men as women in any respect.\"",
      "The Smithsonian Institution is the world's largest museum, education and research complex. It consists of 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven museums are located along the National Mall in Washington.",
      "The institution was established by Congress with money from James Smithson, a British scientist who left his estate to the United States to found \"at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.\"",

      "The 2025 iteration of the Pistols \u2014 original guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock joined by frontman Frank Carter (of Gallows, Pure Love and Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes) \u2014 will hit the road on Sept. 16 at a very memorable stage: The Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas, Texas. It was the site of a particularly hostile show for the band when it first toured the U.S. in 1978.",
      "Jones told The Associated Press he recalls having \"pigs' hooves and bottles and whatnot slung at us by cowboys.\"",
      "It is one of a few dates featured in three \"Live in the U.S.A.\" albums, documenting the band's '78 run: Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco. The latter will be released on April 25 and captures the show where the band originally called it quits.",
      "\"We were thinking of breaking up in San Francisco again,\" Jones joked.",
      "The 2025 tour is currently scheduled to conclude Oct. 16 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles.

      "So, why tour the U.S. and Canada now?",
      "\"Why not?\" Jones said.",
      "\"I think everybody needs this band right now. I think the world needs this band right now,\" Carter said. \"And I think definitely America is screaming out for a band like the Sex Pistols.\"",
      "\"At the end of the day, we're living in a really, really difficult time. So not only do people want to come and just be entertained, they want to enjoy themselves,\" he continued. \"Punk is an energetic music. It's one where you can go and vent and let your hair down, hopefully in a safe manner. Fingers crossed, no bottles or pigs' hooves.\"",
      "Carter fronted the Sex Pistols last year for a few U.K. dates. The band said they did not reach out to Lydon to see if he wanted to participate in this reunion tour.",
      "\"The last thing he wants to do is have anything to do with us right now,\" Jones said, referring to a previous lawsuit between the singer and the band over music use in\u00a0their TV series \"Pistol.\"\u00a0The judge ruled against Lydon's opposition.",
      "\"We wish him the best,\" Jones said.",
      "\"Good luck to him,\" Matlock added. \"I wish he thinks, maybe, 'good luck' to us. Probably doesn't. But over the years, John (has had) all our phone numbers, and I can't see many missed calls from him.\"",
      "As for the 2025 tour: Fans shouldn't expect the violence of their 1978 run, but they should anticipate a tighter performance.",
      "\"We're a bit older but we play just as well, if not better,\" Matlock said. \"And I think that's something that's got a great deal of aplomb that we're going to bring to the public over there.\"",
      "Does this mean there could be new Sex Pistols music in the future? \"It's early days,\" Jones said. \"Let's see what happens.\"",

      "The Sundance Film Festival takes place every January. The Boulder Film Festival will likely be pushed back by about a month, officials behind that festival previously told CBS News Colorado.",
      "Utah was home to the international film festival for 42 years, but festival organizers said the festival has outgrown its home.",
      "Since entering the selection process, state and local leaders in Colorado have mounted considerable efforts to get the festival moved to Boulder, citing the city's concentration of artists, its history of culture, and the revenue benefits to the city and state.",
      "\"I founded the Sundance Institute with a commitment to discovering and developing independent artists, with the Sundance Film Festival serving as the platform for stories to help expand audiences and broaden the landscape,\" Robert Redford, Sundance Institute president and founder, said in a statement. \"This move will ensure that the Festival continues its work of risk taking, supporting innovative storytellers, fostering independence, and entertaining and enlightening audiences. I am grateful to the Boulder community for its support, and I look forward to seeing what the future holds for the Festival there.\"",
      "As part of Boulder's efforts to attract Sundance, the state legislature is considering up to $34 million in refundable tax credits, which would kick in by 2027, when Sundance is set to relocate here. Some state lawmakers oppose that move, however, with one saying it was unfair to ask the entire state to subsidize what would largely only benefit one community.",
      "Nonetheless, the efforts didn't stop there. City leaders in Boulder previously said that local hotels have already committed to capping room price increases during the 11-day event.",
      "\"Our walkable downtown, iconic venues, and beautiful landscape at the base of the Rocky Mountains sets the stage for the Sundance Film Festival to flourish in its next chapter,\" said Charlene Hoffman, CEO of Visit Boulder. \"It's been a remarkable experience getting to share our vibrant community with the Sundance Institute and we eagerly await the Festival's debut in beautiful Boulder, Colorado with excitement and gratitude.\"",
      "A study by the State of Utah found Sundance had nearly 73,000 attendees in 2024, generating $132 million in economic output, $14 million in tax revenue, and $70 million in wages.",
      "\"Boulder is an art town, tech town, mountain town, and college town. It is a place where the Festival can build and flourish. This is the beginning of a bold, new journey as we invite everyone to be part of our community and to be entertained and inspired,\" the Sundance Institute's acting CEO Amanda Kelso said. \"We can't imagine a better fit than Boulder.\"",

      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French cinema icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu is in court in Paris this week, accused of sexually assaulting two women in 2021. A set designer, 34, and an assistant producer, 54, claim the actor grabbed and groped them while filming \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\") in Paris in August and September 2021.",
      "Taking the stand Tuesday for the first time, Depardieu told the court he was nothing like the man described by the two women.",
      "\"I don't see why I would grope a woman, her buttocks, her breasts,\" he said. \"I'm not somebody who rubs himself up against people on the metro.\"",
      "The actor said it was \"very emotional\" being in court.",
      "The two women did not immediately report the alleged offenses. However, after the actor published an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023 in which he stated: \"Never, never have I abused a woman,\" the set designer went to the police. She reported Depardieu for alleged sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults.",
      "The trial first opened in October, but it was adjourned due to Depardieu's failing health. His lawyer told the court the 76-year-old was diabetic and had recently undergone a quadruple-bypass heart surgery.",
      "Medical experts later deemed him fit to attend the trial, but limited the hearings to six hours per day, with a provision for 15-minute pauses if Depardieu needed them. The trial that opened Monday was scheduled to run for only two days, but it may go longer if his health requires breaks in the proceedings.",
      "Depardieu was in court for the trial's opening on Monday. As they walked in together, his lawyer told reporters the actor was happy to have the chance to present his side.",
      "\"G\u00e9rard Depardieu is someone who is very free, who can be extremely direct,\" said his lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, who dismissed the accusations as \"lies.\"",
      "Dozens of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the courthouse, denouncing what they called endemic sexism and impunity for sex offenders in French cinema and French society. They told reporters they were pleased the actor was finally in court to answer the allegations, and waved placards with messages including: \"Victims, we believe you; rapists, we see you\"; \"Touch one, you answer to all\".",
      "A giant of French cinema, Depardieu has been more infamous than famous in recent years. He's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women in the movie industry. Many of the claims surfaced years after the alleged incidents took place, however, so under French law the actor cannot be tried for them.",
      "In a high-profile move, the actor left his native France for a few years about a decade ago, moving to Belgium, having criticized French tax increases.",
      "Depardieu has been open about his admiration for Russia under autocratic President Vladimir Putin, who bestowed Russian citizenship on him in 2013.",
      "He later also became a citizen of Dubai.",

    "summary": "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs are a \"poverty trap\" for millions of Americans.",
    "story": [
      "PLEASANTVILLE, Iowa \u2014 Zach Mecham has heard politicians demand that Medicaid recipients work or lose their benefits. He also has run into a jumble of Medicaid rules that effectively prevent many people with disabilities from holding full-time jobs.",
      "\"Which is it? Do you want us to work or not?\" he said.",
      "Mecham, 31, relies on the public insurance program to pay for services that help him live on his own despite a disability caused by muscular dystrophy. He uses a wheelchair to get around and a portable ventilator to breathe.",
      "A paid assistant stays with Mecham at night. Then a home health aide comes in the morning to help him get out of bed, go to the bathroom, shower, and get dressed for work at his online marketing business. Without the assistance, he would have to shutter his company and move into a nursing home, he said.",
      "Private health insurance plans generally do not cover such support services, so he relies on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by federal and state governments and covers millions of Americans who have low incomes or disabilities.",
      "Like most other states, Iowa has a Medicaid \"buy-in program,\" which allows people with disabilities to join Medicaid even if their incomes are a bit higher than would typically be permitted. About two-thirds of such programs charge premiums, and most have caps on how much money participants can earn and save.",
      "Some states have raised or eliminated such financial caps for people with disabilities. Mecham has repeatedly traveled to the Iowa Capitol to lobby legislators to follow those states' lead. The \"Work Without Worry\" bill would remove income and asset caps and instead require Iowans with disabilities to pay 6% of their incomes as premiums to remain in Medicaid. Those fees would be waived if participants pay premiums for employer-based health insurance, which would help cover standard medical care.",
      "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs can prevent participants from working full time or accepting promotions. \"It's a trap \u2014 a poverty trap,\" said Stephen Lieberman, a policy director for the United Spinal Association, which supports the changes.",
      "Lawmakers in Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, and New Jersey have introduced bills to address the issue this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Several other states have raised or eliminated their program's income and asset caps. Iowa's proposal is modeled on a Tennessee law passed last year, said Josh Turek, a Democratic state representative from Council Bluffs. Turek, who is promoting the Iowa bill, uses a wheelchair and earned two gold medals as a member of the U.S. Paralympics basketball team.",
      "Proponents say allowing people with disabilities to earn more money and still qualify for Medicaid would help ease persistent worker shortages, including in rural areas where the working-age population is shrinking.",
      "Turek believes now is a good time to seek expanded employment rights for people with disabilities, since Republicans who control the state and federal governments have been touting the value of holding a job. \"That's the trumpet I've been blowing,\" he said with a smile.",
      "The Iowa Legislature has been moving to require many nondisabled Medicaid recipients to work or to document why they can't. Opponents say most Medicaid recipients who can work already do so, and the critics say work requirements add red tape that is expensive to administer and could lead Medicaid recipients to lose their coverage over paperwork issues.",
      "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has made Medicaid work requirements a priority this year. \"If you can work, you should. It's common sense and good policy,\" the Republican governor told legislators in January in her \"Condition of the State Address.\" \"Getting back to work can be a lifeline to stability and self-sufficiency.\"",
      "Her office did not respond to KFF Health News' queries about whether Reynolds supports eliminating income and asset caps for Iowa's buy-in program, known as Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities.",
      "Spouse's income counts toward cap",
      "National disability rights activists say income and asset caps on Medicaid buy-in programs discourage couples from marrying or even pressure them to split up if one or both partners have disabilities. That's because in many states a spouse's income and assets are counted when determining eligibility.",
      "In Iowa, for example, the monthly net income cap is $3,138 for a single person and $4,259 for a couple.",
      "Iowa's current asset cap for a single person in the Medicaid buy-in plan is $12,000. For a couple, that cap rises only to $13,000. Countable assets include investments, bank accounts, and other things that could be easily converted to cash, but not a primary home, vehicle, or household furnishings.",
      "\"You have couples who have been married for decades who have to go through what we call a 'Medicaid divorce,' just to get access to these supports and services that cannot be covered in any other way,\" said Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities.",
      "Town said some states, including Massachusetts, have removed income caps for people with disabilities who want to join Medicaid. She said the cost of adding such people to the program is at least partially offset by the premiums they pay for coverage and the increased taxes they contribute because they are allowed to work more hours. \"I don't think it has to be expensive\" for the state and federal governments, she said.",
      "Congress has considered a similar proposal to allow people with disabilities to work more hours without losing their Social Security disability benefits, but that bill has not advanced.",
      "Although most states have Medicaid buy-in programs, enrollment is relatively low, said Alice Burns, a Medicaid analyst at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Fewer than 200,000 people nationwide are covered under the options, Burns said. \"Awareness of these programs is really limited,\" she said, and the income limits and paperwork can dissuade potential participants.",
      "In states that charge premiums for Medicaid buy-in programs, monthly fees can range from $10 to 10% of a person's income, according to a KFF analysis of 2022 data.",
      "Iowa bill to remove caps",
      "The Iowa proposal to remove income and asset caps has drawn bipartisan backing from legislators, including a 20-0 vote of approval from the House Health and Human Services Committee. \"This aligns with things both parties are aiming to do,\" said state Rep. Carter Nordman, a Republican who chaired a subcommittee meeting on the bill. Nordman said he supports the idea but wants to see an official estimate of how much it would cost the state to let more people with disabilities participate in the Medicaid buy-in program.",
      "Mecham, the citizen activist lobbying for the Iowa bill, said he hopes it allows him to expand his online marketing and graphic design business, \"Zach of All Trades.\"",
      "On a recent morning, health aide Courtnie Imler visited Mecham's modest house in Pleasantville, a town of about 1,700 people in an agricultural region of central Iowa. Imler chatted with Mecham while she used a hoist to lift him out of his wheelchair and onto the toilet. Then she cleaned him up, brushed his hair, and helped him put on jeans and a John Deere T-shirt. She poured him a cup of coffee and put a straw in it so he could drink it on his own, swept the kitchen floor, and wiped the counters. After about an hour, she said goodbye.",
      "After getting cleaned up and dressed, Mecham rolled his motorized wheelchair over to his plain wooden desk, fired up his computer, and began working on a social media video for a client promoting a book. He scrolled back and forth through footage of an interview she'd done, so he could pick the best clip to post online. He also shoots video, takes photos, and writes advertising copy.",
      "Mecham loves feeling productive, and he figures he could work at least twice as many hours if not for the risk of losing Medicaid coverage. He said he's allowed to make a bit more money than Iowa Medicaid's standard limit because he signed up for a federal option under which he eventually expects to work his way off Social Security disability payments.",
      "There are several such options for people with disabilities, but they all involve complicated paperwork and frequent reports, he said. \"This is such a convoluted system that I have to navigate to build any kind of life for myself,\" he said. Many people with disabilities are intimidated by the rules, so they don't apply, he said. \"If you get it wrong, you lose the health care your life depends on.\"",

    "summary": "West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a bill into law this week that bans some artificial dyes as well as two preservatives from foods sold statewide.",
    "story": [
      "West Virginia has outlawed foods that contain\u00a0some artificial dyes\u00a0or other additives, in one of the most comprehensive statewide bans of its kind. The move cites potentially harmful health effects and comes amid a broader push from scientists and government leaders to clamp down on synthetics in the nation's food supply.",
      "On Monday, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed into law a bill that was passed earlier by legislators to eliminate seven artificial dyes \u2014 Red Dye No. 3, Red Dye No. 40, Yellow Dye No. 5, Yellow Dye No. 6, Blue Dye No. 1, Blue Dye No. 2 and Green Dye No. 3 \u2014\u00a0 from food products and drugs sold in the state. The preservatives butylated hydroxyanisole and propylparaben will also be banned.",
      "The dyes will not be allowed in meals served as part of school nutrition programs starting on Aug. 1 this year, while the dyes and the two preservatives will not be permitted in drugs and food sold in the state starting on Jan. 1, 2028, according to the governor's office.",
      "\"West Virginia ranks at the bottom of many public health metrics, which is why there's no better place to lead the Make America Healthy Again mission,\" Morrisey said in a statement, citing the campaign slogan popularized by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has said he is prioritizing the removal of artificial dyes from food and drinks sold around the United States. \"By eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we're taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges.\"",
      "The latest ban in West Virginia follows a pair of laws passed in California in recent years to remove some additives from foods sold statewide and synthetic dyes from school meals. Dozens of other U.S. states have introduced legislation to ban or more strictly regulate certain food additives, including artificial dyes, since the beginning of the year, according to the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization focused on food safety.",
      "Thirty-six color additives are approved by the Federal Drug Administration for use in food and drinks in the U.S., including nine artificial dyes.",
      "Rising concerns from advocacy groups and scientists about possible health consequences of synthetic food components, particularly for children, prompted the FDA to undertake a new effort in December to review previously approved additives, although the agency's deputy commissioner for human foods warned at the time that budget restrictions might prevent a timely turnaround. In January, the FDA announced its decision to revoke the authorization for one dye, Red 3, to be added to foods, after evidence showed a link between the dye and cancer in laboratory animals.",

      "After a week that brought tough economic news and polling showing Americans'\u00a0views of the economy\u00a0are still sour, most say President Trump has focused too much on tariffs \u2014 which they believe will end up raising prices \u2014 and not enough on lowering prices.",
      "This has Americans collectively skeptical right now about the ability of Mr. Trump's policies to make them financially better off, a sentiment that was key to the success of his 2024 campaign.",
      "Yet that's balanced out for Mr. Trump today by continued majority approval on immigration and on his deportation program, specifically. That comes especially \u2014 but not exclusively \u2014 from his Republican base, many of whom say that's just as important as the economy in their evaluations.",
      "Meanwhile, the public continues to weigh the changes brought by the federal workforce reductions, with many believing they will impact programs they care about.",
      "But the matter involving administration officials' use of the Signal app, while seen as serious, does not seem tied to evaluations of Mr. Trump overall.",
      "From a list of items, most say the administration is focused too much on tariffs, and by contrast, is not focused enough on lowering prices.",
      "Donald Trump won the 2024 election in large part on the economy and the idea that he'd make Americans financially better off.",
      "Just before he took office, a sizable four in 10 felt his policies as president would do just that.",
      "Asked about what's happening today, just a quarter of Americans say those policies are making them financially better off. Nearly twice as many say he's making their finances worse.",
      "Even among Republicans, things have tempered. Just before he took office, three-fourths of Republicans said Mr. Trump's policies as president would make them better off, and now, under half of them say that's what is happening so far.",
      "Tariffs, or the threat of them, don't seem to be helping.",
      "Most oppose new tariffs, as they have for a while, and big numbers think that'll lead to higher prices in the short term.",
      "The administration has argued that tariffs will have long-term benefits, but people are more inclined to think they'll raise prices rather than lower them in the long term, too. Tariffs on imported cars in particular aren't popular, either.",
      "(Prices, of course, have been a key concern for years. They are the number one reason that people still rate the economy badly,\u00a0according to recent polling.)",
      "Importantly, though, Mr. Trump doesn't fully \"own\" the issue. Joe Biden still gets a little more blame for today's inflation rate than Mr. Trump does.",
      "Mr. Trump's approval for handling inflation specifically remains negative, and his rating on handling the economy in general has edged into negative territory since last month.",
      "That balances against net-positive ratings for immigration (which are extremely positive with Republicans), and he's even overall.",
      "His overall approval rating has ticked down just a point from last month and is a few points lower than at the start of his term, though it remains above what he got at any point during his first term.",
      "Trump's deportation program, specifically, retains majority approval. That hasn't really changed in recent weeks.",
      "As for some potential implications, as a general principle it's not acceptable to most if some legal U.S. residents were to be mistakenly detained by immigration authorities. But half of Republicans say it would be acceptable.",
      "Judges and the courts",
      "Americans overwhelmingly support the principle of judicial review of the legality of Mr. Trump's policies, including most Republicans. But there's also been calls from some to try to impeach federal judges who rule against Mr. Trump's policies, and that also finds favor with a majority of Republicans, especially those who identify as part of the MAGA movement.",
      "Federal workforce and DOGE",
      "Views on Mr. Trump's efforts to reduce the federal workforce are evenly split in the country.",
      "One reason is that most think the reductions will impact programs and services they care about. A slight majority still think Musk and DOGE have too much influence \u2014 with Republicans, again, standing differently than other Americans.",
      "On the matter of Trump administration officials discussing U.S. military plans on the Signal messaging app, most Americans, including most Republicans, say the matter is serious. And most don't think it was appropriate to use the app to discuss military plans.",
      "Democrats are more likely than Republicans to be following this story.",
      "So far, this situation isn't adversely affecting Republicans in their overall evaluation of Mr. Trump. An overwhelming majority of Republicans who describe what happened as very or somewhat serious still approve of him. Four in 10 Republicans do say what happened was appropriate.",
      "And most Americans would not approve of Donald Trump having the U.S. take control of Greenland.",
      "The Role of Congress",
      "Democrats increasingly call for their party in Congress to oppose Trump \u2014 these figures have risen with each poll.",
      "And those Democrats who are calling for this overwhelmingly say their party in Congress could be doing more to oppose him.",
      "Relatively few Americans, including those in his own party, would generally want to see Mr. Trump have more power as president than he already does; they feel he has the right amount now. And they do see a role for the party in Congress. Majorities of Republicans would have their members push back on Mr. Trump if they disagree.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,609 U.S. adults interviewed between March 27-28, 2025.

    "story": [
      "Crowds protesting billionaire Elon Musk's purge of the U.S. government under President Trump began amassing outside Tesla dealerships throughout the U.S. and in some cities in Europe on Saturday in the latest attempt to dent the fortune of the world's richest man.",
      "The protesters are trying to escalate a movement targeting Tesla dealerships and vehicles in opposition to Musk's role as the head of the newly created Department of of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he's gained access to sensitive data and shuttered entire agencies as he attempts to slash government spending. Most of Musk's estimated $340 billion fortune consists of the stock he holds in the electric vehicle company that he continues to run while also working alongside Mr. Trump.",
      "Earlier protests have been somewhat sporadic. Saturday marked the first attempt to surround all 277 of the automaker's showrooms and service centers in the U.S. in hopes of deepening\u00a0a recent decline in the company's sales.",
      "By early afternoon, crowds ranging from a few dozen to hundreds of protesters had flocked to Tesla locations in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Maryland, Minnesota and the automaker's home state of Texas. Pictures posted on social media accounts showed protesters brandishing signs such as\u00a0\"Honk if you hate Elon\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"Fight the billionaire broligarchy.\"",
      "The Tesla Takedown movement also hoped to rally protestors at more than 230 Tesla locations in other parts of the world. Although the turnouts in Europe weren't as large as the crowds in the U.S., the anti-Musk sentiment was similar.",
      "About two dozen protesters held signs lambasting Musk outside a Tesla dealership in London as passing cars and trucks tooted horns in support.",
      "One of the signs displayed at the London protest showed a photo of Musk next to an image of Adolf Hitler making the Nazi salute \u2014 a\u00a0gesture that Musk has been accused of reprising shortly after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. A person in a tyrannosaurus rex costume held another sign with a picture of Musk's straight-arm gesture that said, \"You thought the Nazis were extinct. Don't buy a Swasticar.\"",
      "\"We just want to get loud, make noise, make people aware of the problems that we're facing,\" said Cam Whitten, an American who showed up at the London protest.",
      "Tesla Takedown was organized by a group of supporters that included disillusioned owners of the automaker's vehicles, celebrities such as actor John Cusack, and at least one Democratic Party lawmaker, Rep. Jasmine Crockett from Dallas.",
      "\"I'm going to keep screaming in the halls of Congress. I just need you all to make sure you all keep screaming in the streets,\" Crockett said during a\u00a0Tesla Takedown organizing call\u00a0held earlier this month.",
      "In New York City, mayoral hopeful and New York state Rep. Zohran Mamdani joined protesters at a Tesla showroom on Saturday.",
      "\"We are here in a moment that demands all of us,\" Mandani told the crowd through a megaphone. \"It demands all of us because the richest man in the world has purchased the president of the United States.\"",
      "Some people opposed to Musk have gone beyond protests and set the automaker's vehicles on fire and committed\u00a0other acts of vandalism that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has decried as \"nothing short of domestic terrorism.\" Musk indicated he was dumbfounded by the attacks during a March 20 company meeting and said the vandals should \"stop acting psycho.\"",
      "Crockett and other Tesla Takedown supporters have been stressing the importance for Saturday's protests to remain peaceful.",
      "But police were investigating a fire that destroyed seven Tesla vehicles in northwestern Germany early Saturday morning. It was wasn't immediately clear if the blaze, which was extinguished by firefighters, was related to the Tesla Takedown protests.",
      "There have been vandalisms at Tesla dealerships acrossing the U.S., including fires in Nevada and Missouri, and graffiti at locations in Massachusetts and Maryland, CBS News previously reported.",
      "Since January 2025, incidents targeting Tesla EVs have occurred in at least nine states, according to a joint intelligence bulletin issued by the Department of Homeland Security and FBI and obtained by CBS News.\u00a0Although U.S. intelligence suggests lone actors are behind them, Trump administration officials are promising to crack down on what they say are coordinated attacks.",
      "There have also been reports of vandalism to parked Teslas, making individual owners nervous.",
      "\"My wife cautions me, 'Be careful where you are at with it,'\" Bill Fonte told CBS New York. \"If you don't like the product, don't buy it. But they're going above and beyond, creating panic and concern for normal people like me.\"",
      "A growing number of consumers who bought Tesla vehicles before Musk took over DOGE have been looking to sell or trade in their cars while others have slapped on bumper stickers seeking to distance themselves from the billionaire's efforts to prune or shut down government agencies.",
      "But Musk didn't appear concerned about an extended slump in sales of new Tesla cars in his March 20 address to employees. He reassured the workers that the company's Model Y, which is undergoing a refresh, would remain \"the best-selling car on Earth again this year.\" He also predicted Tesla will have sold more than 10 million cars worldwide by next year, up from about 7 million cars now.",
      "\"There are times when there are rocky moments, where there is stormy weather, but what I am here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting,\" Musk said.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected last November, investors initially saw Musk's alliance with the president as a positive development for Tesla and its long-running efforts to launch\u00a0a network of self-driving cars.",
      "That optimism helped lift Tesla's stock by 70% in the period between Mr. Trump's Nov. 5 election and his Jan. 20 inauguration, creating an additional $560 billion in shareholder wealth. But virtually all those gains have evaporated amid investor worries about the Tesla backlash, lagging sales in the U.S., Europe and China, and Musk spending time overseeing DOGE.",
      "\"This continues to be a moment of truth for Musk to navigate this brand tornado crisis moment and get onto the other side of this dark chapter for Tesla,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note leading up to Saturday's protests.",

The bureau's chief operating officer, Adam Martinez, said the agency was in \"wind-down mode\" after Trump fired its previous director, Rohit Chopra, on Feb. 1.",

      "Mr. Trump has delayed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports until April 2, but economists say the import duties could have detrimental effects on their economies given their deep reliance on the U.S. The drop in airline demand reflects \"a degradation of travel demand between the two countries, especially coming from the Canadian side,\" Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, a flight deals website, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "Slashing routes to the U.S.",

      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close ally of Mr. Trump, posted on X Wednesday that the new tariffs would affect the company's American-made electric vehicles.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X Wednesday. \"To be clear, this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries. The cost impact is not trivial,\" he wrote in a later post.",
      "That said, Tesla is expected to be among the automakers that are least affected by the tariffs, given that its vehicles are made in the U.S., and most of their parts are sourced domestically, too. The EV brand does, however, rely on China for some batteries, \"so the tariffs will have an impact,\" Art Wheaton, a transportation industry expert and director of labor studies at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Tesla rival Rivian could also be spared for similar reasons, according to UBS.",
      "\"We believe TSLA and RIVN could fare better as 100% of their production is in the U.S. (though not all components),\" UBS analysts said in a research note.",
      "General Motors",
      "General Motors, one of the so-called Big Three automakers, along with Stellantis and Ford, is widely expected to be the most exposed to the forthcoming auto tariffs. Headquartered in Detroit, the U.S. car company makes just 45% of vehicles it sells to U.S. customers domestically, leaving 55% of its lineup exposed to tariffs, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "GM, which makes Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac vehicles, is heavily invested in Mexico and Canada, where it builds heavy-duty vehicles, according to Cornell's Wheaton.",
      "Stellantis",
      "Stellantis, whose brands include Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge and Ram, among others, is similarly susceptible to rising costs from the tariffs, as it makes between 73%-75% of vehicles for sale in the U.S. stateside, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "That means, a $80,000 RAM truck from Stellantis could cost $100,000 once it reaches the U.S., under the new policy.",
      "\"The impact is quite large,\" Wheaton said.",
      "Ford",
      "Ford is among the car companies better positioned to weather the tariffs, according to Cox Automotive analyst Erin Keating, as 80% of its vehicles are manufactured in the U.S. and therefore would not be subject to the 25% tariff on passenger cars. However, any imported parts used in Ford's U.S.-manufactured vehicles could be tariffed at 25%.",
      "Ford vehicles made in the U.S. include the F-150 pickup truck lineup. Some of its smaller vehicles, including the Maverick pickup truck and Bronco Sport SUV are made in Mexico and \"will take a hit,\" said Wheaton.",
      "While domestic automakers will face increased costs, it's unclear how much of the tax they'll pass along to consumers. The\u00a0Wall Street Journal,\u00a0reported that Mr. Trump warned the CEOs of the Big Three not to raise car prices because of tariffs, according to people familiar with the matter.",
      "Toyota and Honda",
      "Japanese automakers Toyota and Honda export a large number of vehicles and auto parts from Japan to the U.S., which represents a sizable market for the companies. Both also operate big plants in Canada, Wheaten noted, leaving them particularly vulnerable to added costs from new tariffs.",
      "The same goes for South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia.",
      "BMW and Volkswagen",
      "German automakers, including BMW and Volkswagen, which makes Audi vehicles, both operate big plants in Mexico.",
      "The May 3 auto-parts tariff will likely apply to engines and transmission systems, and hit the company \"heavily,\" according to Wheaton.",
      "BMW, for instance, makes a lot of engines in Germany, which it then ships to South Carolina, where the automaker manufactures SUVs. The company could be hit \"heavily,\" by the auto-parts tariffs, according to Wheaton.",
      "Mercedes-Benz operates similarly, sending engines and transmission from Germany to a plant in Alabama, where the company manufactures SUVs. The 25% auto tariffs would also likely apply to fully assembled Mercedes vehicles shipped to the U.S.",
      "\"I don't think any brands will be spared, because none are 100% in the U.S.,\" Wheaton said. \"They all have products from Canada, Mexico or elsewhere. And even Tesla, which is the most American, still has non-U.S. content in their vehicles.\"",
      "Tariffs could spark affordability issues",
      "Even vehicles whose parts aren't subject to tariffs and that are assembled in the U.S. could face price hikes, as automakers attempt to spread new costs out across their lineups. While Cox Automotive expects price hikes of between 15%-20% on vehicles that are caught in the tariffs' crosshairs, those that are exempt could still go up by about 5%, Keating noted.",
      "The auto tariffs could ignite new affordability challenges for consumers by moving lower-cost vehicles closer to, or in some cases over the $30,000 threshold.",
      "Take, for example, a Hyundai Venue, a subcompact crossover SUV, with an average current list price of $24,000. Under Mr. Trump's auto tariffs, that price could rise to about $28,500, adding more than $4,000 to an affordable design.",
      "\"Sub- $30,000 compact SUVs and crossovers that are the most popular are almost all foreign-made, with the exception of one or two,\" Keating said. \"So they'd all be subjected to the 25% tariffs.\"",
      "At the other end of the economic spectrum, luxury Italian car maker Ferrari on Thursday said it would hike prices on certain car models by 10% after April 1, citing Mr. Trump's auto tariffs. The vehicles subject to price increase include the Ferrari 296, SF90 and Roma, which already retail for hundreds of thousands of dollars each.",

    "story": [
      "Stocks are taking a battering on Friday amid growing concerns on Wall Street about the impact of President Trump's tariff regime as well as hotter-than-expected price data, sparking worries that the Federal Reserve is far from declaring victory on inflation.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 758 points, or 1.8%, to 41,541.09 in Friday afternoon trading, while the broad-based S&P 500 shed 2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index skidded 2.8%.",
      "Friday's stock market rout comes after Wall Street has already suffered a pummeling this year, with the S&P 500 down 9% from its most recent February high.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said he is imposing a\u00a025% tariff on all vehicles\u00a0and auto parts imported into the U.S., a move that is expected to add thousands of dollars to the cost of many vehicles. He also plans to announce more tariffs on April 2. Because tariffs are import taxes that companies largely pass onto consumers, many economists are forecasting an uptick in inflation later this year.",
      "At the same time, new economic data released on Friday shows that core inflation heated up last month, posing a challenge to the Federal Reserve's goal of driving inflation down to a 2% annual rate.",
      "\"The recent U.S. stock market correction appears to have been partially triggered by investors realising that Trump may follow through with his tariff threats and that this will hurt the U.S. economy,\" said Oxford Economics lead economist Daniel Harenberg and senior economist Kiki Sondh in a Friday report. \"Similarly, consumer sentiment has weakened due to tariff-induced inflation fears.\"",
      "The economy has so far been holding up relatively well, but if it were to weaken while inflation stays high, it would produce a worst-case scenario called \"stagflation,\" which policymakers in Washington have few good tools to fix.",
      "A report on Friday morning showed that U.S. consumers, including Republicans, Independents and Democrats, getting more pessimistic about their future finances. Two out of three consumers surveyed by the University of Michigan expect unemployment to worsen in the year ahead. That's the the highest reading since 2009, and it raises worries about a job market that's been the linchpin keeping the U.S. economy solid.",
      "At the same time, recent CBS News polling shows that Americans have become more dour in their economic outlooks, with relatively more consumers bracing for a slowdown or\u00a0recession\u00a0over the next year.",
      "Automaker stocks",
      "Shares of automakers tumbled on Friday, continuing a rout that began after Mr. Trump announced his new auto tariffs.\u00a0Hyundai Motor fell 2.6% in Seoul, while Honda Motor fell 2.6%, and Toyota Motor sank 2.8% in Tokyo.",
      "On Wall Street, Ford Motor fell 2.6%, and General Motors sank 1.7%. Even U.S. automakers selling vehicles in the country can feel the pain of such tariffs because their supply chains are spread throughout North America. Trump says he wants more manufacturing to take place within the United States.",
      "The rout also hit shares outside the auto industry, with investors concerned that Mr. Trump's trade war may cause U.S. households and businesses to freeze their spending. Even if the tariffs end up being less painful than feared, all the uncertainty may filter into changed behaviors that hurt the economy.",
      "Leading the market lower on Friday was Lululemon Athletica, which dropped 15%. Even though the seller of athletic apparel reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, it warned that its revenue growth may slow this upcoming year as consumers grow more cautious.",
      "\"Consumers are spending less due to increased concerns about inflation and the economy,\" said CEO Calvin McDonald.",
      "Lululemon also said tariffs and shifting foreign-currency values may account for about half of its expected drop in a key measure of performance: how much profit it can squeeze out of each $1 of revenue.",
      "Oxford Industries, the company behind the Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer brands, likewise reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected but still saw its stock fall 3.1%. CEO Tom Chubb said it saw a \"deterioration in consumer sentiment that also weighed on demand\" beginning in January, which accelerated into February.",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 12:07:02 -0400",
    "summary": "Here's what to know about tariffs ahead of President Trump's plans to announce new import duties on April 2.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is planning to impose a round of fresh tariffs on April 2, a day President Trump has dubbed \"liberation day.\" The announcement is viewed by economists as the culmination of his \"America First Trade Policy,\" an\u00a0executive order he signed on his first day in office aimed at revitalizing U.S. manufacturing.",
      "Mr. Trump has referred to his April 2 tariff announcement as \"the big one,\" suggesting that the plans may be more far reaching than the import levies he's already unleashed on goods from other nations, such as his March 26 declaration of 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S.",
      "\"For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol' USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!\" Trump said about his April 2 plans in a post\u00a0earlier this month on Truth Social.",
      "On April 2, Mr. Trump is expected to announce his administration's plans for so-called reciprocal tariffs, which he deems necessary to erase trade imbalances with nations that export more goods to the U.S. than they import from America. But the addition of broad-based tariffs to a host of imports is likely to heat up a global trade war that could, at least in the short term, boost prices for U.S. consumers and juice inflation.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on imported goods, and research shows that that majority gets passed along to consumers,\" Colin Grabow, associate director of the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Ultimately, the Trump administration's goal is to increase prices on imports to the point where it's economically favorable for companies to relocate their manufacturing to the U.S., he noted.",
      "\"If prices don't go up, it doesn't deter imports, and therefore there is no reason to set up shop in the U.S.,\" Grabow explained. \"Part of the logic is premised on prices going up, otherwise they are not going to accomplish their goal.\"",
      "Economists say that Mr. Trump's tariff agenda, including the uncertainty surrounding it, could drag down U.S. GDP by depressing financial markets and consumer sentiment.",
      "\"The main channel from trade policy uncertainty to GDP is via business investment. Under higher trade policy uncertainty, future revenue streams of an investment become more uncertain, raising the option value of delaying investment decisions until the situation is clearer,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a research note.",
      "What tariffs will Trump announce April 2?",
      "Mr. Trump teased his April 2 announcement on Wednesday when he announced his new 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars and auto parts. \"That's Liberation Day, that's gonna be on the 2nd, and that's gonna be reciprocal, and I think people will be impressed,\" the president said.",
      "Reciprocal tariffs are designed to match the import duties placed on U.S. goods and services by other nations, as well as compensate for other trade barriers, according to the Yale Budget Lab, a non-partisan public policy think tank. According to a White House memo from Feb. 13, the U.S. faces additional trade barriers aside from tariffs such as regulatory requirements that can make it more difficult for American exports to reach other nations.",
      "While the size and scope of the reciprocal tariffs that Mr. Trump plans to announce are unknown, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week said the administration's reciprocal tariffs would target countries with the biggest trade surpluses, as well as those which have imposed the highest tariffs plus non-tariff trade barriers on U.S. goods.",
      "Multiple nations run large annual trade surpluses with the U.S., including Germany, Ireland and Italy in the European Union, as well as Vietnam, Japan and Taiwan. The U.S. also has a large trade deficit with China, although Mr. Trump has already imposed new tariffs on that nation.",
      "\"It'll be in many cases less than the tariff that they've been charging us for decades ... I think we're trying to keep it somewhat conservative,\" Mr. Trump said on March 26.",
      "Mr. Trump added that he'll introduce a reciprocal tariff policy on \"all countries,\" which he said would be \"very lenient.\"",
      "Meanwhile, additional tariffs are also slated to go into effect on April 2, with Mr. Trump's one-month delay on 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports set to expire that day. The 25% auto tariff announced by the president on March 26 is also scheduled to take effect on April 2.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Reciprocal tariffs enacted by the U.S. would match foreign nations' levies and other trade policies on American goods.",
      "A reciprocal tariff policy would include calculating a country-specific number that the Trump administration deems representative of all trade barriers. But import restrictions other than tariffs, such as regulatory requirements, could be hard to quantify, economists say.",
      "\"There are a lot of intangibles, like testing regulations for different products in countries, or perceived openness to business with American companies,\" Simon Macadam, deputy chief global economist at Capital Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These are things you can't easily put a number on.\"",
      "Because of this complexity, some experts expect Trump's reciprocal tariffs could be more limited in scope, and might not be truly \"reciprocal\" because they may not exactly match other countries' levies.",
      "\"We shouldn't be surprised if some of the stuff is rolled back, or not as sweeping as maybe originally talked about, because logistically, from a practical perspective, running the calculations and coming up with a number is extremely time consuming,\" Grabow of the Cato Institute said.",
      "Wilbur Ross, who served as the U.S. Secretary of Commerce during the first Trump administration, agreed that a truly reciprocal tariff policy would be \"very complicated to get to work.\"",
      "\"If you were literally going to be reciprocal, you would put the same tariff on a product that comes into the U.S. as that country charges on products from the U.S.,\" he said. \"But the problem is you'd be charging a different tariff on the same item from different countries.\"",
      "That would create loopholes for exporters to ship products through lower-tariffed countries to the U.S., Ross added. \"It would make it easy for people to game the system,\" he said.",
      "What does Trump want to achieve?",
      "Through his \"Fair and Reciprocal Plan\" on trade, Mr. Trump is aiming to bring about three outcomes: Boost U.S. manufacturing jobs; close the $1.2 trillion U.S. trade deficit; and gain leverage over U.S. trade partners.",
      "But experts say that trade barriers such as tariffs may not be enough to revitalize U.S. manufacturing jobs, which have fallen sharply over the last few decades. Fewer than 13 million people are employed in manufacturing today, down from a peak of 19.6 million in 1979,\u00a0according to federal data.",
      "\"To a large extent, and particularly in low- and medium-tech industries, the economics of production will not be significantly altered by a 10-20% tariff,\" Macadam said. \"When labor costs in hubs like Mexico are one-fifth of what they are in the U.S., in order to induce companies to seriously relocate a lot of production back to the U.S. a 20% tariff isn't going to cut it.\"",
      "There's also the unknown of how long any new tariffs announced by Mr. Trump will remain in place. Such uncertainty could deter American or foreign businesses from investing heavily in re-shoring manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "\"Even if for some companies it gets to the point where it seems to make financial sense to move back to the U.S., there's the question of, 'Are these tariffs actually going to last a long time?'\" Macadam said. \"If you think the tariff is going to be there forever, then yeah, absolutely relocate. But if it's reversed or rates are lowered, then it would have been silly to relocate.\"",
      "What will tariffs mean for consumers?",
      "Consumers typically pay the price for tariffs, as companies have said they plan on passing off much of the costs to their customers.",
      "As a result, a round of fresh tariffs could boost inflation, economists say. According to an analysis by Oxford Economics, if the effective tariff rate on imports into the U.S. rises from their 2024 level of 2.5% to 10% in April, which is what Oxford Economics expects, prices in aggregate would rise by half a percentage point.",
      "\"Inflation was on trend to fall \u2014 now we expect it to rise,\" Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "story": [
      "Mega Millions will roll out several changes next month, including new ticket prices, jackpots and an increase in the odds of winning, the multistate lottery game announced.",
      "Players will need more than $2 and a dream to play. After the April 4 drawing, tickets will cost $5 each, Mega Millions said in a statement Tuesday. An optional add-on to potentially increase nonjackpot prizes for an additional dollar and a $3 feature for two plays for the jackpot will be discontinued.",
      "In exchange for the higher price, the game boasts better odds for winning. While the odds for winning any prize will improve from 1 in 24 to 1 in 23, the chances of winning the big prize will still be astronomical: going from 1 in 302,575,350 to 1 in 290,472,336. The change will make the odds of winning Mega Millions' jackpot closer to winning Powerball's, where the odds\u00a0are 1 in 292.2 million.",
      "One thing that hasn't changed is people are still less likely to win the jackpot than to be struck by lightning, the odds of which are 1 in 15,300 in a lifetime, according to the National Weather Service.",
      "Players win a Mega Millions jackpot by matching the five white balls and the gold Mega Ball. The game's smallest prize is won by matching just the Mega Ball. The changes in the game's odds come from removing one of the Mega Balls.",
      "The size of the prizes are also changing. The jackpot will be a minimum of $50 million, up from $20 million. Mega Millions estimates that the average jackpot win with the new changes will be over $800 million, an increase from about $450 million. A random multiplier will also be added to the smaller prizes.",
      "\"Players who had won $2 in the old game will now take home $10, $15, $20, $25 or $50 under this game,\" Joshua Johnston, lead director of the Mega Millions Consortium, said in a statement. \"Those who had won $500 under the old rules will now take home $1,000; $1,500; $2,000; $2,500 or $5,000 in this new game.\"",
      "Mega Millions drawings are held Tuesdays and Fridays at 11 p.m. Eastern time. The first drawing under the changes will be April 8. Tickets are sold in 45 states, Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands.",
      "The biggest Mega Millions jackpot ever was $1.602 billion, won on Aug. 8, 2023, when a single winning ticket was sold in Florida.",

    "summary": "President Trump on Wednesday said he is imposing a 25% tariff on automobiles not manufactured in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday said he will put a 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S., escalating his administration's use of aggressive trade measures in an effort to boost domestic manufacturers.",
      "\"This will continue to spur growth like you haven't seen before,\" Mr. Trump said from the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon. \"We'll effectively be charging a 25% tariff. But if you build your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the new auto tariffs will take effect on April 2 and that the U.S. would start collecting the duties the following day. The president added he believes the new import duty could raise between $600 billion and $1 trillion in revenue for the U.S. over the next two years.",
      "\"This number will be used to reduce debt greatly,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Basically I view it as reducing taxes and reducing debt.\"",
      "White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who stood next to Mr. Trump during the announcement, offered a more conservative estimate of how much the new auto tariffs would raise, predicting roughly $100 billion in new revenue.",
      "Mr. Trump also reiterated his goal of making interest paid on auto loans tax deductible, while noting that such a deduction would apply only to cars made in the U.S.",
      "Tax deductions are generally only employed by high-income Americans because most taxpayers take the standard deduction, which means tax-deductible auto loans wouldn't impact low- or middle-income households.",
      "Meanwhile, car prices are \"likely to rise significantly\" for consumers, according to Rella Suskin, equity analyst at Morningstar in a Thursday research note. Suskin added, \"Domestically produced vehicles are expected to gain market share, but very few, even from US-based manufacturers, are made with 100% U.S. content.\"",
      "Automaker shares take a hit",
      "The latest salvo of tariffs comes after Mr. Trump earlier this month gave a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers from the round of import duties that took effect on March 4.",
      "Because tariffs are taxes on imports that are largely passed onto U.S. consumers, they can cause households to cut back on spending and dampen economic growth, according to experts.",
      "Shares of the Big Three U.S. automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis \u2014 all sank after Mr. Trump announced the new tariffs. In Thursday morning trading, Ford's shares slipped 38 cents, or 3.7% to $9.92, while GM tumbled 7.3%. Stellantis shed 2.6%.",
      "Tesla shares, which have slumped this year because of disappointing sales and\u00a0consumer unhappiness\u00a0over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, rose $7.13, or 2.6%, to $279.19. Tesla manufactures its vehicles within the U.S., although Musk said on social media that the electric vehicle maker will still feel an impact. Some Tesla parts are imported from other countries.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X.",
      "In a statement Wednesday night, Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, a U.S. trade group that represents the Big Three, said that \"U.S. Automakers are committed to President Trump's vision of increasing automotive production and jobs in the U.S. and will continue to work with the Administration on durable policies that help Americans.\"",
      "Tesla warns that Trump's trade war could hurt U.S. automakers",
      "Tesla warns that Trump's trade war could hurt U.S. automakers",
      "Blunt added, \"In particular, it is critical that tariffs are implemented in a way that avoids raising prices for consumers and that preserves the competitiveness of the integrated North American automotive sector that has been a key success of the President's USMCA agreement.\"",
      "When reached for comment, Stellantis directed CBS News to the AAPC's statement.",
      "Mr. Trump has long said that tariffs on auto imports would be a\u00a0defining policy\u00a0of his presidency, betting that the costs created by the taxes would lead both American and foreign automakers to relocate production to U.S. soil.",
      "Automakers with U.S. plants still depend on Canada, Mexico and other nations for parts and finished vehicles. Because booting up manufacturing facilities would take time, in the medium term domestic auto prices would likely increase and car sales decline, experts say.",
      "Car prices could jump",
      "One analysis of Mr. Trump's tariffs estimated that auto prices could rise as much as\u00a0$12,200 for some models\u00a0due to the new import duties, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"In the long-run, this could boost domestic investment and production. In the short-run, however, it will be inflationary and, assuming that domestic producers respond by substantially increasing their own prices, could make new vehicles something of a luxury item,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "Targeting imported cars also could strain ties with key trading U.S. partners including Canada, Japan, Mexico and South Korea, as well as Europe.",
      "\"I deeply regret the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on EU automotive exports,\" Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a social media post. \"Tariffs are taxes \u2014 bad for businesses, worse for consumers in the U.S. and the EU. The EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.\"",
      "About 50% of cars sold in the U.S. are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany, also major suppliers.",
      "Other groups expressed support for the new auto tariffs.",
      "\"Auto production is the bedrock of a nation's manufacturing ecosystem,\" Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, an industry trade group, said in a statement posted social media. \"We've seen it eroded in the U.S. over the past four decades first by Asian imports then by NAFTA. A 25% tariff on auto imports isn't the only way to spur more auto plants here, but it is in my view necessary.\"",
      "Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, said the tariffs could bolster job growth in the U.S. \"With these tariffs, thousands of good-paying blue-collar auto jobs could be brought back to working-class communities across the United States within a matter of months, simply by adding additional shifts or lines in a number of underutilized auto plants,\" he said.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 09:53:55 -0400",
    "summary": "Starting today, the Social Security Administration will again take 100% of a beneficiary's check to recoup overpayments. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Some Social Security recipients could soon find themselves in the crosshairs of a policy that advocates for seniors say could cause financial hardship for many older Americans.",
      "Starting today, the Social Security Administration will begin clawing back overpayments from the retirement program by taking 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check until the money is repaid, up from the prior rate of 10%. The policy will impact new cases of overpayments starting on March 27. The benefits withholding rate for people who were overpaid before that date will remain at 10%.",
      "The agency's 100% recovery rate was announced earlier this month by SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, who has worked with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut costs at the agency by firing thousands of workers and closing field offices.",
      "Dudek has\u00a0described the 100% clawback rate as part of the agency's responsibility to recover overpaid funds. But advocates for older Americans say the policy will cause financial distress for many people, especially those who rely on the program for all or most of their income.",
      "\"If an overpayment is being made, that means the Social Security Administration is withholding 100% of their payment for however long it takes to repay the agency \u2014 and they are without money to pay for food\" or other living expenses, Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy for the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The clawback policy could prove especially hard on the 40% of Social Security beneficiaries who rely on the program for 90% of more of their income, he added.",
      "In many cases, Social Security overpayments are the fault of agency, with a\u00a02022 report\u00a0by its inspector general finding that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Social Security Administration in 2024\u00a0capped the clawback rate at 10%, stepping back from its prior 100% level following reports that the higher rate had pushed some Americans into financial hardship and even\u00a0homelessness.",
      "\"The thing is, this administration has said, 'We're going back to the old way, we're getting 100% of the money back going forward,'\" CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger told CBS News.",
      "Can you avoid a Social Security overpayment?",
      "In some cases, overpayments are due to miscalculations on the part of the Social Security Administration, or because the agency doesn't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way. That can make it difficult for seniors to know if they're getting paid too much.",
      "But it's also important for beneficiaries to update the SSA with their latest information, such as increases in their income that can lead to overpayments. The importance of updating the agency about such changes may not be fully appreciated by some beneficiaries because of the complexity of the Social Security system, the agency's inspector general said in a 2024 report.",
      "\"We urge beneficiaries to keep a close eye on their benefits going forward,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director of The Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group for older Americans. \"If they notice any unscheduled changes to their benefits, they should contact Social Security immediately.\"",
      "It's important to keep records of your payments and flag any issues, such as if your check is larger than it previously was, Schlesinger said. \"Unfortunately the onus is on us\" to correct the record, she added.",
      "DOGE cuts, long waits",
      "Because of DOGE's job cuts at the Social Security Administration and the closure of agency field offices, it's recently become more difficult for seniors and other beneficiaries to contact the agency to report changes or ask for help, Adcock said.",
      "Those issues arose in a Tuesday Senate confirmation hearing for President Trump's nominee for Social Security commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who said that only about 46% of phone calls to the agency are answered \"because people get discouraged and hang up\" due to long wait times.",
      "Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican from Montana, told Bisignano that one of his staffers this week called the agency's 800 number to assess the level of customer service, but was disconnected three times, once after being on hold for an hour.",
      "\"We've got a lot of work to do to serve the taxpayers in this country,\" Daines said.",
      "Improvements to Social Security?",
      "In the hearing, Bisignano also said he wants to reduce what the agency calls \"improper payments,\" which include both overpayments and underpayments to beneficiaries. Currently, about 1% of Social Security's annual payments are improper, with Bisignano saying he believes that rate should be \"five decimal points to the right.\"",
      "Yet enhancing the accuracy of benefits will likely take a large investment in Social Security because it would require changes in systems, technology and other resources, Benton said.",
      "\"While improvements are possible, achieving such a low error rate is challenging due to the complexity of Social Security benefits and past challenges with fraud and reporting errors,\" she said. \"Some progress is likely and will probably be incremental, but a significant reduction over the next four years will be extremely challenging.\"",
      "In the meantime, seniors and other Social Security recipients should watch their benefits closely and report changes in their income to the agency. And if people receives a beneficiary letter from the agency, they can also request a waiver, which can be made through\u00a0SSA form 632.",
      "\"While we believe that overpayments should be recouped, we believe it's essential that beneficiaries have time to plan, and not face undue pressure from an almost immediate 100% reduction in benefits,\" Benton said.",

      "The so-called \"X-date\" marks when the government could run out of borrowing power and face an unprecedented default without action from Congress to address the debt limit, which caps how much the Treasury can borrow to pay the government's obligations.

Since January, the Treasury Department has been using \"extraordinary measures\" to pay its bills and extend the date when it will run out of money. Raising the debt limit doesn't greenlight new spending, but allows the government to pay what it already owes. The U.S. national debt currently stands at more than $36 trillion.",

      "\"While Mr. Bisignano was the unconfirmed nominee to lead the Social Security Administration, he frequently spoke with senior SSA executives and was personally briefed on key SSA operations, personnel and management decisions,\" the letter from the former SSA employee claimed.",
      "Under questioning by Wyden, Bisignano said during the hearing that he had not, between the time he was nominated in December and Tuesday, March 25, been involved in discussions with DOGE.",
      "The Social Security Administration delivers more than $1.6 trillion annually in benefits to 70 million seniors, disabled people and children, with the monthly benefit checks providing a major source of retirement income to many older Americans. At the same time, Social Security is facing a potential financial crunch, with the program set to cut benefits starting in 2035 because its spending is outpacing income.",
      "Here's what Bisignano said during the hearing.",
      "Who is Frank Bisignano?",
      "Bisignano has served as the chief executive of Fiserv, a financial technology company, since July 2020. Under his leadership, Fiserv's stock price has more than doubled, while the company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.",
      "Prior to serving as CEO of Fiserv, he was the chairman and CEO of First Data Corp., and oversaw the merger of First Data and Fiserv in 2019. Earlier in his career, Bisignano worked as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and had also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",
      "What does Bisignano say about Social Security?",
      "In an interview with CNBC in February, Bisignano said he views Social Security as both a technology and services organization, while pledging not to make any changes that affect the level of benefits.",
      "\"The objective isn't to touch benefits,\" Bisignano told CNBC. \"The objective is there is going to be fraud, waste and abuse in there,\" adding that he views himself as \"fundamentally a DOGE person.\"",
      "During Tuesday's hearing, the executive also said he plans to use artificial intelligence to identify and weed out fraud, waste or abuse within the system. He repeatedly referred to the current 1% payments error rate, which he said he believes is \"five decimal places too high.\" He added that he plans to \"focus on what we need to do to drive the 1% error rate down.\"",
      "Bisignano said part of that effort will start with what he described as an unsatisfied workforce at the agency.",
      "\"My objective is to come in and motivate the workforce we have ... to be able to get our job right the first time for the American public,\" Bisignano said in response to questioning.",
      "Mr. Trump and Musk have claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are well over 100 years old are improperly and routinely drawing benefits from Social Security, a claim that has been refuted by the acting Social Security Administration commissioner.",
      "The program also automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "On protecting Americans' data",
      "A key concern among some Social Security recipients and lawmakers is the potential exposure of millions of Americans' personal data after DOGE employees accessed the agency's systems. Bisignano claimed he is committed to protecting that data.",
      "When Sen. Wyden asked Bisignano if he would \"lock DOGE out of databases\" that workers have accessed, the nominee said that personally identifiable information \"will not be exposed.\"",
      "\"I am going to do whatever is required to protect the information,\" he said.",
      "On privatization and agency cuts",
      "Bisignano repeatedly said he had not thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in \"tech bros and private equity folks\" to \"save\" it.",
      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "\"I've only been given one order, which is to run the agency in the right fashion,\" Mr. Bisignano said.",
      "Regarding customer service enhancements, Bisignano stressed the importance of meeting beneficiaries where they are, such as by providing customer service via phone as well as in person and online. He also touted his company's experience handling 400 million phone calls per year, compared to the estimated 80 million calls that SSA fields annually.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's nominee to run the Social Security Administration (SSA), Frank Bisignano, vowed to crack down on fraud and to protect Americans' personal data in a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday. He also dismissed suggestions that he supports privatizing a federal agency that provides retirement, disability and other benefits to more than 70 million Americans.",
      "Like other government agencies, the SSA has been targeted for major job cuts by Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0(DOGE), a reduction in force that former agency officials and other experts warn could greatly hinder the delivery of services to Social Security recipients.",
      "In February, the SSA\u00a0announced\u00a0it would slash 7,000 of its 57,000 workers. Former SSA Commissioner Martin O'Malley, who led the agency under the Biden administration from December 2023 to November 2024, expects the actual number to be\u00a0closer to 10,000 workers.",
      "Who is Frank Bisignano?",
      "Even before his inauguration in January, Mr. Trump\u00a0announced\u00a0the nomination of Bisignano, CEO of financial technology company Fiserv, calling him a business leader \"with a tremendous track record of transforming large corporations.\" In a social media post, Mr. Trump highlighted Bisignano's \"long career leading financial services institutions through great transformation.\"",
      "Bisignano has served as Fiserv's chief executive since July 2020, and the company has seen strong growth during his tenure. Fiserv's stock price, which was around $100 when Bisignano took the helm, has more than doubled since then. The company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.",
      "Previously, Bisignano led Fiserv's 2019 merger with First Data Corp., where he\u00a0had been\u00a0chairman and CEO since 2013. He is credited in his bio with turning the payment processor into a \"technology innovator.\"",
      "Prior to leading First Data, Bisignano had a career on Wall Street as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",
      "What are potential concerns about Bisignano leading SSA?",
      "In a\u00a0March 23 letter\u00a0to Bisignano, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden \u2014 both members of the Senate panel that will consider his nomination \u2014 expressed concern about the\u00a0ongoing cost-cutting efforts at the agency.",
      "\"We write regarding our concerns about the Trump Administration's ongoing efforts \u2014 in conjunction with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) \u2014 to hollow out the Social Security Administration (SSA) and deprive Americans of Social Security benefits they earned and need,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"In recent days, SSA officials have intensified their efforts to undermine the program, imposing burdensome administrative requirements on beneficiaries while simultaneously cutting thousands of agency jobs and closing dozens of Social Security offices.\"",
      "On the campaign trail in 2024, Mr. Trump\u00a0promised not to touch\u00a0the Social Security program, which provides monthly financial payments to\u00a0roughly\u00a01 in 5 Americans.",
      "Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, also want Bisignano to vow not to privatize any part of Social Security, a move they say would benefit private-sector players like Fiserv.",
      "\"Already, financial services firms are salivating at the possibility of profiting off of Americans' hard-earned retirement benefits,\" the lawmakers said in their letter. \"Even your own payment firm, Fiserv \u2014 which 'enables money movement for thousands of financial institutions and millions of people' \u2014 could theoretically benefit form a privatization of Social Security.\"",
      "By contrast, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo and an Idaho Republican, said in a March\u00a0statement\u00a0that Bisignano's private-sector experience \"make him exceptionally qualified for the task ahead.\"",
      "In his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Bisignano repeatedly said he hasn't thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in \"tech bros and private equity folks\" to \"save\" it.",

      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "What do advocates for seniors have to say?",
      "Some advocacy groups that represent older Americans also question if Bisignano is the right person to lead the SSA.",
      "\"Mr. Bisignano's experience in the private sector could bring some fresh ideas to the SSA. Still, we are concerned about whether he's truly ready to handle the complexities of such an important public service,\" The Senior Citizens League (TSCL), a nonprofit that advocates for benefits recipients, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Will he fully understand the struggles of many Social Security recipients or connect with their challenges? That remains to be seen,\" TSCL Executive Director Shannon Benton said. \"The key issue is finding the right balance between introducing new ideas and protecting Social Security as an essential public program.\"",
      "After Bisignano was nominated in December, the Alliance for Retired Americans, an advocacy organization founded by the AFL-CIO, also raised questions about his lack of experience dealing with social services for seniors and disabled people.",
      "\"Nothing in Mr. Bisignano's career suggests that he understands the unique needs of older and disabled Americans. His record in the private sector doesn't instill confidence that he will protect beneficiaries from plans to dismantle and replace the SSA workforce with AI chatbots,\" Richard Fiesta, executive director at the Alliance, said in a statement at the time.",

    "story": [
      "Americans are increasingly anxious about their financial prospects, with a closely watched gauge of consumer confidence slumping to a 12-year low amid growing concerns about tariffs and inflation.",
      "The Conference Board said\u00a0Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell 7.2 points in March to 92.9, the fourth straight monthly decline and its lowest level since January of 2021. The reading was short of analysts expectations for a reading of 94.5, according to a survey by FactSet.",
      "The consumer confidence index measures both Americans' assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months. The business group found that the measure of Americans' short-term expectations for income, business and the job market fell 9.6 points to 65.2. That's the lowest reading in 12 years and well below the threshold of 80, which the Conference Board says can signal a potential recession in the near future.",
      "The proportion of U.S. consumers anticipating a recession remains at a nine-month high, the board reported.",
      "\"Consumer confidence has come under a microscope in recent months as investors worry about retail sales and consumer spending \u2014 the engine of the U.S. economy,\" Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at eToro, said in an email. \"If consumer confidence continues to sag, it stands to reason that consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of U.S. GDP, could also come under pressure.\"",
      "Consumer optimism has \"largely vanished\"",
      "\"Consumers' optimism about future income \u2014 which had held up quite strongly in the past few months \u2014 largely vanished, suggesting worries about the economy and labor market have started to spread into consumers' assessments of their personal situations,\" Stephanie Guichard, senior economist at The Conference Board, said in a statement.",
      "\"Like the Michigan survey results, this index says that consumers are rattled,\" added Carl Weinburg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, referring to the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers, which earlier this month showed that consumer sentiment had fallen to a two-year low. \"Their current situation is not so bad, but a growing do not feel so good about the future,\" he added.",
      "The Trump administration has largely played down the souring mood among Americans, saying it doesn't necessarily reflect what's happening in the actual economy. This argument is similar to what officials in former President Biden's administration said as high inflation dented consumer confidence without undermining growth.",
      "\"I just don't think that there's been a very strong correlation between the confidence data and actual consumer spending in recent years,\" Stephen Miran, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told CNBC on Tuesday. \"You go out in the street, people are going about their lives, you know, they're getting their paychecks, they're spending their paychecks, the economy is marching on ahead.\"",
      "Yet some of the nation's biggest retailers, who have noted a shift in consumer behavior, are telling a different story.",
      "Walmart and others lower profit forecasts",
      "Walmart has thrived with Americans trying to offset higher prices by seeking bargains. Late last month, however, the nation's largest retailer slashed its profit forecast for this year. Its sales outlook was also conservative and the company does not include the potential impact of tariffs in its expectations for 2025.",
      "Target's sales and profit slipped during the crucial holiday quarter, and the company predicted that there would be \"meaningful pressure\" on its profits to start the year in part because of tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China.",
      "Macy's, Best Buy, Abercrombie & Fitch, Dollar General and others also have grown cautious about their expectations for 2025, with many citing \"economic uncertainty.\"",
      "Home and car sales decline",
      "The Conference Board's survey showed that demand for both homes and cars has waned. However, in somewhat of a surprise given respondents' anxiety about the future, intentions to buy big-ticket items like appliances increased in March. The group said that could reflect a desire to buy before U.S. tariffs kick in, leading to price increases.",
      "While inflation has retreated from the highs during the post-pandemic rebound, it has remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target. It is also important to note that while inflation isn't at the 9% high we saw in summer 2022, prices are still rising, just at a slower pace. Consumers have seen cumulative price increases above 20% since the inflation crisis began \u2014 higher than their income.",
      "\"Until there's more certainty on the tariff and macro front, sentiment and confidence remain vulnerable,\" eToro's Kenwell said.",
      "Consumers had appeared increasingly confident heading into the year-end holidays and spent generously. One month later, however, in January, U.S. retail sales fell sharply, though cold weather shared some of the blame.",
      "\"Consumers are spooked by headlines about higher tariffs and trade war, DOGE cuts and the stock market sell-off,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in a research note. \"When people fear for their jobs, they will cut back on discretionary spending on vacations and going out, and delay big purchases like new houses, cars, or appliances,\" he added.",
      "Adams predicts a weakening in discretionary consumer spending in the near-term, but sees a potential break in the clouds further ahead if, perhaps in 2026, tariff talk is replaced by tax cuts.",

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other Trump officials allegedly used Signal for a group chat to discuss a highly sensitive operation.",
    "story": [
      "An encrypted messaging app called Signal is drawing attention and questions after top Trump officials \u2014 including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 allegedly used the service to discuss a highly sensitive military operation while inadvertently including The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, in the chat.",
      "On Monday, Goldberg published a piece in The Atlantic about how he was added to an 18-person chat on Signal earlier this month to discuss military strikes in Yemen, writing that at first he \"didn't think it could be real.\"",
      "The National Security Council said the messages seem to be \"authentic,\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "The use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations is raising questions about the app, including its level of security against hackers and other bad actors. It's an app that many Americans may not be familiar with, given that Signal had about 70 million users in 2024, a fraction of the 1 billion active monthly users of Apple's iMessage, according to the national security publication Lawfare.",
      "President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he had asked national security adviser Mike Waltz, who Goldberg said added him to the group chat, to \"immediately study\" the use of Signal by government officials.",
      "Here's what to know about the service.",
      "What is Signal?",
      "Signal is an encrypted service for text messaging, but it can also handle phone and video calls, making it a versatile app for talking on a secure channel with others. Up to 1,000 people can join a group chat, and messages can be set to disappear after a period of time.",
      "Signal has been gaining users because of its end-to-end encryption, which is boosting its \"adoption during uncertain times or specific events which reinforce its position as the go-to communication service,\" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Its encryption prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. In other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them.",
      "Unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, encryption on Signal is turned on by default. Signal also says it doesn't collect or store any sensitive information.",
      "\"Signal messages and calls cannot be accessed by us or other third parties because they are always end-to-end encrypted, private and secure,\" according to the service.",
      "Signal didn't immediately reply to a request for comment about the Trump administration's use of the app.",
      "Who owns Signal?",
      "Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up by co-founders Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton to support the app's operations as well as \"investigate the future of private communication,\" according to the foundation's website. The foundation says it is a nonprofit \"with no advertisers or investors, sustained only by the people who use and value it.\"",
      "The foundation's board has five members, including Marlinspike and Acton, who co-founded WhatsApp and donated $50 million to set up the foundation.",
      "The Signal app was created more than a decade ago by Marlinspike, an entrepreneur, who was briefly head of product security at Twitter after he sold his mobile security startup, called Whisper Systems, to the social media company in 2011. Marlinspike merged two existing open source apps, one for texting and one for voice calls, to create Signal.",
      "Can Signal be hacked?",
      "Signal touts the privacy of its service, and experts agree it is more secure than conventional texting.",
      "But they also caution that it could be hacked. And in February 2025, the National Security Agency sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees cautioning them of vulnerabilities in the Signal app, according to internal NSA documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin says.",
      "Signal\u00a0responded\u00a0to the bulletin in a social media post Tuesday, saying the NSA's \"memo used the term 'vulnerability' in relation to Signal-but it had nothing to do with Signal's core tech. It was warning against phishing scams targeting Signal users.\"",
      "\"Phishing isn't new, and it's not a flaw in our encryption or any of Signal's underlying technology,\" the company said. \"Phishing attacks are a constant threat for popular apps and websites.\"",
      "Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings. But in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration.",
      "\"Unlike other end-to-end encryption messaging services, Signal does boast a rich range of features,\" Pescatore said. \"However, hackers are always on the prowl to find weaknesses and use apps maliciously.\"",
      "What is Signal typically used for?",
      "Because of its end-to-end encryption, Signal is often used by national security and intelligence professionals, as well as activists, among others, according to Lawfare.",
      "A recent\u00a0Associated Press review\u00a0found that encrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, with some using government mobile phone numbers, while others registered their accounts to personal numbers.",
      "Are there legal issues for government officials using Signal?",
      "Possibly, yes. Sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act, CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a nonsecure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "While Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Tuesday that \"I don't know anything about Signal, I wasn't involved in this,\" he indicated that other branches of government use the app.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" he said. \"A lot of the military, I think successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Signal is the \"No. 1 device or app that is used\" that he had asked Waltz to explore its use by government officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are\u00a0demanding an investigation\u00a0into why highly\u00a0sensitive information\u00a0was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "The Atlantic's Goldberg also alleged that some of the messages in the group chat were designed to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",

    "story": [
      "PLEASANTVILLE, Iowa \u2014 Zach Mecham has heard politicians demand that Medicaid recipients work or lose their benefits. He also has run into a jumble of Medicaid rules that effectively prevent many people with disabilities from holding full-time jobs.",
      "\"Which is it? Do you want us to work or not?\" he said.",
      "Mecham, 31, relies on the public insurance program to pay for services that help him live on his own despite a disability caused by muscular dystrophy. He uses a wheelchair to get around and a portable ventilator to breathe.",
      "A paid assistant stays with Mecham at night. Then a home health aide comes in the morning to help him get out of bed, go to the bathroom, shower, and get dressed for work at his online marketing business. Without the assistance, he would have to shutter his company and move into a nursing home, he said.",
      "Private health insurance plans generally do not cover such support services, so he relies on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by federal and state governments and covers millions of Americans who have low incomes or disabilities.",
      "Like most other states, Iowa has a Medicaid \"buy-in program,\" which allows people with disabilities to join Medicaid even if their incomes are a bit higher than would typically be permitted. About two-thirds of such programs charge premiums, and most have caps on how much money participants can earn and save.",
      "Some states have raised or eliminated such financial caps for people with disabilities. Mecham has repeatedly traveled to the Iowa Capitol to lobby legislators to follow those states' lead. The \"Work Without Worry\" bill would remove income and asset caps and instead require Iowans with disabilities to pay 6% of their incomes as premiums to remain in Medicaid. Those fees would be waived if participants pay premiums for employer-based health insurance, which would help cover standard medical care.",
      "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs can prevent participants from working full time or accepting promotions. \"It's a trap \u2014 a poverty trap,\" said Stephen Lieberman, a policy director for the United Spinal Association, which supports the changes.",
      "Lawmakers in Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, and New Jersey have introduced bills to address the issue this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Several other states have raised or eliminated their program's income and asset caps. Iowa's proposal is modeled on a Tennessee law passed last year, said Josh Turek, a Democratic state representative from Council Bluffs. Turek, who is promoting the Iowa bill, uses a wheelchair and earned two gold medals as a member of the U.S. Paralympics basketball team.",
      "Proponents say allowing people with disabilities to earn more money and still qualify for Medicaid would help ease persistent worker shortages, including in rural areas where the working-age population is shrinking.",
      "Turek believes now is a good time to seek expanded employment rights for people with disabilities, since Republicans who control the state and federal governments have been touting the value of holding a job. \"That's the trumpet I've been blowing,\" he said with a smile.",
      "The Iowa Legislature has been moving to require many nondisabled Medicaid recipients to work or to document why they can't. Opponents say most Medicaid recipients who can work already do so, and the critics say work requirements add red tape that is expensive to administer and could lead Medicaid recipients to lose their coverage over paperwork issues.",
      "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has made Medicaid work requirements a priority this year. \"If you can work, you should. It's common sense and good policy,\" the Republican governor told legislators in January in her \"Condition of the State Address.\" \"Getting back to work can be a lifeline to stability and self-sufficiency.\"",
      "Her office did not respond to KFF Health News' queries about whether Reynolds supports eliminating income and asset caps for Iowa's buy-in program, known as Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities.",
      "Spouse's income counts toward cap",
      "National disability rights activists say income and asset caps on Medicaid buy-in programs discourage couples from marrying or even pressure them to split up if one or both partners have disabilities. That's because in many states a spouse's income and assets are counted when determining eligibility.",
      "In Iowa, for example, the monthly net income cap is $3,138 for a single person and $4,259 for a couple.",
      "Iowa's current asset cap for a single person in the Medicaid buy-in plan is $12,000. For a couple, that cap rises only to $13,000. Countable assets include investments, bank accounts, and other things that could be easily converted to cash, but not a primary home, vehicle, or household furnishings.",
      "\"You have couples who have been married for decades who have to go through what we call a 'Medicaid divorce,' just to get access to these supports and services that cannot be covered in any other way,\" said Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities.",
      "Town said some states, including Massachusetts, have removed income caps for people with disabilities who want to join Medicaid. She said the cost of adding such people to the program is at least partially offset by the premiums they pay for coverage and the increased taxes they contribute because they are allowed to work more hours. \"I don't think it has to be expensive\" for the state and federal governments, she said.",
      "Congress has considered a similar proposal to allow people with disabilities to work more hours without losing their Social Security disability benefits, but that bill has not advanced.",
      "Although most states have Medicaid buy-in programs, enrollment is relatively low, said Alice Burns, a Medicaid analyst at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Fewer than 200,000 people nationwide are covered under the options, Burns said. \"Awareness of these programs is really limited,\" she said, and the income limits and paperwork can dissuade potential participants.",
      "In states that charge premiums for Medicaid buy-in programs, monthly fees can range from $10 to 10% of a person's income, according to a KFF analysis of 2022 data.",
      "Iowa bill to remove caps",
      "The Iowa proposal to remove income and asset caps has drawn bipartisan backing from legislators, including a 20-0 vote of approval from the House Health and Human Services Committee. \"This aligns with things both parties are aiming to do,\" said state Rep. Carter Nordman, a Republican who chaired a subcommittee meeting on the bill. Nordman said he supports the idea but wants to see an official estimate of how much it would cost the state to let more people with disabilities participate in the Medicaid buy-in program.",
      "Mecham, the citizen activist lobbying for the Iowa bill, said he hopes it allows him to expand his online marketing and graphic design business, \"Zach of All Trades.\"",
      "On a recent morning, health aide Courtnie Imler visited Mecham's modest house in Pleasantville, a town of about 1,700 people in an agricultural region of central Iowa. Imler chatted with Mecham while she used a hoist to lift him out of his wheelchair and onto the toilet. Then she cleaned him up, brushed his hair, and helped him put on jeans and a John Deere T-shirt. She poured him a cup of coffee and put a straw in it so he could drink it on his own, swept the kitchen floor, and wiped the counters. After about an hour, she said goodbye.",
      "After getting cleaned up and dressed, Mecham rolled his motorized wheelchair over to his plain wooden desk, fired up his computer, and began working on a social media video for a client promoting a book. He scrolled back and forth through footage of an interview she'd done, so he could pick the best clip to post online. He also shoots video, takes photos, and writes advertising copy.",
      "Mecham loves feeling productive, and he figures he could work at least twice as many hours if not for the risk of losing Medicaid coverage. He said he's allowed to make a bit more money than Iowa Medicaid's standard limit because he signed up for a federal option under which he eventually expects to work his way off Social Security disability payments.",
      "There are several such options for people with disabilities, but they all involve complicated paperwork and frequent reports, he said. \"This is such a convoluted system that I have to navigate to build any kind of life for myself,\" he said. Many people with disabilities are intimidated by the rules, so they don't apply, he said. \"If you get it wrong, you lose the health care your life depends on.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-infrastructure-c-engineers-slightly-better-4-years-ago/",
    "published": "Tue, 25 Mar 2025 09:34:50 -0400",
    "summary": "A once-every-four-year report card on the upkeep of America's infrastructure gave it a \"C\" grade in 2025, up slightly from previous reports.",
    "story": [
      "A once-every-four-year report card on the upkeep of America's infrastructure\u00a0gave it a \"C\" grade on Tuesday, up slightly from previous reports, largely due to investments made during former President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The report from the American Society of Civil Engineers, which examined everything from roads and dams to drinking water and railroads, warns that federal funding must be sustained or increased to avoid further deterioration and escalating costs.",
      "\"We have seen the investments start to pay off, but we still have a lot of work to do out there,\" said Darren Olson, chair of this year's report. He said decrepit infrastructure \u2014 from poor roads that damage cars to delayed flights to power outages that spoil groceries \u2014 hurts people and the economy.",
      "\"By investing in our infrastructure, we're making our economy more efficient, we're making it stronger (and) we're making ourselves globally more competitive,\" he said.",
      "The report was the first ever not to have any categories with a D-minus grade, CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave notes.",
      "Eight categories saw grade increases, Van Cleave says. Many of them had been chronically stuck at D-minus or D for years",
      "Olson said it's especially critical that infrastructure can handle more extreme weather due to climate change, pointing to hurricanes that devastated the East Coast and parts of Appalachia last year. The U.S. saw 27 weather disasters last year that cost at least $1 billion, the second-most since 1980.",
      "The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided $550 billion in new infrastructure investments but is set to expire in 2026. Another $30 billion came from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, including for projects focused on clean energy and climate change, the engineering group said.",
      "President Trump's administration has targeted some of Biden's green policies. Public parks improved to a C-minus from a D-plus, for example, thanks in part to significant investments over several years. Recently, however, the Trump administration moved to slash National Park Service staffing.",
      "Massive spending needed",
      "In 2021, the U.S. earned a C-minus overall. The investments made since then are just a fraction of the $9.1 trillion the civil engineers group estimates is needed to bring all of the nation's current infrastructure into a state of good repair.",
      "Even if current federal infrastructure funding were maintained, there still would be a $3.7 trillion gap over a decade, according to the report.",
      "The bill to upgrade and maintain the nation's roughly 50,000 water utilities, for example, is $625 billion over the next two decades, according to the federal government. The grade for drinking water was C-minus, unchanged from four years ago.",
      "Many communities already struggling to maintain old, outdated drinking water systems also face new requirements to replace lead service lines and reduce per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, collectively known as PFAS.",
      "The infrastructure bill helped complete or start \"a lot of really important projects,\" said Scott Berry, director of policy and governmental affairs at the US Water Alliance. \"But the gap has widened so much over the last couple of decades that a lot, lot more investment is going to be needed.\"",
      "The bill also provided billions to help the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers upgrade inland waterways, which move roughly $150 billion in commerce every year, improving the grade from a D-plus to a C-minus.",
      "Barges on the Mississippi River, for example, carry enormous amounts of coal, soybeans, corn and other raw materials to international markets. But critical infrastructure like locks and dams \u2014 many built more than a half-century ago and requiring regular maintenance and repair \u2014 is often invisible to the public, making it easy to neglect, said Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition.",
      "And when big projects are funded, it too often comes in stages, he said. That forces projects to pause until more money is appropriated, driving up costs for materials and labor.",
      "\"If we really want to make the taxpayer dollars stretch further, you have got to be able to bring a greater degree of predictability and reliability in how you fund these projects,\" he said.",
      "The report's focus on engineering and money misses the importance of adopting policies that could improve how people use and pay for infrastructure, according to Clifford Winston, a microeconomist in the Brookings Institution's economic studies program.",
      "\"You fail to make the most efficient use of what you have,\" said Winston. For example, he noted that congestion pricing like that recently adopted by New York City\u00a0\u2014 charging people to drive in crowded areas \u2014 places the burden on frequent users and can pressure people to drive less, reducing the need for new bridges, tunnels and repairs.",
      "Roads remain in chronically poor shape, receiving a D-plus compared to a D in the last report, despite $591 billion in investments since 2021.",
      "Aviation also came in with a D-plus, Van Cleave notes.",
      "Two categories, rail and energy, received lower grades. Disasters like the derailment of a train carrying dangerous chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio, in 2023 lowered rail's previous B mark to a B-minus.",
      "The energy sector, stressed by surging demand from data centers and electric vehicles, got a D-plus, down from C-minus.",
      "Invest now or pay more later",
      "Engineers say problems in many sectors have festered for so long that the nation must figure out how to address the shortcomings now or pay for them when systems fail.",
      "On Wednesday, a delegation of engineers will visit Washington to talk to lawmakers about the funding impacts and \"the importance of continuing that investment,\" said Olson, who said the needs are a bipartisan issue.",
      "\"When we talk about it in ways of how better infrastructure saves the American family money, how better infrastructure supports economic growth, we're really confident that ... there is strong support,\" he said."

    "story": [
      "The head of the beleaguered U.S. Postal Service, Louis DeJoy, resigned Monday after nearly five years in the position, leaving as President Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have floated the idea of privatizing mail service.",
      "DeJoy had said last month he planned to step down but hadn't set a date. He leaves an agency with an uncertain future. Mr. Trump has said he is considering putting USPS under the control of the Commerce Department in an attempt to stop losses at the $78 billion-a-year agency, which has struggled at times to balance the books with the decline of first-class mail.",
      "Deputy Postmaster General Doug Tulino will take on the role until the Postal Service Board of Governors names a permanent replacement for DeJoy, who became postmaster general in the summer of 2020 during Mr. Trump's first term. He was a Republican donor who owned a logistics business and was the first person to hold the position in nearly two decades who was not a career postal employee.",
      "DeJoy's tenure was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, surges in mail-in election ballots and efforts to stem losses through cost and service cuts.",
      "\"I believe strongly that the organization is well positioned and capable of carrying forward and fully implementing the many strategies and initiatives that comprise our transformation and modernization, and I have been working closely with the Deputy Postmaster General to prepare for this transition,\"\u00a0DeJoy said in a statement.",
      "He added that \"much work remains that is necessary to sustain our positive trajectory.\"",
      "The National Association of Letter Carriers' president, Brian L. Renfroe, said in a statement Monday that the union stands ready to work with whomever the board selects as the next postmaster general.",
      "\"The future of the Postal Service is on the line, and choosing someone with innovative ideas and appreciation for our Constitutionally mandated service is essential,\" Renfroe said.",
      "Earlier this month, DeJoy said he planned to cut 10,000 workers and billions of dollars from the USPS budget and he'd do that working with DOGE, according to a letter sent to members of Congress.",
      "USPS workers, including mail carriers, have gathered over the past week to protest the cuts and the plan they say will dismantle the service.",
      "Critics of the plan fear negative effects of the cuts will be felt across the country. Democratic U.S. Rep. Gerald Connolly, of Virginia, has said in response that turning over the service to DOGE would result in it being undermined and privatized.",
      "DeJoy had introduced in 2021 a 10-year overhaul he has orchestrated\u00a0\u2014 including higher postal rates, slower standard delivery and fewer post offices \u2014 to stem the Postal Service's financial hemorrhaging. The USPS targeted a turn to profit in fiscal 2024 but instead reported two consecutive years of increasing losses.",
      "USPS employs about 640,000 workers who make deliveries from inner cities to rural areas and far-flung islands.",

    "summary": "Taking the stage in Green Bay wearing a yellow foam cheesehead hat, Elon Musk gave out $1 million checks on Sunday to two Wisconsin voters.",
    "story": [
      "A unanimous Wisconsin Supreme Court on Sunday refused to hear a last-minute attempt by the state's Democratic attorney general to stop billionaire Elon Musk from handing over\u00a0$1 million checks to two voters, a ruling that came just minutes before the start of the rally.",
      "Two lower courts had already rejected the legal challenge\u00a0by Democrat Josh Kaul, who argues that Musk's offer violates a state law. \"Wisconsin law prohibits offering anything of value to induce anyone to vote,\" Kaul argued in his filing. \"Yet, Elon Musk did just that.\"",
      "But the state Supreme Court, which is currently controlled 4-3 by liberal justices, declined to take the case as an original action. The court gave no rationale for its decision.",
      "Taking the stage in Green Bay wearing a yellow foam cheesehead hat, Musk gave out $1 million checks on Sunday to two Wisconsin voters, declaring them spokespeople for his political group.",
      "Musk painted the judicial race he has pumped more than $20 million into as pivotal for the country.",
      "Noting the likelihood the state high court will take up redistricting that could give Democrats a chance at winning two additional U.S. House seats, Musk said, \"The House majority is now razor thin.\"",
      "\"And if the (Wisconsin) Supreme Court is able to redraw the districts, they will gerrymander the district and deprive Wisconsin of two seats on the Republican side,\" Musk said. \"Then they will try to stop all the government reforms we are getting done, for you the American people.\"",
      "Wisconsin's tightly contested Supreme Court election, where ideological control of the court is at stake, is on Tuesday. The race, with the assist from Musk, has become the most expensive judicial election in American history, with more than $81 million in spending.",
      "Liberals currently hold a 4-3 majority. But five of the court's seven justices have endorsed a candidate in the race, raising potential conflicts for them to hear the Musk lawsuit.",
      "The court's liberal justices have endorsed Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, the Democratic-backed candidate. One of the court's conservative justices has endorsed Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel, who also has the backing of President Trump and Musk. Schimel wore a \"Make America Great Again Hat\" while campaigning Sunday.",
      "\"That's exactly what I've committed to anybody, whether it's President Trump, Elon Musk or any donors and donors or supporters or voters in Wisconsin. That's my commitment,\" Schimel told \"Fox News Sunday.\"",
      "It's unclear whether Schimel attended the rally.",
      "Crawford's campaign declined to comment on Kaul's legal filing, and Kaul had no immediate comment on the court's order.",
      "\"Wisconsin law prohibits offering anything of value to induce anyone to vote,\" Kaul had argued in his filing. \"Yet, Elon Musk did just that.\"",
      "Musk's political action committee used a nearly identical tactic before the presidential election last year, offering to pay $1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states who signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. A judge in Pennsylvania said prosecutors failed to show the effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day.",
      "Musk on Friday initially said in a post on his social media platform, X, that he planned to \"personally hand over\" $2 million to a pair of voters who have already cast their ballots in the race.",
      "Musk later posted a clarification, saying the money would go to people who will be \"spokesmen\" for an online petition against \"activist\" judges. After first saying the event would only be open to people who had voted in the Supreme Court race, he said attendance would be limited to those who have signed the petition.",
      "Also on Friday, Musk's political action committee identified the recipient of its first $1 million giveaway \u2014 a Green Bay man who had donated to the Wisconsin GOP and the conservative candidate in the court race, and who has a history of posting support for Trump and his agenda.",
      "The judicial election comes as Wisconsin's highest court is expected to rule on abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting rules that could affect the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election in the state.",
      "There will also be congressional elections held Tuesday in Florida that have attracted big fundraising. Florida's 6th District was vacated when National Security Adviser Mike Waltz joined Mr. Trump's Cabinet, and the 1st District was held by former Rep. Matt Gaetz, who resigned to join the Trump administration as Attorney General. He eventually withdrew his name from consideration, but he had already vacated his seat. Both districts voted for Mr. Trump by 30 points or more, but Democrats have dominated fundraising."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sue Gordon, Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence in first Trump administration, and Ret. Gen. Frank McKenzie, a CBS News contributor, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 30, 2025.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: I want to go back to the situation surrounding the administration and the officials use of Signal, a messaging app to discuss military attack plans. In our new CBS News poll- let's see three quarters of Americans say that this was, to them a serious matter matter. A total of 76% of Americans also said the use of the app to discuss military plans was to their way of thinking, not appropriate, and that included eight in 10 independents and more than half of Republicans surveyed. We turn now to Sue Gordon, who served as Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence during the first Trump administration. She is in Austin. And retired Marine Corps General Frank McKenzie, former head of US Central Command. This marks his first official appearance as a CBS News contributor, and he joins us from Tampa, Florida. Good morning to you both. Sue, I want to start with you. Just break this down for our audience. How much of this falls into anything that you would, through your career, understand to be acceptable communications about sensitive or classified information?",
      "SUE GORDON: Well, good morning, Major. Just top line without getting into classification guides. There is nothing about the information that has to do with operations that is appropriate for this communications channel- none. And- and there are other communications channels that are available for this type of thing, and the risk of loss that comes with uncontrolled communications is profound. So I don't think we need to argue at any level, whether it was appropriate for this path. Now we can talk about how that happened. We can talk about what they could have done, and we can talk about what we do next. But on the top line, this isn't what you discuss in those channels.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So when the administration, Sue, says, but nothing bad happened. Nobody got to it, so don't worry about it. How do you react to that?",
      "SUE GORDON: One, I'm glad the operation was successful- yay. But we have a saying that says that every success is a failure, where something went right. And I don't think we should rest on the fact that nothing bad happened this time. We don't know whether that communications path has been penetrated. So we don't know whether state actors that have lots of resources are just sitting and lurking now knowing that we do important things on that. Certainly the information that has now come out for any intelligence officer- and I can speak of this with great expertise, that's all super useful for the next time, or for understanding the sources, or understanding how we did the targeting, or understanding how we operate, or what our operational tempo is. So all of that information is valuable. So I'm glad the operation was successful. Now we need to deal with the fact that this should not have happened. There is consequence when it does, and you can't be sure that there is no persistent risk that follows it.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Frank, this story has forests and trees. I don't want to lose the forest. The bigger issue here is a new tempo, an increased tempo of military operations- some of them day in, day in, day in, day-in-out against the Houthis in Yemen. Evaluate that and its importance in understanding the broader context of this story.",
      "GENERAL FRANK MCKENZIE (RET.) : Sure, Major. And first of all, it's great to be with you here today. I think the larger story here is actually that we have finally begun to strike the Houthis hard. There's an old Neil Young song- I'll lift the line from it, should have been done long ago. Well, now we're beginning to do it, and we're beginning to strike effectively at a pace, a scope and a tempo that frankly, eluded the last information- the last administration. And I would argue that we're doing it because for the first time, we have the political will to employ appropriate military capability against the Houthis. And we want one of two things from the Houthis. We want them either to be deterred from attacking ships that pass through the Bab-el-Mandeb, which really means the Suez Canal. That's one condition. The other condition would be, if they won't- if they won't stop, we want to remove their capability to do it. The second task would be harder. It is within our capability. It will not be a short action. It won't be what would call a single period of darkness. These attacks will have to continue. They may grow in scope and scale. They're certainly not endless in time. And we need- we need to- we need to fix the problem and move on to other things. I think the fact that we have a second aircraft carrier that's moving to CENTCOM is certainly a sign that this administration is very serious about this requirement. The fact we're moving B-2s into the region similarly signals that. But I believe again, for the first time, we're coupling genuine political will to act along with military capability. So it's a unique- it's a unique moment in the theater, and I'm glad to see that this administration is grasping that opportunity.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Frank, the terminology you just used, deter and degrade, can that be done from a distance, meaning aerial and from ship borne armaments?",
      "GEN. MCKENZIE: So, I think we can do a very good job of that. I wouldn't take anything off the table. Again, when you take things off the table, it tends to give aid and comfort to the enemy. We've done too much of that. I think we should leave everything on the table and I would also leave on the table, actions against- against Tehran itself. All paths in this matter lead back to Tehran, and we need to know and understand that. They're the principal supplier for the Houthis and right now, Iran is finding it convenient to back pedal and to claim that close relationship. But in fact, the Houthis exist because of Iranian support, and now, to a lesser degree because of Russian support, and we need to recognize that, and we shouldn't give Iran a free ride on this. And I think we have the capability, actually, right now, in Iran's weakened state, to threaten them very strongly. And I'll just say one more thing as I close out on this, Major, the first Trump Administration did three things that put them in a unique place right now in the region. Number one, that administration struck and killed Qassem Soleimani, that's forgotten in the United States, that's not forgotten in Iran. It displayed American will at a level that has generally been absent in the region. Second thing is the signing of the Abraham Accords, which gave Israel the opportunity to enter the region diplomatically, economically and to a degree culturally. It's going to be a rough road, but I think that's only going to expand and last, the movement of Israel from the European Command into the Central Command has actually enabled the very successful defense of Israel that we've seen over the last few weeks and months, and is a huge step forward. All of these taken together give this administration a unique opportunity right now and in the months ahead to shape events in the region.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Sue, I want to go back to you, because Senator Warner on this program just a few moments ago said he's concerned that those in the Five Eyes community, meaning our top intelligence sharing allies, will look at the situation \u2013 whether it's prosecuted or not, they don't care \u2013 as careless as reckless, and they might be legitimately encouraged, therefore, to pull back. Working in the Trump administration the first time around, you worked with our partners there, you know what their sentiments are. Do you share those concerns?",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "GEN. MCKENZIE: They may express those concerns. I would argue\u2013",
      "GORDON: I think\u2013",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Frank, this is for Sue. Frank, this is for Sue.",
      "GEN. MCKENZIE: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sue, please go ahead.",
      "GORDON: Well, General, anything you have to say is worthwhile, but let me- let me- let me take a run at this. Listen, we count on our allies and partners, and protecting their equities and interests and their sources of information is really important. I- there have been, historically, errors in the past. It's not limited to this one where you find that- that one partner or another has been unable to protect a partner's information. I think what's difficult about this one is two things that the administration does need to address. One is, you really do need to tighten down on how you communicate, because my suspicion is that they were just doing something expedient, and I wish someone on the call had said, hold on, if we're going to go down this path, we need to go to a different channel. But the second thing is the way we're reacting to it when we suggest that there was nothing to see here. I think that's actually the thing that more needs to be addressed with our partners and allies, to say, yeah, we understand that this was not what we should or would have preferred to do, and so to rebuild trust that way. So it's not that there's not error. The issue is, are you doing things that inspire confidence? And I think that we know that, just from an environmental perspective, our relationships with our allies and partners are a little bit tenuous at best, so creating something that causes them to wonder whether we're trustworthy, again, to me, has a huge impact on our ability to advance the things that we want to do.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Frank, you're a CBS contributor, I'm going to give you a one minute time warning on this. Close out with your thoughts about this issue with the Signal chat.",
      "GEN. MCKENZIE: So I think Sue was spot on in her- in her analysis, I would simply argue that I believe the United States remains the indispensable nation in a lot of places. And I think I'm sure we'll learn from this. I would like to think that it won't be repeated, but I think again, it's unfortunate that the Signal chat has really sort of obscured the very good, very real work that's been done in finally addressing a problem that's dragged on far too long, which is Houthi action in the Bab-al-Mandab to close the- effectively closed the Suez Canal.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And real quick, Frank, when you looked at this, did it shock you? I mean, like, what? You're talking about that there?",
      "GEN. MCKENZIE: I was surprised.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: That's it. You're learning the whole TV thing. Frank Mackenzie and Sue Gordon, thank you very, very much. I appreciate it for your time, your expertise and pulling this all out for the audience. Thank you so much. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with House Budget Committee chairman Rep. Jodey Arrington, Republican of Texas, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 30, 2025.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We turn now to the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, Texas Congressman Jodey Arrington, who joins us this morning from New Orleans. Mr. Chairman, great to see you. Thanks for joining us. In the last month, the Dow has lost 5.14% of its value, the NASDAQ 8%, the S&P 6.2%. Consumer confidence, as you probably are aware, has dipped a bit in the last couple of months. How do you account for all of this?",
      "REP. JODEY ARRINGTON: Well, good morning to you Major. First of all, core inflation is down. Mortgage rates are down just a little bit. Food and gas prices are down. So you're going to have fluctuations in in the financial markets, but we're seeing that the fundamentals are already having an impact on the cost of living, which I think should be job number one of this President, but you've got the tariffs, which I think are critical for our long term prosperity to have that reset, have that Fair and reciprocal trade dynamic that doesn't exist today. So transitioning from the last four years to a new administration with a new economic policy agenda is going to have some adjustments that go with it, and- but I think at the end of the day, you're going to have better prospects for growth. You're going to bring down the prices and you're going to have better prospects for our future, including reducing the debt to GDP, which, as the budget chairman, I can tell you, is completely unsustainable at this point and could bankrupt our country.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Mr. Chairman, one of the top tariff advisers to the president, Peter Navarro, said this morning that tariffs are tax cuts. Are they?",
      "REP. ARRINGTON: Well, in the long run, I think having an unfair trade dynamic at the current point is suppressing growth. It's suppressing wages and suppressing job creation, so it has an adverse impact on our economy. There's no way, Major, to reset the trade dynamic that we've allowed to persist in an unfair way for so long without some disruption. The President has been very transparent about it, and he deployed the same tactics. Now, back in his first administration, successfully, we brought China and others to the table. We had a reset. We had new purchase agreements, we had structural reforms, and we benefited. We had better trade activity, we had better economic activity. And overall, wages grew and life in the American economy, and the quality of life for our fellow Americans was better, so that transition has to happen, and the only person I've seen in my life and experience in politics with the political courage to do it has been President Trump, and I support him 100%.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: When you think about the budget and the process by which to finance tax cuts, either the existing ones or new ones, you're going to count on tariff revenue, are you not?",
      "REP. ARRINGTON: Well, I think we should count on reducing spending that is runaway, bankrupting levels of spending at $2 trillion in annual deficits that will double in the next 10 years. Half of that $2 trillion is interest on the debt that will more than double in the next 10 years. So, we have a spending problem. That deficit spending is driving World War levels of debt and will bankrupt the country. So, I think we should offset the tax cuts with spending reductions and bend that debt to GDP. The revenue from tariffs could do two things, accelerate the reduction of deficit to GDP and do what the President has said he wants to happen in this America First agenda put our nation on a path to balance, but it can also provide tariff relief like he did in the first administration for farmers in West Texas, for example, with the market facilitation payments that took the sting out of the fallout from the early stages of the trade battles, before we had the reset for reciprocal trade. So, I think those are better uses of tariff revenue, but I think we've got to bring down spending. If we don't, then I don't know how much longer we have before, as Ray Dalio says, we're going to have an economic heart attack, and it will undermine everything.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Let's talk about spending for a second. As you know, Mr. Chairman, Medicaid is projected to increase 5.2% each year for the next 10 years. House Republicans have voted for $880 billion in cuts over 10 years. You and I both know you don't have to argue with me about it, that it would be a reduction of the future growth, not a pure cut, but if you lose a service as a Medicaid recipient, that's probably a distinction without a difference. Can you say that when this all gets done, alterations to Medicaid will not change the way people access that program and the health services they receive from it?",
      "REP. ARRINGTON: Major, I'll do better. I think if we don't make these changes, this program and the federal budget in general is not sustainable, because we're allowing states and local organizations to siphon hundreds of billions of dollars away from the Medicaid beneficiary and the Medicaid program. We also this is the one means tested program that doesn't have work requirements for able-bodied adults. We also have a Medicaid program because of the Obamacare expansion and the expansion population of able-bodied adults, where the federal government provides 90 cents on every dollar match for that population, but the preponderance of Medicaid beneficiaries, the blind, the disabled, the poor, the sickest among our fellow citizens, get about 60% to 65% So all of the healthcare system is oriented around the 90% the able bodied adults, and they're not providing the same access, which is to the- to the traditional Medicaid, which is why the outcomes are going down. So, there is a lot of ways to reorient the system, to make it more efficient, to root out waste and fraud, and it's well over the $800 billion. It's common sense, straightforward, and you don't have to touch a dime of the benefits.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Mr. Chairman, very quickly, the President told NBC he \"couldn't care less if foreign automakers raised prices.\" Do you care?",
      "REP. ARRINGTON: What I care about is that our workers and manufacturers in this country are competing head-to-head with China and every other competitor country that we allow their mark their products to come in our markets, open and free, and they don't, they tax our products, and it's hurting our workers. It's hurting our economic output, and we need a reset, and so there's no way to get to that dynamic, that reciprocal trade arrangement, without the tough negotiation tactics of President Trump. He was successful in the first term. We didn't create economic chaos. We didn't even have much of inflation. In fact, the economy was roaring. We had more jobs, more people out of poverty. That's what's going to happen. And I support the president, and he has to prove that he is committed to this, and I believe he is, and I think that's important if we're going to get to the other side of this.",

      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back. We are joined now by the Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Virginia Democrat Mark Warner. Senator, always a pleasure. Thanks for coming in. Two things here. We're going to talk about the chat room and we're going to talk about the raid. Let's talk about the raid first. Are you glad this administration is taking a more aggressive military posture against the Houthis and do you believe if it is successful, it will reopen commercial shipping through the Red Sea?",
      "SEN. MARK WARNER: I think we should take more affirmative action. I think the administration is doing the right thing. I would rather than do it with more of our allies involved. But the fact that Donald Trump's America First is turning quickly into America alone, but the basis of going after Houthis in a stronger, tougher way, I agree with.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The administration argues the Biden administration didn't do enough. Do you agree with that?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I think the Biden administration took repeated action against the Houthis. I think they could have done more.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: All right, now let's get to the chat room. What is your experience? Do you use Signal, for example?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Yes. Signal is safer than your normal cell phone, because the Chinese, through Salt Typhoon, have penetrated our traditional cellular networks. Signal is better, but the Chinese, the Russians, are trying to go after Signal. They've- they've made- had some successful efforts. Everyone is warned in the intelligence community, do not use Signal for classified information. It is bright, it is bold, it is a- it is cyber hygiene 101, in terms of how to stay safe.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: One of the things discussed in this chat, which the administration has said is accurate, was a reference to a high value Houthi target at his girlfriend's house somewhere in Yemen, probably Sanaa, near the capital. David Martin, my exceptional colleague here at CBS, has reported that the Israelis are furious about this because they believe those who would read that could sort of backward engineer that and find something out that they shouldn't find out. Do you agree with that? What do you think the implications of that are?",
      "SEN. WARNER : I have not seen any of the classified information about this, so I'm basing my knowledge on open source. If the Israelis are this mad, and I think they got a right to be this mad about classified information being treated sloppily, and this is a pattern. We've seen them expose CIA agents in the first two weeks. We've seen the DOGE boys print the full budget and head counts of a classified agency. So this is not a one off. And what happens if the Israelis are this mad and the Five Eye partners, our key allies, are upset, will they continue to share information with us if it's treated this sloppily. And if we don't see action taken by this administration, if someone is not held accountable, I believe Secretary Hegseth should resign or be fired. I think Mike Waltz should resign or be fired. If no action is taken, what message does that send to the workforce? Because Maj- Major, I can tell you this, if you were a military officer or a CIA agent and you treated classified information this way, you would be fired. End of story.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: When Republicans say it was a mistake and they'll never make it again, does that satisfy you?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Baloney. I'd use stronger language- Sunday morning, but it's like this is a pattern of sloppiness. I mean, think about the DOGE boys when they print all the savings and half of the information just factually wrong. This administration does not treat classified information the appropriate way, Major. We don't- we've not even seen if the phones that were used, have they been collected? Had they been checked to make sure the bad guys didn't put malware in them? That, again, would be the first action of a serious administration. I've asked the FBI Director whether he's launching an investigation. I've heard nothing back from him.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Does it give you any comfort that the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Roger Wicker, a Republican and the Democrat Jack Reed, have called for an inspector general investigation? And is that enough?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I'm glad there's that bipartisan effort. I hope there will be additional ones. I hope, frankly, I think the Department of Justice needs to look at whether laws have been broken. Because, again, put this in context, the Director of National Intelligence, I think, 12-13, days ago, boldly tweeted out, you know, anybody that leaks information should be pursued to the full extent of the law? Well, if Tulsi Gabbard believes that, is that just for others, or does that standard apply to her as well? Well, she frankly, in our hearing, one, refused to acknowledge she was even on the call to start with, wouldn't tell us if her phone was hers or the government, and then, at least initially, said there was no classified information at all. When clearly, if you've got this kind of information about time of an attack that's classified, and one of the things I'd love her or Hegseth to do is go down to the Norfolk, Virginia Beach area. I was there yesterday for a couple town halls. The aircraft carrier Truman is home ported in Norfolk. I was talking yesterday with friends and family of members who are on the Truman. Their anger level was so high because if that information had gotten out and the Houthis had been able to redirect their defensive tools, very likely, we would have had American life loss. That could've been prevented if you just have treat classified information appropriately.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Talk about something else that is of deep concern to you because you wrote the law. Oracle appears to be in deep talks with the administration about some method of acquiring Tiktok before the April 5 deadline. It's not clear whether or not China would retain ownership of the ever important algorithm within Tiktok. What do you know? What are your concerns? What's going to happen?",
      "SEN. WARNER: What I know is I believe there are four bidders. I don't know all of the bidders, but I can tell you this. If there is a result, no matter how much kind of Trump publicity around this, that suddenly we've got a new owner, if we've got a result and the algorithm resides in Beijing, it is all a sham, because the ability to manipulate that algorithm to what we see on that TikTok channel- and again, remember, China doesn't offer Tiktok to their own young people that are getting, you know, we get the crack version. And where you can manipulate information, you can put Chinese propaganda out, and if that algorithm does not move whatever transfer, then the whole thing's a sham.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And it violates the law.",
      "SEN. WARNER: And it violates the law. And the irony of this, Major, it was Donald Trump in his first administration that first pointed out the problems with TikTok. Candidly, I didn't fully agree until I did my own research and I go, holy heck, collecting data and this power of a propaganda tool, it should not be available to Americans. Eighty percent of the Congress, both parties agree.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Warner, stay right there. We'll have more questions for you, and for you at home, please stay with us, we'll be right back.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return to our conversation with Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, Vice Chair of the Intelligence Committee. So the intelligence community released its National Threat Assessment Tuesday. Among the things it said was China is going after Greenland's natural resources, saying they, China, will use the same access as a key strategic foothold for advancing China's broader and economic aims in the Arctic. The Vice President was there with his wife a couple of days ago. President Trump recently said 100% America will get Greenland, and did not rule out, if necessary, the possible use of military force in America to do that. Is Greenland a legitimate strategic issue? Point 1. Point 2, how is this administration pursuing that legitimate interest, if there is one?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Greenland has got a lot of rare earth minerals and has enormous value, just as many other places around the world do, so legitimate interests and stronger ties with Greenland, absolutely. The idea that we are going to threaten a military invasion against a population that at least everything I've read, overwhelmingly people in Greenland don't want to become part of America. The going against Denmark, who is a NATO member, who rules Greenland currently, this whole approach that Trump has of treating our allies, I mean, he turned Canada into an enemy, our allies as not allies. And suddenly wanting to buddy up with Putin in Russia or with Xi in China. Think about it. America, two weeks ago, three weeks ago, voted with Russia, North Korea, I think it was Belarus, against everyone else who was a democracy, because we wouldn't acknowledge that Putin started the war in Ukraine. This is a crazy foreign policy, and America is stronger when we have allies. America alone is weaker if we don't have that intelligence sharing, if we don't have these mutual defense pacts.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: That National Threat Assessment also had a notable shift, saying that the biggest threat to America was drug cartels, gangs, fentanyl, Islamic terrorists, not Russia and China. Do you agree?",
      "SEN. WARNER: I think the threat of drugs is awful, and we need to do more against fentanyl. I think the long term strategic technology competition with China is the issue, not just of today, but of the next 30 years, it's AI, it's quantum, it's a whole series of biotech as well. On the question of Russia, here's the remarkable thing, the intelligence assessment said Russia is still an enemy, and said Russia is still going to do malign election interference. In that document, they say that at the very same time, the Trump administration is getting rid of the election threat group inside our intelligence community, that is a complete contradiction.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Very quickly, this threat assessment does not mention climate change. It was there in the previous Trump administration and the Biden administration. Your reaction?",
      "SEN. WARNER: Denial of science doesn't mean that it's not happening. One of the reasons why Greenland in the Arctic, because we've had so much ice melt, there are a whole suddenly set of new shipping lanes. You can't deny what is happening. Call it sea level rise. Call it whatever you want. We spend hundreds of millions of dollars raising the piers each year in Norfolk because of sea level rise. You can't ignore what's happening.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Democratic Senator Mark Warner, Virginia, Vice Chair of the Senate Intelligence community. Thanks very much.",
      "SEN. WARNER: Thank you, Major.",

      "The following is the transcript of the full interview with Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on March 30, 2025.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We go now to the president of the United Auto Workers Union, Shawn Fain. Shawn, it's great to have you with us. I appreciate the time. Let's start very simply on the question of tariffs on autos and auto parts. Fundamentally, and quite simply, why do you believe those are helpful for your membership?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: Thanks for having me. Look, all you have to do is look at the history of the United States, especially in auto manufacturing in the last 30 years, with the inception of NAFTA and unfair trade laws. We've seen over 90,000 manufacturing facilities leave the United States. We've seen- in the Big Three alone, in the last 20 plus years, 65 plants have closed. You know- And so look, tariffs aren't the total solution. Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox to get these companies to do the right thing, and- and the intent behind it is to bring jobs back here. And, you know, invest in the American workers. The American working class people have been left behind for decades, and they're sick of it. You know, it's a massive struggle. People are struggling just to get- to survive right now, to get by. And so, you know- you know- you know, there's two parts to the tariffs though. I mean, the tariffs are a motivator. We have to fix the broken trade laws. And the other thing to me is, you know, these can't just be just, you know, as with the Biden administration, when they did the stuff for battery work and EV work, we had to come in and say, no, these can't just be union jobs or- or jobs. They got to be good paying union jobs that set standards. So the big part of this that gets left out a lot of times is, if they're going to bring jobs back here, you know, they need to be life sustaining jobs where people can make a good wage, a living wage, have adequate health care and have a retirement security and not have to work seven days a week or multiple jobs, just a scrape to get by, paycheck to paycheck.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Do you have assurances from the Trump administration as you dialogue with it about those things you just laid out, not just jobs, but a substantial wage, healthcare and the like?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: I mean that- I mean that is the conversation we're having naturally. I mean, we, you know, that's- that's the part of this. I mean, look, I'll be honest with you, it's- every time we speak, we talk about bringing jobs back, about bringing the manufacturing base back in this country, you know. But you know, it doesn't do any good if they're going to locate them in places and they're not going to have the opportunity to have a union, you know. And so naturally, we have concerns. We have great concerns after- after what happened last night. You know, with the stroke of a marker, you know, Trump eliminated bargaining- or eliminated contracts for 700,000 federal workers. You know, we have- we have concerns with what's going on with our higher education sector that we represent. We have members who are being detained, you know, their right to free speech being violated. We have workers at the National Institute of Health that provide vital research, and that- that is for the betterment of the people. So, you know, we have big concerns with that. So naturally, yes, every time we talk about trade, talk about tariffs, it's an integral part of that, these have to be good paying union jobs.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: I'll get back to the tariffs and autos in a second. But since you brought up this executive order, it regards an effort by the Trump administration, through the President, to stop- or certainly dramatically slow collective bargaining for federal workers. Randy Ervin [sic], who is currently the president of the National Federation of the Federal Employees, called it \"the biggest assault on collective bargaining\" he has ever seen. Do you agree with those sentiments?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: Exactly. I mean, spot on. Look, I remember when I was 12 years old when Reagan busted the PATCO workers, you know that was a massive issue back then and we've heard a lot of people talk about the labor--",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The air traffic controllers union, yes--",
      "SHAWN FAIN:\u00a0 Yes, yes. And you know that- that, you know, labor should have done more then. Look, this is 100 times worse than PATCO ever dreamed of being. When you're talking, you know, 700,000 people, their contracts just being taken away. And so, you know, as I said, you know, free speech is under attack. Unions are under attack. You look at the changes to the NLRB, you look at the situation at the Department of Labor, Department of Education, you know, Veterans Affairs. I mean, why are all these things under attack? Medicare, Social Security. It's because, you know, billionaires want more tax cuts for themselves, and that we- it's been proven time and again that's not what works for America. That's not good for the American people. The working class people in America, they want their fair share. They're not asking to be rich. They just want a decent standard of living. And again, that goes back to what we call our four core issues. You know, living wages, adequate health care, retirement security and having some quality of life other than just everything revolving around work.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So for those listening to you, Shawn, do you want them to conclude, well, if we get the tariffs and there are a few more auto jobs, it's worth all the other terrible- or maybe terrible- that's too strong a word, but all the other things you just talked about: Medicaid, free speech, collective bargaining, is that a deal that's worth them taking?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: Not at all. Let me be clear about this, you know, because I think this is being misconstrued here, there's been no change in where we stand politically as a union, and where, you know, what our stance is. Look, we've been very clear since day one of my administration. You know, we have expectations. Endorsements are earned, but at the end of the day, like we're not, we know we're not partisan to any one- any one party here. We expect, no matter what party someone comes from, to stand up for what we believe in. So just because we find common ground on tariffs or on trade doesn't mean that everything else goes out the window. It's despicable what happened last night. It's despicable some of the other things that are going on. Like I said, some of our members have been detained. You know, their jobs are being threatened, and it's unacceptable. So no, there is no trade off here, you know. So we- we continue to do what we do, and we have integrity. When we can- when we can work with a politician on an issue, and we get traction, we're going to work with them, but where we can't, we're going to be just as vocal.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Understood. Let's get back to the tariffs and the auto industry. Peter Navarro, a top adviser to the president on trade, says currently, automobile manufacturing plants are at about 60% capacity. He argues that there's lots of untapped capacity, meaning jobs could be created relatively easy, and you didn't have to need- you wouldn't need to spend two or three or maybe five years building new factories. Is that your understanding? Is that your belief?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: It's- he's spot on. Look, we have a situation right now in Warren, Michigan where 2,000 workers were laid off this past year. They- they built the Ram truck there for years under Stellantis, and Stellantis made a decision to shift that production to Mexico. They could shift that work back in- in very short order and be producing Ram trucks right back there and put those people back to work. I was just at Volkswagen this week, you know, talking with workers down there that are trying to get their first contract, and the company announced a reduction of a shift. Meanwhile, you know, Volkswagen is the biggest violator of all. They- 75% of their production for the North American market is made in Mexico, so they can shift product there overnight. There's excess capacity. You know, we- people forget this lesson in World War II. The way that we- we formed the Arsenal of Democracy that won the war was, they took the excess capacity of all the automotive manufacturing plants in the country, and produced tanks and planes and bombs and engines and all those things. And it's no different right now. We have excess capacity. They could bring work back in very short order. And yes, they're- in a situation where they need to build a new plant, yeah, that's going to take a couple years, but- but there is plenty of opportunity for these companies to do the right thing and bring work back here overnight, just as quick as they shifted out of here.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And Shawn, for people who are listening to you, how do tariffs make that happen? How do- what is the relationship between a 20 or 25% tariff and getting that capacity back up to where you'd like it to see- you'd like to see it?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: Well, because, like everything, the companies abuse the process. I mean, they- you know, they- they- they're in the pursuit of driving a race to the bottom. I mean, the tariffs are- you know, there was a major promise when NAFTA- and we go back to when NAFTA happened in 1992, the big debate, and- and Ross Perot talked about the giant sucking sound, that our manufacturing base was going to disappear. He was spot on, you know. And- and we saw what happened in the- in the ensuing 30 years. We see 90,000 plants leave. You know, like I said, we've seen 65 plants in the Big Three close. Look, right now, as we speak, in- in- in Wisconsin, we have a Deere plant threatening to be closed, and their work being- being threatened to go to Mexico. We have a heavy truck plant in- at Volvo, and Mack Truck in Pennsylvania being threatened to be taken to Mexico. There is plenty of opportunity, and that's the reality that- that we've seen here in America. So, tariffs are a tool in the toolbox. They're not the end all solution. We have to fix the broken trade system. But- but the way tariffs work, I mean, it's a motivator, because there's going to be a penalty for everything the companies ship in here, and I've had companies tell us, point blank, that they're going to have to bring product back here if those tariffs are implemented.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You mentioned NAFTA. Of course, NAFTA has been replaced by USMCA. And I well remember, and you might remember this, Shawn, January 2020, President Trump in the Rose Garden said the following: \"USMCA is the largest, fairest, most balanced modern trade agreement ever achieved. It will add another 1.2% to our GDP, create countless new American jobs.\" Again, I'm quoting, \"It will make our blue collar boom.\" Is USMCA a part of this problem, negotiated by President Trump?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: Well, yes. I mean, USMCA, I mean, obviously there were changes made, there were- there were some improvements, but it didn't go far enough. There were still a lot of loopholes in it. And, you know, we- as a result of the- of the renegotiated NAFTA, you know, we still saw an increase in the deficit we have, especially with Mexico. But at the end of the day it's up for renegotiation next year. So nothing stops them from- from getting to work, you know, and we're right here. We're here every day. We've been very open with them about, we want to work with them. We want to find ways to fix the USMCA and- and fix the atrocities of NAFTA that the working class in this country have suffered and the communities in this country have suffered for decades.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Shawn, the market research firm Cox Automotive, for this year, is projecting 700,000 fewer cars will be produced and sold, because of consumer anxiety over sticky inflation, meaning persistent inflation, and nervousness about cost impacts of tariffs. If 700,000 cars, or trucks, fewer, are being made and sold, how does that help your workforce?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: Well, it doesn't. But, you know, we need to be- we need to take a hard look at this, because those same- the same economists that are saying this now are the same ones in 1992 that said, overnight, when NAFTA was created, there would be 400,000 jobs created in America in the first year. We know what happened there. They got it wrong. And the interesting part to me- all this crying about the effects of- of tariffs, I find it interesting, because to me, this is just Wall Street. Now that Wall Street's upset about it, it's an issue. Where was Wall Street when- when all these manufacturing facilities have been leaving the country in the last 30 years? You know, interestingly enough, you know, automotive companies in the last three years, 2019- 2019 to 2023, they jacked up the price of vehicles 35% to 40% over that time frame. Not because of anything that happened, not because wages went up. It was just flat out price gouging to consumer and corporate greed. Where was the outcry then? They don't have to raise the price of vehicles a penny with these tariffs. It's a decision that the companies are making, and that lays straight in the hands of the- of the companies.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The White House also says when it comes to the auto industry, currently, we are essentially an assembly auto industry, we don't make drive trains. We don't make the things within the car that have the most material value and the most worker involvement. A, is that true? And B, how does that change?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: Well, it's somewhat true. There's been a huge shift in the last several decades, thanks to the unfair trade laws, where a lot of the, you know, the parts, the supply chain, the parts and the engines and transmissions have been sourced. But we still do produce those things. I can tell you where I come from, at Kokomo, Indiana. We still make the transmissions. We make engine blocks. We still produce engines here in Michigan, in the Big Three. So we still do some of that work. I mean, we've brought, you know, some of the battery work in thanks to the Biden administration and their plans with the IRA. I mean, so, you know, we're working on a lot of that work, you know. So that is powertrain type work, so the drive trains, things like that. But yes, a lot of that work was sourced, was casualties of NAFTA and broken trade laws.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And when you think about the future of the auto industry for the next two or three years, does it survive without tariffs?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: Like I said, I think tariffs are a tool in the toolbox. I think they're a initial motivator, but ultimately, we have to fix the broken trade laws in this country and any trade laws we have-\u00a0 let's be clear about this. It has to have a social policy, and it's got to have a decent standard of living. It's got to have adequate health care for everyone. It's got to have retirement security for people when they're too old to work and too young to die, and it's got to have some quality of life initiatives into it, where people don't have to work around the clock and their life has to revolve around- around work. So, you know, there's a lot of things we have to fix to make it work. You know, and I want to make this clear. Mexican workers, they're not the enemy. They've been exploited for decades. You know, another promise of NAFTA was that it was going to raise the standard for everybody. The realization of that is the wages in America and the wages in Mexico were cut in half over the- over the last 30 years as a result of NAFTA. So it's driving a race to the bottom, and that's not going to work for anybody.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Shawn, your membership makes you powerful, so you associate with presidents. From your perspective, what's more valuable to your membership, a president who walks a picket line or imposes tariffs?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: I mean, it's- it's- it's both. I mean, a president- ultimately, it's a president that supports organized labor and supports good working conditions and good safe jobs and good union contracts, and so that's the big concern right now. I mean, you know, while we applaud the shift with tariffs here under this administration, again, it's deplorable what happened last night with the stroke of a marker, you know, stripping away bargaining- stripping away contractual rights for hundreds of thousands of union workers, attacking the free speech of union workers. So, you know, and we can't stand for that. So like I said\u2013",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And how about changes at the National Labor Relations Board?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: --we do take this issue by issue.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: How about changes at the National Labor Relations Board?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: I'm sorry?",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: How about changes at the National Labor Relations Board? Which would have to be there--",
      "SHAWN FAIN: Yeah exactly",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: --to safeguard the kind of things you want protected.",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "SHAWN FAIN: Yes, no. Every- everything, like I said. I mean, that's like, I've been very clear about this. Look, as I said, when we find something we agree with someone on that we can work with them on, we're going to work with them. But, but again, the list is very long, of things we don't agree on. I mean, all these attacks on Department of Labor, Department of Education, you know, the NLRB, you know, naturally with, you know, the cuts with the federal workers, the cuts with our- our higher ed workers, the attacks on our higher education workers on these college campuses, on their free speech, you know, again, on the National Institute of Health workers, those things are unacceptable. And yes, we- look, we're organizing right now, and these companies hire union busters. They break the law every day. Volkswagen's breaking the law as we speak. There's got to be mechanisms in place to hold them accountable. And when you weaken all those things, or you eliminate those things, obviously that's not going to be good.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Shawn, last question, our recent polling shows a five percent shift, five percent more Americans than in February fear a coming recession within the next year. Does your membership?",
      "SHAWN FAIN: I mean, I think a lot of people are cautious right now. I mean, obviously there's a lot of uncertainty with what's going on. I mean, you know, when you are stripping bargaining rights and you're, you know, threatening to fire, you know, workers all over the country and fire federal workers, things like that. I mean, obviously there's a lot of concern.",

      "\"I would rather negotiate a deal. I'm not sure that everybody agrees with me, but we can make a deal that would be just as good as if you won militarily,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But the time is happening now. The time is coming up. Something's going to happen one way or the other. I hope that Iran \u2014 and I've written him a letter, saying, 'I hope you're going to negotiate.' Because if we have to go in militarily, it's going to be a terrible thing \u2014 for them.\"",

      "Mr. Trump's overture comes as both Israel and the U.S. have warned they will never let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon, leading to fears of a military confrontation as Tehran enriches uranium at near weapons-grade levels \u2013 something only done by atomic-armed nations.",

Mike Lee of Utah \u2014 on Friday visited the Pituffick Space Base, the northernmost U.S. military installation, in Greenland. The trip had been scaled back after an uproar among Greenlanders and Danges who were not consulted about the original itinerary. While there, the vice president blasted Denmark for its handling of the island, saying the U.S. base in Greenland is less secure than it was decades ago because of Denmark's stewardship.",
      "\"There is no amount of bullying, no amount of obfuscating, no amount of confusing the issue,\" Vance said. \"Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland, you have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change. And because it hasn't changed, that's why President Trump's policy in Greenland is what it is.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has eyed the semi-autonomous Danish territory\u00a0despite opposition from residents and leaders. The president told NBC News in an interview on Saturday that \"we'll get Greenland,\" saying there's a \"good possibility that we could do it without military force,\" while adding that \"I don't take anything off the table.\"",
      "Earlier Saturday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen posted a video on social media scolding the Trump administration, saying his country is already investing more into Arctic security and remains open to more cooperation with the U.S.",
      "\"Many accusations and many allegations have been made. And of course, we are open to criticism,\" Rasmussen said speaking in English. \"But let me be completely honest: we do not appreciate the tone in which it is being delivered. This is not how you speak to your close allies. And I still consider Denmark and the United States to be close allies.\"",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen also pushed back on Vance's claim that Denmark isn't doing enough for defense in the Arctic, calling her country \"a good and strong ally.\"",
      "Vivian Motzfeldt, Greenland's foreign minister told CBS News she wants cooperation with the U.S., not domination.",
      "\"You just don't take over. You speak and you talk. That's all politics is about,\" she said.",

      "Hundreds of protesters demonstrated Saturday outside the U.S. Embassy in the Danish capital Copenhagen with some lifting signs saying, \"back off, USA\"\u00a0Danish broadcaster TV2 reported.",
      "L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, in his video, reminded viewers of the 1951 defense agreement between Denmark and the United States. Since 1945, the American military presence in Greenland has decreased from thousands of soldiers over 17 bases and installations on the island, he said, to the remote Pituffik Space Base in the northwest with some 200 soldiers today.",

    "story": [
      "Staff members at the U.S. Institute of Peace were informed they were terminated effective immediately on Friday, five sources familiar with the situation told CBS News.",
      "It was not immediately clear if the terminations affect the entire organization but sources said the terminations impact the vast majority of the nonprofit, including multiple departments at the congressionally funded organization.",
      "The Trump administration has attempted to freeze the institute's funding and gut and replace its board. President Trump signed an executive order in February aimed at dismantling the USIP.",
      "USIP has about 300 employees and a budget of roughly $55 million. The institute's mission is to promote conflict resolution and the prevention of conflict across the globe.",
      "Affected employees were notified of their termination by email from a USIP email address.",
      "\"Dear [Employee], this letter is to inform you of a change in your employment status with United State Institute of Peace (sic),\" reads a copy of an email sent to one terminated employee and obtained by CBS News. \"Effective March 28, 2025, your employment with us will conclude.\"",
      "Earlier this month, a federal judge declined to grant a temporary restraining order to stop the Department of Government Efficiency's takeover of the USIP, after DOGE staffers gained access to the USIP's building in Washington, D.C.",
      "U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell criticized how the DOGE team handled the situation but said she would not grant a temporary restraining order to stop DOGE. The USIP had asked the judge to stop DOGE from \"completing the unlawful dismantling of the institute.\"",
      "George M. Foote, outside general counsel for USIP, said in a statement Saturday that the terminations \"in the dark of night is unconscionable and deeply troubling.\"",
      "\"The Institute's employees are fiercely dedicated to their important work, and they don't deserve to be treated with such disrespect,\" Foote said. \"This action only adds urgency to the complaint that has been filed to halt and reverse the Administration's unlawful attempt to dismantle the Institute. We will continue to press this matter in court, where we are confident we will prevail.\"",
      "The terminations at USIP came the same day the Trump administration\u00a0took steps\u00a0to formally shutter the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "USIP was created by Congress in 1984 during former President Ronald Reagan's administration. Reagan signed a law formally establishing the institute as \"an independent, nonprofit corporation.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News on Saturday, the White House press deputy secretary, Anna Kelly, said: \"Taxpayers don't want to spend $50 million per year on a publicly-funded 'research institute' that has failed to deliver peace.

    "summary": "Protesters are trying to escalate a movement targeting Tesla dealerships and vehicles in opposition to Elon Musk's role in DOGE.",
    "story": [
      "Crowds protesting billionaire Elon Musk's purge of the U.S. government under President Trump began amassing outside Tesla dealerships throughout the U.S. and in some cities in Europe on Saturday in the latest attempt to dent the fortune of the world's richest man.",
      "The protesters are trying to escalate a movement targeting Tesla dealerships and vehicles in opposition to Musk's role as the head of the newly created Department of of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he's gained access to sensitive data and shuttered entire agencies as he attempts to slash government spending. Most of Musk's estimated $340 billion fortune consists of the stock he holds in the electric vehicle company that he continues to run while also working alongside Mr. Trump.",
      "Earlier protests have been somewhat sporadic. Saturday marked the first attempt to surround all 277 of the automaker's showrooms and service centers in the U.S. in hopes of deepening\u00a0a recent decline in the company's sales.",
      "By early afternoon, crowds ranging from a few dozen to hundreds of protesters had flocked to Tesla locations in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Maryland, Minnesota and the automaker's home state of Texas. Pictures posted on social media accounts showed protesters brandishing signs such as\u00a0\"Honk if you hate Elon\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"Fight the billionaire broligarchy.\"",
      "The Tesla Takedown movement also hoped to rally protestors at more than 230 Tesla locations in other parts of the world. Although the turnouts in Europe weren't as large as the crowds in the U.S., the anti-Musk sentiment was similar.",
      "About two dozen protesters held signs lambasting Musk outside a Tesla dealership in London as passing cars and trucks tooted horns in support.",
      "One of the signs displayed at the London protest showed a photo of Musk next to an image of Adolf Hitler making the Nazi salute \u2014 a\u00a0gesture that Musk has been accused of reprising shortly after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. A person in a tyrannosaurus rex costume held another sign with a picture of Musk's straight-arm gesture that said, \"You thought the Nazis were extinct. Don't buy a Swasticar.\"",
      "\"We just want to get loud, make noise, make people aware of the problems that we're facing,\" said Cam Whitten, an American who showed up at the London protest.",
      "Tesla Takedown was organized by a group of supporters that included disillusioned owners of the automaker's vehicles, celebrities such as actor John Cusack, and at least one Democratic Party lawmaker, Rep. Jasmine Crockett from Dallas.",
      "\"I'm going to keep screaming in the halls of Congress. I just need you all to make sure you all keep screaming in the streets,\" Crockett said during a\u00a0Tesla Takedown organizing call\u00a0held earlier this month.",
      "In New York City, mayoral hopeful and New York state Rep. Zohran Mamdani joined protesters at a Tesla showroom on Saturday.",
      "\"We are here in a moment that demands all of us,\" Mandani told the crowd through a megaphone. \"It demands all of us because the richest man in the world has purchased the president of the United States.\"",
      "Some people opposed to Musk have gone beyond protests and set the automaker's vehicles on fire and committed\u00a0other acts of vandalism that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has decried as \"nothing short of domestic terrorism.\" Musk indicated he was dumbfounded by the attacks during a March 20 company meeting and said the vandals should \"stop acting psycho.\"",
      "Crockett and other Tesla Takedown supporters have been stressing the importance for Saturday's protests to remain peaceful.",
      "But police were investigating a fire that destroyed seven Tesla vehicles in northwestern Germany early Saturday morning. It was wasn't immediately clear if the blaze, which was extinguished by firefighters, was related to the Tesla Takedown protests.",
      "There have been vandalisms at Tesla dealerships acrossing the U.S., including fires in Nevada and Missouri, and graffiti at locations in Massachusetts and Maryland, CBS News previously reported.",
      "Since January 2025, incidents targeting Tesla EVs have occurred in at least nine states, according to a joint intelligence bulletin issued by the Department of Homeland Security and FBI and obtained by CBS News.\u00a0Although U.S. intelligence suggests lone actors are behind them, Trump administration officials are promising to crack down on what they say are coordinated attacks.",
      "There have also been reports of vandalism to parked Teslas, making individual owners nervous.",
      "\"My wife cautions me, 'Be careful where you are at with it,'\" Bill Fonte told CBS New York. \"If you don't like the product, don't buy it. But they're going above and beyond, creating panic and concern for normal people like me.\"",
      "A growing number of consumers who bought Tesla vehicles before Musk took over DOGE have been looking to sell or trade in their cars while others have slapped on bumper stickers seeking to distance themselves from the billionaire's efforts to prune or shut down government agencies.",
      "But Musk didn't appear concerned about an extended slump in sales of new Tesla cars in his March 20 address to employees. He reassured the workers that the company's Model Y, which is undergoing a refresh, would remain \"the best-selling car on Earth again this year.\" He also predicted Tesla will have sold more than 10 million cars worldwide by next year, up from about 7 million cars now.",
      "\"There are times when there are rocky moments, where there is stormy weather, but what I am here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting,\" Musk said.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected last November, investors initially saw Musk's alliance with the president as a positive development for Tesla and its long-running efforts to launch\u00a0a network of self-driving cars.",
      "That optimism helped lift Tesla's stock by 70% in the period between Mr. Trump's Nov. 5 election and his Jan. 20 inauguration, creating an additional $560 billion in shareholder wealth. But virtually all those gains have evaporated amid investor worries about the Tesla backlash, lagging sales in the U.S., Europe and China, and Musk spending time overseeing DOGE.",
      "\"This continues to be a moment of truth for Musk to navigate this brand tornado crisis moment and get onto the other side of this dark chapter for Tesla,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note leading up to Saturday's protests.",

    "summary": "Billionaire Elon Musk on Friday clarified his reasons for visiting Wisconsin two days ahead of its hotly contested Supreme Court election after deleting a social media post saying he planned to \"personally hand over\" $2 million.",
    "story": [
      "Wisconsin's Democratic attorney general asked a court on Friday to block billionaire\u00a0Elon Musk from handing out $1 million checks to voters this weekend, just two days before the state's\u00a0hotly contested Supreme Court race was to be decided.",
      "Attorney General Josh Kaul filed the lawsuit in Dane County Circuit Court to stop Musk from making the payments, which he said he would make Sunday in Wisconsin. Musk initially said in a post on his social media platform, X, that he planned to \"personally hand over\" $2 million to a pair of voters who have already cast their ballots in the race.",
      "Musk later posted a clarification, saying the money will go to people who will be \"spokesmen\" for an online petition against \"activist\" judges. After first saying the event would only be open to people who had voted in the Supreme Court race, he said attendance would be limited to those who have signed the petition.",
      "Also on Friday, Musk's political action committee identified the recipient of its first $1 million giveaway \u2014 a Green Bay man who had donated to the Wisconsin GOP and the conservative candidate in the court race, and who has a history of posting support for President Donald Trump and his agenda.",
      "Musk deleted the post from his social media platform, X, about 12 hours after he initially posted it late Thursday night. He issued the clarification about an hour later.",
      "He had posted that he planned to give $1 million each to two voters at the event on Sunday, just two days before the election\u00a0that will determine ideological control of the court\u00a0in the battleground state.",
      "\"I will also personally hand over two checks for a million dollars each in appreciation for you taking the time to vote,\" Musk's now-deleted post said. \"This is super important.\"",
      "The Supreme Court race has\u00a0shattered previous spending records for a U.S. judicial election\u00a0and has become a referendum on Musk and the first months of President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "Trump, a Republican, endorsed Brad Schimel and hosted a telephone town hall with him on Thursday night.",
      "\"It's a very important race,\" Trump said in brief remarks by phone, in a call organized by Schimel's campaign. \"I know you feel it's local, but it's not. It's really much more than local. The whole country is watching.\"",
      "Schimel, a Waukesha County judge, faces Dane County Judge Susan Crawford in Tuesday's election. Crawford is backed by a wide range of Democrats, including the liberal justices who hold a 4-3 majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and former President Barack Obama. The retirement this year of a liberal justice puts majority control of the court in play.",
      "Musk's political action committee said Friday that it had awarded $1 million to Scott Ainsworth, a mechanical engineer from Green Bay, for signing its petition protesting against \"activist\" judges. In a video posted on X, Ainsworth encouraged people to sign the petition and \"get out and vote early for Brad Schimel.\"",
      "\"If everyone in the MAGA movement shows up and votes for Brad Schimel, we will win,\" Ainsworth said in the video.",
      "Ainsworth donated $350 to Schimel's campaign this year, campaign finance records show.",
      "Andrew Romeo, a spokesperson for Musk's political action committee, declined to say whether Ainsworth was one of the two who would be receiving $1 million on Sunday.",
      "Musk promised $100 to any registered Wisconsin voter\u00a0who signed the petition or forwarded it to someone who did.",
      "That raised questions about whether the petition violated Wisconsin law that makes it a felony to offer, give, lend or promise to lend or give anything of value to induce a voter to cast a ballot or not vote.",
      "Any legal challenge to Musk's payments could end up before the Wisconsin Supreme Court.",
      "A bipartisan coalition of government watchdog groups and former office holders, along with a liberal Madison law firm, asked the Wisconsin attorney general and the Milwaukee County district attorney to investigate the $1 million payment and the offer of $100 for signing the petition.",
      "The group, in its letter sent Thursday night, said the payments appear to violate the state law against election bribery.",
      "Attorney General Josh Kaul and Milwaukee County District Attorney Kent Lovern did not immediately return messages Friday seeking comment.",
      "Schimel, a former attorney general, was asked about the petition on Thursday by WISN-TV.",
      "\"I, frankly, thought, 'Should I sign that petition? I'm against activist judges, but I don't think I should do that,'\" Schimel said.",
      "When asked about the $1 million award, Schimel said, \"I don't know what the criteria to get it was.\"",
      "Crawford's campaign spokesperson Derrick Honeyman, called Musk's announced visit to Wisconsin a \"last-minute desperate distraction.\"",
      "\"Wisconsinites don't want a billionaire like Musk telling them who to vote for, and, on Tuesday, voters should reject Musk's lackey Brad Schimel,\" he said.",
      "Musk's political action committee used a nearly identical tactic before the White House election last year, offering to pay $1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states\u00a0who signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments.",
      "During last year's presidential race, Philadelphia's district attorney sued in an attempt to stop the payments under Pennsylvania law. But a judge said prosecutors failed to show the effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day.",
      "Musk and groups he funds have already spent more than $20 million in an effort to elect Schimel, while billionaire George Soros has given $2 million to bolster Crawford, and Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has donated $1.5 million.",
      "Musk got involved in the race just days after his electric car company, Tesla, filed a lawsuit against Wisconsin in an effort to open dealerships in the state.",
      "Crawford and her allies have accused Musk of trying to buy influence on the court given that Tesla's lawsuit could end up before the justices.",
      "The race comes as the Wisconsin Supreme Court is also expected to rule on abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting rules that could affect the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election.",
      "Wisconsin is one of a handful of true battleground states, which only intensifies the focus on court races where rules for voting will be decided. Trump won Wisconsin in 2016 and 2024 by less than a percentage point, but he lost it in 2020 by a similar margin. Five of the past seven presidential elections in the state have been decided by less than a percentage point.",
      "More than $81 million has been spent on the Supreme Court race so far, obliterating the record for a judicial race in the U.S. of $51 million set in Wisconsin just two years ago, according to Brennan Center tallies.",

      "President Trump issued an executive order Tuesday targeting Chicago law firm Jenner & Block. The firm also has an office in Washington, D.C.",
      "Jenner & Block has been an active part of the legal challenges against Mr. Trump's executive orders, including successfully securing a preliminary injunction against an order from the administration that reduced health care access for transgender youth.",
      "That case is still pending in a Maryland-based federal court.",
      "This executive order instructs officials to review and revoke firm members' security clearance, identify any good, property, material and services provided by the federal government and stop providing them, terminate any government contracts that may exist with the law firm, and not hire any employees of the firm for any future federal government jobs.",
      "The order also singles out attorney Andrew Weissman, who worked on Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The executive order says he was re-hired at Jenner & Block, but the firm clarified that Weissman hasn't worked there since 2021.",
      "The executive order specifies that Weissman is prohibited from being hired by or working for the federal government unless a waiver is issued.",
      "The Trump administration has targeted a number of law firms that have been active in challenging or pausing executive orders and policies in the courts.",
      "Previously, the president issued and then rescinded an executive order targeting international law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Garrison & Wharton after it pledged to review its hiring practices and provide tens of millions of dollars in free legal services to support certain White House initiatives.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced Friday that the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom agreed to provide more than $100 million in pro bono work for initiatives backed by his administration.",
      "The agreement makes Skadden Arps the second major firm to reach a deal with Mr. Trump amid a recent blitz of executive orders targeting law firms that have employed his purported political opponents. The orders issued by the president have focused on the firms Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, and Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, known as WilmerHale.",
      "All three of those firms have filed federal lawsuits challenging the executive orders as a violation of the First Amendment. A federal judge in Washington blocked parts of Mr. Trump's executive order against Perkins Coie earlier this month, and on Friday, two separate judges issued temporary restraining orders halting the president's actions against Jenner & Block and WilmerHale.",
      "While Mr. Trump earlier in the month issued an order going after a fourth firm, Paul, Weiss, it was rescinded after the international firm agreed to provide $40 million in free legal services to support causes backed by the administration.",
      "The president said in a statement posted to Truth Social that in addition to providing $100 million in pro bono work, the firm will not engage in \"illegal DEI discrimination and preferences\" and work with an outside counsel to advise it on employment practices.",
      "Mr. Trump also said Skadden Arps \"will not deny representation to clients, such as members of politically disenfranchised groups, who have not historically received legal representation from major National Law Firms, including in pro bono matters, and in support of non-profits, because of the personal political views of individual lawyers.\"",
      "The White House said Skadden Arps approached the administration \"and declared the Firm's strong commitment to ending the Weaponization of the Justice System and the Legal Profession.\"",
      "Jeremy London, the firm's executive partner, said in a statement distributed by Mr. Trump that it is \"pleased to have achieved a successful agreement with President Trump and his Administration. We engaged proactively with the President and his team in working together constructively to reach this agreement. The Firm looks forward to continuing our productive relationship with President Trump and his Administration. We firmly believe that this outcome is in the best interests of our clients, our people, and our Firm.\"",
      "The executive orders targeting the law firms are among a number of actions taken by Mr. Trump since he returned to the White House that have gone after his perceived enemies. He revoked the security clearances of former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other top Biden administration officials, as well as others who have been critical of him, last week. Mr. Trump also pulled the security details for Dr. Anthony Fauci and retired Gen. Mark Milley, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Trump and Biden administrations.",
      "Executive orders targeting major law firms",
      "The law firm-related orders take issue with the work they have performed and the lawyers previously on their payrolls. In the directive targeting Perkins Coie, Mr. Trump attacked the firm for representing Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign and hiring a research firm that retained a former British spy, Christopher Steele, who\u00a0produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier.\"",
      "The president's order attacking Jenner & Block singles out the firm for hiring Andrew Weissmann, who worked with former special counsel Robert Mueller on his investigation into Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. Weissmann left the firm in 2021. It also took issue with Jenner & Block's work on a challenge to Mr. Trump's executive order that seeks to strip federal funds from medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to minors, among other lawsuits.",
      "In a ruling late Friday, Judge John D. Bates, an appointee of President George W. Bush, issued an order temporarily blocking the action, saying it likely violates the First, Fifth and Sixth Amendments. The judge called Mr. Trump's executive order \"disturbing\" and \"troubling\" on the grounds that it attacks pro bono practice.",
      "\"The court does not take lightly the power to enjoin the executive branch, but the government has not made any persuasive case that the public interest will be harmed\" by halting enforcement, he said.",
      "Mr. Trump's latest executive order, which targets WilmerHale, accused the firm of weaponizing the justice system by employing Mueller and two others who worked on his investigation, James Quarles and Aaron Zebley. Mueller left WilmerHale more than three years ago, according to the firm, and Quarles is retired. Zebley is a partner at WilmerHale.",
      "In his ruling Friday night temporarily blocking\u00a0portions of Mr. Trump's executive order, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon wrote: \"There is no doubt this retaliatory action chills speech and legal advocacy, or that it qualifies as a constitutional harm.\"",
      "Leon said WilmerHale \"faces more than economic harm\" from the executive order, \"it faces crippling losses and its very survival is at stake.\" He wrote that the injuries to the firm from the order \"would be so severe and would spill over to its clients and the justice system at large. The public interest demands protecting against harms of this magnitude.\"",
      "His temporary restraining order stops the Trump administration from requiring government contracting agencies to terminate all contracts with WilmerHale, and stops the administration from restricting WilmerHale employees' access to federal buildings and officials.",
      "The executive orders directed agency heads to suspend any active security clearances held by employees of three firms and require federal contractors to disclose any business with WilmerHale, Jenner & Block and Perkins Coie. The administration is also directed to review all contracts with the firms or with entities that disclose doing business with them.",
      "The fallout from the executive orders has been swift. In a declaration filed with the court, Thomas Perrelli, firm chair and a partner at Jenner & Block, warned that if allowed to take the effect, the restrictions laid out in Mr. Trump's order would be \"devastating and irreparable.\"",
      "According to Perrelli, one client has already informed Jenner & Block that the Justice Department notified them that they cannot bring their lawyers from the firm to a department meeting set for April 3. That client, Perrelli wrote, will need to attend the meeting without their outside representation or hire new counsel before it.",
      "Some Jenner & Block clients are also worried the firm cannot represent them in federal court or go into government buildings to engage with regulatory agencies or government officials, he said. Within 24 hours of Mr. Trump's order, Perrelli said several clients expressed concerns about the firm's representation because they were unsure whether Jenner & Block lawyers could enter federal buildings and courthouses, negotiate with government officials or participate in meetings with the Justice Department.",
      "As to the order's provisions targeting government contractors with a relationship with Jenner & Block, Perrelli said 40% of the firm's revenue came from clients who have federal contracts or subcontracts.",
      "\"If we lost that business, or even a portion of it, it would be a serious threat to the firm's financial health,\" Perrelli wrote.",

    "summary": "A recent poll\u200b shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance\u00a0said Friday during a day trip to a U.S. base in Greenland that the Trump administration doesn't think that \"military force is ever going to be necessary\" there, the same day President Trump said, \"We have to have Greenland.\"",
      "Vance visited the Pituffik Space Base, the northernmost U.S. military installation, along with second lady Usha Vance, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. While there, the vice president blasted Denmark for its handling of the island, as the Trump White House eyes the semi-autonomous Danish territory despite opposition from residents and leaders. While Vance was there, President Trump reiterated his strong desire to acquire the island.",
      "\"We need Greenland, very importantly, for international security,\" the president told reporters at the White House. \"We have to have Greenland. It's not a question of, 'Do you think we can do without it?' We can't.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't ruled out military force in Greenland, while Vance on Friday said he believes the people of Greenland will seek independence from Denmark. A reporter asked Vance if his message is consistent with the president's. Vance said the president wants more of a U.S. presence in Greenland, but \"the president has said clearly he doesn't think that military force is going to be necessary.\"",
      "\"What we think is going to happen is that the Greenlanders are going to choose through self-determination to become independent of Denmark, and then we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there,\" Vance said. \"So I think talking about anything too far in the future is way too premature. We do not think that military force is ever going to be necessary. We think this makes sense. And because we think the people of Greenland are rational and good, we think we're going to be able to cut a deal, Donald Trump style, to ensure the security of this territory but also the United States of America.\"",
      "Vance said his trip to the base helped him see up close how critical Greenland is for U.S. national security. If an enemy fired a missile on the U.S., it would be the American soldiers at the Greenland base who would alert their countrymen, he said. Vance said the U.S. knows Russia and China are taking serious interest in the Arctic, and the U.S. needs to make sure it's leading in the Arctic. But while Vance recognized Denmark has been an important security partner in the past, he launched into criticisms of the European country, saying the U.S. base in Greenland is less secure than it was decades ago because of Denmark's stewardship.",
      "\"There is no amount of bullying, no amount of obfuscating, no amount of confusing the issue,\" Vance said. \"Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland, you have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change. And because it hasn't changed, that's why President Trump's policy in Greenland is what it is.\"",
      "The second lady was originally scheduled to visit Greenland in an expanded cultural trip this week, and then the vice president\u00a0announced\u00a0Tuesday that he would be joining her for a shorter trip that was more focused on U.S. policy and defense.",
      "Vance also thanked soldiers on the base, who are there for a year at a time and can't bring their families with them.",
      "\"I know it's a lot of sacrifice to spend a year away from your families, but the mission is really important,\" Vance said. \"The Trump administration, the president, is really interested in Arctic security. As you all know, that's a big issue, and it's only going to get bigger over the coming decade, so thanks for doing what you do.\"",
      "Waltz told the soldiers they're carrying a \"tradition\" of U.S. soldiers in Greenland, and said the president is very serious about Arctic security.",
      "A statement earlier this week by the vice president's office that announced Vance would join his wife on the trip emphasized Greenland's role in U.S. national security.",
      "\"During World War II, the United States established over a dozen military bases in Greenland to defend the North Atlantic from Nazi incursion,\" the statement said. \"During the Cold War, the United States committed additional resources to Greenland to defend against Soviet missile attacks.\"",
      "The statement went on to criticize Denmark, claiming, \"In the decades since, neglect and inaction from Danish leaders and past U.S. administrations have presented our adversaries with the opportunity to advance their own priorities in Greenland and the Arctic. President Trump is rightly changing course.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't given up on the idea of absorbing Greenland into the U.S., despite opposition from Greenland's leadership and people. Greenland is an expansive island to the north and east of Canada that's a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. It's roughly three times the size of Texas, but mostly covered by ice. Most of its roughly 57,000 people \u2014 a population smaller than Carson City, Nevada \u2014 live along Greenland's southern coast.",
      "A\u00a0recent poll shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States, and residents who spoke with CBS News ahead of Vance's visit to a remote U.S. installation on the island \u2014 America's furthest north military base \u2014 clearly reflected the sentiments shown in that poll.",
      "\"He can't just take it like that,\" said Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander.",
      "And Greenland's prime minister, M\u00fate Bourup Egede,\u00a0has called the planned visits from U.S. officials \"aggressive.\" And Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, said the U.S. is putting \"unacceptable pressure\" on Greenland.",
      "Despite this opposition, Mr. Trump said earlier this month in a speech before the joint session of Congress that he had \"a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland: We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the territory is important to U.S. national security and that his administration is \"working with everybody involved to try and get it.\"",
      "\"And I think we're going to get it, one way or the other,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're going to get it. We will keep you safe, we will make you rich, and together, we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before. It's a very small population, but very, very large piece of land, and very, very important for military security.\"",

    "summary": "Sources tell CBS News the Signal chat involving senior Trump administration officials included sensitive intelligence Israel provided to the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Israeli officials are furious over the Signal chat leak involving senior Trump administration officials because it included sensitive intelligence Israel provided to the U.S. from a human intelligence source in Yemen, CBS News has learned.",
      "While the Signal chat messages published by Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic this week may not have compromised the effectiveness of the airstrike, given the publication's restraint on releasing the information, it did compromise a human source who provided the intelligence to the Israelis, who then provided it to the U.S. for targeting, a senior American intelligence official and a source with knowledge of the Israelis' ire told CBS News. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive national security matters.",
      "The Wall Street Journal on Thursday first reported about the Israelis complaining to U.S. officials about Mike Waltz, President Trump's national security adviser, who set up the group chat and apparently added Goldberg by mistake. The group spent several days earlier this month exchanging messages about possible plans to strike Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, who have repeatedly launched missiles at Israel and targeted shipping in the Red Sea.",
      "CBS News reached out to the National Security Council and the Israeli Embassy in the U.S. for comment on Friday, but has not received a response.",
      "On March 15, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth texted the group chat, composed of what's known as the principals committee \u2014 the highest level of the National Security Council, which includes Cabinet members and other senior U.S. officials.",
      "According to Goldberg's report, one of Hegseth's messages said:",
      "\"Trigger Based\" F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME \u2013 also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)",
      "The senior American intelligence official told CBS News that in this context, \"Trigger Based\" refers to an operation that is contingent upon a specific condition or event \u2014 essentially, a go or no-go decision to launch an airstrike based on confirmation of the target's presence.",
      "That day, Navy F/A-18F Super Hornets launched from the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman located in the Red Sea, while the MQ-9 Reaper drones took flight from bases in the Middle East. U.S. Central Command said in a statement that they had begun an operation which consisted of \"precision strikes against Iran-backed Houthi targets across Yemen in order to restore freedom of navigation.\"",
      "Hegseth said in another text, prior to the decision to strike, that he supported doing so to restore freedom of navigation and reestablish deterrence, which he described as being \"cratered\" under the Biden administration.",
      "After the U.S. airstrikes began on the Iranian-backed Houthis, Waltz addressed Vice President JD Vance in the chat group to say the building had collapsed and that U.S. military forces had \"multiple positive ID,\" indicating positive identification of the Houthi member or members they were aiming to kill.",
      "Waltz added: \"The first target \u2014 their top missile guy \u2014 we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend's building and it's now collapsed,\" according to the texts posted by The Atlantic.",
      "As a barrage of criticism rolled in this week towards those involved in the Signal chat, senior Trump administration officials have repeatedly said the information was not classified and that no sources or methods were compromised.",
      "\"No locations. No sources & methods. No WAR PLANS,\" Waltz wrote on X on Wednesday. \"Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent.\"",
      "But the sources who spoke to CBS News say Israeli intelligence is angry that the intelligence they provided to the U.S. was revealed. It's unclear what the fallout will be, if any, between the U.S. and Israel over the situation.",
      "CBS News reported Thursday that President Trump has been privately venting his irritation about the Signal chat leak and is closely monitoring the news to see if the fallout quiets down, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
      "On Tuesday, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, both of whom were in the Signal group chat, testified before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.",
      "\"There was no classified material that was shared in that Signal chat,\" Gabbard told lawmakers. The following day, testifying before a House panel, Gabbard acknowledged the conversation was \"sensitive\" but again denied classified information was shared in the chat. \"There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,\" she said.",
      "Multiple U.S. intelligence officials and members of the U.S. military who have spoken to CBS News this week contended that this type of information is always classified, but even if the information was somehow unclassified, it would still be a violation of cybersecurity and operational security protocols.",
      "CBS News on Tuesday published unclassified internal documents from a National Security Agency bulletin warning of vulnerabilities in using the Signal app, even though it is encrypted. The NSA bulletin was widely distributed to NSA employees a month before the Signal chat group was created by Waltz.",
      "The bulletin also underscored to NSA employees that third-party messaging applications such as Signal and WhatsApp are permitted for certain \"unclassified accountability/recall exercises\" but not for communicating more sensitive information.",
      "NSA employees were also warned to not send \"anything compromising over any social media or Internet-based tool or application,\" and to not \"establish connections with people you do not know.\"",

      "\"The court cannot look away or the CFPB will be dissolved and dismantled completely in approximately thirty days, well before this lawsuit has come to its conclusion,\" she wrote in a 112-page decision.",
      "Her order keeps the CFPB in existence until the case has been resolved on the merits. It also reinstates the agency's contracts, workforce, data and operational capacity.",

      "\"If the defendants are not enjoined, they will eliminate the agency before the Court has the opportunity to decide whether the law permits them to do it, and as the defendants' own witness warned, the harm will be irreparable,\" Berman Jackson said in her order.",
      "During a March 10 hearing, Jackson heard testimony about the chaos that erupted inside the agency after government employees were ordered to stop working last month. The bureau's chief operating officer, Adam Martinez, said the agency was in \"wind-down mode\" after Trump fired its previous director, Rohit Chopra, on Feb. 1.",
      "Trump installed a temporary replacement who ordered the immediate suspension of all agency operations, cancelled $100 million in contracts and fired 70 employees.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., cleared the way for President Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board after district courts had earlier blocked their removals and ordered them reinstated.",
      "A three-judge panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit divided 2-1 in agreeing to halt the lower court orders that voided Mr. Trump's firings of Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board and Cathy Harris from the Merit Systems Protection Board while legal proceedings move forward.",
      "Wilcox and Harris had argued that their firings violated federal laws that limited their removals only for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. The Trump administration, meanwhile, defended the terminations and said the restrictions on the president's ability to remove the officials are unconstitutional.",
      "\"The people elected the president to enforce the nation's laws, and a stay serves that purpose by allowing the people's chosen officer to control the executive branch,\" Judge Justin Walker, who was appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term, wrote in an opinion siding with the administration.",
      "Wilcox was nominated to the National Labor Relations Board by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term in September 2023. She was designated chair of the board in December 2024.",
      "Harris was selected to serve on the Merit Systems Protection Board by Biden and confirmed in 2022. She was approved by the Senate as chair last year.",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump returned to the White House for his second term, Wilcox received a letter from the president informing her that the labor board had not been operating in a manner consistent with his administration's objectives, and telling her she had been removed. In Harris' case, she received an email in early February from the White House Presidential Personnel Office that stated, \"On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position on the Merit Systems Protection Board is terminated, effective immediately.\"",
      "Both officials filed lawsuits seeking reinstatement in the federal district court in Washington. District court judges separately ruled in favor of Wilcox and Harris, finding their removals were unlawful and returning them to their roles.",

      "\"The people elected the president, not Harris or Wilcox, to execute the nation's laws,\" he said. \"The forcible reinstatement of a presidentially removed principal officer disenfranchises voters by hampering the president's ability to govern during the four short years the people have assigned him the solemn duty of leading the executive branch.\"",

      "As with the others, the latest bid for intervention by the high court attacks the scope of the order issued by the district judge presiding over the case, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg. But the criticisms of Boasberg by the president and his allies escalated the administration's ongoing tension with the courts. Mr. Trump called for the judge to be impeached after he issued an order that blocked the administration earlier this month from using the Alien Enemies Act to summarily deport migrants, prompting a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.",

      "The legal battle began earlier this month when the president invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to order the deportation of Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of Tren de Aragua prison gang. Mr. Trump claimed in his proclamation that the gang was \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States,\" the legal threshold for using the authority, which has only been invoked three times before, and all during times of war.",
      "The president declared that all members of the gang who are in the U.S. unlawfully were \"subject to immediate apprehension, detention and removal.\"",
      "Five Venezuelan nationals who are being held at an immigration detention center in Texas filed a lawsuit in Washington, D.C., on March 15 that sought to stop the administration from removing them under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Boasberg agreed to block the removals\u00a0of the five Venezuelans for 14 days. Several hours later, the judge expanded his order to prevent the Trump administration from deporting any migrants believed to be members of Tren de Aragua under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The judge had also told the Justice Department in person during a hearing that any planes carrying people subject to Mr. Trump's proclamation that were going to take off or were already in the air needed to return to the U.S. Planes carrying migrants later landed in El Salvador, raising questions\u00a0about whether the government complied with Boasberg's order.",
      "The Justice Department has argued that it was not bound by the oral directive, though the district court has continued to examine whether the government complied with his order.",
      "The Trump administration appealed the court's two-week ban on deportations under the Alien Enemies Act to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which issued a 2-1 decision\u00a0Wednesday that declined to allow the administration to resume the deportations.",
      "In the filing with the Supreme Court, Harris argued that the Alien Enemies Act gives the president sweeping national-security authority, and she warned that the district court's orders are harming the administration's ability to conduct foreign policy.",
      "\"That order is forcing the United States to harbor individuals whom national-security officials have identified as members of a foreign terrorist organization bent upon grievously harming Americans,\" she argued. \"Those orders \u2014which are likely to extend additional weeks \u2014 now jeopardize sensitive diplomatic negotiations and delicate national-security operations, which were designed to extirpate TdA's presence in our country before it gains a greater foothold.\"",
      "In addition to this case, the Supreme Court is also weighing requests for emergency relief arising from challenges to Mr. Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, the mass firings of federal probationary workers\u00a0and the Department of Education's cancellation of teacher preparation grants that purportedly funded diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",

    "summary": "President Trump signed an executive order targeting funding for Smithsonian Institution programs that he says contain \"divisive, race-centered ideology.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0targeting funding for programs at the\u00a0Smithsonian Institution\u00a0that contain what he characterizes as \"divisive, race-centered ideology\" in his latest broadside against a liberalism that has critiqued Western culture and values.",
      "The president said in the order that there has been a \"concerted and widespread\" effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing \"objective facts\" with a \"distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.\" He said this narrative has cast the \"founding principles\" of the U.S. in a \"negative light.\"",
      "\"The Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,\" Mr. Trump said in the order. \"This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.\" He pointed to a sculpture exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum representing that \"[s]ocieties including the United States have used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement.\"",
      "The order tasks Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, with overseeing efforts to \"remove improper ideology\" from all areas of the institution, including its museums, education and research centers and the National Zoo.",
      "It marks Mr. Trump's latest salvo against cultural pillars of society, such as universities and art, that he sees as out of step with conservative sensibilities. He recently had himself installed as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the aim of overhauling programming, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show. The administration also recently forced Columbia University to make a series of policy changes by threatening the Ivy League school with the loss of several hundred million dollars in federal funding.",
      "The executive order also hints at the return of statues and monuments of Confederate figures, many of which were taken down or replaced around the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is detested by Trump and other conservatives.",
      "The president directed the secretary of the interior to determine whether, since Jan. 1, 2020, \"public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior's jurisdiction have been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.\"",
      "The order also calls for improvements to Independence Hall in Philadelphia by July 4, 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Mr. Trump singled out the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, the Women's History Museum, which is in development, and the American Art Museum for criticism.",
      "\"Museums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn \u2014 not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,\" he said in the order.",
      "Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution's chief spokesperson, said in an email late Thursday, \"We have no comment for now.\"",
      "Under the order, Vance is to work with the White House budget office to make sure future funding for the Smithsonian Institution isn't spent on programs that \"degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.\" The president also wants to ensure that the women's history museum celebrates women and not \"recognize men as women in any respect.\"",
      "The Smithsonian Institution is the world's largest museum, education and research complex. It consists of 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven museums are located along the National Mall in Washington.",
      "The institution was established by Congress with money from James Smithson, a British scientist who left his estate to the United States to found \"at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.\"",

    "summary": "A new study shows how cuts to foreign aid could lead to millions of HIV/AIDS deaths and soaring rates of infections, undoing decades of progress against the virus.",
    "story": [
      "Proposed cuts to global foreign aid, including slashing programs in the United States, could lead to millions of HIV deaths and soaring rates of infections around the world in the coming years, according to a new study.",
      "Published Wednesday in\u00a0The Lancet HIV journal, the modeling study estimates that by 2030, there could be between 4.4 million to 10.8 million additional new HIV infections in low- and middle-income countries and 770,000 to 2.9 million HIV-related deaths in children and adults. To estimate the impacts, the authors examined 26 countries that used foreign aid for HIV resources, including Albania, Cambodia, Colombia, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, South Africa and Sri Lanka.",
      "They noted that international funding has been crucial in reducing HIV transmissions and deaths, and that five countries \u2014 the U.S., U.K., France, Germany and the Netherlands \u2014 provide over 90% of international HIV funding, with the U.S. being by far the largest contributor. The U.S. committed $5.71 billion in 2023, or about 73% of total donor government funding, according to analysis by KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization.",
      "But as of February, they authors report, donor nations have announced reductions in aid of between 8% and 70% between 2025 and 2026. The Trump administration froze foreign aid\u00a0spending, including funding for HIV/AIDS programs, soon after taking office, and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, is spearheading major cutbacks.",
      "\"The United States has historically been the largest contributor to global efforts to treat and prevent HIV, but the current cuts to PEPFAR and USAID-supported programs have already disrupted access to essential HIV services including for antiretroviral therapy and HIV prevention and testing,\" co-lead study author Debra ten Brink of the Burnet Institute in Australia said in a news release.",
      "The study's authors said ongoing disruptions could undo decades of progress to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat.",
      "\"Looking ahead, if other donor countries reduce funding, decades of progress to treat and prevent HIV could be unravelled. It is imperative to secure sustainable financing and avoid a resurgence of the HIV epidemic, which could have devastating consequences, not just in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, but globally,\" said ten Brink.",
      "PEPFAR, or the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, was launched under then-President George W. Bush in 2003 and has invested over $100 billion in the global HIV/AIDS response over the years. According to the State Department, the program has saved the lives of\u00a026 million people since it began\u00a0\u2014 but its funding stopped after Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered a\u00a0pause on foreign aid\u00a0earlier this year.",
      "\"PEPFAR is the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease in history, enabled by strong bipartisan support across ten U.S. congresses and four presidential administrations, and through the American people's generosity,\" the government website HIV.gov reads. \"PEPFAR shows the power of what is possible through compassionate, cost-effective, accountable, and transparent American foreign assistance.\"",
      "Others have already warned about the devastation these cuts could bring to those who rely on it. Earlier this week, the UNAIDS chief warned that without funding, millions will die and the global AIDS pandemic will resurge.",
      "\"It is reasonable for the United States to want to reduce its funding over time, but the sudden withdrawal of lifesaving support is having a devastating impact,\" UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima told reporters in Geneva. \"We urge for a reconsideration and an urgent restoration of services \u2014 lifesaving services.\"",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said the U.S. contributions play a key role that could not be easily replaced.",
      "\"Many of these countries rely heavily on the United States. Some of them between 50 and 70% of their budgets for HIV diagnosis, treatment and prevention is coming from the United States,\" she said on \"CBS Mornings Plus.\" \"There's not really any other country that can easily step in. And big picture, this is sort of like telling a surgeon in the middle of surgery to walk away. It's just not that easy to jump in and take over.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang quickly kicked off a legal battle.",
      "A federal judge on March 15 issued a temporary restraining order that blocked the use of the 18th-century law. That order was upheld\u00a0by a federal appeals court on March 26. Two days later, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to lift the lower court orders.",
      "However, on the same day as the March 15 order, three flights carrying more than 200 Venezuelan men were flown to El Salvador to be held in the nation's maximum security prison.",
      "White House officials told CBS News last week that 137 of those Venezuelans were expelled under the Alien Enemies Act. Another 101 were removed under what officials described as \"regular\" proceedings under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, including people who allegedly signed deportation papers after crossing the border illegally, officials said.",
      "Here's what to know about the Alien Enemies Act and how it has been used.",
      "What is the Alien Enemies Act of 1798?",
      "The Alien Enemies Act is one of the laws enacted as part of the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798 under President John Adams and the Federalist-controlled Congress. At the time, the U.S. was anticipating a war with France.",
      "The law states that when the U.S. is at war or facing an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" by another nation, the president can detain and deport citizens of the enemy nation without due process.",
      "Two other laws in the Alien and Sedition Acts increased the number of years an immigrant needed to be in the U.S. to become a citizen and allowed the president to deport non-citizens deemed to be \"dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States,\" according to the National Archives. The fourth law, the Sedition Act, restricted speech that was considered critical of the government and was used to prosecute journalists and others.",
      "Opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts contributed to the defeat of the Federalists in the election of 1800, which was won by Thomas Jefferson, the Democratic-Republican candidate.",
      "Jefferson allowed three of the four laws to expire, according to historians. But, there was no expiration written into the Alien Enemies Act, so it remained.",
      "The\u00a0Neighbors Not Enemies Act\u00a0is a proposed law that would repeal the Alien Enemies Act. It was reintroduced in January by Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, both Democrats.",
      "How is Trump using the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "In a proclamation\u00a0invoking the Alien Enemies Act on March 15, Mr. Trump declared that Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, \"is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\" and that all Venezuelan citizens over 14 years old who are members of Tren de Aragua and are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents are \"liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.\"",
      "Chief D.C. District Judge James Boasberg, whose order has temporarily blocked Mr. Trump from removing immigrants under the law, questioned the legality of its use in this case.",
      "\"Despite the President's determination otherwise, Tren de Aragua is not a 'foreign nation or government,' and its actions, however heinous, do not amount to an 'invasion' or a 'predatory incursion,'\" he wrote.",
      "In a March 19 briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that \"when you read the act ... a predatory incursion is absolutely what has happened with Tren de Aragua. They have been sent here by the hostile Maduro regime in Venezuela. And the president, immediately upon taking office, designated TdA as a foreign terrorist organization.\"",
      "When else has the Alien Enemies Act been used?",
      "The law has been invoked three other times in U.S. history: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "In 1812, the Madison administration required British nationals in the U.S. to report information to the government, including their age, addresses, the length of time they'd been in the U.S. and their occupations, according to a document signed by then-Secretary of State James Monroe.",
      "President Woodrow Wilson used the act in 1917 to limit the activities and speech of citizens of Germany and its allies in World War I. The use of the act led to the internment of more than 6,000 German nationals and \"other enemy aliens,\" the National Archives says.",
      "Then, after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked the Alien Enemies Act to detain citizens of Japan and the other Axis powers, Germany and Italy. But, Roosevelt also issued an executive order that allowed for the internment of Japanese Americans. More than 100,000 people of Japanese descent were sent to internment camps, which the federal government\u00a0formally apologized for\u00a0in 1988.",
      "In 1948, the Supreme Court ruled in Ludecke v. Watkins, a case involving a German national who was ordered to be removed in 1946 under the Alien Enemies Act, despite the end of fighting in World War II. In a 5-4 decision, the high court dismissed the German national's challenge, arguing \"a state of war\" remained and it was a matter of \"political judgment\" to determine if an individual could be removed under the Alien Enemies Act, which precludes judicial review.",
      "\"It is not for us to question a belief by the President that enemy aliens who were justifiably deemed fit subjects for internment during active hostilities do not lose their potency for mischief during the period of confusion and conflict which is characteristic of a state of war even when the guns are silent but the peace of Peace has not come,\" Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote in the opinion.",
      "In a dissent, Justice Hugo Black argued it is \"nothing but a fiction\" to say the U.S. was currently at war with Germany, and that \"the 1798 Act did not grant its extraordinary and dangerous powers to be used during the period of fictional wars.\"",

    "summary": "NOAA's Office of Space Commerce plays a crucial role in the growing space industry and is tasked with helping to manage satellite traffic to guard against collisions.",
    "story": [
      "Top Democrats on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee are sounding the alarm about cuts to a little-known but rapidly expanding space office within NOAA as part of the hundreds of recent layoffs at the agency.",
      "NOAA's Office of Space Commerce is tasked with helping to manage commercial and military satellite traffic in space to help guard against collisions, as well as licensing and regulating commercial satellite systems. The office has recently gotten attention around Washington as a key government office for commercial space companies.",
      "Its already small team lost eight employees in the initial round of layoffs in late February, representing around 30% of its staff, according to multiple sources. Since then, three staffers in leadership roles were brought back, but lawmakers still worry about the impact.",
      "The members of Congress are calling for all fired employees within the office to be reinstated permanently. Earlier this month, fired employees were placed on administrative leave after their firings were blocked by a federal court ruling.",
      "In a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, obtained by CBS News, lawmakers including the committee's ranking member Zoe Lofgren, of California, say the firings could compromise the office's public safety programs and risk hurting U.S. leadership in space.",
      "They also question whether there's a conflict of interest given Trump adviser and DOGE leader Elon Musk's stake in SpaceX.",
      "\"If OSC is gutted, the harm to America's economy, its national security, and its public safety will leave everyone worse off \u2014 except perhaps for SpaceX, whose size and scale will allow it to mitigate the damage done to the rest of the commercial space sector,\" reads the letter in part.",
      "\"As the largest and most profitable commercial satellite operator, SpaceX has already achieved a size and scale that far surpasses its competitors, thereby positioning the company to withstand market disruptions and uncertainty with much greater ease than its less-established rivals,\" it continues.",
      "In addition to Lofgren, the letter is signed by Democratic House members Valerie Foushee, of North Carolina, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics; and Emilia Sykes, of Ohio, the ranking member of the subcommittee on Investigations & Oversight.",
      "Former NOAA officials also say the steep cuts to the office appear to be at odds with policy goals set out under the first Trump administration to help manage increasing commercial and civil space traffic.",
      "Admiral Timothy Gallaudet, who served as acting administrator of NOAA during the first Trump administration, called the cuts \"self-defeating,\" since the office was established to help support a growing commercial space sector. Gallaudet now works as a consultant for space companies.",
      "\"One of our goals, broadly, was to support these growing tech industries. One of them was space, and we grew,\" Gallaudet told CBS News. \"If that office has employees fired, that means it's going to take more time for them to issue licenses to new companies.\"",
      "Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation's conservative policy playbook, even called for Republicans to \"elevate\" the Office of Space Commerce, saying the office \"should be the vehicle for a new Administration to set a robust and unified whole-of-government commercial space policy that cements U.S. leadership in one of the most crucial industries of the future.\"",
      "One of the employees who remains on leave, Cole Donovan, served as an international affairs specialist within the Office of Space Commerce. His work focused on regulations and coordination between private space companies in the United States and the European Union.",
      "\"For my division, specifically, we don't have an expert anymore on EU law and EU regulation,\" he said. \"We had been helping U.S. companies navigate that process.\"",
      "Committee Democrats have asked Secretary Lutnick whether impacts to the U.S. space industry were assessed before the firings took place. They also asked whether any communications occurred between SpaceX representatives and officials from the Department of Commerce, NOAA or the Office of Space Commerce.",
      "The lawmakers also want to know whether the Office of Space Commerce will be compelled to grant DOGE access to proprietary data from SpaceX competitors that could potentially be disclosed to Musk and SpaceX.",
      "\"These unprecedented conflicts of interest threaten to destabilize the entire U.S. commercial space sector if they are not immediately addressed,\" they write in the letter.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Department of Commerce, DOGE and NOAA for comment, as well as SpaceX.",

At least one account remained public for a day after the Atlantic report.",

      "According to screenshots obtained by CBS News, White House national security adviser Michael Waltz's friends list on Venmo was open to the public to view as late as Tuesday \u2014 a day after the Atlantic report about the Signal chat was published. On Wednesday, his account settings were changed to make his contacts private.",

      "Susie Wiles, President Trump's chief of staff, was listed on Waltz's Venmo friends list, but her account is now no longer searchable. On Wednesday, Wired magazine reported on Waltz' and Wiles' Venmo accounts and said their respective accounts were made private after the publication contacted the White House.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has faced a barrage of criticism this week for sharing details on the Signal chat about the March 15 U.S. strike on Iranian-backed Houthis, had an account in early March, but it has since been deactivated, CBS News has learned.",

On Tuesday, Gabbard and Ratcliffe both said they were not aware of any information that was shared in the chat regarding weapons packages, targets or timing. The Atlantic on Wednesday released more of the texts on those topics after officials on the chat stated repeatedly that nothing disclosed in the Signal group was classified.",

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other Trump officials allegedly used Signal for a group chat to discuss a highly sensitive operation.",
    "story": [
      "An encrypted messaging app called Signal is drawing attention and questions after top Trump officials \u2014 including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 allegedly used the service to discuss a highly sensitive military operation while inadvertently including The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, in the chat.",
      "On Monday, Goldberg published a piece in The Atlantic about how he was added to an 18-person chat on Signal earlier this month to discuss military strikes in Yemen, writing that at first he \"didn't think it could be real.\"",
      "The National Security Council said the messages seem to be \"authentic,\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "The use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations is raising questions about the app, including its level of security against hackers and other bad actors. It's an app that many Americans may not be familiar with, given that Signal had about 70 million users in 2024, a fraction of the 1 billion active monthly users of Apple's iMessage, according to the national security publication Lawfare.",
      "President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he had asked national security adviser Mike Waltz, who Goldberg said added him to the group chat, to \"immediately study\" the use of Signal by government officials.",
      "Here's what to know about the service.",
      "What is Signal?",
      "Signal is an encrypted service for text messaging, but it can also handle phone and video calls, making it a versatile app for talking on a secure channel with others. Up to 1,000 people can join a group chat, and messages can be set to disappear after a period of time.",
      "Signal has been gaining users because of its end-to-end encryption, which is boosting its \"adoption during uncertain times or specific events which reinforce its position as the go-to communication service,\" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Its encryption prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. In other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them.",
      "Unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, encryption on Signal is turned on by default. Signal also says it doesn't collect or store any sensitive information.",
      "\"Signal messages and calls cannot be accessed by us or other third parties because they are always end-to-end encrypted, private and secure,\" according to the service.",
      "Signal didn't immediately reply to a request for comment about the Trump administration's use of the app.",
      "Who owns Signal?",
      "Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up by co-founders Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton to support the app's operations as well as \"investigate the future of private communication,\" according to the foundation's website. The foundation says it is a nonprofit \"with no advertisers or investors, sustained only by the people who use and value it.\"",
      "The foundation's board has five members, including Marlinspike and Acton, who co-founded WhatsApp and donated $50 million to set up the foundation.",
      "The Signal app was created more than a decade ago by Marlinspike, an entrepreneur, who was briefly head of product security at Twitter after he sold his mobile security startup, called Whisper Systems, to the social media company in 2011. Marlinspike merged two existing open source apps, one for texting and one for voice calls, to create Signal.",
      "Can Signal be hacked?",
      "Signal touts the privacy of its service, and experts agree it is more secure than conventional texting.",
      "But they also caution that it could be hacked. And in February 2025, the National Security Agency sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees cautioning them of vulnerabilities in the Signal app, according to internal NSA documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin says.",
      "Signal\u00a0responded\u00a0to the bulletin in a social media post Tuesday, saying the NSA's \"memo used the term 'vulnerability' in relation to Signal-but it had nothing to do with Signal's core tech. It was warning against phishing scams targeting Signal users.\"",
      "\"Phishing isn't new, and it's not a flaw in our encryption or any of Signal's underlying technology,\" the company said. \"Phishing attacks are a constant threat for popular apps and websites.\"",
      "Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings. But in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration.",
      "\"Unlike other end-to-end encryption messaging services, Signal does boast a rich range of features,\" Pescatore said. \"However, hackers are always on the prowl to find weaknesses and use apps maliciously.\"",
      "What is Signal typically used for?",
      "Because of its end-to-end encryption, Signal is often used by national security and intelligence professionals, as well as activists, among others, according to Lawfare.",
      "A recent\u00a0Associated Press review\u00a0found that encrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, with some using government mobile phone numbers, while others registered their accounts to personal numbers.",
      "Are there legal issues for government officials using Signal?",
      "Possibly, yes. Sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act, CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a nonsecure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "While Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Tuesday that \"I don't know anything about Signal, I wasn't involved in this,\" he indicated that other branches of government use the app.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" he said. \"A lot of the military, I think successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Signal is the \"No. 1 device or app that is used\" that he had asked Waltz to explore its use by government officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are\u00a0demanding an investigation\u00a0into why highly\u00a0sensitive information\u00a0was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "The Atlantic's Goldberg also alleged that some of the messages in the group chat were designed to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",

      "Musk's political action committee used a nearly identical tactic before the presidential election last year, offering to pay $1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states who signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments. A judge in Pennsylvania said prosecutors failed to show the effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day.",
      "Musk on Friday initially said in a post on his social media platform, X, that he planned to \"personally hand over\" $2 million to a pair of voters who have already cast their ballots in the race.",
      "Musk later posted a clarification, saying the money would go to people who will be \"spokesmen\" for an online petition against \"activist\" judges. After first saying the event would only be open to people who had voted in the Supreme Court race, he said attendance would be limited to those who have signed the petition.",
      "Also on Friday, Musk's political action committee identified the recipient of its first $1 million giveaway \u2014 a Green Bay man who had donated to the Wisconsin GOP and the conservative candidate in the court race, and who has a history of posting support for Trump and his agenda.",
      "The judicial election comes as Wisconsin's highest court is expected to rule on abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting rules that could affect the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election in the state.",
      "There will also be congressional elections held Tuesday in Florida that have attracted big fundraising. Florida's 6th District was vacated when National Security Adviser Mike Waltz joined Mr. Trump's Cabinet, and the 1st District was held by former Rep. Matt Gaetz, who resigned to join the Trump administration as Attorney General. He eventually withdrew his name from consideration, but he had already vacated his seat. Both districts voted for Mr. Trump by 30 points or more, but Democrats have dominated fundraising."

      "Legendary television actor Richard Chamberlain, known as the king of the miniseries for his roles in \"Shogun\" and \"The Thorn Birds,\" has died at the age of 90, his publicist Harlan Boll confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The actor died Saturday, March 29, in Waimanalo, Hawai'i of complications following a stroke. He was two days shy of his 91st birthday.",

      "Born George Richard Chamberlain on March 31, 1934 in Beverly Hills, California, he attended Beverly Hills High and later Pomona College, where he graduated with a degree in art. After a two-year stint in the U.S. Army, stationed in Korea, Chamberlain launched his career when he earned his first TV appearance as a guest spot on Alfred Hitchcock \"Presents.\"",
      "The role that put him on the map was the lead in the TV show \"Dr. Kildare,\" which earned Chamberlain the first of three Golden Globes in his career.",
      "He went on to star in notable films including \"Petulia,\" The Three Musketeers,\" \"The Music Lovers,\" and Peter Weir's \"The Last Wave.\"",
      "His forte, however, remained in the small screen, where he portrayed the likes of King Edward VIII, Octavius Caesar, and Scott Fitzgerald.",
      "Chamberlain also had a brief, yet successful, period as a recording artist, mostly romantic ballads, and was nominated for a Grammy.",
      "On the stage, Chamberlain played the title role in \"Hamlet\" for the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in England. On Broadway, Chamberlain appeared in \"My Fair Lady\" and \"The Sound of Music.\" In addition to successful tours with \"My Fair Lady\" and \"The Sound of Music,\" Chamberlain also played King Arthur on the national tour of the musical \"Spamalot.\"",
      "Other TV and movie appearances included \"The Drew Carey Show,\" \"Nip/Tuck,\" \"I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry,\" \"Brothers & Sisters\" and \"We are the Hartmans.\"",
      "He earned the title of \"King of the Miniseries\" when he appeared in \"Centennial,\" \"Shogun,\" and \"The Thorn Birds.\"",
      "In 2003, Chamberlain came out as gay in his memoir, \"Shattered Love,\" saying \"I can talk about it now because I'm not afraid anymore.\"",
      "\"When I grew up, being gay, being a sissy or anything like that, was verboten,\" he told \"Dateline.\" \"I disliked myself intensely and feared this part of myself intensely and had to hide it.\"",
      "Apart from acting and singing, ecological matters were a subject close to Chamberlain's heart. He had lobbied long to save the Tuolomne River, which originates in Yosemite National Park in California. His efforts helped to put the river under the National Wild and Scenic System, a legislation that protects the river.",
      "Funeral services have not been announced at this time. Instead of flowers donations in his name are requested to either NPR or to Hawaii Humane Society.",

      "From \"Dallas\"That word pulls the trigger,Rips through my house like the wind.I said, one day I'll go to you,Yell at the airAt the building,At anyone who was there.Years passed,The pain didn't.",
      "She said, \"It wasn't something that anybody really talked about, so I just didn't talk about it, either.\"",
      "\"Nobody asked how you were doing?\" I asked.",
      "\"Not that I'm aware of. I grew up in a family that soldiered on. And I think there's a lot that's admirable about that, but I think there's a lot that then you never get to know about yourself.\"",
      "It seems as if before she was running through the forest of her big life. And now, at age 69, she's stopping at individual trees \u2013 moments, she writes:",
      "From \"Those Moments\"You look at those moments like little stones.\u00a0You turn them upside down and right side up.You stare at them.\u00a0Look for what you saw, and what you missed.",
      "One of those stones glittered with Hollywood magic: her marriage to Arnold Schwarzenegger, later California's governor. \"I had been with Arnold since I was 21,\" she said. \"I had gone straight from my parents to him.\"",
      "Years later, though, that once-glittering stone pulled her underwater when the two divorced.",
      "From \"The Public Square\"Shame filled my bodyHumiliation filled my soulEvery inch of me being crumbled.",
      "And that's where she says she'll leave it. \"I don't believe in kind of talking behind other people's backs in public; it's just never been my jam,\" Shriver said. \"And I'm in a good place with Arnold, and that's really important to me.\"",
      "It's been at St. Monica Catholic Church in Los Angeles where her faith has gotten her through many a challenge. \"I've yelled at God \u2013 I don't know anybody who hasn't \u2013 so I just take my focus off of Him and move to Mary,\" she laughed.",
      "She minored in Theology at Georgetown, and actually considered being a nun. \"And then I heard that, you know, they didn't have sex, and they had to take a vow of poverty. I'm like, I'm out!\"",
      "She eventually landed in the secular world of journalism \u2026 first here at CBS, then later at NBC. It was high-profile. In the late '80s there weren't a lot of female news anchors \u2013 certainly not pregnant ones. \"And I was anchoring with Gareth Utley, esteemed journalist. And he had never sat next to somebody who was throwing up during commercial breaks,\" she said.",
      "Shriver forged ahead in a man's world, much the way she says her mother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, tried to do as well. \u00a0\"She was formidable. She was fierce. Yet she grew up in a family where the men were the focus \u2013 they were the first row, so to speak.\"",
      "I asked, \"I got a sense that you just didn't feel like you were kind of seen, truthfully, I guess?\"",
      "\"Yeah. I don't think \u2013 I think my mother, you know, was focused on her work, she was focused on her brothers,\" Shriver said. \"I have no doubt she loved me. I have no doubt she wanted to push me 24/7, and she did.\"",
      "\"Did that experience change the way you decided to be a mom?\"",
      "\"Oh, yeah, 100%,\" Shriver replied. \"My door was always open. I just hope that my kids know that they were \u2013 makes me cry! \u2013 but you know, the priority of my life. And I hung with them, and I had time with them and time for them.\"",
      "Eunice Shriver died in 2009; her father, Sargent Shriver, just a few years later, after a long battle with Alzheimer's. Ever since, Shriver, who grew up in Camelot, found that that disease was the dragon she wanted to slay.",
      "In a 2017 Congressional hearing on National Institutes of Health funding, Shriver testified, \"Every 66 seconds, another brain will develop Alzheimer's disease, and two-thirds of those brains belong to women.\"",
      "She founded the Women's Alzheimer's Movement at the Cleveland Clinic, and pushed the Biden administration for a comprehensive plan to fund research into all kinds of women's health issues.",
      "\"We, as half the population, deserve answers,\" Shriver said, \"not just on Alzheimer's, but on endometriosis, on menopause, on migraines, on osteoporosis, on MS.\"",
      "She has used her public voice for causes all her life. But her poetry, she says, is her private voice \u2013 and this time, Maria Shiver's cause is herself.",
      "\"Life hasn't turned out exactly the way I thought,\" she said. \"But I sit here today in love with my life, deeply grateful. I'm at peace. And I really spent a lot of years not at peace. Some people would say, who know me well, 'You're not at peace. You're restless and you're driven' and all that sort of stuff. But I'm really content with my life and I'm proud of myself, finally.\"",

    "story": [
      "Friday, Nov. 12, 2021, started as a fun night in Los Angeles for architect Hilda Marcela Cabrales, 26, and her friend, 24-year-old model Christy Giles. The pair headed out to a nightclub in Hollywood and then to a warehouse party in East Los Angeles to see a DJ they both loved.",
      "Christy's husband, Jan Cilliers, was in San Francisco that weekend visiting his father. He says Christy and Hilda, who was new to Los Angeles, were becoming \"fast friends.\"",
      "But what started as a happy girls' night out took a sinister turn, Cilliers says, when he woke up that Saturday morning in San Francisco to see his wife's phone location at a Los Angeles address he didn't recognize. He and Christy always shared locations, he says, for safety reasons.",
      "Cilliers says he texted Christy and didn't hear back. And, as the hours mounted without a word, Cilliers says, his fear began to grow.",
      "What happened that weekend and the tragic aftermath is investigated by \"48 Hours\" and contributor Jonathan Vigliotti in \"Dead Girls Don't Talk,\" to be broadcast Saturday, March 29 at 10/9c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Cilliers says he experienced \"raw panic\" when, at around 5 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 13, he says he saw Christy's phone had moved to a hospital about three miles from that strange address. Cilliers soon learned that Christy had been dropped there by two masked men in a black Prius without license plates. They said they found her unconscious on the street nearby and were being \"good Samaritans.\" Doctors had declared Christy dead on arrival.",
      "\"So, in less than 24 hours, your world was turned upside down?\" asks Vigliotti.",
      "\"Shattered, yes,\" Cilliers replies.",
      "Hilda also had a habit of sharing her phone location \u2014 with a close friend who was also her emergency contact. That friend also became concerned on Saturday, when she saw Hilda's phone pinging at 8641 West Olympic Boulevard \u2014 the same address where Cilliers had tracked Christy's phone.",
      "Hilda's friend soon learned that Hilda, like Christy, had been dropped off at a hospital by two masked men driving a black Prius with no plates, who said they had found Hilda passed out on the street.",
      "Hilda was still alive, but in critical condition. Two weeks later, with no sign of regaining consciousness, her family made the difficult decision to take Hilda off life support. Her sister, Fernanda Cabrales-Arzola, said she remembers telling Hilda it was OK to leave and that she told Hilda, \"Thank you for being my sister.\"",
      "Hilda's family decided to donate her organs, and her mother, Dr. Hilda Marcela Arzola-Plascencia, said she remembers the medical team lining the hallway and \"clapping. To honor her for giving life.\"",
      "Because both Cilliers and Hilda's friend knew exactly where the two women had been all day, and because they knew the minute each woman was taken to each hospital, when LAPD detectives got the call about the two cases, they had a huge head start.",
      "Within hours of Hilda being dropped off at that second hospital, LAPD homicide detective Jonathan Vander Lee and his partner were on their way to 8641 West Olympic Boulevard. By the time they arrived, they knew it was the home of David Pearce and that he owned a black Prius. Pearce lived there with a roommate named Brandt Osborn.",
      "A month later, Pearce and Osborn were arrested in connection with the two women's deaths. Pearce was eventually charged with two counts of felony murder and Osborn, who was seen helping Pearce take both women out of their home and dropping them off at both hospitals, was charged with accessory to murder after the fact.",
      "It took a little more than three years for their cases to go to trial, but in the end, Pearce was convicted of murdering Christy and Hilda and of raping seven other women who came forward to testify at the trial. The jury deadlocked on a verdict for Osborn, and a mistrial was declared for his case.",
      "At a press conference after Pearce's conviction, Christy's mother, Dusty Giles, pleaded with the public to learn the safety lesson from her daughter's case, saying, \"As much as it hurts to lose my baby girl ... her sharing her location technology told us where she was.\"",
      "Police say that information was critical to helping get Pearce, whom prosecutors say was a serial rapist, finally off the street.",
      "Dusty Giles begged the public to learn the lesson from their horrendous loss, \"Please, within your own families ... share locations,\" she said, adding, \"You'll never know when you're going to not be able to get in touch with somebody.\"",
      "Pearce has not yet been sentenced, and the district attorney has not announced if Osborn will be retried.",

      "The woman was Christy Giles, and her mother Dusty Giles will never forget the call that came from the hospital, telling her that her 24-year-old daughter was dead from a drug overdose.",
      "Dusty Giles: And I said, \"what do you mean she didn't make it?\" \u2026 and then I hung up and I fell apart.",
      "Two hours later, at a hospital just two miles away, a second woman was left at another emergency room by the same two men also in a black Prius and wearing masks.",

      "CHRISTY GILES AND HILDA MARCELA CABRALES",
      "And in the earliest hours of the investigation, there were only questions. How could this happen to Christy? It was an unimaginable ending to a life bursting with exuberance.",
      "Christy was an adventurer, traveling the world as a high fashion model for Wilhelmina. She ultimately made L.A. her home.",
      "At 21, her life took a dramatic turn. Christy met Jan Cillers, a South African-born artist, photographer, and special effects editor 17 years her senior. They'd been together seven months when the couple went to Burning Man \u2014 an arts festival in the Nevada desert \u2014 where, impulsively, they took a big leap.",
      "Jan Cilliers: We just decided to elope. We just got married right there. \u2026 we said to each other that, you know, life's very short \u2026 So we kind of really just proposed to each other and the next day we got married.",
      "After they got married, Christy started studying interior design in Los Angeles\u00a0 \u2013 which led to a new friendship with Hilda Marcela. Hilda had just moved there to start her dream job, recalls her father.",
      "Luis Cabrales: I feel very happy for her, but very sad for me, because we are \u2014 we are very close.",
      "No one was surprised that the cum laude graduate of the prestigious university in Monterrey Mexico was thriving in LA, \u00a0especially her sister, Fernanda.",
      "Fernanda Cabrales-Arzola: She was always making a lot of friends. Talkative, outgoing. \u2026 just having a good time and meeting people that they also like the music, that they are also enjoying dancing.",
      "Dancing is what the two friends were doing that night.",
      "Christy's husband Jan Cilliers was out of town visiting his father. He knew she and Hilda had planned a girl's night out starting at Soho House, and then on to a warehouse party after midnight to see a favorite DJ. A friend who was with them said they did ketamine \u2014 a popular club drug.",
      "But by the next day, Cilliers was on his way home knowing Christy was gone.",

      "Jonathan Vigliotti: Are these drugs that Christy would take willingly?",
      "Jan Cilliers: I mean that combination of drugs sounds deadly to me. So, like, no.",

      "At 5:30 a.m., Christy sends Hilda a wide-eyed emoji and says, \"let's go.\" Hilda replies: \"I'll call an Uber\" \"10 min away.\"",
      "Jan Cilliers: The fact that they're both in the same house text messaging each other \u2026 they need to leave is very worrying.",
      "That was the last text message that Christy or Hilda ever sent. That Uber arrived, waited five minutes, and drove away empty.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: How did you process that?",

      "Acting on information supplied by Cilliers, Vander Lee and his partner headed to 8641 West Olympic Boulevard a little after midnight on Nov. 14 \u2014 only a few hours after getting that call from the second hospital.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: And this is where the Uber that Christy and Hilda called that night would have waited?",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: Right out front, yep.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: Ten minutes between life and death.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: That's all it takes.",
      "It was the home of 39-year-old David Pearce. Police would learn Christy and Hilda had met him for the first time at that warehouse party. Police also discovered Pearce had a registration for a black Prius and found it parked behind the building. It matched the car seen at both hospitals \u2014down to the black rims. Pearce lived on the second floor with a roommate \u2014 Brandt Osborn, 42.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: There was a light on in the upstairs where the two men live. \u2026 so I just went up, knocked on the door. Immediately, the lights go out.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: You identified yourself?",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: Yes, completely\u2014LAPD, open the door. And then it's just complete silence.",
      "After about 15 minutes, he says, Pearce and Osborn came out. Pearce denied owning a Prius.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: So I immediately get a lie.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: Do you leave?",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: No. I interviewed Mr. Osborn.",
      "At first, he says, Osborn denied seeing Christy and Hilda at all.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: He changes his stories numerous times. At first, there's no girls had been on that location whatsoever.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: I \u2026 tell him on the interview, listen, I know you're lying. It's extremely obvious. You're very nervous.",
      "Vander Lee says Osborn eventually admitted the women had been at their apartment, but said he'd been asleep and when he woke up realized Christy and Hilda were in distress. He said he and Pearce chose to go to two separate hospitals because quote \"we didn't know how it would look.\"",
      "Pearce, police say, did later admit he owned the Prius, but lied again, saying his license plates had been stolen. Vander Lee says he saw those plates on the ground by the vehicle.",
      "Then, the men agreed to let detectives inside.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: Two beds had been stripped. \u2026 There was a washing machine that had been recently used. It was still wet.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: \u2026 Anything else that stands out to you?",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: There was a safe in his room with, uh, baggies, which was indicative of narcotics \u2026 he \u2026 said they're for crafts \u2014 for arts and crafts.",
      "By now, Vander Lee says he knew Pearce and Osborn had dropped Hilda and Christy off, and believed Pearce had drugged them, but he didn't have enough evidence to make an arrest.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: He thought he'd beat us that night, for sure. And he was happy.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: He smiled and said goodbye?",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: Yeah.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: \"Thanks, detectives\"?",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: Yep.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: But that wasn't where it ended for you?",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: No, not by a long shot.",
      "Vander Lee knew he needed more evidence and turned to his colleague, Detective Calvin You.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: You hear the name, David Pearce. What goes on in your mind?",
      "Lt. Calvin You: Well, the first thing is \u2026 Who did he sexually assault this time?",
      "Detective You had investigated Pearce in 2020 for sexually assaulting a 19-year-old.",
      "Lt. Calvin You: She was raped while she was unconscious.",
      "The victim said Pearce had given her drugs to knock her out during a date. But the investigation had stalled and wasn't prosecuted at the time. Detective You knew Pearce had other prior charges, including another rape charge from 2014 that was also not prosecuted.",
      "Lt. Calvin You: He has a pattern. \u2026 His first step is trying to find his victim. So that could be through \u2026 a dating app through online listings or meeting them at bars or events. \u2026 When he picks his victim, he goes to step two, which is bragging about himself.",
      "Pearce relies on lies, detectives say, to set his trap.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: He'd introduce himself as a producer, as doctor, all these different things. \u2026 He's none of these things \u2026 He might have been an intern at the time or something at a production company.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: An intern?",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: Yeah.",
      "They say his next step is to drug his victims and incapacitate them, often with a drink.",
      "Lt. Calvin You: After they take this drink, he goes to step four, which is the sexual assault.",
      "Police would learn both Christy and Hilda showed signs of sexual assault, but they feared they would face challenges making the case.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: How difficult is it to prove a crime took place when the victims were recreationally using drugs?",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: \u2026 it makes \u2026 the case extremely hard. \u2026 I had told Jan early on that this was gonna be a near impossible case to prove.",
      "FATAL ENCOUNTER",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: At first, it's a whodunit. But \u2026 it just became what actually happened \u2026 and that's what was difficult in this case.",
      "Detective Vander Lee says the pressure was on to locate any evidence of what happened after Christy and Hilda met David Pearce that night.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee:\u00a0 Video starts expiring. \u2026 these DVRs, it's a constant \u2026 you gotta get this evidence before it disappears.",
      "Police did have some luck, starting with footage from outside that warehouse party. They say it shows the women leaving with Pearce, Osborn, and a friend of theirs \u2014 47-year-old Michael Ansbach \u2014 on their way to Pearce's apartment.",
      "Police also uncovered this text exchange from moments earlier, when the women were still inside that party. \"Do you want coke,\" asks Hilda. \"Yes,\" replies Christy. Hilda texted back, \"I'm in the kitchen. Let's do a line.\"",
      "Witnesses say Pearce supplied that cocaine, which Cilliers says was not a common choice for Christy.",
      "Jan Cilliers: Maybe it was late at night and she wanted to get less tired \u2026 it's not something that she would do regularly.",
      "Police determined the group arrived at Pearce's apartment a little after 5 a.m. The women aren't seen again until 11 hours later, when, at 4:30 p.m. a security camera recorded the grainy image showing Pearce with Christy over his shoulder at the top of the stairs. Police say Osborn is carrying her bag. 35 minutes later, at the hospital, Pearce, wearing a black sweatshirt, helps take Christy's body out of the car. Osborn looks on.",
      "A full hour-and-a-half later, a dark image shows the men leaving the apartment again, with Hilda. Police say Pearce is carrying her and Osborn has her boots and coat. Half-an-hour later, the Prius arrives at that second hospital where the men take Hilda out of the car together.",
      "It had been more than 13 hours since Christy texted Hilda: \"let's go.\"",
      "For two weeks Hilda was on life support. With no hope of regaining consciousness, her family gathered to say their goodbyes.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: Hilda, what were your final moments with your daughter?",
      "Dr. Hilda Marcela Arzola-Plascencia: Oh, they were so hard you know \u2026 and I just was asking God to not let her suffer more.",
      "Fernanda Cabrales-Arzola: I remember telling her that you can leave \u2026 and just thanking her for being my sister.",
      "Luis Cabrales: I told her \u2026 baby when I pass away I will see you again. \u2026and I give you a big hug, a kiss.",
      "The family decided to donate Hilda's organs. Her mom remembers the medical staff lining the halls as the family accompanied Hilda to the OR.",
      "Dr. Hilda Marcela Arzola-Plascencia: The medical team was clapping \u2026 to honor her, to say thank you for giving life to others.",
      "Like Christy, Hilda had suffered a drug overdose. Toxicology reports would later reveal that she had cocaine, MDMA or ecstasy, and elevated levels of fentanyl in her system. Police would also learn that while the women were in that apartment, the downstairs neighbor heard someone \"in pain and moaning on-and-off\" for six hours. Police believe that was Hilda. Neither Pearce, nor Osborn, nor Ansbach called for help.",
      "Dr. Hilda Marcela Arzola-Plascencia: It makes me get angry \u2026 because she was suffering and nobody, nobody helped her.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: How hard is it to prove this narrative when the victims \u2026 can't even testify on their own behalf?",
      "Lt. Calvin You: If we were just investigating Christy and Hilda's alone, very difficult.",
      "But the district attorney at the time went public asking other women who knew Pearce to call in, so police could better understand what he did to Hilda and Christy.",
      "D.A. GEORGE GASCON (to reporters): \u00a0If you feel comfortable moving forward so that we can evaluate your case and charge it\u00a0 we're here for you.",
      "Lt. Calvin You: We started getting a lot of calls.",
      "As police continued building their case, Cilliers received a call that Pearce and Osborn were on the move. He recorded video of the men loading up a moving van the day after Hilda died. Police say Pearce had also changed his phone number, and it took them a week to locate him again.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: So the pressure is on. You gotta get this guy.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: I gotta come up with something quick, yes.",
      "On Dec. 15, 2021, David Pearce, Brandt Osborn, and Michael Ansbach were arrested in connection with Hilda and Christy's deaths. The detectives still knew next to nothing about what had happened inside that apartment. Vander Lee says they decided to take a gamble and bring the men in.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: This is the only way we're going to get the info we need.",
      "Once the men were in custody, police conducted interviews with them one by one.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: We kind of played with a rotation and it worked out exceedingly well.",
      "They secretly recorded Pearce and Osborn while Ansbach was talking to police.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: Pearce \u2026 says, \"I hope Ansbach is not up there telling him \u2026 I gave them drugs and wine.\"",
      "When it was his turn, Pearce denied giving the women drugs.",
      "DAVID PEARCE (police interview): I was told \u2026 there was like a very bad batch of fentanyl that was going around.",
      "This was suspicious because information that the women had likely died from fentanyl had not been released.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: I knew \u2026 these girls died from fentanyl but nobody else knew.",
      "Two months after his arrest, Ansbach reached out to police with details of what he says he witnessed that night. He says Pearce had offered the women a ride to an after party, and then said he needed to make a quick stop at his house. Ansbach says Pearce was \"very insistent they stay and have a drink,\" and, after the women talked about leaving, Pearce gave all three of them so-called \"special cocaine.\"",
      "Ansbach says he, Christy and Hilda got sick immediately, and... when he woke up hours later, he saw Christy without any signs of life. Ansbach says he told Pearce to take Christy and Hilda to the hospital and says Pearce then said repeatedly, \"dead girls don't talk.\"",
      "Jackie | Jane Doe No. 2: I wouldn't say survivor. I'm a fighter. That's what I am.",
      "But police had at least one woman who could talk about David Pearce at his upcoming trial.",

      "SURVIVORS SPEAK OUT AT TRIAL",
      "On Jan. 9 2025, opening arguments begin in the trial of David Pearce, charged with felony murder, and Brandt Osborn, charged with accessory after the fact.",
      "CATHERINE MARIANO (in court): The evidence will show that the defendant knowingly gave Hilda and Christy GHB and fentanyl, knowing that it was dangerous to their lives, knowing that it could kill them, but he just didn't care. \u2026 Defendant Osborn helped him get rid of any evidence to implicate defendant Pearce in the deaths of Christy and Hilda.",
      "Prosecutor Catherine Mariano has marshalled the forensic evidence to make her case: the toxicology results that found fentanyl in both women and the date rape drug GHB in Christy. Also, Pearce's DNA discovered on Christy's body and under Hilda's fingernails.",
      "CATHERINE MARIANO (in court): This is no accident. This is no mistake.",
      "But in order to prove felony murder, she must show that Pearce incapacitated Christy and Hilda to rape them. Without their testimony, she needs to establish he had a history of doing this to other women: putting drugs in their drinks and then sexually assaulting them.",
      "CATHERINE MARIANO (in court): He didn't care whether they lived or died, all he cared about taking advantage of them.",
      "JEFF VOLL (in court): Here's where there's a problem \u2026",
      "But defense attorney Jeff Voll says the fact that Christy and Hilda were using drugs before meeting Pearce that night means there is no case for murder.",
      "JEFF VOLL (in court): \u2026 these young ladies unfortunately ingested fentanyl and they died \u2026 it's a shame but Mr. Pearce didn't kill them.",
      "Voll is sixth in a long line of lawyers who have represented Pearce in this case. He knows his client is problematic.",
      "Jeff Voll: \u2026 he's very demanding \u2026 he's very sure of himself. \u2026 what David Pearce wants David Pearce gets.",
      "Mariano has her own version of who David Pearce is based on the accounts of the women who talked to investigators and chose to be anonymous.",
      "Jackie is Jane Doe No. 2.",
      "Jackie: It was important for me to come forward \u2026 and, you know, get any information I could regarding this vile man.",
      "No cameras were allowed in the courtroom for any of the testimony, but Jackie agreed to talk with \"48 Hours\" about her experience with Pearce in 2010 when she was a 24-year-old law student looking for a room to rent. She testified about her meeting with Pearce at his apartment on West Olympic Boulevard, where he gave her a tour and offered a drink.",
      "Jackie: I started to spin and, you know, I \u2014 I just became, like, disoriented.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: You drink this drink, you start to feel dizzy, I'm sure confused. What happens next?",
      "Jackie: So the next thing I know, um, he was, you know, basically trying, I would say, trying to rape me \u2026 So I started fighting him back.",
      "According to Jackie he continued to assault her.",
      "Jackie: He threw me onto the floor. \u2026 he punched me in the face.",
      "When she tried to take her phone out, he grabbed her arm so hard the phone flew and smashed into the wall. Unsteady on her feet and unable to call for help, she did everything she could to escape.",
      "Jackie: I had to crawl down the stairs I was so disoriented and crawled down West Olympic Boulevard to my car \u2026 screaming for help.",
      "Though seriously injured and traumatized, she did not report it.",
      "Jackie: There's a huge stigma that surrounds women that come forward with sexual assault.",
      "But when she heard about Christy and Hilda, she decided to act.",
      "In all, 20 women came forward. Pearce was charged with seven sexual assaults. Detective Calvin You thinks that's just a fraction of those who suffered at the hands of David Pearce.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: Are there more Jane Does out there?",
      "Lt. Calvin You: Yes. I would definitely say so.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: How many do you believe?",
      "Lt. Calvin You: I'd say a hundred.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: A hundred. That's incredible. And that's just based on the people that you have spoken with directly?",
      "Lt. Calvin You: Yes.",
      "Jan Cilliers: I'm just so grateful that they came forward \u2026 I can't even imagine how the level of bravery that you have to have in order to \u2026 testify to a room of strangers that you were so intimately violated.",
      "And as the women testified one by one, defense attorney Voll could see what was happening; the prosecution strategy was working.",
      "Jeff Voll: The victims coming to court testifying, some who broke down in tears, all gave the same testimony \u2026 and I am watching the jury.",
      "Jeff Voll: They're looking at him and the expression on the juror's faces are like, how could you? How could you do this?",
      "After the Jane Does testified, the prosecution called Pearce's friend Michael Ansbach, who was in the apartment that night and later arrested along with Pearce and Osborn.",
      "Ansbach took video of Christy and Hilda minutes after Pearce gave them wine and cocaine at the apartment.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: Christy's lying on the couch. It looks like she's on her way to becoming unconscious.",
      "In his testimony, Ansbach again said he also used the same cocaine, got violently ill and then passed out. When he woke up, he said, Pearce asked him to check on Christy and when he did, Ansbach said, it looked like she was not breathing. Hilda, he said, was in Pearce's bedroom. According to Ansbach, this is when Pearce told him \"dead girls don't talk.\"",
      "Like Pearce and Osborn, Ansbach never called for help. His charges were later dropped.",
      "On day 11 \u2014 and against the advice of his attorney \u2014 David Pearce, who pleaded not guilty, was sworn in and testified.",
      "Lt. Calvin You: So he got on the stand and he did his best to try to say everybody was wrong and he was right.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: He was apparently the only one telling the truth at the entire trial.",
      "On the 12th day, Pearce's roommate Brandt Osborn, who also pleaded not guilty, takes the stand.",
      "Det. Jonathan Vander Lee: So, Osborn's role was to help get rid of the bodies, first and foremost. \u2026 He helped carry the girls at first \u2026 He helped formulate the plan in terms of what they're gonna tell the security guards.",
      "Osborn testified he was \"dumbfounded\" by Pearce's behavior and was emotional \u2013 crying more than once on the stand \u2014 saying he played no part in a cover-up because he didn't have a complete picture of what was really going on.",
      "Cilliers, for one, was not buying it.",
      "Jan Cilliers: He's basically claiming to be an innocent bystander in the situation and that he's also a victim in the situation. \u2026 but there are facts that prove that he helped David Pearce cover it up.",
      "The question is whether the jury will believe either man. After three weeks, the trial took a toll on Christy's family.",
      "Dusty Giles: We sat and had to hold our mouth closed while they battered, and I feel like they destroyed my daughter's reputation.",
      "Jan Cilliers: It was definitely difficult being in the same room as them. \u2026 did I have an overwhelming urge to throw something really hard at their heads? Yeah.",
      "In closing, Prosecutor Mariano hits back at the defense \u2013 just because Christy and Hilda did drugs on their own that night doesn't make them responsible for their own deaths. David Pearce took care of that, Mariano argued.",
      "CATHERINE MARIANO (in court): He didn't care about violating them in the most awful way. He didn't care that by drugging Christy and Hilda, that they could die.",
      "And she repeats the words of Ansbach attributed to David Pearce \u2014 the words that rang in the ears of everyone who loved Christy and Hilda.",
      "CATHERINE MARIANO (in court): He wanted them to die because \"dead girls don't talk.\"",
      "Attorneys for Osborn and Pearce told jurors there simply was not enough direct evidence linking them to the crime and that there's a strong case for reasonable doubt.",
      "Now it's up to the jury to draw its own conclusion about Brandt Osborn and David Pearce.",
      "Dusty Giles made her decision about that a long time ago.",
      "Dusty Giles: Pearce is a sick, slimy \u2026 lizard that sits and preys and sneaks \u2026 and his bite is deadly.",

      "For Christy's family, it's been a long and wrenching road to get here.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: For you, what does justice for Christy look like?",
      "Jan Cilliers: I mean (sigh) there's no justice for Christy \u2026 There is only preventing him from doing it again, I think. \u2026 That's the only justice we can get.",
      "And for Hilda's mother, who could not travel to be in court, the last three years without her daughter have been its own trial.",

      "But the jury is deadlocked when it comes to Brandt Osborn and a mistrial is declared.",
      "PROSECUTOR MARIANO (to reporters following verdict): I was surprised, definitely disappointed at \u2014 at the hung jury. I thought the trial made clear that he had definitely a hand in their deaths.",

      "Jan Cilliers: I saw that she was at a location that I didn't recognize.",
      "Her phone was located at 8641 West Olympic Boulevard.",
      "Jan Cilliers: So \u2026 a little orange flag at the back of your head.",
      "Jan Cilliers: I still hadn't heard back from her, and I saw her location had suddenly moved \u2026 to the hospital.",
      "Jan Cilliers: I called the hospital. They told me that she was in the emergency room and at that point, like, I'm in real panic.",
      "Jan raced to the airport to catch a flight back to L.A.",
      "Jan Cilliers: I called her parents \u2026 let them know that something terrible had happened and that she's in the emergency room \u2026 and then, her mom called the emergency room and called me back probably five minutes later, letting me know that Christy passed away.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: In less than 24 hours, your world was turned upside down.",
      "Jan Cilliers: Shattered.",
      "Jan went straight to the hospital. Christy and Hilda's friend who had been at the warehouse party with them, but left early, was already here. She had been desperately trying to get in touch with Hilda but couldn't reach her. They were about to find out why.",
      "Jan Cilliers: She \u2026 got a call from a different hospital like two hours later saying that Hilda was just checked in there \u2026 And then \u2014 like, obviously, all our alarm bells are going off in our heads when both girls are dropped off at two different hospitals, two hours apart. Like something terrible happened that night.",
      "And Jan believed, whatever happened, took place at that mysterious address on Olympic Blvd. He put it on Instagram asking for help.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: You blast out this address and very quickly, you got responses.",

      "Mary Fulginiti: A murderer.",

      "As Hilda Marcela lay in a hospital bed fighting for her life in LA, Dusty and Leslie Giles were preparing to bury their daughter Christy in Alabama.",
      "Half her ashes would go to Jan to scatter in the places they loved. Dusty placed the rest in an urn inside a butterfly box and gently wrapped it in the wedding dress she never had the chance to wear.",
      "Dusty Giles: It was important because I know how happy she was when she found it. She swirled like a princess literally in it.",
      "Within hours of Christy's death, detectives on the case were following clues from Christy herself.\u00a0 Her pinging phone had led them straight to the apartment of David Pearce at 8641 West Olympic Blvd.",
      "Barry Telis: Police drive over there. Oh, my God. There's the car. Boom. There's the car. \u2026 Same car.",
      "Telis says police believed it was the same black Prius with no license plates that dropped Christy off at the hospital.",
      "Barry Telis: And it's like, OK, I think \u2014 I think we have our man.",
      "They retraced the movements of the women that night, which would become the basis of a police affidavit. When they combed through those pictures from the party at the warehouse, there was David Pearce with Hilda partying it up in the VIP section.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: it sounds like VIP access gave David Pearce \u2026 instant credibility.",
      "Barry Telis: Absolutely. It's all part of the manipulation \u2026 He must be a good guy. He's in the VIP section.",
      "It was likely all part of a plan to meet women \u2014 a plan that included drugs, says the retired detective.",
      "Barry Telis: Based on the witnesses' statements and the police investigation\u2026 David Pearce comes with a bag of cocaine \u2014 an ounce estimated \u2014 and David Pearce came here to share it with whoever he could meet.",
      "According to Telis, cocaine is a hot ticket at these parties, at least on that night, even for Hilda and Christy.\u00a0 The police recovered this text exchange between the two women starting at 4:21 a.m. while still at the warehouse party: \"Do you want coke?\" asks Hilda. \"Yes,\" replies Christy. Hilda texted back \"I'm in the kitchen. Let's do a line.\"",
      "According to the police affidavit, a witness \"observed Pearce provide what looked like cocaine to Giles and Cabrales who consumed it.\"",
      "Police say half an hour later, surveillance video obtained by \"48 Hours\" shows Hilda and Christy leaving with David Pearce and two other men \u2014 his roommate Brandt Osborn and their friend, photographer Michael Ansbach. They all get into Osborn's car.",
      "At 5:11 a.m., according to the police affidavit, surveillance video \u2014 which has not been released because of the ongoing investigation \u2014 shows Osborn's car arriving in front of the apartment. According to the affidavit, several people got out of the vehicle and headed to the entrance of the residence.",
      "Nineteen minutes later, at 5:30 a.m., Christy sends \u2014 from inside Pearce's apartment \u2014 a wide-eyed emoji text to Hilda saying, \"let's go.\" Hilda replies \"I'll call an Uber 10 min away.\"",
      "Thirteen minutes later, according to the affidavit, a car, believed to be the Uber, pulls up. After waiting five minutes it drives away without Christy and without Hilda.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: How did you process that?",
      "Jan Cilliers: I mean it's just confirming my worst fears again that they were there at that place against their will. They didn't want to be there. They wanted to leave.",
      "Mary Fulginiti, a former federal prosecutor and defense attorney and a CBS News consultant, has reviewed the police affidavit and court documents. She says this text is an important piece of evidence.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: Something or someone stopped them in their tracks because they never got out and they never left.",
      "No one knows exactly what went on inside that apartment for the next 13 hours. But, according to the affidavit, a neighbor heard someone \"in pain and moaning on-and-off during the hours of 10:30 a.m. \u2026until 4 p.m.\" For reasons not known, the neighbor did not call police.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: She's clearly in a distressed state that everyone seems to just be ignoring. And when I say everyone, not just Pearce or Osborn, but there's a third individual that appears to have been at that apartment, at least for part or all of the night, and that's Michael Ansbach.",
      "Whatever happened inside the apartment was hidden from public view, not so outside the apartment. Another key piece of evidence: images captured on security cameras.",
      "Barry Telis (standing outside Pearce's apartment): But the cameras are in the adjacent building right next door, pointing right in this direction.",
      "Although Telis has not seen the video, the police affidavit describes it in detail. At 4:19 in the afternoon \u2014 11 hours after they'd arrived at the apartment \u2014 Pearce and Osborn are caught on camera carrying Christy down the back stairs.",
      "Barry Telis: It shows Pearce exit the door \u2026 the back door, looks \u2026 in both directions.",
      "Barry Telis: Making sure the coast is clear \u2026 making sure there's not gonna be any witnesses that sees me carrying this body to my car.",
      "Both men get in the Prius. According to the affidavit, the men are captured on security cameras trying to disguise themselves.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: You see them putting on a hat, a mask and a hoodie. And then they drive away, and they drive to a hospital. Southern California Medical Center.",
      "Shortly after, according to police, Ansbach leaves the residence carrying bags \"of unknown items.\"\u00a0 Pearce and Osborn return to the apartment to get Hilda. They carry her partially clad body out to the Prius.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: And again, they leave \u2026 They don't go to the same hospital. They go to a different hospital, Kaiser Permanente.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: Why not bring them at the same time to the same hospital?",
      "Barry Telis: Who knows? They're trying to conceal their actions. They're trying to keep the police at bay, and they don't want to hit the radar.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: And they do the same thing \u2026 They drop the body, they tell the same story, and then they take off without leaving their name, their phone number or anything to identify themselves with.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: And Hilda \u2026 what is her state at this point.",
      "Barry Telis: Hilda was still alive \u2026 when they got her to the hospital \u2026 and then she was declared what we call brain dead.",

      "Erica Bergman, who also goes by Erykah Poe, is not one of the Jane Does. But she says she was so traumatized by Pearce, she tried to warn other women about him on a blog called \"The Dirty\" as far back as 2013. She discovered she had a lot of company.",
      "Erica Bergman: There's a lot of commonalities in our stories.",
      "Erica says she met Pearce at a low point in her life \u2013 she was getting a divorce and money was tight. Initially, she says she was taken in by him.",

      "Erica says she wanted to leave but felt trapped. She says he threatened to send compromising pictures to her estranged husband whom she was battling in divorce court. She reluctantly stayed, but she says the violence only got worse.",

      "Jonathan Vigliotti: It took months before David Pearce was charged with murder. What was your reaction?",
      "Jan Cilliers: I mean, definitely relief, but also very sad.",
      "The police did not find any fentanyl-laced drugs in Pearce and Osborn's apartment, just drug paraphernalia. But Osborn, who has been charged as an accessory to murder after the fact, may have unwittingly explained why. According to the police affidavit, Osborn told coworkers if cops had found the \"drugs hidden underneath the cash\" inside the car they would've been in \"big trouble.\"",
      "Not finding fentanyl-laced drugs creates a big challenge for the prosecution, says Fulginiti.",
      "Mary Fulginiti: They're going to have to prove that David Pearce gave the girls these drugs and he knew at the time that it could harm them, and he did so with conscious disregard. \u2026 so, they're gonna have to prove that David Pearce intended to kill these young women. That's not an easy threshold to overcome.",
      "Especially in light of witness statements that the women were doing drugs willingly \u2014 cocaine at the warehouse and earlier in the evening, as well. Friends told police Christy and Hilda both had taken cocaine and ketamine, a popular club drug.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: How does this work in the defense's favor?",
      "Josh Ritter: Because fentanyl is a problem in this country \u2026 And people are dying from fentanyl that they take recreationally because they believe that they're only taking cocaine.",
      "Josh Ritter: If you're the defense, that's the point you want to continue to drive home. It's, how do you hold these two men responsible for an epidemic that's really plaguing the entire country?",

      "And how do you get around the fact that Christy had the so-called date rape drug, GHB, in her system?",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: Is GHB, is the date-rape drug something these women would have taken knowingly?",
      "Mary Fulginiti: Absolutely not \u2026 that is a drug that's usually used by sexual predators, guys that want to, you know, take advantage of women and don't want them to remember and know about it.",
      "Hilda and Christy were still coherent at 5:30 a.m. on Saturday morning when they exchanged that text about calling an Uber \u2014 the text punctuated with a wide-eyed emoji.",

      "In a bold decision, the state will combine the sexual assault and murder charges in one trial.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: Why include sexual assault charges in a murder case?",
      "Mary Fulginiti: If you look at this case in its totality, I mean, this is David Pearce's MO. \u2026 He lures women back to his apartment. He provides them with a drink. \u2026 And then they start to feel dizzy or they blackout, and he sexually assaults them.",
      "While Christy and Hilda's autopsy stated there was no physical or sexual trauma, nurses who treated Hilda noted slight bleeding in her vagina, and a review of her sexual assault examination found a small abrasion.",
      "Jonathan Vigliotti: I know this is a difficult conversation. Do you think Hilda and Christy were potentially raped that night?",
      "Dr. Hilda Marcela Arzola-Plascencia: Of course, I believe that. \u2026 That's the reason why they drugged them.",
      "Josh Ritter believes the testimony of the women who were allegedly drugged and raped by Pearce will help jurors see a dangerous pattern of behavior.",
      "Josh Ritter: Their testimonies are going to be huge \u2026 one woman \u2026 perhaps the defense can poke holes in that. \u2026 Two women, it begins to sound like \u2026 is this really a coincidence or not? But three or four women or more and you realize you're dealing with \u2026 with a monster.",
      "It turns out David Pearce had been on the police radar for years. According to the police affidavit, he was arrested in 2014 for sexual assault, along with an additional rape case. But these cases are often difficult to prove and were ultimately rejected by the District Attorney's Office \u2014 something Christy's sister Misty finds unforgivable.",
      "Misty Weldon: To know that \u2026 he had been arrested and had been released \u2026 is just appalling to me \u2026 It's really sad that two beautiful girls had to die in order for him to be in jail right now.",
      "David Pearce has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him.",

      "U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell criticized how the DOGE team handled the situation but said she would not grant a temporary restraining order to stop DOGE. The USIP had asked the judge to stop DOGE from \"completing the unlawful dismantling of the institute.\"",

      "\"The Institute's employees are fiercely dedicated to their important work, and they don't deserve to be treated with such disrespect,\" Foote said. \"This action only adds urgency to the complaint that has been filed to halt and reverse the Administration's unlawful attempt to dismantle the Institute. We will continue to press this matter in court, where we are confident we will prevail.\"",

      "Crowds protesting billionaire Elon Musk's purge of the U.S. government under President Trump began amassing outside Tesla dealerships throughout the U.S. and in some cities in Europe on Saturday in the latest attempt to dent the fortune of the world's richest man.",
      "The protesters are trying to escalate a movement targeting Tesla dealerships and vehicles in opposition to Musk's role as the head of the newly created Department of of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he's gained access to sensitive data and shuttered entire agencies as he attempts to slash government spending. Most of Musk's estimated $340 billion fortune consists of the stock he holds in the electric vehicle company that he continues to run while also working alongside Mr. Trump.",
      "Earlier protests have been somewhat sporadic. Saturday marked the first attempt to surround all 277 of the automaker's showrooms and service centers in the U.S. in hopes of deepening\u00a0a recent decline in the company's sales.",
      "By early afternoon, crowds ranging from a few dozen to hundreds of protesters had flocked to Tesla locations in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Maryland, Minnesota and the automaker's home state of Texas. Pictures posted on social media accounts showed protesters brandishing signs such as\u00a0\"Honk if you hate Elon\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"Fight the billionaire broligarchy.\"",
      "The Tesla Takedown movement also hoped to rally protestors at more than 230 Tesla locations in other parts of the world. Although the turnouts in Europe weren't as large as the crowds in the U.S., the anti-Musk sentiment was similar.",
      "About two dozen protesters held signs lambasting Musk outside a Tesla dealership in London as passing cars and trucks tooted horns in support.",
      "One of the signs displayed at the London protest showed a photo of Musk next to an image of Adolf Hitler making the Nazi salute \u2014 a\u00a0gesture that Musk has been accused of reprising shortly after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. A person in a tyrannosaurus rex costume held another sign with a picture of Musk's straight-arm gesture that said, \"You thought the Nazis were extinct. Don't buy a Swasticar.\"",
      "\"We just want to get loud, make noise, make people aware of the problems that we're facing,\" said Cam Whitten, an American who showed up at the London protest.",
      "Tesla Takedown was organized by a group of supporters that included disillusioned owners of the automaker's vehicles, celebrities such as actor John Cusack, and at least one Democratic Party lawmaker, Rep. Jasmine Crockett from Dallas.",
      "\"I'm going to keep screaming in the halls of Congress. I just need you all to make sure you all keep screaming in the streets,\" Crockett said during a\u00a0Tesla Takedown organizing call\u00a0held earlier this month.",
      "In New York City, mayoral hopeful and New York state Rep. Zohran Mamdani joined protesters at a Tesla showroom on Saturday.",
      "\"We are here in a moment that demands all of us,\" Mandani told the crowd through a megaphone. \"It demands all of us because the richest man in the world has purchased the president of the United States.\"",
      "Some people opposed to Musk have gone beyond protests and set the automaker's vehicles on fire and committed\u00a0other acts of vandalism that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has decried as \"nothing short of domestic terrorism.\" Musk indicated he was dumbfounded by the attacks during a March 20 company meeting and said the vandals should \"stop acting psycho.\"",
      "Crockett and other Tesla Takedown supporters have been stressing the importance for Saturday's protests to remain peaceful.",
      "But police were investigating a fire that destroyed seven Tesla vehicles in northwestern Germany early Saturday morning. It was wasn't immediately clear if the blaze, which was extinguished by firefighters, was related to the Tesla Takedown protests.",
      "There have been vandalisms at Tesla dealerships acrossing the U.S., including fires in Nevada and Missouri, and graffiti at locations in Massachusetts and Maryland, CBS News previously reported.",
      "Since January 2025, incidents targeting Tesla EVs have occurred in at least nine states, according to a joint intelligence bulletin issued by the Department of Homeland Security and FBI and obtained by CBS News.\u00a0Although U.S. intelligence suggests lone actors are behind them, Trump administration officials are promising to crack down on what they say are coordinated attacks.",
      "There have also been reports of vandalism to parked Teslas, making individual owners nervous.",
      "\"My wife cautions me, 'Be careful where you are at with it,'\" Bill Fonte told CBS New York. \"If you don't like the product, don't buy it. But they're going above and beyond, creating panic and concern for normal people like me.\"",
      "A growing number of consumers who bought Tesla vehicles before Musk took over DOGE have been looking to sell or trade in their cars while others have slapped on bumper stickers seeking to distance themselves from the billionaire's efforts to prune or shut down government agencies.",
      "But Musk didn't appear concerned about an extended slump in sales of new Tesla cars in his March 20 address to employees. He reassured the workers that the company's Model Y, which is undergoing a refresh, would remain \"the best-selling car on Earth again this year.\" He also predicted Tesla will have sold more than 10 million cars worldwide by next year, up from about 7 million cars now.",
      "\"There are times when there are rocky moments, where there is stormy weather, but what I am here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting,\" Musk said.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected last November, investors initially saw Musk's alliance with the president as a positive development for Tesla and its long-running efforts to launch\u00a0a network of self-driving cars.",
      "That optimism helped lift Tesla's stock by 70% in the period between Mr. Trump's Nov. 5 election and his Jan. 20 inauguration, creating an additional $560 billion in shareholder wealth. But virtually all those gains have evaporated amid investor worries about the Tesla backlash, lagging sales in the U.S., Europe and China, and Musk spending time overseeing DOGE.",
      "\"This continues to be a moment of truth for Musk to navigate this brand tornado crisis moment and get onto the other side of this dark chapter for Tesla,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note leading up to Saturday's protests.",

      "Musk's political action committee said Friday that it had awarded $1 million to Scott Ainsworth, a mechanical engineer from Green Bay, for signing its petition protesting against \"activist\" judges. In a video posted on X, Ainsworth encouraged people to sign the petition and \"get out and vote early for Brad Schimel.\"",
      "\"If everyone in the MAGA movement shows up and votes for Brad Schimel, we will win,\" Ainsworth said in the video.",
      "Ainsworth donated $350 to Schimel's campaign this year, campaign finance records show.",
      "Andrew Romeo, a spokesperson for Musk's political action committee, declined to say whether Ainsworth was one of the two who would be receiving $1 million on Sunday.",
      "Musk promised $100 to any registered Wisconsin voter\u00a0who signed the petition or forwarded it to someone who did.",
      "That raised questions about whether the petition violated Wisconsin law that makes it a felony to offer, give, lend or promise to lend or give anything of value to induce a voter to cast a ballot or not vote.",
      "Any legal challenge to Musk's payments could end up before the Wisconsin Supreme Court.",
      "A bipartisan coalition of government watchdog groups and former office holders, along with a liberal Madison law firm, asked the Wisconsin attorney general and the Milwaukee County district attorney to investigate the $1 million payment and the offer of $100 for signing the petition.",
      "The group, in its letter sent Thursday night, said the payments appear to violate the state law against election bribery.",
      "Attorney General Josh Kaul and Milwaukee County District Attorney Kent Lovern did not immediately return messages Friday seeking comment.",
      "Schimel, a former attorney general, was asked about the petition on Thursday by WISN-TV.",
      "\"I, frankly, thought, 'Should I sign that petition? I'm against activist judges, but I don't think I should do that,'\" Schimel said.",
      "When asked about the $1 million award, Schimel said, \"I don't know what the criteria to get it was.\"",
      "Crawford's campaign spokesperson Derrick Honeyman, called Musk's announced visit to Wisconsin a \"last-minute desperate distraction.\"",
      "\"Wisconsinites don't want a billionaire like Musk telling them who to vote for, and, on Tuesday, voters should reject Musk's lackey Brad Schimel,\" he said.",
      "Musk's political action committee used a nearly identical tactic before the White House election last year, offering to pay $1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states\u00a0who signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments.",
      "During last year's presidential race, Philadelphia's district attorney sued in an attempt to stop the payments under Pennsylvania law. But a judge said prosecutors failed to show the effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day.",
      "Musk and groups he funds have already spent more than $20 million in an effort to elect Schimel, while billionaire George Soros has given $2 million to bolster Crawford, and Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has donated $1.5 million.",
      "Musk got involved in the race just days after his electric car company, Tesla, filed a lawsuit against Wisconsin in an effort to open dealerships in the state.",
      "Crawford and her allies have accused Musk of trying to buy influence on the court given that Tesla's lawsuit could end up before the justices.",
      "The race comes as the Wisconsin Supreme Court is also expected to rule on abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting rules that could affect the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election.",
      "Wisconsin is one of a handful of true battleground states, which only intensifies the focus on court races where rules for voting will be decided. Trump won Wisconsin in 2016 and 2024 by less than a percentage point, but he lost it in 2020 by a similar margin. Five of the past seven presidential elections in the state have been decided by less than a percentage point.",
      "More than $81 million has been spent on the Supreme Court race so far, obliterating the record for a judicial race in the U.S. of $51 million set in Wisconsin just two years ago, according to Brennan Center tallies.",

      "Update: A judge in Washington, D.C., issued a temporary restraining order on Friday, March 28, blocking the Trump administration's executive order against the law firm Jenner & Block.",
      "President Trump issued an executive order Tuesday targeting Chicago law firm Jenner & Block. The firm also has an office in Washington, D.C.",
      "Jenner & Block has been an active part of the legal challenges against Mr. Trump's executive orders, including successfully securing a preliminary injunction against an order from the administration that reduced health care access for transgender youth.",
      "That case is still pending in a Maryland-based federal court.",
      "This executive order instructs officials to review and revoke firm members' security clearance, identify any good, property, material and services provided by the federal government and stop providing them, terminate any government contracts that may exist with the law firm, and not hire any employees of the firm for any future federal government jobs.",
      "The order also singles out attorney Andrew Weissman, who worked on Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The executive order says he was re-hired at Jenner & Block, but the firm clarified that Weissman hasn't worked there since 2021.",
      "The executive order specifies that Weissman is prohibited from being hired by or working for the federal government unless a waiver is issued.",
      "The Trump administration has targeted a number of law firms that have been active in challenging or pausing executive orders and policies in the courts.",
      "Previously, the president issued and then rescinded an executive order targeting international law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Garrison & Wharton after it pledged to review its hiring practices and provide tens of millions of dollars in free legal services to support certain White House initiatives.",

    "summary": "President Trump has issued executive orders targeting law firms that have employed his purported political opponents.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced Friday that the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom agreed to provide more than $100 million in pro bono work for initiatives backed by his administration.",
      "The agreement makes Skadden Arps the second major firm to reach a deal with Mr. Trump amid a recent blitz of executive orders targeting law firms that have employed his purported political opponents. The orders issued by the president have focused on the firms Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, and Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, known as WilmerHale.",
      "All three of those firms have filed federal lawsuits challenging the executive orders as a violation of the First Amendment. A federal judge in Washington blocked parts of Mr. Trump's executive order against Perkins Coie earlier this month, and on Friday, two separate judges issued temporary restraining orders halting the president's actions against Jenner & Block and WilmerHale.",
      "While Mr. Trump earlier in the month issued an order going after a fourth firm, Paul, Weiss, it was rescinded after the international firm agreed to provide $40 million in free legal services to support causes backed by the administration.",
      "The president said in a statement posted to Truth Social that in addition to providing $100 million in pro bono work, the firm will not engage in \"illegal DEI discrimination and preferences\" and work with an outside counsel to advise it on employment practices.",
      "Mr. Trump also said Skadden Arps \"will not deny representation to clients, such as members of politically disenfranchised groups, who have not historically received legal representation from major National Law Firms, including in pro bono matters, and in support of non-profits, because of the personal political views of individual lawyers.\"",
      "The White House said Skadden Arps approached the administration \"and declared the Firm's strong commitment to ending the Weaponization of the Justice System and the Legal Profession.\"",
      "Jeremy London, the firm's executive partner, said in a statement distributed by Mr. Trump that it is \"pleased to have achieved a successful agreement with President Trump and his Administration. We engaged proactively with the President and his team in working together constructively to reach this agreement. The Firm looks forward to continuing our productive relationship with President Trump and his Administration. We firmly believe that this outcome is in the best interests of our clients, our people, and our Firm.\"",
      "The executive orders targeting the law firms are among a number of actions taken by Mr. Trump since he returned to the White House that have gone after his perceived enemies. He revoked the security clearances of former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other top Biden administration officials, as well as others who have been critical of him, last week. Mr. Trump also pulled the security details for Dr. Anthony Fauci and retired Gen. Mark Milley, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Trump and Biden administrations.",
      "Executive orders targeting major law firms",
      "The law firm-related orders take issue with the work they have performed and the lawyers previously on their payrolls. In the directive targeting Perkins Coie, Mr. Trump attacked the firm for representing Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign and hiring a research firm that retained a former British spy, Christopher Steele, who\u00a0produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier.\"",
      "The president's order attacking Jenner & Block singles out the firm for hiring Andrew Weissmann, who worked with former special counsel Robert Mueller on his investigation into Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. Weissmann left the firm in 2021. It also took issue with Jenner & Block's work on a challenge to Mr. Trump's executive order that seeks to strip federal funds from medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to minors, among other lawsuits.",
      "In a ruling late Friday, Judge John D. Bates, an appointee of President George W. Bush, issued an order temporarily blocking the action, saying it likely violates the First, Fifth and Sixth Amendments. The judge called Mr. Trump's executive order \"disturbing\" and \"troubling\" on the grounds that it attacks pro bono practice.",
      "\"The court does not take lightly the power to enjoin the executive branch, but the government has not made any persuasive case that the public interest will be harmed\" by halting enforcement, he said.",
      "Mr. Trump's latest executive order, which targets WilmerHale, accused the firm of weaponizing the justice system by employing Mueller and two others who worked on his investigation, James Quarles and Aaron Zebley. Mueller left WilmerHale more than three years ago, according to the firm, and Quarles is retired. Zebley is a partner at WilmerHale.",
      "In his ruling Friday night temporarily blocking\u00a0portions of Mr. Trump's executive order, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon wrote: \"There is no doubt this retaliatory action chills speech and legal advocacy, or that it qualifies as a constitutional harm.\"",
      "Leon said WilmerHale \"faces more than economic harm\" from the executive order, \"it faces crippling losses and its very survival is at stake.\" He wrote that the injuries to the firm from the order \"would be so severe and would spill over to its clients and the justice system at large. The public interest demands protecting against harms of this magnitude.\"",
      "His temporary restraining order stops the Trump administration from requiring government contracting agencies to terminate all contracts with WilmerHale, and stops the administration from restricting WilmerHale employees' access to federal buildings and officials.",
      "The executive orders directed agency heads to suspend any active security clearances held by employees of three firms and require federal contractors to disclose any business with WilmerHale, Jenner & Block and Perkins Coie. The administration is also directed to review all contracts with the firms or with entities that disclose doing business with them.",
      "The fallout from the executive orders has been swift. In a declaration filed with the court, Thomas Perrelli, firm chair and a partner at Jenner & Block, warned that if allowed to take the effect, the restrictions laid out in Mr. Trump's order would be \"devastating and irreparable.\"",
      "According to Perrelli, one client has already informed Jenner & Block that the Justice Department notified them that they cannot bring their lawyers from the firm to a department meeting set for April 3. That client, Perrelli wrote, will need to attend the meeting without their outside representation or hire new counsel before it.",
      "Some Jenner & Block clients are also worried the firm cannot represent them in federal court or go into government buildings to engage with regulatory agencies or government officials, he said. Within 24 hours of Mr. Trump's order, Perrelli said several clients expressed concerns about the firm's representation because they were unsure whether Jenner & Block lawyers could enter federal buildings and courthouses, negotiate with government officials or participate in meetings with the Justice Department.",
      "As to the order's provisions targeting government contractors with a relationship with Jenner & Block, Perrelli said 40% of the firm's revenue came from clients who have federal contracts or subcontracts.",
      "\"If we lost that business, or even a portion of it, it would be a serious threat to the firm's financial health,\" Perrelli wrote.",

      "The Kansas outbreak is spread across 6 southwest counties, the state's\u00a0Department of Health and Environment\u00a0said Wednesday.",
      "The majority of cases, 20, are individuals who were not vaccinated against the infection. Fifteen cases are in school-aged children, between ages 5 and 17, six patients are 4 years old or younger and two are over 18, officials said.",
      "Health officials in Ohio have also\u00a0reported 10 cases this week.",
      "\"Given the measles activity in Texas, New Mexico, and other states around the country, we're disappointed but not surprised we now have several cases here in Ohio and known exposure in some counties,\" Ohio Department of Health Director Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff said in a news release Tuesday.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance\u00a0said Friday during a day trip to a U.S. base in Greenland that the Trump administration doesn't think that \"military force is ever going to be necessary\" there, the same day President Trump said, \"We have to have Greenland.\"",
      "Vance visited the Pituffik Space Base, the northernmost U.S. military installation, along with second lady Usha Vance, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. While there, the vice president blasted Denmark for its handling of the island, as the Trump White House eyes the semi-autonomous Danish territory despite opposition from residents and leaders. While Vance was there, President Trump reiterated his strong desire to acquire the island.",
      "\"We need Greenland, very importantly, for international security,\" the president told reporters at the White House. \"We have to have Greenland. It's not a question of, 'Do you think we can do without it?' We can't.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't ruled out military force in Greenland, while Vance on Friday said he believes the people of Greenland will seek independence from Denmark. A reporter asked Vance if his message is consistent with the president's. Vance said the president wants more of a U.S. presence in Greenland, but \"the president has said clearly he doesn't think that military force is going to be necessary.\"",
      "\"What we think is going to happen is that the Greenlanders are going to choose through self-determination to become independent of Denmark, and then we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there,\" Vance said. \"So I think talking about anything too far in the future is way too premature. We do not think that military force is ever going to be necessary. We think this makes sense. And because we think the people of Greenland are rational and good, we think we're going to be able to cut a deal, Donald Trump style, to ensure the security of this territory but also the United States of America.\"",
      "Vance said his trip to the base helped him see up close how critical Greenland is for U.S. national security. If an enemy fired a missile on the U.S., it would be the American soldiers at the Greenland base who would alert their countrymen, he said. Vance said the U.S. knows Russia and China are taking serious interest in the Arctic, and the U.S. needs to make sure it's leading in the Arctic. But while Vance recognized Denmark has been an important security partner in the past, he launched into criticisms of the European country, saying the U.S. base in Greenland is less secure than it was decades ago because of Denmark's stewardship.",
      "\"There is no amount of bullying, no amount of obfuscating, no amount of confusing the issue,\" Vance said. \"Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland, you have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change. And because it hasn't changed, that's why President Trump's policy in Greenland is what it is.\"",
      "The second lady was originally scheduled to visit Greenland in an expanded cultural trip this week, and then the vice president\u00a0announced\u00a0Tuesday that he would be joining her for a shorter trip that was more focused on U.S. policy and defense.",
      "Vance also thanked soldiers on the base, who are there for a year at a time and can't bring their families with them.",
      "\"I know it's a lot of sacrifice to spend a year away from your families, but the mission is really important,\" Vance said. \"The Trump administration, the president, is really interested in Arctic security. As you all know, that's a big issue, and it's only going to get bigger over the coming decade, so thanks for doing what you do.\"",
      "Waltz told the soldiers they're carrying a \"tradition\" of U.S. soldiers in Greenland, and said the president is very serious about Arctic security.",
      "A statement earlier this week by the vice president's office that announced Vance would join his wife on the trip emphasized Greenland's role in U.S. national security.",
      "\"During World War II, the United States established over a dozen military bases in Greenland to defend the North Atlantic from Nazi incursion,\" the statement said. \"During the Cold War, the United States committed additional resources to Greenland to defend against Soviet missile attacks.\"",
      "The statement went on to criticize Denmark, claiming, \"In the decades since, neglect and inaction from Danish leaders and past U.S. administrations have presented our adversaries with the opportunity to advance their own priorities in Greenland and the Arctic. President Trump is rightly changing course.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't given up on the idea of absorbing Greenland into the U.S., despite opposition from Greenland's leadership and people. Greenland is an expansive island to the north and east of Canada that's a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. It's roughly three times the size of Texas, but mostly covered by ice. Most of its roughly 57,000 people \u2014 a population smaller than Carson City, Nevada \u2014 live along Greenland's southern coast.",
      "A\u00a0recent poll shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States, and residents who spoke with CBS News ahead of Vance's visit to a remote U.S. installation on the island \u2014 America's furthest north military base \u2014 clearly reflected the sentiments shown in that poll.",

    "story": [
      "A unilateral partial ceasefire to facilitate earthquake relief efforts was announced on Saturday by Myanmar's shadow National Unity Government, which coordinates the popular struggle against the ruling military. The country's death toll from the disaster soared to 1,644.",
      "The figure was a sharp rise compared to the 1,002 announced just hours earlier, highlighting the difficulty of confirming casualties over a widespread region and the likelihood that the numbers will continue to grow from Friday's 7.7 magnitude quake. The number of injured increased to 3,408, while the missing figure rose to 139.",
      "In neighboring Thailand, the death toll rose to 17. The quake rocked the greater Bangkok area, home to around 17 million people, and other parts of the country. Many places in the north reported damage, but the only casualties were reported in Bangkok.",
      "Of the death toll, 10 were killed in the high rise building near famous Chatuchak market that collapsed, while the rest were killed in seven other sites. Authorities in Bangkok said 83 people were unaccounted for.",
      "On Saturday, more heavy equipment was brought in to move the tons of rubble, but hope was fading among friends and relatives.",
      "\"I was praying that that they had survived, but when I got here and saw the ruin \u2014 where could they be? said 45-year-old Naruemol Thonglek, sobbing as she awaited news about her partner, who is from Myanmar, and five friends who worked at the site.",
      "In Myanmar, rescue efforts so far are focused on the major stricken cities of Mandalay, the country's No. 2 city, and Naypyitaw, the capital.",
      "But even though teams and equipment have been flown in from other nations, they are hindered by damage to airports. Satellite photos from Planet Labs PBC analyzed by The Associated Press show that the earthquake toppled the air traffic control tower at Naypyitaw International Airport as if sheered from its base.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear if there had been any casualties from its collapse.",
      "Francesco Capoluongo, from the International Federation of the Red Cross in Myanmar, told the BBC that with more than 18 million people living within the earthquake's impacted area, they expect the death toll to keep increasing.",
      "\"The search and rescue is still ongoing,\" she said. \"It's very difficult now to validate any figure, and we know that it will continue to increase and (that) many of these 18 million people are now without safe shelter, access to clean water, reliable health care.\"",
      "Myanmar, also known as Burma, is in the throes of a prolonged and bloody civil war, which is already responsible for a massive humanitarian crisis. It makes movement around the country both difficult and dangerous, complicating relief efforts and raising fears that the death toll could still rise precipitously.",
      "On Saturday night, Myanmar's National Unity Government, which coordinates the popular struggle against the ruling military, announced a unilateral partial ceasefire to facilitate earthquake relief efforts. It said in a statement that its armed wing, the People's Defense Force will implement a two-week pause in offensive military operations starting Sunday in earthquake-affected areas.",
      "It said it would \"collaborate with the U.N. and non-governmental organizations to ensure security, transportation, and the establishment of temporary rescue and medical camps,\" in its controlled areas.",
      "The earthquake struck midday Friday with an epicenter not far from Mandalay, followed by several aftershocks including one measuring a strong 6.4 magnitude. It sent buildings in many areas toppling to the ground, buckled roads, caused bridges to collapse and burst a dam.",
      "In the capital Naypyidaw, crews worked Saturday to repair damaged roads, while electricity, phone and internet services remained down for most of the city. The earthquake brought down many buildings, including multiple units that housed government civil servants, but that section of the city was blocked off by authorities on Saturday.",
      "The government said more than 1,590 houses were damaged in the Mandalay region, the epicenter of the earthquake.",
      "Destruction in Thailand",
      "In neighboring Thailand, the death toll increased to 10. The quake rocked the greater Bangkok area, home to around 17 million people, and other parts of the country. Many places in the north reported damage, but the only casualties were reported in Bangkok, the capital.",
      "Nine of the fatalities were at the site of the collapsed high-rise under construction near Bangkok's Chatuchak market, while 78 people were still unaccounted for.",
      "On Saturday, more heavy equipment was brought in to move the tons of rubble, but hope was fading among friends and family members of the missing that they would be found alive.",
      "\"I was praying that that they had survived but when I got here and saw the ruin \u2014 where could they be? In which corner? Are they still alive? I am still praying that all six are alive,\" said 45-year-old Naruemol Thonglek, sobbing as she awaited news about her partner, who is from Myanmar, and five friends who worked at the site.",
      "\"I cannot accept this. When I see this I can't accept this. A close friend of mine is in there, too,\" she said.",
      "Waenphet Panta said she hadn't heard from her daughter Kanlayanee since a phone call about an hour before the quake. A friend told her Kanlayanee had been working high on the building on Friday.",
      "\"I am praying my daughter is safe, that she has survived and that she's at the hospital,\" she said, Kanlayanee's father sitting beside her.",
      "Thai authorities said the quake and aftershocks were felt in most of the country's provinces. Many places in the north reported damage to residential buildings, hospitals and temples, including in Chiang Mai, but the only casualties were reported in Bangkok",
      "International aid arrives as rescuers ask for help",
      "After more than 24 hours of desperate searching, many exhausted rescue workers are asking for some relief. \"We have been here since last night. We haven't got any sleep. More help is needed here,\" the rescue worker told AFP. \"We have enough manpower but we don't have enough cars. We are transporting dead bodies using light trucks. About 10-20 bodies in one light truck.\"",
      "In a country where prior governments sometimes have been slow to accept foreign aid, Min Aung Hlaing said Myanmar was ready to accept outside assistance.",
      "China and Russia, the largest suppliers of weapons to Myanmar's military, were among the first to step in with humanitarian aid.",
      "China said it has sent more than 135 rescue personnel and experts along with supplies like medical kits and generators and pledged some $13.8 million in emergency humanitarian aid. Russia's Emergencies Ministry said it had flown in 120 rescuers and supplies.",
      "India also sent a search and rescue team and a medical team while Malaysia said it would send 50 people on Sunday.",
      "South Korea said it would provide $2 million worth of humanitarian aid through international organizations, and the U.N. allocated $5 million to start relief efforts.",
      "Hong Kong sent a group of 51 search-and-rescue personnel to help with earthquake relief efforts in Myanmar. The group includes firefighters and ambulance personnel as well as two search-and-rescue dogs, among others.",
      "President Trump said Friday that the U.S. was going to help with the response.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office he'd already spoken to the country's officials and \"It's a real bad one, and we will be helping.\"",
      "However, some experts were concerned about this effort given his administration's deep cuts in foreign assistance.",
      "Natural disaster on top of civil war",
      "Myanmar's military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021 and is now involved in a bloody civil war with long-established militias and newly formed pro-democracy ones.",
      "Military forces continued their attacks even after the quake, with three airstrikes in northern Kayin state, also called Karenni state, and southern Shan \u2014 both of which border Mandalay state, said Dave Eubank, a former U.S. Special Forces soldier who founded the Free Burma Rangers, a humanitarian aid organization that has provided assistance to both combatants and civilians in Myanmar since the 1990s.",
      "Eubank told The Associated Press that in the area he was operating in, most villages had already been destroyed by the military so the earthquake had little impact.",
      "\"People are in the jungle and I was out in the jungle when the earthquake hit \u2014 it was powerful, but the trees just moved, that was it for us, so we haven't had a direct impact other than that the Burma army keeps attacking, even after the quake,\" he said.",
      "In northern Shan, an airstrike on a rebel-controlled village just minutes after the earthquake killed seven militia members and damaged five buildings, including a school, Mai Rukow, editor of a Shan-based online media Shwe Phee Myay News Agency, told the AP.",
      "Government forces have lost control of much of Myanmar, and many places are incredibly dangerous or simply impossible for aid groups to reach. More than 3 million people have been displaced by the fighting and nearly 20 million are in need, according to the United Nations.",

As of Sunday night, more than 1,700 people were confirmed dead in Myanmar and the greater Bangkok area, which took the brunt of the earthquake in Thailand.",

      "Officials were still assessing the damage and any overall estimate remains incomplete. But two days later, a clearer picture has emerged about the extent of the destruction. As efforts pressed on to search the debris, Myanmar has sought emergency aid from the international community.",
      "Myanmar sits on the major north-south Sagaing Fault, which separates the India and Sunda plates, and the widespread damage runs down a wide swath of the middle of the country. The area includes Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city with 1.5 million people that is located near the earthquake's epicenter.",
      "Critical infrastructure has been destroyed including the historic Ava Bridge connecting Sagaing and Mandalay, Mandalay University and various heritage sites, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in a statement Sunday.",

    "summary": "Denmark's foreign minister posted a video scolding the Trump administration hours after Vice President JD Vance's visit to Greenland.",
    "story": [
      "The Danish foreign minister scolded the Trump administration on Saturday for its \"tone\" criticizing Denmark and Greenland during Vice President JD Vance's visit to the strategic island.",
      "Vance \u2014 joined by his wife, second lady Usha Vance, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah \u2014 on Friday visited the Pituffick Space Base, the northernmost U.S. military installation, in Greenland. The trip had been scaled back after an uproar among Greenlanders and Danges who were not consulted about the original itinerary. While there, the vice president blasted Denmark for its handling of the island, saying the U.S. base in Greenland is less secure than it was decades ago because of Denmark's stewardship.",
      "\"There is no amount of bullying, no amount of obfuscating, no amount of confusing the issue,\" Vance said. \"Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland, you have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change. And because it hasn't changed, that's why President Trump's policy in Greenland is what it is.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has eyed the semi-autonomous Danish territory\u00a0despite opposition from residents and leaders. The president told NBC News in an interview on Saturday that \"we'll get Greenland,\" saying there's a \"good possibility that we could do it without military force,\" while adding that \"I don't take anything off the table.\"",
      "Earlier Saturday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen posted a video on social media scolding the Trump administration, saying his country is already investing more into Arctic security and remains open to more cooperation with the U.S.",
      "\"Many accusations and many allegations have been made. And of course, we are open to criticism,\" Rasmussen said speaking in English. \"But let me be completely honest: we do not appreciate the tone in which it is being delivered. This is not how you speak to your close allies. And I still consider Denmark and the United States to be close allies.\"",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen also pushed back on Vance's claim that Denmark isn't doing enough for defense in the Arctic, calling her country \"a good and strong ally.\"",
      "Vivian Motzfeldt, Greenland's foreign minister told CBS News she wants cooperation with the U.S., not domination.",
      "\"You just don't take over. You speak and you talk. That's all politics is about,\" she said.",
      "Danish King Frederik X posted on Facebook: \"We live in an altered reality. There should be no doubt that my love for Greenland and my connectedness to the people of Greenland are intact.\"",
      "Hundreds of protesters demonstrated Saturday outside the U.S. Embassy in the Danish capital Copenhagen with some lifting signs saying, \"back off, USA\"\u00a0Danish broadcaster TV2 reported.",
      "L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, in his video, reminded viewers of the 1951 defense agreement between Denmark and the United States. Since 1945, the American military presence in Greenland has decreased from thousands of soldiers over 17 bases and installations on the island, he said, to the remote Pituffik Space Base in the northwest with some 200 soldiers today.",
      "The 1951 agreement \"offers ample opportunity for the United States to have a much stronger military presence in Greenland,\" the foreign minister said. \"If that is what you wish, then let us discuss it.\"",
      "L\u00f8kke Rasmussen added that Denmark has increased its own investment into Arctic defense. In January, Denmark announced 14.6 billion Danish kroner (US$2.1 billion) in financial commitments for Arctic security covering three new naval vessels, long-range drones and satellites.",
      "The second lady was originally scheduled to visit Greenland in an expanded cultural trip this week, and then the vice president\u00a0announced\u00a0Tuesday that he would be joining her for a shorter trip that was more focused on U.S. policy and defense.",
      "A\u00a0recent poll\u00a0shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States.",

      "Following their visit, the Taliban government announced the release of U.S. citizen George Glezmann after a deal brokered by Qatar. Glezmann, an Atlanta native, had been in custody after being detained by Taliban authorities while on a tourist visit to Afghanistan in December 2022.",
      "The U.S. government had said Glezmaan had been wrongfully detained by the Taliban. Khalilzad called Glezmann's release \"a goodwill gesture\" to President Trump by the Taliban.",
      "Glezmann and Hall are two of several Americans to be released from Taliban custody this year.",

    "summary": "Protesters are trying to escalate a movement targeting Tesla dealerships and vehicles in opposition to Elon Musk's role in DOGE.",
    "story": [
      "Crowds protesting billionaire Elon Musk's purge of the U.S. government under President Trump began amassing outside Tesla dealerships throughout the U.S. and in some cities in Europe on Saturday in the latest attempt to dent the fortune of the world's richest man.",
      "The protesters are trying to escalate a movement targeting Tesla dealerships and vehicles in opposition to Musk's role as the head of the newly created Department of of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he's gained access to sensitive data and shuttered entire agencies as he attempts to slash government spending. Most of Musk's estimated $340 billion fortune consists of the stock he holds in the electric vehicle company that he continues to run while also working alongside Mr. Trump.",
      "Earlier protests have been somewhat sporadic. Saturday marked the first attempt to surround all 277 of the automaker's showrooms and service centers in the U.S. in hopes of deepening\u00a0a recent decline in the company's sales.",
      "By early afternoon, crowds ranging from a few dozen to hundreds of protesters had flocked to Tesla locations in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Maryland, Minnesota and the automaker's home state of Texas. Pictures posted on social media accounts showed protesters brandishing signs such as\u00a0\"Honk if you hate Elon\"\u00a0and\u00a0\"Fight the billionaire broligarchy.\"",
      "The Tesla Takedown movement also hoped to rally protestors at more than 230 Tesla locations in other parts of the world. Although the turnouts in Europe weren't as large as the crowds in the U.S., the anti-Musk sentiment was similar.",
      "About two dozen protesters held signs lambasting Musk outside a Tesla dealership in London as passing cars and trucks tooted horns in support.",
      "One of the signs displayed at the London protest showed a photo of Musk next to an image of Adolf Hitler making the Nazi salute \u2014 a\u00a0gesture that Musk has been accused of reprising shortly after Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. A person in a tyrannosaurus rex costume held another sign with a picture of Musk's straight-arm gesture that said, \"You thought the Nazis were extinct. Don't buy a Swasticar.\"",
      "\"We just want to get loud, make noise, make people aware of the problems that we're facing,\" said Cam Whitten, an American who showed up at the London protest.",
      "Tesla Takedown was organized by a group of supporters that included disillusioned owners of the automaker's vehicles, celebrities such as actor John Cusack, and at least one Democratic Party lawmaker, Rep. Jasmine Crockett from Dallas.",
      "\"I'm going to keep screaming in the halls of Congress. I just need you all to make sure you all keep screaming in the streets,\" Crockett said during a\u00a0Tesla Takedown organizing call\u00a0held earlier this month.",
      "In New York City, mayoral hopeful and New York state Rep. Zohran Mamdani joined protesters at a Tesla showroom on Saturday.",
      "\"We are here in a moment that demands all of us,\" Mandani told the crowd through a megaphone. \"It demands all of us because the richest man in the world has purchased the president of the United States.\"",
      "Some people opposed to Musk have gone beyond protests and set the automaker's vehicles on fire and committed\u00a0other acts of vandalism that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has decried as \"nothing short of domestic terrorism.\" Musk indicated he was dumbfounded by the attacks during a March 20 company meeting and said the vandals should \"stop acting psycho.\"",
      "Crockett and other Tesla Takedown supporters have been stressing the importance for Saturday's protests to remain peaceful.",
      "But police were investigating a fire that destroyed seven Tesla vehicles in northwestern Germany early Saturday morning. It was wasn't immediately clear if the blaze, which was extinguished by firefighters, was related to the Tesla Takedown protests.",
      "There have been vandalisms at Tesla dealerships acrossing the U.S., including fires in Nevada and Missouri, and graffiti at locations in Massachusetts and Maryland, CBS News previously reported.",
      "Since January 2025, incidents targeting Tesla EVs have occurred in at least nine states, according to a joint intelligence bulletin issued by the Department of Homeland Security and FBI and obtained by CBS News.\u00a0Although U.S. intelligence suggests lone actors are behind them, Trump administration officials are promising to crack down on what they say are coordinated attacks.",
      "There have also been reports of vandalism to parked Teslas, making individual owners nervous.",
      "\"My wife cautions me, 'Be careful where you are at with it,'\" Bill Fonte told CBS New York. \"If you don't like the product, don't buy it. But they're going above and beyond, creating panic and concern for normal people like me.\"",
      "A growing number of consumers who bought Tesla vehicles before Musk took over DOGE have been looking to sell or trade in their cars while others have slapped on bumper stickers seeking to distance themselves from the billionaire's efforts to prune or shut down government agencies.",
      "But Musk didn't appear concerned about an extended slump in sales of new Tesla cars in his March 20 address to employees. He reassured the workers that the company's Model Y, which is undergoing a refresh, would remain \"the best-selling car on Earth again this year.\" He also predicted Tesla will have sold more than 10 million cars worldwide by next year, up from about 7 million cars now.",
      "\"There are times when there are rocky moments, where there is stormy weather, but what I am here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting,\" Musk said.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected last November, investors initially saw Musk's alliance with the president as a positive development for Tesla and its long-running efforts to launch\u00a0a network of self-driving cars.",
      "That optimism helped lift Tesla's stock by 70% in the period between Mr. Trump's Nov. 5 election and his Jan. 20 inauguration, creating an additional $560 billion in shareholder wealth. But virtually all those gains have evaporated amid investor worries about the Tesla backlash, lagging sales in the U.S., Europe and China, and Musk spending time overseeing DOGE.",
      "\"This continues to be a moment of truth for Musk to navigate this brand tornado crisis moment and get onto the other side of this dark chapter for Tesla,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note leading up to Saturday's protests.",

      "State-run television MRTV reported that 694 people have now been found dead and another 1,670 injured, with 68 others missing, according to a statement from the military-led government. The same figures were also reported by the independent news site The Irrawaddy.",
      "Myanmar is in the throes of a prolonged and bloody civil war, which is already responsible for a massive humanitarian crisis. It makes movement around the country both difficult and dangerous, complicating relief efforts and raising fears that the death toll could still rise precipitously.",

      "It was not immediately clear what relief efforts the ruling military regime would be able to provide, but it issued appeals for any help available, including blood supplies, from the international community. The major hospital in the country's capital that sustained significant damage was described as a mass casualty area, as medics raced to treat the wounded in an outdoor triage area.",
      "The hospital's emergency department was heavily damaged, and images showed a car crushed under the concrete roof that had covered its entrance.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance\u00a0said Friday during a day trip to a U.S. base in Greenland that the Trump administration doesn't think that \"military force is ever going to be necessary\" there, the same day President Trump said, \"We have to have Greenland.\"",
      "Vance visited the Pituffik Space Base, the northernmost U.S. military installation, along with second lady Usha Vance, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. While there, the vice president blasted Denmark for its handling of the island, as the Trump White House eyes the semi-autonomous Danish territory despite opposition from residents and leaders. While Vance was there, President Trump reiterated his strong desire to acquire the island.",
      "\"We need Greenland, very importantly, for international security,\" the president told reporters at the White House. \"We have to have Greenland. It's not a question of, 'Do you think we can do without it?' We can't.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't ruled out military force in Greenland, while Vance on Friday said he believes the people of Greenland will seek independence from Denmark. A reporter asked Vance if his message is consistent with the president's. Vance said the president wants more of a U.S. presence in Greenland, but \"the president has said clearly he doesn't think that military force is going to be necessary.\"",
      "\"What we think is going to happen is that the Greenlanders are going to choose through self-determination to become independent of Denmark, and then we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there,\" Vance said. \"So I think talking about anything too far in the future is way too premature. We do not think that military force is ever going to be necessary. We think this makes sense. And because we think the people of Greenland are rational and good, we think we're going to be able to cut a deal, Donald Trump style, to ensure the security of this territory but also the United States of America.\"",
      "Vance said his trip to the base helped him see up close how critical Greenland is for U.S. national security. If an enemy fired a missile on the U.S., it would be the American soldiers at the Greenland base who would alert their countrymen, he said. Vance said the U.S. knows Russia and China are taking serious interest in the Arctic, and the U.S. needs to make sure it's leading in the Arctic. But while Vance recognized Denmark has been an important security partner in the past, he launched into criticisms of the European country, saying the U.S. base in Greenland is less secure than it was decades ago because of Denmark's stewardship.",
      "\"There is no amount of bullying, no amount of obfuscating, no amount of confusing the issue,\" Vance said. \"Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland, you have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change. And because it hasn't changed, that's why President Trump's policy in Greenland is what it is.\"",
      "The second lady was originally scheduled to visit Greenland in an expanded cultural trip this week, and then the vice president\u00a0announced\u00a0Tuesday that he would be joining her for a shorter trip that was more focused on U.S. policy and defense.",
      "Vance also thanked soldiers on the base, who are there for a year at a time and can't bring their families with them.",
      "\"I know it's a lot of sacrifice to spend a year away from your families, but the mission is really important,\" Vance said. \"The Trump administration, the president, is really interested in Arctic security. As you all know, that's a big issue, and it's only going to get bigger over the coming decade, so thanks for doing what you do.\"",
      "Waltz told the soldiers they're carrying a \"tradition\" of U.S. soldiers in Greenland, and said the president is very serious about Arctic security.",
      "A statement earlier this week by the vice president's office that announced Vance would join his wife on the trip emphasized Greenland's role in U.S. national security.",
      "\"During World War II, the United States established over a dozen military bases in Greenland to defend the North Atlantic from Nazi incursion,\" the statement said. \"During the Cold War, the United States committed additional resources to Greenland to defend against Soviet missile attacks.\"",
      "The statement went on to criticize Denmark, claiming, \"In the decades since, neglect and inaction from Danish leaders and past U.S. administrations have presented our adversaries with the opportunity to advance their own priorities in Greenland and the Arctic. President Trump is rightly changing course.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't given up on the idea of absorbing Greenland into the U.S., despite opposition from Greenland's leadership and people. Greenland is an expansive island to the north and east of Canada that's a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. It's roughly three times the size of Texas, but mostly covered by ice. Most of its roughly 57,000 people \u2014 a population smaller than Carson City, Nevada \u2014 live along Greenland's southern coast.",
      "A\u00a0recent poll shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States, and residents who spoke with CBS News ahead of Vance's visit to a remote U.S. installation on the island \u2014 America's furthest north military base \u2014 clearly reflected the sentiments shown in that poll.",
      "\"He can't just take it like that,\" said Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander.",
      "And Greenland's prime minister, M\u00fate Bourup Egede,\u00a0has called the planned visits from U.S. officials \"aggressive.\" And Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, said the U.S. is putting \"unacceptable pressure\" on Greenland.",
      "Despite this opposition, Mr. Trump said earlier this month in a speech before the joint session of Congress that he had \"a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland: We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the territory is important to U.S. national security and that his administration is \"working with everybody involved to try and get it.\"",
      "\"And I think we're going to get it, one way or the other,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're going to get it. We will keep you safe, we will make you rich, and together, we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before. It's a very small population, but very, very large piece of land, and very, very important for military security.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Israeli officials are furious over the Signal chat leak involving senior Trump administration officials because it included sensitive intelligence Israel provided to the U.S. from a human intelligence source in Yemen, CBS News has learned.",
      "While the Signal chat messages published by Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic this week may not have compromised the effectiveness of the airstrike, given the publication's restraint on releasing the information, it did compromise a human source who provided the intelligence to the Israelis, who then provided it to the U.S. for targeting, a senior American intelligence official and a source with knowledge of the Israelis' ire told CBS News. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive national security matters.",
      "The Wall Street Journal on Thursday first reported about the Israelis complaining to U.S. officials about Mike Waltz, President Trump's national security adviser, who set up the group chat and apparently added Goldberg by mistake. The group spent several days earlier this month exchanging messages about possible plans to strike Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, who have repeatedly launched missiles at Israel and targeted shipping in the Red Sea.",
      "CBS News reached out to the National Security Council and the Israeli Embassy in the U.S. for comment on Friday, but has not received a response.",
      "On March 15, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth texted the group chat, composed of what's known as the principals committee \u2014 the highest level of the National Security Council, which includes Cabinet members and other senior U.S. officials.",
      "According to Goldberg's report, one of Hegseth's messages said:",
      "\"Trigger Based\" F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME \u2013 also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)",
      "The senior American intelligence official told CBS News that in this context, \"Trigger Based\" refers to an operation that is contingent upon a specific condition or event \u2014 essentially, a go or no-go decision to launch an airstrike based on confirmation of the target's presence.",
      "That day, Navy F/A-18F Super Hornets launched from the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman located in the Red Sea, while the MQ-9 Reaper drones took flight from bases in the Middle East. U.S. Central Command said in a statement that they had begun an operation which consisted of \"precision strikes against Iran-backed Houthi targets across Yemen in order to restore freedom of navigation.\"",
      "Hegseth said in another text, prior to the decision to strike, that he supported doing so to restore freedom of navigation and reestablish deterrence, which he described as being \"cratered\" under the Biden administration.",
      "After the U.S. airstrikes began on the Iranian-backed Houthis, Waltz addressed Vice President JD Vance in the chat group to say the building had collapsed and that U.S. military forces had \"multiple positive ID,\" indicating positive identification of the Houthi member or members they were aiming to kill.",
      "Waltz added: \"The first target \u2014 their top missile guy \u2014 we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend's building and it's now collapsed,\" according to the texts posted by The Atlantic.",
      "As a barrage of criticism rolled in this week towards those involved in the Signal chat, senior Trump administration officials have repeatedly said the information was not classified and that no sources or methods were compromised.",
      "\"No locations. No sources & methods. No WAR PLANS,\" Waltz wrote on X on Wednesday. \"Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent.\"",
      "But the sources who spoke to CBS News say Israeli intelligence is angry that the intelligence they provided to the U.S. was revealed. It's unclear what the fallout will be, if any, between the U.S. and Israel over the situation.",
      "CBS News reported Thursday that President Trump has been privately venting his irritation about the Signal chat leak and is closely monitoring the news to see if the fallout quiets down, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
      "On Tuesday, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, both of whom were in the Signal group chat, testified before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.",
      "\"There was no classified material that was shared in that Signal chat,\" Gabbard told lawmakers. The following day, testifying before a House panel, Gabbard acknowledged the conversation was \"sensitive\" but again denied classified information was shared in the chat. \"There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,\" she said.",
      "Multiple U.S. intelligence officials and members of the U.S. military who have spoken to CBS News this week contended that this type of information is always classified, but even if the information was somehow unclassified, it would still be a violation of cybersecurity and operational security protocols.",
      "CBS News on Tuesday published unclassified internal documents from a National Security Agency bulletin warning of vulnerabilities in using the Signal app, even though it is encrypted. The NSA bulletin was widely distributed to NSA employees a month before the Signal chat group was created by Waltz.",
      "The bulletin also underscored to NSA employees that third-party messaging applications such as Signal and WhatsApp are permitted for certain \"unclassified accountability/recall exercises\" but not for communicating more sensitive information.",
      "NSA employees were also warned to not send \"anything compromising over any social media or Internet-based tool or application,\" and to not \"establish connections with people you do not know.\"",

      "Pabrade, Lithuania\u00a0\u2014 Lithuania's president said Friday that he hoped for \"a miracle\" as he visited the site of a rescue operation to recover four missing U.S. Army soldiers from their submerged vehicle. The four soldiers, assigned to the Army's 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, went missing early Tuesday morning during a maintenance mission to recover another U.S. Army vehicle in the Pabrade training area, near Lithuania's border with Belarus, during a scheduled training missing, the Army has said.",
      "Search and rescue teams were at the scene on Friday using heavy military equipment and excavators to remove silt from the body of water where the vehicle was found on Wednesday.",
      "\"I am still hoping for a miracle,\" Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda told reporters in Pabrade. \"Although many sceptics would probably say that there is nothing to hope for in these circumstances, I want to believe.\"",
      "In a statement issued Friday, the U.S. Army said the hulking, 70-ton M88 Hercules armored recovery vehicle the missing U.S. soldiers had been operating \"was found submerged approximately 15 feet under a body of water and mud in a boggy area\" connected to a nearby lake.",
      "\"The area around the site is incredibly wet and marshy and doesn't support the weight of the equipment,\" the U.S. Army Europe and Africa's public affairs office said in a statement Friday. \"Draining the area has been slow and difficult due to ground water seepage,\" it said.",
      "\"This will be a long and difficult recovery operation, but we are absolutely committed to bringing our soldiers home,\" said Curtis Taylor, Commanding General of the 1st Armored Division.",
      "The main goal Friday was to remove the mud from the submerged vehicle and identify possible attachment points for extraction, Lithuanian Armed Forces chief General Raimundas Vaiksnoras said.",
      "\"We are working and will continue to work until we can give clear and honest answers to those who need to know the most \u2014 family members,\" Vaiksnoras said on Facebook on Friday.",

      "The U.S. Army's Europe command said in its statement that a \"large capacity slurry pump, cranes, more than 30 tons of gravel, and subject matter experts from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are just some of the assets that arrived on site to assist with accessing the M88.",
      "The Polish Armed Forces have also volunteered a unit of military engineers, which is moving toward the site.\"",

      "On the Panama Canal, Mr. Trump said in his March 4 address, \"To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it,\" referring to a deal to give an American company control of key ports.",
      "Panama's president denounced Mr. Trump's remarks and said \"The Canal is Panamanian\" in a social media post.",
      "Below is a look at where the two places are and what Mr. Trump has said about wanting the U.S. to control them.",
      "Where is Greenland and why does President Trump want it?",
      "Greenland is located to the northeast of Canada. The largest island in the world, it is about 836,000 square miles, around the size of Sweden. It is largely covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet and is home to only around 60,000 people. It is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark and has its own elected government.",
      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes. \"I'm talking about protecting the free world,\" he said in early January. \"You look at \u2014 you don't even need binoculars \u2014 you look outside. You have China ships all over the place. You have Russian ships all over the place. We're not letting that happen. We're not letting it happen.\"",
      "The Northwest Passage, or Northern Sea route, was first crossed in the winter months by a Russian commercial vessel several years ago, and is a shorter route linking east Asia's major ports to Europe and the Atlantic Ocean. Western powers have already voiced concern about Russia and China using it to boost their presence in the North Atlantic.",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News.",
      "Pernille Benjaminsen, a human rights lawyer in Greenland, told CBS News the ties between the territory's semi-autonomous government and the Danish government had grown tense in recent years, and Mr. Trump could be trying to take advantage of that.",
      "\"He has noticed that there is this tense relationship between Denmark and Greenland and seen opportunities in that,\" she said.",
      "Greenland also has oil, natural gas and highly sought after mineral resources.",
      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a\u00a0Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, both of which are needed to produce electric vehicle batteries, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals like Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "Currently, China produces about 70% of rare earth elements.",
      "\"The world is currently too dependent on a small set of actors for mining and processing many critical minerals,\" Fernandez said in November.",
      "Demand for rare earth minerals is outstripping supply, which has kept prices high, according to the Swiss newspaper Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung. Still, there are significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "Inside the Vances' Greenland visit",
      "Usha Vance was originally supposed to visit Greenland solo in late March as part of an expanded cultural trip, but then the vice president announced he would join her.",
      "The Vances arrived along with national security adviser Mike Waltz on Friday, March 28, to spend the day at Pituffik Space Base, the United States' northernmost military installation. The base, formerly known as Thule Air Base, is locked in by ice for much of the year, according to its website, but operates its airfield year-round.",
      "They met with service members at the base and received a briefing on Arctic security issues.",
      "\"As you've heard, we have some interest in Greenland from the Trump administration,\" the vice president told a group of service members at the dining hall.",
      "Vance said Mr. Trump wants more of a U.S. presence in Greenland, but \"the president has said clearly he doesn't think that military force is going to be necessary.\"",
      "While announcing his visit, Vance said \"a lot of other countries\" pose\u00a0a threat to Greenland and its waterways, and would use them to threaten the U.S.",
      "\"Unfortunately, leaders in both America and in Denmark, I think, ignored Greenland for far too long,\" he said in a video message before his trip. \"That's been bad for Greenland, it's also been bad for the security of the entire world. We think we can take things in a different direction, so I'm gonna go check it out.\"",
      "A\u00a0recent poll showed\u00a0that 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States.",
      "\"He can't just take it like that,\" Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander, told CBS News.",
      "What is the Panama Canal and why does Trump want it?",
      "About 40% of U.S. container shipping currently travels through the Panama Canal, according to the trade publication CargoNOW. The canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and, beyond that, the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "Mr. Trump has said that the United States needs the Panama Canal for \"economic security,\" falsely alleging that it is being \"operated by China.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is vital to our country. It's being operated by China. China! And we gave the Panama Canal to Panama. We didn't give it to China, and they've abused it. They've abused that gift. It should have never been made,\" he said before taking office again on Jan. 20.",
      "Panama President Jose Raul Mulino has disputed claims that China controls the canal.",
      "\"There is absolutely no Chinese interference nor involvement in anything to do with the Panama Canal,\" he said in late December.",
      "But in February, Panama decided not to renew a key infrastructure agreement with Beijing after a visit from Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "Ahead of Mr. Trump's address to Congress, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate that operates ports at either end of the canal announced an agreement to sell shares of its units to an investment group led by American company BlackRock.",
      "Mr. Trump touted the deal in his speech. \"The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it,\" he said.",
      "In his response, Mulino said, \"President Trump is lying.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is not in the process of being restored, and this is certainly not the task that was even discussed in our conversations with Secretary Rubio or anyone else,\" he wrote on social media. \"The Canal is Panamanian and will continue to be Panamanian!\"",
      "China has denied trying to claim any control over the canal, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning saying in December that Beijing would \"always respect Panama's sovereignty over the Canal and recognize the Canal as a permanently neutral international waterway.\"",
      "The history of Greenland",
      "The Kingdom of Denmark began colonizing Greenland in the early 18th century, hundreds of years after Vikings from the same distant land first arrived to set up residency. It was not until World War II that the U.S. established a presence on the island, when then-Danish Ambassador to the U.S., Henrik Kauffmann, refused to surrender to the rule of Denmark's Nazi occupiers.",
      "Denmark was liberated from Nazi occupation in 1945, but the U.S. did not leave its military base, Pituffik Space Base, which to this day remains the American military's northernmost installation.",
      "The history of the Panama Canal",
      "The Panama Canal\u00a0was built by the U.S. between 1904 and 1914. It serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean, dramatically shortening shipping routes from Asia to ports in the eastern U.S.",
      "It was first managed by the U.S. government for decades, which caused tension with Panama.",
      "In the 1970s, the U.S. and Panama signed a treaty agreeing to the permanent neutrality of the canal. The U.S. committed to relinquishing control of the canal and did so fully in 1999. The canal is now run by the Panama Canal Authority.",

    "story": [
      "Beirut, Lebanon \u2014\u00a0Israel has launched an attack on the Lebanese capital, Beirut, for the first time since a fragile ceasefire ended the latest Israel-Hezbollah war in November. Associated Press reporters in Beirut heard a loud boom and witnessed smoke rising from the area that Israel's military had warned it would strike.",
      "The strike came after Israel's army urgently warned people to evacuate parts of a Beirut suburb, vowing to retaliate against strikes which it said were launched from Lebanon into northern Israel. Israel's defense minister said Friday that if there was no peace in Israel's northern communities there would be no peace in Beirut either.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said the strike in Beirut had targeted a Hezbollah drone storage facility in the Dahiyeh neighborhood, which Israel has long described as a key Hezbollah stronghold. Israel accuses Hezbollah of using civilians as human shields and the IDF noted its advanced warning for people to leave the area on Friday.",
      "Hezbollah denied firing the rockets at northern Israel, and accused Israel of seeking a pretext to continue attacking Lebanon.",
      "Lebanon's government ordered all schools and universities in Beirut's southern suburb of Hadath to close for the day. Residents were seen fleeing the area in cars and on foot ahead of the strike.",
      "It was the first strike on Beirut since a ceasefire took hold on Nov. 27, 2024, between Israel and Hezbollah, a U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist organization that has long been powerful political force in Lebanon, although Israel has struck targets in southern Lebanon almost daily since then.",
      "Hezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day after its ally Hamas' unprecedented Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack, which ignited the war in Gaza. The Israel-Hezbollah conflict boiled over into all-out war in September as Israel carried out waves of airstrikes and killed most of the militant group's senior leaders. The fighting killed over 4,000 people in Lebanon and displaced about 60,000 Israelis who live in communities near the country's shared border.",
      "Israeli forces were supposed to withdraw from all Lebanese territory by late January under the ceasefire deal. The deadline was extended to Feb. 18, but Israel has remained in five locations in Lebanon across from communities in northern Israel. Meanwhile, Israel has carried out dozens of airstrikes on southern and eastern Lebanon, saying it attacked Hezbollah, while continuing drone attacks that have killed several members of the militant group.",
      "Last week, Israeli airstrikes on several locations in Lebanon killed six people.",
      "The United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, said the exchange of fire was deeply concerning. \"This is a critical period for Lebanon and the wider region,\" she said Friday.",
      "The Israeli strikes on Beirut came as Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun made his first visit to Paris as his country's leader. He met Friday with President Emmanuel Macron who, following their meeting, called the Israeli strike \"unacceptable\" and a \"violation of the ceasefire\" that he argued would \"play into the hands of Hezbollah.\"",
      "Aoun called the Friday strike a continuation \"of Israel's violations\" of the November ceasefire agreement, which was sponsored by the U.S. and France.",
      "Israel continues bombing Gaza as humanitarian crisis deepens",
      "The escalation comes 11 days after Israel abruptly ended its separate ceasefire agreement with Hamas in Gaza, by launching a surprise wave of strikes that killed hundreds of people in the decimated Palestinian territory.",
      "Earlier this month, Israel halted deliveries of food, fuel, medicine and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million inhabitants.",
      "Israel has vowed to escalate the war until Hamas returns the 59 hostages it still holds in Gaza \u2014 24 of whom are still believed to be alive. Israel is demanding that Hamas give up power, disarm and send its leaders out of Gaza into exile.",
      "Hamas has said it will only release the remaining captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire, and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.",
      "The war triggered by Hamas' terrorist attack has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians in Gaza, many of them women and children, according to the enclave's Hamas-run Health Ministry. The attack on Israel saw Hamas and its allies kill some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and take 251 others hostage.",
      "Almost 40 more people were killed in Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip overnight, Palestinian media outlets said Friday, including 14 who were reportedly killed in a strike that hit a house in the al-Zaytoun neighborhood in Gaza city.

    "summary": "A new study shows how cuts to foreign aid could lead to millions of HIV/AIDS deaths and soaring rates of infections, undoing decades of progress against the virus.",
    "story": [
      "Proposed cuts to global foreign aid, including slashing programs in the United States, could lead to millions of HIV deaths and soaring rates of infections around the world in the coming years, according to a new study.",
      "Published Wednesday in\u00a0The Lancet HIV journal, the modeling study estimates that by 2030, there could be between 4.4 million to 10.8 million additional new HIV infections in low- and middle-income countries and 770,000 to 2.9 million HIV-related deaths in children and adults. To estimate the impacts, the authors examined 26 countries that used foreign aid for HIV resources, including Albania, Cambodia, Colombia, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, South Africa and Sri Lanka.",
      "They noted that international funding has been crucial in reducing HIV transmissions and deaths, and that five countries \u2014 the U.S., U.K., France, Germany and the Netherlands \u2014 provide over 90% of international HIV funding, with the U.S. being by far the largest contributor. The U.S. committed $5.71 billion in 2023, or about 73% of total donor government funding, according to analysis by KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization.",
      "But as of February, they authors report, donor nations have announced reductions in aid of between 8% and 70% between 2025 and 2026. The Trump administration froze foreign aid\u00a0spending, including funding for HIV/AIDS programs, soon after taking office, and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, is spearheading major cutbacks.",
      "\"The United States has historically been the largest contributor to global efforts to treat and prevent HIV, but the current cuts to PEPFAR and USAID-supported programs have already disrupted access to essential HIV services including for antiretroviral therapy and HIV prevention and testing,\" co-lead study author Debra ten Brink of the Burnet Institute in Australia said in a news release.",
      "The study's authors said ongoing disruptions could undo decades of progress to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat.",
      "\"Looking ahead, if other donor countries reduce funding, decades of progress to treat and prevent HIV could be unravelled. It is imperative to secure sustainable financing and avoid a resurgence of the HIV epidemic, which could have devastating consequences, not just in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, but globally,\" said ten Brink.",
      "PEPFAR, or the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, was launched under then-President George W. Bush in 2003 and has invested over $100 billion in the global HIV/AIDS response over the years. According to the State Department, the program has saved the lives of\u00a026 million people since it began\u00a0\u2014 but its funding stopped after Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered a\u00a0pause on foreign aid\u00a0earlier this year.",
      "\"PEPFAR is the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease in history, enabled by strong bipartisan support across ten U.S. congresses and four presidential administrations, and through the American people's generosity,\" the government website HIV.gov reads. \"PEPFAR shows the power of what is possible through compassionate, cost-effective, accountable, and transparent American foreign assistance.\"",
      "Others have already warned about the devastation these cuts could bring to those who rely on it. Earlier this week, the UNAIDS chief warned that without funding, millions will die and the global AIDS pandemic will resurge.",
      "\"It is reasonable for the United States to want to reduce its funding over time, but the sudden withdrawal of lifesaving support is having a devastating impact,\" UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima told reporters in Geneva. \"We urge for a reconsideration and an urgent restoration of services \u2014 lifesaving services.\"",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said the U.S. contributions play a key role that could not be easily replaced.",
      "\"Many of these countries rely heavily on the United States. Some of them between 50 and 70% of their budgets for HIV diagnosis, treatment and prevention is coming from the United States,\" she said on \"CBS Mornings Plus.\" \"There's not really any other country that can easily step in. And big picture, this is sort of like telling a surgeon in the middle of surgery to walk away. It's just not that easy to jump in and take over.\"",

      "The king has maintained a busy schedule of official events in recent weeks, having steadily ramped up his work after returning to public duties in April last year, just several months after beginning his treatment. He made his first foreign trip during the treatment in July 2024, to Australia.",

      "Today's scammers use generative AI to \"supercharge\" their existing techniques while enabling entirely new types of fraud, according to\u00a0Dave Schroeder, UW\u2013Madison national security research strategist. Here are the four most dangerous ways they're using this technology.",
      "With just three seconds of audio, easily obtained from social media, voicemails or videos, fraudsters can create a convincing replica of your voice using AI. \"Imagine a situation where a 'family member' calls from what appears to be their phone number and says they have been kidnapped,\" explains Schroeder. \"Victims of these scams have said they were sure it was their family member's voice.\"",
      "These AI-generated voice clones can be used to manipulate loved ones, coworkers or even financial institutions into transferring money or sharing sensitive information, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent calls.",
      "Today's AI tools can generate convincing fake identification documents with AI-generated images. Criminals use these to verify identity when fraudulently opening accounts or taking over existing ones. These AI-generated fake IDs are becoming increasingly sophisticated, often including realistic holograms and barcodes that can bypass traditional security checks and even fool automated verification systems.",
      "Many financial institutions use selfies for customer verification. However, fraudsters can take images from social media to create deepfakes that bypass these security measures. These AI-generated deepfakes are not limited to still images; they can also produce realistic videos that can fool liveness detection checks during facial recognition processes, posing a significant threat to biometric authentication systems.",
      "Similarly, GenAI now crafts flawlessly written, highly personalized\u00a0phishing emails that analyze your online presence to create messages specifically tailored to your interests and personal details. These AI-enhanced phishing attempts can also incorporate sophisticated chatbots and improved grammar, making them significantly more convincing and harder to detect than traditional\u00a0phishing scams.",

Those with substantial retirement savings or investments naturally represent more valuable targets \u2014 the more assets you have, the more attention you'll attract from criminals looking for bigger payoffs. Many older adults are particularly vulnerable as they didn't grow up with today's technology and may be less familiar with AI's capabilities. This knowledge gap makes it harder to recognize when AI is being used maliciously. Compounding this risk is an extensive digital footprint: if you're active on social media or have a significant online presence, you're inadvertently providing fraudsters with the raw materials they need to create convincing deepfakes and highly personalized scams designed specifically to exploit your trust.",

      "Protection against AI-powered threats requires a multi-layered approach that goes well beyond just digital measures. Awareness is your first line of defense \u2014 understanding how these scams work helps you spot red flags before you become a victim. This awareness should be paired with both digital safeguards and \"analog\" verification systems that exist entirely offline. Here are some key steps to protect yourself:",
      "1.\u00a0Invest in personal data removal services: Generative AI fundamentally needs your personal data to craft convincing scams, which is why limiting your online footprint has become paramount in today's fraud landscape. The less information about you that's publicly available, the fewer raw materials scammers have to work with. Going completely off-grid is unrealistic for most of us today \u2014 much like never leaving your home. But you can reduce your online footprint substantially with a personal data removal service like Incogni, making yourself significantly less exposed to AI-powered scams.",
      "By removing your personal data from data broker companies, you not only protect yourself from GenAI-powered fraud but also gain numerous other privacy benefits, such as reduced risks of receiving spam and falling victim to identity theft, as well as helping to prevent stalking and harassment. As AI technology advances, gen-AI scams will only become more sophisticated.

      "2. Establish your own verification protocols:\u00a0Consider agreeing on a \"safe word\" that only family members know. If you receive an unexpected call from a relative in distress, ask for this word before taking action.",
      "3. Choose strong, unique passwords for each account: Create complex passwords using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or common words. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. A password manager can generate and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts, reducing the risk of password reuse and making it easier to maintain good password hygiene.

      "5. Receive MFA codes via an authenticator app on your phone rather than email when possible: Using an\u00a0authenticator app like Microsoft Authenticator or Google Authenticator is more secure than receiving codes via email. Authenticator apps generate time-based one-time passcodes (TOTPs) that are not transmitted over email or SMS, reducing the risk of interception by hackers. Additionally, authenticator apps often support biometric authentication and push notifications, making the verification process both secure and convenient.",
      "6. Use a strong antivirus software: Modern cybersecurity threats are evolving rapidly, with AI being used to create more convincing phishing attacks, deepfake scams, and malware. Investing in strong antivirus software can help identify and block suspicious activity before it reaches you. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "What you need to know",
      "As reported by\u00a0KrebsOnSecurity, the latest ClickFix campaign tricks you into installing password-stealing malware under the guise of a routine \"Verify You Are a Human\" test. Initially seen in targeted attacks, it has now gone mainstream, affecting industries like hospitality and healthcare.",
      "The scam begins when you visit a hacked or malicious website and see a fake CAPTCHA-style prompt. Clicking the \"I\u2019m not a robot\" button triggers a set of instructions asking you to press specific keyboard shortcuts. First, you are told to press Windows + R, which opens the Windows Run dialog. Then you are instructed to press CTRL + V, which pastes a malicious script copied from the website\u2019s virtual clipboard. If you press enter, a script is executed that downloads and runs malware.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Cybercriminals are using phishing emails and malicious websites to spread ClickFix. The hospitality industry has been heavily targeted, with attackers impersonating Booking.com and sending fake emails referencing guest reviews or promotions. Clicking on links in these emails directs you to a ClickFix trap. Healthcare workers have also been targeted, with malicious code embedded into the widely used physical therapy site HEP2go.",
      "Once ClickFix is on your PC, it installs various types of malware, including password stealers like XWorm, Lumma Stealer and DanaBot, which extract your login credentials and financial information. Some versions deliver remote access trojans like VenomRAT and AsyncRAT, giving attackers full control over your system. Others deploy NetSupport RAT, a remote access tool commonly misused for cyber espionage.",

I reported on the malware back in June 2024 when it\u00a0posed as fake Google Chrome, Word and OneDrive errors to trick users into downloading harmful code. Just like in the current campaign, attackers prompted victims to click a button that copied a PowerShell \"fix\" to the clipboard, then paste and run it in a Run dialog or PowerShell prompt.",
      "By November 2024, attackers\u00a0had expanded their targets to Google Meet users. The scam started with an email containing a link to a Google Meet session, often disguised to appear as if it were from the victim's organization. This link leads to an invite for a meeting, webinar or online collaboration. Clicking the link directed the victim to a fake Google Meet page, which displayed a warning claiming there was an issue with their PC, such as problems with their microphone, camera or headset.",

      "To protect yourself from the evolving threat of ClickFix malware, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider implementing these six essential security measures.",
      "1. Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to press Windows + R, copy commands or paste anything into PowerShell. If a website instructs you to do this, it's likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many ClickFix attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services like Booking.com or Google Meet. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from ClickFix or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "ClickFix is a reminder that malware doesn\u2019t always rely on complex exploits. It often just needs you to follow the wrong instructions. Attackers are refining their methods, making scams like fake CAPTCHAs, phishing emails and deceptive pop-ups more convincing than ever. The best way to stay ahead is to question anything that seems even slightly off. If a website asks you to run commands or paste something into PowerShell, it\u2019s a red flag. If an email pressures you into clicking a link, verify it first.",

      "Hackers worldwide are exploiting any type of free document converter or downloader tool to carry out this scheme. The scam may involve websites that promise to convert files, such as turning a .doc into a .pdf, or tools that claim to merge multiple images into a single document. Some even pose as MP3 or MP4 downloaders. While these tools perform the advertised task, the resulting file may contain hidden malware, giving attackers access to the victim\u2019s computer.",

      "1. Use official conversion tools:\u00a0Instead of relying on random online tools, download and use reputable document conversion software provided by reputable companies like Adobe Acrobat, LibreOffice or Microsoft Office. These programs let you convert files securely without exposing your data to potential threats.",
      "2. Check the website\u2019s reputation:\u00a0Before using an online converter, research the site. Look for reviews and see if cybersecurity forums or sources have flagged it as unsafe. If the site lacks basic security measures, avoid it.",
      "3. Avoid downloading executable files:\u00a0If an online document converter provides an .exe, .bat or .scr file instead of a standard document format, do not download or run it. Legitimate converters should only generate files like .pdf, .docx or .png, not executables that could contain malware.",
      "4. Scan files after conversion: Even if you use a trusted converter, always scan the converted file with up-to-date\u00a0strong antivirus software before opening it.",
      "5. Check file permissions: After conversion, verify that the new file doesn't have unexpected permissions or properties that could indicate malware.",
      "6. Create backups and enable ransomware protection:\u00a0Regularly\u00a0back up important documents on an external drive or a secure cloud service. Some security suites, like Microsoft Defender, offer ransomware protection features that prevent unauthorized changes to your files.",
      "7. Be cautious of browser extensions: Avoid installing browser extensions for file conversion, as these can often be browser hijackers or adware.",
      "8. Consider paid services: If you frequently need to convert files, invest in a reputable paid service that offers better security and privacy protection.",
      "9. Use cloud-based solutions: Consider using cloud-based productivity suites that offer built-in conversion tools, reducing the need for third-party converters.",
      "FBI'S NEW WARNING ABOUT AI-DRIVEN SCAMS THAT ARE AFTER YOUR CASH",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The convenience of free online tools often blinds us to the risks they carry. Many users assume that if a website looks professional or ranks high on Google, it must be safe. Cybercriminals understand this mindset and take full advantage of it.",
      "The real issue is not just malware-laced converters but the habit of trading security for convenience without a second thought. The internet is filled with services that appear free but come at the hidden cost of stolen data, financial fraud or compromised devices. Instead of trusting every tool that offers an easy solution, it is important to think critically about what we are giving away whenever we upload a file or click a download button.",

      "4) Download and secure your data: Before considering account deletion, download your genetic record and store it securely on an encrypted device or cloud service.",
      "5) Request data deletion: If you no longer wish for your data to be stored by 23andMe, request its deletion through your account settings. Ensure you also ask for the destruction of any physical samples.",
      "6) Use strong passwords and multifactor authentication:\u00a0Creating unique, complex passwords for each of your accounts and devices is essential. Avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts; this kind of password reuse was a factor in the recent\u00a023andMe data breach. Enable two-factor authentication wherever it\u2019s offered to add an extra layer of security that helps prevent unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.\u00a0Check out my best expert-reviewed password managers for 2025 here.",
      "7) Monitor for suspicious activity and use identity theft protection: Genetic data leaks can lead to identity theft or medical fraud. Consider signing up for an identity theft protection service that monitors personal information, such as your Social Security number, phone number and email, alerting you if this data is found on the dark web. Some identity theft services also include up to $1 million in identity theft insurance to cover losses and legal fees and a dedicated fraud resolution team with a U.S.-based case manager to help you recover any stolen assets or identity.\u00a0See my expert recommendations here: Best identity theft protection services for 2025 here.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Attorneys for a South Carolina death row inmate whose execution is imminent are making a last-ditch argument that their client is incompetent to be executed partly because of his belief that he is a sovereign citizen.",
      "Steven Bixby and his father, Arthur Bixby, led a 12-hour gun battle with law enforcement in Abbeville, South Carolina, on Dec. 8, 2003, that resulted in the deaths of two police officers.",
      "The standoff, during which thousands of rounds of ammunition were exchanged between the Bixbys and police, stemmed from an attempt by the South Carolina Department of Transportation to widen a highway by using an easement on Bixby property. The Bixbys claimed that the easement was fabricated, or in any case irrelevant.",
      "The family, including Bixby's mother Rita, was well known for their sovereign citizen beliefs.",
      "JURY CONVICTS CONNECTICUT \u2018SOVEREIGN CITIZEN\u2019 WHO DECAPITATED CHAMPION ROOMMATE WITH SAMURAI SWORD",
      "Charles Grose speaks to his client, Steven Bixby, as guilty verdicts are read in Bixby's trial, Sunday, Feb. 18, 2007, in Abbeville, South Carolina. (AP Photo/Sefton Ipock, Pool)",
      "The FBI labels sovereign citizens as extremists and characterizes them as people who believe they are sovereign from the United States government and thus do not have to answer to government authorities, including law enforcement, courts, taxing entities and others. At best, they are a loosely affiliated group who hold similar beliefs, but most sovereign citizens act on their own without any central organization guiding them.",
      "They are also known for filing lawsuits against government authorities, a trait embodied by Rita Bixby, who filed unsuccessful lawsuits against state entities.",
      "After the standoff, Steven Bixby was charged with two counts of murder and one count of criminal conspiracy, and sentenced to death in February 2007. Arthur and Rita Bixby were charged in the attack too, and both were sentenced to life in prison.",
      "After exhausting his appeals by 2010, Bixby's days were numbered. However, the state faced a shortage of lethal injection drugs, and indefinitely paused all executions. A 2021 state law allowed death sentences to resume via firing squad or electrocution. After years of litigation, the state executed its first death row inmate in 13 years, opening the door for Bixby's execution.",
      "Bixby was set to be executed last May, until a judge postponed his execution date to determine if he is mentally competent.",
      "WHO IS PITTSBURGH SHOOTER WILLIAM HARDISON? 'SOVEREIGN CITIZEN WITH HISTORY OF DEFYING LAW",
      "Now, his attorneys say he cannot be executed because he doesn't meet the state's two-pronged test to declare competency for execution.",
      "The first prong echoes that of the U.S. Supreme Court's only competency test: whether a person understands that they are going to be executed, and why.",
      "The South Carolina Supreme Court has a second prong, established in the 1993 case Singleton v. State: whether a person is able to rationally communicate with their counsel. Bixby's lawyers are arguing that because of his ardent belief in sovereign citizenship and because of his undying admiration and loyalty to his parents, he was genuinely unable to understand that he faced the death penalty and that he could not communicate rationally with his lawyers.",
      "Steven Bixby talks to the media during a break in his arraignment on Dec. 9, 2003, as law enforcement officers look on in Greenwood, South Carolina. (AP Photo/Mary Ann Chastain)",
      "Michael Meltsner, professor emeritus of law at Northeastern University, provided commentary on the 2021 Darrell Brooks case, and spoke with Fox News Digital about Bixby's case. Brooks claimed to be a sovereign citizen and represented himself in court after mowing down innocent people and killing six at a Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wisconsin. He was sentenced to six life terms plus 700 years in prison for his crimes.",
      "\"Well, first of all, just because you have a crazy belief, it does not serve as a defense to either a crime or an execution under the prevailing Supreme Court standard,\" Meltsner said. \"The only way that could be relevant to what the hearing would be about is if it was relevant to the legal standard for insanity or the legal standard for having such a serious mental condition that you can't be executed.\"",
      "But Meltsner said the South Carolina Supreme Court can have broader standards for execution than the standards set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "\"Of course, South Carolina could decide that the state can have a \u2018higher' or \u2018better\u2019 standard than the constitutional one,\" he said. \"The South Carolina courts could decide, well, he can't communicate with his lawyer and so we're not going to execute him.\"",

      "CALIFORNIA POLICE ARREST THREE \u2018SOVEREIGN CITIZENS\u2019 ALLEGEDLY IN POSSESSION OF A \u2018MILITARY GRADE EXPLOSIVE\u2019",
      "As for whether Bixby's sovereign citizenship makes him insane, and whether that argument will hold up in court, Meltsner doesn't know.",
      "\"Well, it's a factual matter,\" he said. \"It could be a terrible disability, and this guy sounds fairly crazy. It also could be at the other end of the continuum. It could be malicious and manipulative. But as a general matter, you can argue any damn thing you want in court. It's up to the courts to decide what it means.\"",
      "Bixby still maintains that he was acting in self-defense and defense of his property.",
      "Fox News Digital reached out to Bixby's attorneys.",
      "The Bixby standoff",
      "The Bixbys were longtime sovereign citizens stemming from their days living in New Hampshire, where Rita was a perpetual litigant against the state and where Arthur was arrested for ignoring a court's order to pay $850 for more than three years after a judgment against him.",
      "Steven Bixby left New Hampshire for South Carolina in the 1990s after a warrant for his arrest was issued for driving drunk without a license and skipping meetings with his parole officers. His mother and father followed shortly thereafter, due to a threat of foreclosure on their home for not paying taxes.",
      "The FBI defines \"sovereign citizens\" as extremists. (Getty Images)",
      "The South Carolina land dispute began in the early 2000s, when the state notified the Bixbys that their property had an easement, deeded by a previous owner of the land to the state, allowing the state to use 20 feet on the edge of the property to widen Highway 72 adjacent to the property if the state so chose.",
      "UTAH MOM OF RECENT COLLEGE GRAD KILLED BY POLICE CLAIMED TO BE \u2018SOVEREIGN CITIZEN\u2019",
      "In 2003, the state was beginning the widening process and land surveyors were making markings on the property to begin the job, causing tension between state authorities and the Bixbys.",
      "On the morning of Dec. 8, 2003, a surveyor called the police on Steven and Arthur Bixby for threatening him.",
      "Abbeville County sheriff\u2019s Sgt. Danny Wilson responded to the call and was immediately shot by Bixby. He was dragged inside the Bixby home, shackled with his own handcuffs, and died sometime during the 14-hour standoff that ensued.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "State constable Donnie Ouzts responded after communications from Wilson ceased. He, too, was immediately shot and killed by Bixby on the front lawn of the property.",
      "After a 14-hour gunfight with SWAT teams and law enforcement from around the state, Steven and Arthur Bixby were finally arrested.",

    "summary": "A UK Parliament report chaired by respected historian Lord Andrew Roberts calls the Oct. 7 Hamas attack in Israel deliberate and brutal, urging democracies to combat denial and misinformation.",
    "story": [
      "Lord Andrew Roberts, chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group, discusses their landmark report on the October 7 massacre by Hamas terrorists.",
      "A Holocaust survivor murdered at age 91 and a baby killed just 14 hours after birth are among the victims named in the U.K.'s October 7 Parliamentary Commission Report, the most detailed Western investigation to date into the Hamas-led attack on Israel.",
      "The 318-page report, chaired by British historian and peer Lord Andrew Roberts, documents the deaths of 1,182 people in a 48-hour period and provides extensive evidence of atrocities committed against civilians.",
      "The report describes the assault as \"a meticulously planned operation designed not only to kill but to terrorize through extreme brutality, looting and humiliation.\" It includes testimonies of group rapes of women and girls, some of whom were murdered, as well as evidence of sexual violence committed against corpses. It details the targeting of children, including infants shot in strollers or burned alive.",
      "REPORT EXPOSES HAMAS TERRORIST CRIMES AGAINST FAMILIES DURING OCT 7 MASSACRE: 'KINOCIDE'",
      "Hamas terrorists killed civilians, including women, children and the elderly, when they attacked Israel on Oct. 7.\u00a0 (Israel Defense Forces via AP)",
      "Roberts, one of Britain\u2019s leading historians and a member of the House of Lords, said that meeting Mandy Damari, the mother of hostage Emily Damari, \"reduced me to tears.\" Speaking in an interview with Fox News Digital, Lord Roberts recalled visiting Kibbutz Kfar Aza and hearing from families of victims while the fate of their loved ones was still unknown.",
      "\"At that time, of course, she didn\u2019t know whether her 27-year-old daughter, Emily, was going to be released or not, or whether she was going to die in Gaza,\" he said. \"And I have a 25-year-old daughter, and so it was brought home incredibly powerfully to me.\"",
      "Despite the graphic nature of the material, Roberts emphasized that the report was deliberately limited to verified facts. \"We actually made the report much less than it could have been, because we insisted on only putting things in that could be double-checked,\" he said. \"If we had put in things that we truly believe happened but couldn't prove happened, we kept them out.\"",
      "A bloodied handprint stains a wall in a Nir Oz house after Hamas terrorists attacked this kibbutz days earlier near the border of Gaza. (Alexi J. Rosenfeld/Getty Images)",
      "When asked what motivated him to take on the project, Roberts said, \"The denialism that has already cropped up,\" including attempts to downplay or question the events of October 7. \"It\u2019s quite ironic that as well as celebrating and indulging in their most sort of disgusting fantasies by wearing GoPro cameras, they also seek to deny that the whole thing ever happened,\" he said of Hamas.",
      "HAMAS' OCT 7 MASSACRE HAS LEGAL SCHOLARS CREATING NEW WAR CRIME CATEGORY",
      "\"October 7 denial,\" as the report refers to it, emerged almost immediately after the attacks and mirrors historical patterns of atrocity denial, despite the overwhelming evidence.",
      "\"I thought it was really important to get a big, thick, well-documented, irrefutable, fully footnoted document out there that will stand the test of time,\" Roberts said.",
      "Hamas terrorists kidnap a bloodied Israeli woman into the Gaza Strip.\u00a0 (Hamas-Telegram)",
      "The report includes accounts of mass looting, arson and mutilation. It states that terrorists used victims\u2019 phones to send images to their families, booby-trapped corpses with grenades, and dragged bodies through Gaza. It confirms that \"acts of sexual violence\" occurred \"across all sites\" during the attack, and references forensic findings of partially or fully naked bodies.",
      "'I WILL BE HAUNTED FOREVER\u2019: ISRAEL\u2019S HORRIFIC VIDEO OF HAMAS ATROCITIES LEAVES VIEWERS SHOCKED AND SICKENED",
      "Roberts said the attack was \"not just spontaneous \u2014 it was a premeditated bloodlust.\" He compared it to historical atrocities like the Rape of Nanjing in 1937. \"Once Hamas got into a bloodlust, they were going out of their way to murder and kill absolutely anybody who came anywhere near them,\" he said.",
      "Despite the horrors, Roberts said the report also includes examples of heroism. For example, of Netta Epstein \u2014 a young man who \"threw himself on a grenade to save his fianc\u00e9e's life\" \u2014 Roberts said such acts \"stand up with the great acts of heroism of any age.\"",
      "Released hostages Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari, wearing green, are greeted by Israeli soldiers following their arrival in Israel after being held in Gaza since the deadly Oct. 7, 2023 attack, following their release as part of a hostage-prisoner exchange deal between Hamas and Israel, in southern Israel, in a screen grab from a handout video obtained by Reuters on Jan. 19, 2025.\u00a0 (\u00a0Israel Defense Forces/Handout via Reuters)",
      "\"We have the names in it of everybody who was killed ... mostly with the circumstances of their deaths as well,\" Roberts added: \"Speaking as a historian, there are moments when one thinks of 9/11, or Pearl Harbor, various other attacks like this. They become part of history very quickly, but the actual individuals involved tend to get forgotten.\"",
      "Asked what role democracies should play in countering denialism, Roberts answered, \"The first is properly to memorialize the victims,\" he said. \"The second ... is to see this appalling act of barbarism for what it is, which is a complete denial of democracy, a blow struck deliberately against civilization, and ... the most appalling act of racism.\"",

      "\"Britain should be doing everything in its power to help Israel protect itself forever against such another attack,\" Roberts clarified that he was expressing a personal view: \"At the moment, it seems [the British government] is not doing that at all.\"",
      "In the report\u2019s conclusion, Roberts and his colleagues wrote: \"Our report will hopefully permit people to see such denials and justifications for what they really are: a perversion of and rejection of human decency. We owe it to the victims and their grieving families to set down the ghastly unvarnished truth about the sheer barbarism that Hamas and its terrorist allies unleashed on October 7, 2023.\"",

      "One by one, he is bending ostensibly independent actors under the weight of his power. So far, Trump has targeted the legal community, universities, the arts, career government employees and the press and brought them to heel in some measure, willingly or not. Law firms with even indirect ties to past investigations of Trump now face punitive measures that could put them out of business.",
      "If Trump prevails by the end of his term, he\u2019ll have influenced who votes in American elections and who does not, who gets to stay in America and who must leave, who pays off their student loans and who gets relief, who gets to question the president and who doesn\u2019t.",
      "He\u2019s facing pushback, but working to sweep it away. A pliant Congress has largely forsaken its oversight role since Trump thundered back into office, leaving the courts as the main impediment to his ambitions. And Trump is challenging their authority with a resolve that has nudged the nation closer to a constitutional crisis than at any point in the last half century.",
      "Pessimistic about government\u2019s ability to hold Trump to account, one U.S. senator said a mass uprising may be the only means of derailing his plans.",
      "\u201cUltimately, popular mobilization\u201d is the only way to tame\u00a0Trump, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said in an interview. The nation\u2019s fate may come down to \u201cthe people on both the right and the left rising up in protest and demanding reform.\u201d",
      "Pressuring universities and law firms",
      "As he sets about to remake the country, Trump has employed a mix of blunt tools.",
      "Pushing into social and cultural realms that past presidents largely avoided, he used federal funds as leverage in pressuring Columbia University to make changes that could reshape what students learn about the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. (Columbia\u2019s interim president, Katrina Armstrong, resigned last week.)",
      "In an operation that could chill free speech, the Trump administration has been picking up foreign students and sending them to detention centers over what appears to be their involvement in the pro-Palestinian protest movement last year.",
      "Most of the students have been in the U.S. legally, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday that he has revoked more than 300 student visas to date and is not about to stop.",
      "\u201cEvery time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas,\u201d Rubio said at a news conference.",
      "One student targeted for deportation is Momodou Taal, a Cornell University graduate student and U.S. visa holder who took part in protests at the school supporting Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "In an interview, Cornell President Michael Kotlikoff said the university \u201chasn\u2019t gotten direct notification\u201d that the student\u2019s visa was revoked.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to talk about this because we don\u2019t know the basis upon which many of these actions are occurring,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIf someone is being targeted for expressing their political opinions, of course that would be concerning,\u201d Kotlikoff added. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we would urge and provide counsel for people to take the appropriate steps.\u201d",
      "Trump cowed a prestigious law firm \u2014 Paul Weiss \u2014 into pledging millions of dollars in pro bono work on behalf of causes he\u2019s championed by threatening measures that could have cost the firm substantial business.",
      "In an executive order targeting the firm, Trump singled out one of its former partners, Mark Pomerantz, who had worked to develop a criminal case against Trump during a stint at the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office several years ago.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m the biggest proponent of President Trump and I was stunned at how rapidly they collapsed,\u201d said Steve Bannon, a former senior White House official in Trump\u2019s first term. \u201cThis just tells you we\u2019ve got to do it to every university and you have to do it to every law firm.\u201d",
      "On Thursday night, Trump signed another executive order punishing a different law firm that has crossed him. He yanked government contracts with WilmerHale and imposed other sanctions, citing in part its hiring of Robert Mueller and two other attorneys who took part in a Justice Department investigation into allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 election on Trump\u2019s behalf. Mueller retired from the firm four years ago.",
      "\u201cWilmerHale rewarded Robert Mueller and two of his colleagues by welcoming them to the firm after they wielded the power of the federal government to lead a partisan \u2018investigation\u2019 against the president and others,\u201d the action reads.",
      "The two other lawyers that Trump mentioned, James Quarles and Aaron Zebley, co-wrote a book about the case, \u201cInterference,\u201d that was published last year. Quarles is listed on the firm\u2019s website as a retired partner; Zebley as a partner.",
      "Trump denied any wrongdoing, and he was not charged in the investigation. He repeatedly dismissed the Mueller investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d",
      "WilmerHale sued the Trump administration on Friday, saying the president\u2019s actions against such firms is \u201cunprecedented and unconstitutional.\u201d\u00a0Later in the day, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon issued a ruling temporarily blocking the Trump administration\u2019s move to cancel contracts with the firm and forbid federal agencies from hiring its employees.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that this retaliatory action chills free speech and legal advocacy, or that it qualifies as a constitutional harm,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "A total of six elite law firms have come within Trump\u2019s crosshairs. Another one \u2014 Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom \u2014 sidestepped an executive order and accompanying punitive action by reaching what Trump termed Friday \u201cessentially a settlement.\u201d\u00a0 The firm is to provide $100 million in free legal services as a condition of the agreement, Trump said.",
      "The firm\u2019s executive partner, Jeremy London, said in a prepared statement:\u00a0\u201cWe engaged proactively with the president and his team in working together constructively to reach this agreement. The firm looks forward to continuing our productive relationship with President Trump and his administration.\u00a0We firmly believe that this outcome is in the best interests of our clients, our people, and our firm.\u201d",
      "'It's all gas, no brakes'",
      "On a different front, Trump issued an executive order earlier this month that may dissuade people from working at public service organizations that take part in activities of which he disapproves.",
      "The move would potentially deny student loan forgiveness to those working at groups supporting undocumented immigrants and transgender care for youth, or taking part in protest activities deemed a \u201cpublic nuisance.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is a consolidation of power in the presidency which is unprecedented,\u201d said Matthew Platkin, New Jersey\u2019s attorney general.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen a president assert this kind of control over the press, universities, free speech, law firms, people who disagree with him, the judiciary, the election system and the personnel who make up the federal government.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re following the authoritarian playbook, which is to do as many things as fast as you can to the point where it\u2019s almost impossible to keep up,\u201d he added.",
      "Another institution facing newfound pressure is the free press. The Trump White House ended a long-standing practice of letting journalists choose who among their print and radio peers are admitted into a tight pool covering smaller presidential events.",
      "Instead, the White House is adding more right-leaning outlets and exerting more control over who gets in and who doesn\u2019t. Among those admitted into the Oval Office on Friday for a Q&A with Trump was One America News Network, whose reporter asked the president, \u201cWhat has made you and your team so effective in finding, locating, apprehending and deporting these violent, illegal migrants.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love this guy,\u201d Trump said \u2014 not for the first time.",
      "Barred from the room was The Associated Press, the wire service that raised Trump\u2019s ire in refusing to amend its style guide to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the \u201cGulf of America,\u201d Trump\u2019s new name for the body of water.",
      "Even the arts are falling within Trump\u2019s ambit. He revamped the board of the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and assumed the chairmanship, meaning he is now something of a tastemaker when it comes to music and theater.",
      "At a board meeting earlier this month, Trump said he doesn\u2019t like the sorts of people the center has previously honored for their lifetime artistic achievements. One of the names floated as a possible future honoree was Sylvester Stallone, who last year referred to Trump as \u201cthe second George Washington.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the past, I mean, these are radical left lunatics that have been chosen. I didn\u2019t like it. I couldn\u2019t watch it. And the host was always terrible,\u201d he said, according to a recording of the meeting obtained by The Washington Post.",
      "In response to the Trumpian takeover, the show \u201cHamilton\u201d canceled a planned appearance at the Kennedy Center, giving rise to a series of ironies. A musical about the architects of America\u2019s delicate system of checks and balances is boycotting a president who is testing those same constitutional guardrails.",
      "Alexander Hamilton wrote in the Federalist Papers that \u201cenergy in the executive\u201d is crucial to good government. Two centuries later, the question is whether Trump is spending too much energy too quickly, with too little forbearance.",
      "\u201cSome of this happened last time,\u201d said Chris Edelson, an assistant professor of government at American University. \u201cWhat\u2019s dangerous now is he [Trump] seems to be having more success with this. You have companies settling lawsuits with him. Columbia and Paul Weiss are going along with this. That\u2019s dangerous stuff.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it will appease him,\u201d he added. \u201cHe will want more.\u201d",
      "Trump allies want much more. Now that his methods have met with some success, Trump should feel emboldened to go further, Bannon said.",
      "\u201cGo to the big state universities and tell them to either purge your faculties of these radicals or we\u2019ll cut you off from the money,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cThese people have no pushback. They talk a big game, but once you cut back the money, they fold. They\u2019re addicted to government cash. So use the addiction against them.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all gas, no brakes,\u201d Bannon added.",
      "Election changes",
      "Indeed, there is no sign that Trump is letting up. A sweeping executive order that he signed Tuesday would upend the nation\u2019s election system \u2014 a particular interest of a president who still insists he won the 2020 election that forced him from office. Some of Trump\u2019s supporters, Bannon included, want to find a way for him to run again in 2028, though the Constitution forbids a third term.",
      "The order demands that the Election Assistance Commission put in place a proof of citizenship requirement that would require people to show a U.S. passport or similar document to register to vote. Nearly half of all Americans don\u2019t have a passport, meaning Trump\u2019s order, if implemented, could disenfranchise millions of Americans. In the order, Trump said the actions were necessary to stop noncitizens from voting, though such cases are rare.",
      "What\u2019s more, the order assumes power that presidents lack, legal experts said. Elections are decentralized, with the Constitution giving Congress and the states authority over how they\u2019re run. Election law experts say the president lacks the legal authority to set new requirements for voter registration or to direct the Election Assistance Commission \u2014 an independent, bipartisan body.",
      "Judicial pushback",
      "An argument that Trump allies make is that he is exercising power that is rightfully his. A slew of congressional legislation in the post-Watergate period curtailed presidential authority. Trump is reclaiming part of it under what\u2019s known as the \u201cunitary executive theory.\u201d",
      "The idea is that the president, as the duly elected head of the executive branch, has discretion to fire any of the millions of federal workers serving under him.",
      "And Trump has been doing just that. Thousands of workers have been pushed out of their jobs as Trump and his aide-de-camp, Elon Musk, work to shrink the size of government.",
      "Polling shows that Americans don\u2019t necessarily want to see a presidency with expanded power. An NBC News survey this month found that 43% of registered voters believe the executive branch already has too much power. By contrast, only 28% said the judicial branch has too much power; while 18% said Congress has excessive power.",
      "A White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, told NBC News: \u201cWith a mandate from the American people, President Trump is confidently and quickly stripping unelected bureaucrats of government overreach, minimizing the scope of the federal government, and returning power back to the states and money to taxpayers\u2019 wallets.\u201d",
      "Trump is taking the additional step of reaching into independent government boards and deciding who should stay put and who should go. He ousted a member of the five-person National Labor Relations Board, Gwynne Wilcox, who had been nominated by President Joe Biden in 2021 and confirmed by the Senate for a term that wasn\u2019t due to end until 2028.",
      "The first Black woman to serve on the board, which mediates labor disputes, Wilcox sued and a federal judge ordered that she be reinstated.",
      "\u201cAn American President is not a king \u2014 not even an \u2018elected\u2019 one \u2014 and his power to remove federal officers and honest civil servants like plaintiff is not absolute, but may be constrained in appropriate circumstances, as are present here,\u201d wrote Senior Judge Beryl Howell in her decision.",
      "A federal appeals court on Friday handed Trump a victory, upholding Wilcox\u2019s dismissal.",
      "In another era, Congress might have been the restraining force in cases where a president oversteps his authority. But Congress has been ceding power to presidents for years, and Republicans who control the House have shown no appetite for reining in a president who\u2019s hugely popular in his own party.",
      "Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., the chair of the House Appropriations Committee, was upfront about it. Limiting Trump\u2019s power over spending is untenable, he told reporters.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re likely to see a Republican House and Republican Senate try to limit a Republican president,\u201d Cole said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to limit what a Republican president can do.\u201d",
      "For his part, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has voiced no interest in investigating how it came to pass that senior Trump administration officials discussed military plans in a group text chat that included a journalist at The Atlantic.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone should have lost their job over that, because an errant member found its way onto a dialog between leaders,\u201d Johnson told reporters.",
      "That leaves the judiciary as the main governmental bulwark against any presidential overreach. And judges have not shrunk from the role.",
      "The White House has bristled as myriad judges have temporarily blocked his efforts to dismantle agencies, freeze spending or deport migrants under a seldom-used 18th-century law that doesn\u2019t require a hearing.",
      "\u201cIt is rogue, activist judges eroding our checks and balance system to purposely stop the president from implementing his agenda,\u201d a White House official said.",
      "In frustration, Trump has locked onto the view that certain recalcitrant judges should be impeached.\u00a0That\u2019s not how the system is supposed to work, legal experts say. The normal means of handling unwelcome judicial rulings is appeal, not impeachment \u2014 a point that John Roberts, the Supreme Court\u2019s chief justice, felt compelled to point out.",
      "\u201cCongress could help Trump by trying to restrain his worst impulses,\u201d John Yoo, who was a senior Justice Department official in George W. Bush\u2019s administration and a former clerk for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, told NBC News. \u201cWe don\u2019t use impeachment because we disagree with decisions. That\u2019s not consistent with the original understanding of the Constitution.\u201d",
      "Impeaching judges who defy Trump would be exceedingly hard to do, requiring a two-thirds vote in the Senate. If his administration were to defy a court order \u2014 something that Trump has pledged not to do \u2014\u00a0 that would eviscerate what remains of the checks and balances the founding fathers conceived.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a single day that goes by, seemingly, without a court order reversing something blatantly illegal the White House has done,\u201d said Murphy, the Democratic senator from Connecticut. \u201cThis is a constitutional crisis, and there\u2019s no parallel in history.\u201d"

    "summary": "Donald Trump has been giving leaders such as Mark Carney, Mexican Claudia Sheinbaum, Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer a popularity boost, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 The second Trump administration may have ruffled the feathers of America\u2019s allies, but there is also evidence it has boosted world leaders scrambling to deal with the White House\u2019s norm-busting approach.",
      "Some have gained plaudits for meeting Trump head-on, while others have taken a more nuanced line between flattering the president and trying to shore up their own interests against the headwinds blowing from Washington.",
      "Canada\u2019s Mark Carney is poised to win next month\u2019s election by volubly rejecting President Donald Trump\u2019s hostile advances to make his country the 51st state. On the flip side, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has earned accolades for becoming something of a Trump whisperer, deftly responding to his tariff threats and seeing her own popularity rise accordingly.",
      "In Europe, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have received polling boosts following their widely praised Trump strategies. And the embattled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has seen his numbers rise as he has tried to cope with Washington\u2019s brusque approach.",
      "\u201cThe standing of politicians who are having to deal with the crisis engendered by Trump\u2019s presidency is leading to a rise in their popularity, if they seem to be doing this in a reasoned and proper way,\u201d said Dominic Grieve, the former British attorney general and an ex-senior lawmaker for the Conservative Party.",
      "To be clear, Trump is no panacea for leaders. Macron and Starmer are still relatively unpopular and face harsh criticisms on domestic issues that will likely decide future elections. Likewise, good polling numbers will be of limited cheer for Zelenskyy while the future of his entire country is in doubt.",
      "Other analysts debate the extent to which this popularity boost is solely because of Trump, rather than the general climate of global instability and uncertainty of which Washington is a part.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure so how much it\u2019s a Trump bounce or more of a international crisis bounce,\u201d said Anand Menon, director of the think tank U.K. in a Changing Europe. \u201cInsecurity means that, initially at least, trust in the government goes up.\u201d",
      "Still, the abrupt change of tone and policy from the White House is an undeniable factor.",
      "Trump\u2019s attacks on Canada have seen a remarkable turnaround for Carney\u2019s Liberals. They were headed for historic losses, but Trump\u2019s onslaught has seen them ride a wave of renewed Canadian nationalism and lead the polls at 45% ahead of April 28\u2019s election.",
      "\u201cThe old relationship we had with the United States,\u201d Carney told a news conference Thursday, \u201cis over.\u201d",
      "Mexico\u2019s Sheinbaum has chosen a different tack, taking action on immigration and fentanyl trafficking \u2014 including sending 10,000 National Guard troops to the border. That earned a delay on Trump\u2019s tariffs, as well as praise from the U.S. president, who called her \u201ca wonderful woman.\u201d",
      "At home, she has mixed this strategy with a cerebral nationalism, telling voters that this is about \u201ccoordination, yes \u2014 submission, never.\u201d",
      "Her already high ratings have risen to 85%, according to the El Financiero newspaper in February.",
      "In the United Kingdom, Starmer\u2019s ratings have gone up 8.5 percentage points from February, according to the British pollster Ipsos. That followed an Oval Office meeting with Trump in which he mixed compliments with candor: talking up a potential trade deal while refusing to budge from a commitment to Ukraine.",
      "He has promised to hike British defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, part of the wider nervousness in Europe about Trump\u2019s commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance.",
      "The economy and health care will likely decide the next election. But defense is now the third most important issue for British voters, most polls show. And it is defense and international trade on which voters think Starmer is performing best, according to the Ipsos poll taken between March 14 and 17.",
      "\u201cPretty much all of his readings have become somewhat less unpopular in the wake of his trip to Washington,\u201d said John Curtice, one of Britain\u2019s most respected polling experts and a professor at Scotland\u2019s University of Strathclyde. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say the public have noticed that he\u2019s risen to the challenge.\u201d",
      "Another man banging the drum on European defense is France\u2019s Macron. He and Starmer are leading an informal \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d \u2014 a group of countries prepared to send troops to Ukraine to uphold any eventual ceasefire.",
      "Likewise, the current international upheaval has seen Macron\u2019s popularity jump to 31% in March, up 7 points from the previous month, according to an Ifop poll.",
      "These numbers are still relatively low, however, and they may well be fleeting. Macron can\u2019t run again in the next election, in 2027, but his centrist heirs risk losing the presidency to the far-right National Rally, the current favorite.",
      "The same is true for Starmer, whose Labour Party has slid from a landslide victory last year to near parity with the Conservatives and hard-right Reform U.K. Most voters are worried about high prices for food, energy and housing, rather than their leader\u2019s Oval Office repartee.",
      "For any leader enjoying a momentary upside, Menon, of U.K. in a Changing Europe, has a word of warning: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get complacent on the back of the fact that, right at the moment, things are looking a little bit better because Trump uncertainty.\u201d"

    "summary": "Some think Vance tried to block an order from Trump. Others feel he is on the wrong side of a rift between MAGA and GOP internationalists.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President JD Vance\u2019s last-minute concerns about President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to strike the Houthis in Yemen, raised in a now-public Signal chat with other top U.S. officials, have left senior Republican lawmakers angry.",
      "Some are upset because they think Vance was trying to block a directive from Trump. Others, reflecting a broader debate inside the administration and the GOP over the wisdom of embarking on a stepped-up campaign against the militant group, are upset about the side he took.",
      "Trump has campaigned and governed on the idea that America should be put first and its traditional allies and conflicts overseas second. But his administration is now making moves that reflect the potential for a protracted military campaign against the Houthis.",
      "Observers say the debate over the Yemen strikes is the difference between MAGA world, which tends to be against helping the Europeans while focusing on Asia, and garden-variety Republicans, who think the U.S. should not abandon issues in the Middle East.",
      "The Pentagon has moved an additional aircraft carrier and its attendant ships into the region, joining the USS Harry Truman carrier strike group already there. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has authorized at least two Patriot missile defense batteries from Asia to be moved to the Middle East, two U.S. officials and one defense official told NBC News.",
      "And in a move that suggests thoughts of a sustained campaign in the Middle East, NBC News has also learned from one U.S. official and another person familiar with the matter that defense officials have approved the relocation of a large missile system known as a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, a more complex effort.",
      "At the same time, the military has acknowledged in a statement that it quietly moved multiple B-2 bombers, C-17 cargo jets and KC-135 refueling tankers to Diego Garcia, a tiny island in the Indian Ocean that has been used as a hub for operations in the Middle East in the past. The B-2 bombers can carry the largest bombs in the U.S. arsenal, including bunker buster bombs that could be useful against Houthi militants, who are known to bury sites deep into the ground to protect them.",
      "All of these moves signal a commitment to a sustained fight against the Houthis with the purpose of finally neutralizing the group, which is armed by Iran and has caused havoc to shipping routes through the Red Sea, and potentially deterring Tehran.",
      "Many Republicans on Capitol Hill are generally happy to see the Trump administration take the fight to the Houthis.",
      "Vance's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.",
      "Questioning Trump?",
      "The fact that Vance had questioned Trump\u2019s directive to conduct the strikes has largely been lost in the controversy over top administration officials discussing the military plans over Signal, and the inadvertent inclusion of The Atlantic\u2019s editor-in-chief in that chat.",
      "Taking what some believe is a pro-MAGA, anti-European position, Vance argued in the discussion on Signal that with the strikes, the U.S. was doing the work of European freeloaders, since, he said, the lion\u2019s share of Red Sea shipping is attributed to their economies.",
      "That has angered some Republicans who believe Vance was about to obstruct the president\u2019s wishes in a way they see as comparable to how some top Trump aides acted during his first administration.",
      "\u201cI think we are making a mistake,\u201d Vance wrote in the Signal chat, later published by The Atlantic. Vance argued that although Trump wanted to send a message with the strikes, \u201cI am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now.\u201d\u00a0He did say, though, that he was \u201cwilling to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself,\u201d but went on to say \u201cthere is a strong argument for delaying this a month.\u201d",
      "Minutes later, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller shut down the conversation, writing, \u201cAs I heard it, the president was clear.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s questioning of the move on the Signal chat, which did not include Trump, has angered hawkish Republicans who were frustrated with what they felt were the Biden administration\u2019s muted efforts to go after the Houthis and who celebrate Trump\u2019s intention to go after senior leaders.",
      "\u201cCapitol Hill Republicans still have their jaws on their floor with how actively the VP worked to try and undo a Trump decision,\u201d one senior Republican official on Capitol Hill said in a text. \u201cThank goodness Miller stepped in and put him in his place.\u201d",
      "The senior Republican official added: \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to have a healthy interagency debate before a decision is made. It\u2019s another to try and undo a Commander-in-Chief decision once Trump gives the execute order. This is the latter, and it\u2019s very [John] Bolton-esque.\u201d",
      "Some Republicans believe Vance raising questions about an action the president had already agreed to amounted to a form of obstruction, the same senior Republican official said.",
      "\u201cThe president was not aware how inconsistent this is with his own messaging?\u201d another Republican on Capitol Hill asked, quoting Vance. \u201cThese are the president\u2019s policies, and for JD Vance to question them like that is ridiculous. He is the commander in chief.\u201d",
      "Fears of another Iraq",
      "But some Trump administration officials believe privately that the U.S. should wash its hands of the conflict and move on. They worry that if he doesn\u2019t, Trump could get himself mired in a campaign that will prevent him from extracting the U.S. from the Middle East\u2019s problems, according to one current administration official, who asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the press.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 2002 all over again,\u201d the official said, referring to the lead-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.",
      "Dana Stroul, who was the top policy official in the Pentagon for the Middle East under Biden and is now a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said, \u201cI think Yemen will be the first test case of these opposing ideological positions in the Trump administration. This is the beginning of a campaign, and for the campaign to be successful, you need to be prepared to go for months if not longer.\u201d",
      "After Trump pours resources into the region, it will be difficult to pull them back out again, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen the president realizes months from now how tied down he is in the region, he might be frustrated to learn it is difficult to quickly change course without tremendous risk.\u201d",
      "Biden was often criticized by both Senate and House Republicans for being overly careful when it came to targeting the Houthis, but Stroul said the Biden administration\u2019s strategy was to keep a lid on the Houthis without getting pulled in altogether.",
      "Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, the commander of U.S. Central Command, presented strike packages to the Pentagon several times last year that included targeting Houthi leaders, specifically those involved in the militants\u2019 drone and missile program, according to multiple current and former U.S. officials.",
      "\u201cThe Biden White House wasn\u2019t approving targets even when they had solid intel with multiple U.S. agencies and allies backing up the info, specifically when they include targeting people,\u201d said a former U.S. official with knowledge of the operations.",
      "But two former U.S. officials, who worked in the White House during the Biden administration, said some of Kurilla\u2019s plans were not approved because they weren\u2019t based on solid intelligence, the possibility of civilian casualties was high, and Kurilla was consistently prepared to accept higher risk than the Pentagon and White House. The two former U.S. officials said obtaining actionable intelligence was hard because the U.S. lacked sources on the ground and drones were often jammed or shot down.",
      "Still, there was no \u201cknee-jerk opposition\u201d to targeting Houthi leaders, one of the former U.S. officials said.",
      "Representatives for Kurilla did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Things changed in January 2025, when the combination of good intelligence shared by Israel and stepped-up intelligence by the U.S. put Washington in a better position to strike the Houthis, the two former U.S. officials said. They said Biden administration officials believed that they could have acted at that point, but that executing the plan correctly would have taken months and would have meant starting an operation just before Inauguration Day and boxing in the Trump administration. So Biden administration officials essentially bequeathed the plan to the Trump administration, which is now beginning to execute it.",
      "Defense Department officials say the strikes in Yemen will continue. \u201cThis is a sustained, ongoing operation targeting Houthi leadership,\u201d a defense official said in a statement. \u201cAt the direction of the president, CENTCOM continues to conduct strikes across multiple Iran-backed Houthi locations every day and night to restore freedom of navigation and restore American deterrence.\u201d"

      "The chair of the charity co-founded by Prince Harry has accused him of \u201charassment and bullying at scale\u201d after he announced his resignation last week.",
      "In an interview with\u00a0Sky News that aired on Sunday, Sentebale chair Sophie Chandauka\u00a0cited Harry\u2019s resignation statement as an \u201cunleashing of the Sussex machine\u201d against her and the organization\u2019s employees.",
      "\u201cAt some point on Tuesday, Prince Harry authorized the release of a damaging piece of news to the outside world without informing me or my country directors or my executive director,\u201d Chandauka said. \u201cAnd can you imagine what that attack has done for me, on me, and the 540 individuals in the Sentebale organizations and their family? That is an example of bullying and harassment at scale.\u201d",
      "The Duke of Sussex founded Sentebale alongside Prince Seeiso of Lesotho in 2006, with the aim of helping young people in the southern African nations of Lesotho and Botswana tackle health issues such as HIV and AIDS, as well as wealth inequity and climate resilience.",
      "The two originally set up the charity to honor their late mothers, Britain\u2019s Princess Diana and Lesotho\u2019s Queen Mamohato. Both quit as patrons of Sentebale after a fallout between its chairperson and the trustees.",
      "Harry and Seeiso had told Britain\u2019s Press Association news agency last week that the relationship between the charity\u2019s trustees and the chair of the board \u201cbroke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation.\u201d",
      "Without naming Chandauka, Harry and Seeiso had said in their joint statement that Sentebale\u2019s trustees had asked the chair to step down, \u201cwhile keeping the wellbeing of staff in mind.\u201d They did not elaborate on why the chair had been asked to step down from their position. The statement then said the chair sued Sentebale \u201cto remain in this voluntary position, further underscoring the broken relationship.\u201d",
      "Harry and Seeiso added in their statement that they plan to raise their concerns with Britain\u2019s Charity Commission, which regulates charities in England and Wales. A spokesperson for the Charity Commission told NBC News last week that it was \u201caware of concerns about the governance of Sentebale\u201d and \u201cassessing the issues to determine the appropriate regulatory steps.\u201d",
      "Chandauka issued her own statement last week, calling out \u201cpeople in this world who behave as though they are above the law and mistreat people, and then play the victim card and use the very press they disdain to harm people who have the courage to challenge their conduct.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeneath all the victim narrative and fiction that has been syndicated to press,\u201d she added, \u201cis the story of a woman who dared to blow the whistle about issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir \u2014 and the cover-up that ensued.\u201d",
      "She clarified in her Sky News interview Sunday that her experience with Harry himself was \u201cfantastic, actually,\u201d and that they had a \u201cgreat relationship.\u201d But some people on the charity\u2019s board, she said, \u201ccompletely disrupted my meetings because they thought that they could get away with mistreating a woman.\u201d",
      "The Duke of Sussex did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Responding to Chandauka\u2019s allegations, former Sentebale trustee Kelello Lerotholi said he was unaware of the issues she raised during his time on the board.",
      "\u201cThe general tone and conduct of the board has been one of respect for each other, accommodating each other\u2019s opinions and inputs, and speaking with respect to each other,\u201d Lerotholi told Sky News. \u201cSo this all came as a shock to me when I heard.\u201d",
      "Harry, who stepped down as a working member of Britain\u2019s royal family in 2020, now lives in California with his wife, Meghan, and their two children."

      "Of the five home runs allowed that day by Brewers starter Nestor Cortes, a former Yankee, four were hit by players using bats that eschew the thick-barreled shape used for generations and instead shift wood from the end of the bat closer to the middle, near its label.",
      "Awareness of the bats became a trending topic during Saturday\u2019s home run derby after Yankees broadcaster Michael Kay revealed the change was a result of a study by the team\u2019s analytics department of shortstop Anthony Volpe that found \u201cevery single ball it seemed like he hit on the label.

      "TOKYO \u2014 Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called Japan on Sunday an \u201cindispensable partner\u201d in deterring growing Chinese assertiveness in the region and announced upgrading the U.S. military command in Japan to a new \u201cwar-fighting headquarters.\u201d",
      "Hegseth, who is on his first Asia trip with Japan as his second stop, also stressed the need for both countries to do more to accelerate the strengthening of their military capability as the region faces China\u2019s assertive military actions and a possible Taiwan emergency.",
      "\u201cJapan is our indispensable partner in deterring Communist Chinese military aggression,\u201d Hegseth said at the beginning of his talks with Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani in Tokyo. \u201cThe U.S. is moving fast, as you know, to reestablish deterrence in this region and around the world.\u201d",
      "His comments come as an assurance at a time when Japan has been worried about how U.S. engagement in the region may change under President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy, Japanese defense officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity, citing protocol. Trump has also threatened to impose trade tariffs on Japan, a key U.S. ally, raising more concern.",
      "The two sides agreed to accelerate plans to jointly develop and produce missiles such as Advanced Medium-Range Air to Air Missiles, or MRAAM, and consider producing SM-6 surface-to-air missiles, to help ease a shortage of munitions, Nakatani said. The ministers also agreed to speed up the process involving the maintenance of U.S. warships and warplanes in Japan to strengthen and complement Japanese and U.S. defense industries.",
      "Japan and the U.S. decided in July to upgrade the command and control of the Japanese military as well as U.S. forces in the East Asian country, under the Biden administration, a major structural change aimed at bolstering joint operational and response capabilities. Japan is home to more than 50,000 U.S. troops.",
      "Last week Tokyo launched the Japan Joint Operations Command, or JJOC, whose mission is to coordinate Japanese Ground, Maritime and Air Self-Defense Forces, in a significant action to further strengthen capabilities to respond to contingencies and better cooperate with the U.S.",
      "Hegseth announced Sunday the upgrading of its current command, U.S. Forces Japan, by placing a unified operational commander to function as a joint force headquarters to liaise with its Japanese counterpart to serve as \u201cwar-fighting headquarters\u201d to bolster speed and capability of their troops\u2019 joint operations.",
      "The Pentagon chief said the reorganization of U.S. troops is a step to better prepare for a possible conflict. America and Japan both work for peace, but \u201cwe must be prepared,\u201d he said.",
      "The Japanese defense officials say they are not expecting a significant change in their responsibilities or an increase in U.S. troops in Japan.",
      "Hegseth and Nakatani told a joint news conference that they have also agreed on the need to beef up Japan\u2019s defense posture on the Southwestern islands, which are in critical locations along disputed areas in the East China Sea and near Taiwan to further step up deterrence against China.",
      "He stressed the need to have \u201csustaining, robust, ready and credible deterrence\u201d in the Indo-Pacific, including across the Taiwan Strait, as \u201cJapan would be on the frontlines of any contingency we might face in the western Pacific.\u201d",
      "China claims Taiwan as its own territory. The U.S. is obligated under a 1979 law to provide Taiwan with sufficient military hardware and technology to deter invasion, and its arm sales to Taiwan have always drawn strong opposition from Beijing.",
      "On Saturday, Hegseth joined the U.S.-Japan joint memorial to honor the war dead in the Battle of Iwo Jima as they marked the 80th anniversary of the end of one of the fiercest battles of World War II, praising the strong alliance between the former enemies.",

      "Elon Musk began and ended his town hall in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on Sunday by urging attendees to back conservative Brad Schimel in the state's high-stakes Supreme Court election Tuesday.",
      "But the bulk of Musk's nearly two-hour event was ultimately focused not on the off-year election that he has poured millions of dollars into \u2014 which he said could \"affect the entire destiny of humanity\" \u2014 but rather the work of his Department of Government Efficiency, as he outlined its purpose and defended its work against naysayers who've questioned the constitutionality of the sweeping cuts to the federal government overseen by the group.",
      "\"The very simple, straightforward goal of the DOGE team is to get rid of waste and fraud. It's mostly waste. It's or, depending on how, you know, I'd say it's probably 80% waste, 20% fraud, something like that,\" he said.",
      "There has been broad backlash to how DOGE has enacted its sweeping cuts to the federal government\u2019s workforce and spending, with an NBC News poll this month finding a majority of voters have negative views of both Musk and the entity he helped create.",
      "In an apparent effort to change the perception of DOGE, Musk said its work could ultimately curb inflation.",
      "\u201cPeople see the prices rising at the grocery store or for goods and services or for houses, and they tend to, like, blame the store, but it\u2019s not the store, it\u2019s the government. The government has reduced the value of money, and as a result, prices rise. So by changing \u2014 by reducing waste and fraud, we'll essentially make the economy more efficient,\" he said.",
      "Musk answered questions about the formation and naming of DOGE, dismissed the idea that the federal government would use his Dogecoin, deflected when he was asked when \"DOGE checks\" would be sent to Americans and responded directly to critics who assert his work to significantly curb government spending is unconstitutional.",
      "\"When I get these sort of attacks of like, oh, it's unconstitutional, I mean, like, well, which expenditure is unconstitutional that we have stopped?\" Musk said. \"They don't know, actually, because they don't \u2014 they haven't actually looked at anything.\"",
      "The attacks Musk has faced working in lockstep with the White House to implement President Donald Trump's agenda were another focus of the event, with one attendee using his question to have his father pray for Musk's protection.",
      "The attacks, Musk said, included vandalism to Tesla vehicles and the drop in value of the company's stock from its once record highs.",
      "Musk has poured significant resources into the state's Supreme Court race, which he argued could affect Trump's ability to enact his agenda. In addition to the two $1 million checks he awarded to voters Sunday night despite a lawsuit from the state's attorney general, his PAC has invested roughly $12 million in the effort, largely focused on canvassing and get-out-the-vote efforts.",
      "The checks, which Musk offered to any Wisconsin voter willing to sign a petition against \"activist judges,\" faced a legal challenge by Wisconsin's Democratic attorney general, Josh Kaul, who argued the giveaways were illegal. The state Supreme Court ultimately declined to intervene."

      "Over the years, he has been subject to additional criticism, including having his recording contract temporarily suspended in February 2021\u00a0after he was caught on camera using a racial slur.\u00a0However, the following year, he reappeared at award shows and\u00a0won album of the year at the Academy of Country Music Awards\u00a0in May 2022.",

      "The biggest revelation from Major League Baseball\u2019s opening weekend was not the Los Angeles Dodgers\u2019 5-0 dominance, the four home runs hit already by Eugenio Su\u00e1rez or Miami\u2019s three consecutive walk-off wins.",
      "Instead, the talk of baseball has been new, torpedo-shaped bats used by several members of the New York Yankees \u2014 and the league-leading offensive numbers they have produced.",
      "The Yankees have scored 36 runs, an MLB-high 22 more than their opponents, through three games, including a team-record nine home runs in Saturday\u2019s victory over Milwaukee.",
      "Of the five home runs allowed that day by Brewers starter Nestor Cortes, a former Yankee, four were hit by players using bats that eschew the thick-barreled shape used for generations and instead shift wood from the end of the bat closer to the middle, near its label.",
      "Awareness of the bats became a trending topic during Saturday\u2019s home run derby after Yankees broadcaster Michael Kay revealed the change was a result of a study by the team\u2019s analytics department of shortstop Anthony Volpe that found \u201cevery single ball it seemed like he hit on the label. He didn\u2019t hit any on the barrel.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo they had bats made up where they moved a lot of the wood into the label so the harder part of the bat is going to actually strike the ball.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know I\u2019m bought in,\u201d Volpe\u00a0told The Associated Press. \u201cThe bigger you can have the barrel where you hit the ball, it makes sense to me.\u201d",
      "The new bats are used by Volpe, Jazz Chisholm \u2014 who hit two home runs Sunday \u2014 Paul Goldschmidt, Cody Bellinger and Austin Wells. They have tallied nine homers in the team\u2019s first three games.",
      "Yankees manager Aaron Boone said it was an example of the team \u201ctrying to win on the margins.\u201d",
      "MLB has only seven stipulations governing bats in its official rule book, and the new shape does not appear to violate them.\u00a0Rules require bats to be one piece of solid wood, a \u201csmooth, round stick not more than 2.61 inches in diameter at the thickest part and not more than 42 inches in length.\u201d Experimental bats are not allowed \u201cuntil the manufacturer has secured approval from Major League Baseball of his design and methods of manufacture.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all within regulation,\u201d Bellinger, who has said he used similar bats during practice but not games last year with the Chicago Cubs, told the AP. \u201cThey made sure [of] that before the season even started, knowing that, I imagine, at some point the way these bats look that it\u2019s probably going to get out at some point.\u201d",
      "Where did the specific design come from?",
      "In a\u00a0series of posts on X, former Yankees infielder Kevin Smith credited Aaron Leanhardt, a former Yankees staffer now employed by the Miami Marlins, for the concept of shifting more wood and density to where hitters make contact most often. Leanhardt \u201cwould say \u20185-10 years from now this is all anyone will be using\u2019\u201d Smith posted.",
      "Before he worked in baseball, Leanhardt was a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Leanhardt told\u00a0The Athletic\u00a0on Sunday that the idea was sparked while he was working with the Yankees\u2019 minor-league hitting department.",
      "\"It\u2019s just about making the bat as heavy and as fat as possible in the area where you\u2019re trying to do damage on the baseball,\u201d Leanhardt told The Athletic.",
      "By any measure, the Yankees have, indeed, done damage. They have hit for an MLB-high team average of .333 and added 11 home runs, one off the league lead. Not all of those gaudy statistics can be attributed to new bats, however.",
      "Aaron Judge, last season\u2019s home run champion, who has already hit four this season and batted in 11 runs, is among the Yankees who are non-torpedo-bat users.",
      "\u201cWhat I did the past couple seasons speaks for itself,\u201d Judge said,\u00a0per the New York Post.\u00a0\u201cWhy try to change something if you have something that\u2019s working?\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Warning: This post contains spoilers for Season 3 of \"The White Lotus.\"",
      "Fans of the \"The White Lotus\" have been waiting to see Gaitok show off his killer instinct in Season 3 of the hit HBO show, and the hotel security guard seems to be getting closer than ever before in Episode 7.",
      "While at a Muay Thai fight with his crush, Mook (Lalisa Manobal, better known by her stage name Lisa), Gaitok confronts the world of violence \u2014 and comes to terms with the fact some of the people at the hotel may not be who they think they are.",
      "As one of the fighters is getting knocked out, Gaitok looks down at Valentin (Arnas Fedaravi\u010dius), one of the wellness gurus at the resort, and sees him cheering with Laurie (Carrie Coon) and two of his Russian friends. Gaitok slowly starts to realize, through flashbacks, that Vlad and Alexei were the two men behind the robbery at the hotel earlier in the season.",
      "Tayme Thapthimthong, who plays Gaitok, tells TODAY.com that the moment of realization for his character is \"very shocking.\"",
      "\"When he goes to the fight, it's obviously very shocking for him to put it together, because the tall Russian guy obviously has very distinct features, and he obviously remembers him from just before he was pistol-whipped,\" Thapthimthong says. \"So just to see that he's like, 'Wait a minute, is it that guy?' And then to see him next to Valentin ... it's just kind of like, 'No, I think this guy's so cool.'\"",
      "\"And then (Valentin) was actually the friend that let them in \u2014 it's all coming together,\" he adds. \"But also, I think in his mind, it's like, Do I tell someone? Like, if I tell someone, what's going to happen to him?'\"",
      "Thapthimthong says he thinks Gaitok knows Valentin's backstory \u2014 he moved to the hotel before the war started in Russia \u2014 and what his involvement in the crime could mean for his employment in Thailand.",
      "\"So I think he's had a lot of empathy for him,\" Thapthimthong says.",
      "Ultimately, Thapthimthong thinks Gaitok is \"just extremely disappointed\" to figure out Valentin could be involved in the crime.",
      "\"Like, I thought you were a friend,\" he says of his character\u2019s thought process. \"We've trained Muay Thai together outside of work. You know, you seem like someone I would befriend for a long time, but I can't believe you would actually let me get hurt like that and be OK with it, and then never say anything.\"",
      "\"Most of all, I think he is processing, like, 'What do I do with this information now?'\" he continues. \"Because he is obviously thinking as well, 'If I do tell someone, maybe they'll like me even more at work, and I'll get a promotion, because I helped solve the case.'\"",
      "The night begins as a date night for Gaitok and Mook, after Valentin gives him tickets for his Muay Thai fight. Before arriving at the fight, Mook and Gaitok grab dinner, where he tells her he doesn't think he is going to be promoted to become a bodyguard.",
      "\"He says I don't have a killer instinct,\" Gaitok tells Mook, referring to his exchange with his boss at the shooting range.",
      "Mook says Gaitok can prove his boss wrong, but Gaitok says that even when the robbers came to the hotel, he didn't want to fight.",
      "He references the Buddha, who condemns violence. Mook says violence is OK in defense. Gaitok replies that he still doesn't want to hurt anyone.",
      "\"You have to be strong, that's part of the job,\" Mook says.",
      "She adds that she also thought Gaitok was more ambitious and that he wanted a better job.",
      "Thapthimthong says he thinks his character was always OK with his job as the hotel's security guard \u2014 and that it was Mook who got into his head.",
      "\"That first episode when, Mook's like, 'Oh yeah, those guys, they get to travel the world, get good pay and have good responsibility, I think that's what hit him,\" he says.",
      "Thapthimthong refers to the scene where Gaitok says he thinks his job is pretty good, and that he does have a big responsibility as one of the hotel's security guards.",
      "\"I think it's when she's like, 'Really? Like, just this letting cars in and out? Is that really that fun?' And I think he's just like, OK, I need to do something. I need to do something more with myself,'\" Thapthimthong says.",
      "At the Muay Thai fight, Mook tells Gaitok, \u201cSee, it\u2019s natural.\u201d She adds that it's \"human to fight.\"",
      "\"There's a lot going through this guy's mind, for sure,\" Thapthimthong says. 'I've really enjoyed the layers that he had to him.\"",
      "During one of Gaitok's flashbacks to the robbery at the resort, he remembers seeing a tall bald man wearing a mask \u2014 with similar features as Vlad \u2014 hitting the car as his fellow robber is about to pistol-whip Gaitok.",
      "He also remembers that he was talking with Valentin at the security checkpoint when the car sped through to commit the robbery.",
      "\"The way I have thought about how Gaitok and Valentin's relationship is in the hotel, is that, Gaitok's a very local guy,\" Thapthimthong says. \"And any foreigner that comes in and befriends him, he's like, so grateful. You know, he's like, 'Oh my God, this guy's talking to me.'\"",
      "Thapthimthong says that was part of his experience serving in the Thai army and cross-training with U.S. forces \u2014 some of his fellow soldiers would get excited when an American soldier talked to them so that they could practice their English.",
      "Similarly, Thapthimthong thinks Thai security guards would be excited to have a foreigner talking with them, especially another worker at the hotel. He references how Gaitok reacts when Valentin offers him a ticket to the Muay Thai fight in Episode 2.",
      "\"I played it as, you know, he obviously looks up to Valentin, as someone who's very cool, and he's got an amazing physique, too,\" Thapthimthong says. \"And he does Muay Thai \u2014 I always thought Gaitok's not a violent guy, but he does, just like most men in Thailand, enjoy watching a Muay Thai fight. So he definitely looks up to Valentin that way.\"",
      "After the fight, Laurie goes home with Aleksei and hooks up with him. He then asks her for money \u2014 upwards of $10,000 \u2014 to help his sick mother back in Russia.",
      "As Laurie is trying to say no, she hears a knock on the door. It's Aleksei's girlfriend is trying to get in. Aleksei tries to stall as Laurie runs into another room, where she discovers the jewelry stolen during the robbery at the hotel.",
      "She ends up jumping out of Aleksei's window and running to catch a cab back to the hotel, while Gaitok ruminates on what to do with his own realization.",
      "As for whether Gaitok is a bad security guard? Thapthimthong says Gaitok is definitely not good at his job, but that he is an accurate representation of a hotel security guard in Thailand.",
      "\"Hotel security guards in Thailand in general, they're not your typical big, chunky guys who you would usually see in front of a club,\" Thapthimthong says. \"I don't think in those hotels they would really expect any like physical confrontation.\"",
      "\"I have seen a lot of guys be like that. They're usually just in charge of opening the gate and ushering the guests in, and are just like a friendly face that you see at the front gate when you first enter,\" he continues. \"So I think that that Gaitok's character was written pretty spot-on.\"",
      "Thapthimthong says he used his experience in the military and working in security to make Gaitok's demeanor convincing.",

Harvey as a confident, cunning and savvy New York City attorney became a difficult act to replicate, many thanks actor Gabriel Macht\u2019s portrayal.",
      "So when the \u201cSuits\u201d resurgence in 2023 created enough buzz to lead a spinoff series, \u201cSuits LA,\u201d by the same creator, Aaron Korsh, fans had to know: Could Harvey Specter return?",
      "That answer became a yes, in the form of a brief cameo in the fourth episode. Macht says he never wished for a major role in the new series.",
      "\u201cI thought that we definitely stuck the landing, and I think we gave the fans what they wanted, and we wrapped up some storylines. When you play a character for that long, it\u2019s time to say goodbye,\u201d Macht tells TODAY.com in an interview.",

      "The episode that includes Harvey features a flashback of Ted, troubled by a personal issue preventing him from focusing on his latest case. It\u2019s unclear where in Harvey\u2019s professional timeline it takes place, though we know Harvey and Ted both used to work in a district attorney\u2019s office. In the scene, Harvey buys Ted a drink after a baseball game to get his mind off things.",
      "\u201cI think the two of them relied on each other for their cerebral machinations of how to get their cases through,\u201d Macht tells TODAY.com. \u201cI think Harvey was there to show him, \u2018All right now, this is the time to just get the job done.\u2019\u201d",
      "Macht also says he\u2019s a fan of Korsh\u2019s direction in the newest chapter of the \u201cSuits\u201d universe and encourages fans to buy in as well.",
      "\u201cI think it takes time to get legs. I think it takes time for people to sort of accept that this is not the original show; it\u2019s a different show,\u201d he explains.",

      "Macht previously said on Instagram that Harvey and Ted\u2019s friendship will be unpacked in three episodes of \u201cSuits LA.\u201d Rick Hoffman also revealed he will reprise his role as Specter\u2019s infamous rival Louis Litt in an upcoming episode.",
      "\u201cIt takes a while for people to feel like you can bring someone in your home,\u201d Macht explains. \u201cWith a little bit of the original coming in and spicing it up and just giving you a little bit of a spark \u2014 I think it\u2019s helpful. But these guys, they don\u2019t even need us.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, Macht is enjoying his time away from major acting roles, mostly focusing on his private life. He especially loves not having to memorize 10 pages of dialogue every day \u2014 and being a soccer dad. (He has two teenaged kids with wife Jacinda Barrett.)",
      "\u201cI\u00a0don\u2019t have a minivan, but I\u2019m doing the school runs, and I\u2019m waking the kids up, and I\u2019m just seeing them grow, and I\u2019m seeing the challenges of adolescents,\u201d Macht continues. \u201cI like just being around.\u201d"

Told through candid interviews, the documentary touches on the harsh realities of casting, authentic stories and what some of the industry's biggest names hope for the future.",
      "Directed by Reginald Hudlin, Part One spotlights Black male actors, including Jamie Foxx, Kevin Hart, Don Cheadle, Idris Elba and more.

      "Lynch says one interview she specifically \"kept pushing\" for was Goldberg. Originally, the goal was to conduct all the interviews in a span of two weeks. (\"I know ... what were we even thinking?\" Lynch says with a laugh.) She also acknowledges that participating in the project was no small ask.",
      "\"We're asking them each to sit down for an interview, to share part of themselves. And it's not a paying gig. Documentaries are not lucrative, and it's not their production company. And so the business on that was difficult,\" she says. \"But they understood the power of telling the story in this context.\"",
      "She credits the film's executive producers \u2014 which includes Bassett, Berry, Davis and Goldberg \u2014\u00a0with giving participants a sense of \"comfort.\"",
      "Part of the documentary explores the importance for actresses to not only be No. 1 on a project but also lead behind the scenes as a producer or director. Having some of those very women be executive producers of \"Number One on the Call Sheet\" \"sends the right signal to all the other people we're trying to bring into the project,\" Lynch says.",
      "\"Filmmaking is a team event,\" Lynch says. \"You can't just have one star. You need everybody to be functioning at a high level. And everybody who worked on this film is kind of No. 1 on the call sheet in their arena.\"",
      "An 'enormous orchestra'",
      "Each interview ranged in length from 45 minutes to up to two hours, Lynch says. Her job was to distill the interviews into a comprehensive narrative, and more importantly, make it feel like each actor was in a dialogue with the other.",
      "\"What I wanted to do is have them be in conversation with each other, even though it never would have happened, like the scheduling could have never happened,\" she says. \"So having Whoopi, as the person who's been doing it the longest, all the way to Meagan and Jurnee and a nod to all of the wonderful young actresses coming up ... I thought that was really important.\"",
      "Lynch also addresses those not involved in the project, adding, \"If anybody's missing, it's scheduling,\" she says.",

After all, the heart of the project comes from the interviews, which Lynch says reminded her that celebrities aren't untouchable, but just people.",
      "\"I got to have a conversation with Halle Berry, the person. Angela Bassett, the person. Cynthia Erivo, the person,\" she says. \"There is delight and pleasure in that, and I hope that comes through in the film.\"",
      "She anticipated the experience to be interesting \u2014 a story to tell her teenagers, recapping who all she got to meet and interview. But what she didn't expect was for it to be inspiring and ultimately, relatable, she says.",
      "\"Because whether you're a school teacher or a documentary filmmaker or a journalist, we should each want to be No. 1 on the call sheet,\" she says. \"And we should be working toward that in our purpose to be excellent.\"",
      "That focus on excellence, Lynch says, is why she decided not to change the project's title.",
      "\u201cIt signifies greatness. If we can have everybody in the world talking about being No. 1 on their call sheet, how amazing would that be?\u201d",
      "What's next?",
      "\"Number One on the Call Sheet\" ends with the note of celebrating all that Black actresses have accomplished, while pointing out industry-wide areas of growth, from pay disparity to lack of diversity when it comes to major awards. For example, in the best actress category at the Oscars, only one Black woman has taken home the statuette \u2014 Berry, in 2002 for \"Monster's Ball.\"",
      "When it comes to the legacy of this documentary, Lynch says she wants it to represent \"a testimonial of this moment.\"",
      "\"I direct it, but it's only what they chose to share and what I could kind of bring out of them, and we've never had that before,\" she says.",
      "Lynch calls the documentary itself a \"historic event\" by virtue of its premise: A project grounded in interviews with 17 Black leading women in Hollywood.",
      "\"And they're more, right? We only interviewed 17,\" she says. \"There has been no other period in history where that has been true.\"",
      "She adds, \"But wouldn't it have been amazing to have this kind of conversation in the '70s during Blaxploitation era? That would have been amazing,\u00a0but it doesn't exist ... So this is historic.\""

For the person who is searching and searching and has not found it yet. This room is full of people who can and will, if they choose, and I hope they will, because I do, to be lanterns to light up your journey and your path on your way to showing the world who you are.",

We are all visible. We can be seen. We see each other. I see you, you see me. But think of those who have not been seen, think of those who sit in the dark and wait their turn, hoping and waiting for a light to light their path. I ask every single one of you in this room, with the spaces that you\u2019re in, and the lights that you hold, to point it in the direction of someone who just needs a little guidance.",

      "In the video, an elderly-appearing Grande is wheeled into a futuristic facility where she's allowed to view four stored memories for the last and final time. If that premise sounds a little like the 2004 film \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\" you're spot-on. She's playing Peaches again, a character she originally portrayed in last year's \"We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love),\" only this is a much older version.",
      "The \"Spotless\" connection is a natural; \"Brighter Days\" is a companion piece of art connected to her \"Eternal Sunshine Deluxe: Brighter Days Ahead\" album, which came out in March. The short film is directed by Grande and Christian Breslauer (who also directed videos for \"We Can't Be Friends\" and \"The Boy Is Mine,\" which also released in 2024, as Rolling Stone reports).",
      "In the video, memories are released like clear lottery balls down a ramp.  Viewers then see everything from old family home movies (it's hard to determine how much, if any, of them are actually Grande's real-life home movies) to a modern day Grande singing \"Eternal Sunshine.\" She also gives young-Grande takes on recent songs \"Dandelion,\" \"Twilight Zone,\" \"Supernatural,\" and \"Hampstead,\" all of which tell different pieces of her history.",
      "The description in the YouTube video notes that it's been 70 years since Peaches was last seen (in her previous video), and she's returned to Brighter Days for her memory visit.",
      "\"As Peaches embarks on this immersive journey, we watch her confront and heal certain wounds (personal and professional alike) that have made her who she is today,\" the description reads.",
      "\"She reconnects with her younger self who had been patiently in the wings for over a decade, as she works her way through the challenges of fame (she is the daughter of the very famous Brighter Days Inc. founder/doctor), personal sensationalism (resulting in being torn apart by stray cats), and generational trauma,\" the description continues. \"In the end, with the help of her loved ones and art, she is able to come home to herself. She would do anything to experience it all again. However, there\u2019s one catch: once a memory is relived, it is erased forever.\"",
      "And stay tuned until after the fourth memory is destroyed in the short film for a delightful last comment.",
      "But why riff so hard on the Jim Carrey/Kate Winslet movie? As Grande told Apple Music in a 2024 interview, the mix of romance and memory was extremely powerful for her.",
      "\"I think the movie is so beloved because so many people can relate to knowing that something isn't right, but loving so much, and wanting to stay, and wanting to figure it out, and that cycle that can happen in the film,\" she said. \"I think that's why the film is so beloved. It's because so many people can relate to it, and I think it kind of fell into place that these songs had little tidbits of that theme. I just felt really inspired by it.\"",
      "Grande is on quite a roll, thanks in part not just to the \u201cEternal Sunshine\u201d release (and the \u201cDeluxe\u201d addition), but she was also nominated for an Academy Award in early 2025 for her work in \u201cWicked.\u201d"

      "When she finished the story, Knightley recalls feeling happy with it. But she was left with an \"itch,\" she says.",

      "The result is \"The Irresistible Urge to Fall in Love,\" which she describes not as an adaptation of her fan fiction but an original work that is \"Dramione-coded\" or has \"Dramione vibes.\"",
      "\u201cI wrote it because I came off a fan fic, and I was like, 'OK, I did that dynamic, but I'm looking for this other one.' And I didn\u2019t have, for once in my life, some sort of IP in mind,\u201d she says. \"So it really was written as an original work.\"",
      "\"The Irresistible Urge to Fall for Your Enemy\" is a slow burn romantic fantasy that follows an ailing assassin, Osric, who has to seek help from a healer named Aurienne, even though their respective orders \u2014\u00a0the Fyren and Haelan, respectively \u2014 are opposites in every way.",
      "The book, which comes out July 8, will kick off the \"Dearly Beloathed\" duology.",
      "The romance is a true slow burn \u2014\u00a0\"They think about killing each other like for the first 10 chapters,\" Knightley says \u2014\u00a0and is set in a version of 19th century England with a form of magic called seith.",
      "Fans of \"Draco Malfoy and the Mortifying Ordeal of Being in Love,\" never fear: Knightley's original fan fiction will stay up on Archive of Our Own.",
      "While having a markedly different plot, \"The Irresistible Urge to Fall For Your Enemy\" will hit all her signature \"beats,\" Knightley says.",
      "\"I always have these steps of like denial and yearning and will they/ won't they ... It's similar to all of my slow burns, not specifically 'Mortifying,'\" Knightley says.",
      "\"When I get to write a stupid idiot who's in denial about his feelings, I am so happy,\" she adds.",
      "Read an excerpt of \u2018The Irresistible Urge to Fall For Your Enemy\u2019",
      "In the following excerpt, Osric (a member of the Fyren Order of assassins) goes to meet Aurienne (a member of the Haelan Order of scholar-healers). She has \u2014 tersely \u2014 ordered him to join her at a clinic so she can assess his illness. He is furious to have been abruptly summoned, especially in daylight. She is aggravated to have to work with a morally bankrupt assassin. The\u00a0ensuing conversation goes as well as you\u2019d imagine... - Brigitte Knightley",
      "Osric, provoked, took the nearest waystone to the designated pub. First, he was at nobody\u2019s beck and call, least of all this priggish Haelan\u2019s. Second, it was broad daylight, and he hated operating in broad day- light. Third, between the name of the pub and the signs for a clinic for spotty bums that he was now following through this gods-forsaken little hamlet, he rather felt that she was taking the piss.",
      "The villagers puttering about gave Osric startled looks as he stalked through the hamlet\u2019s streets, his hood up, his greatcoat flaring behind him.",
      "What part of my condition mustn\u2019t be discovered hadn\u2019t this idiot understood?",
      "He found the final spotty-bum sign and knocked upon the clinic door.",
      "The idiot opened the door.",
      "Fairhrim\u2019s greeting consisted of a look. There was a lot in it; she looked at Osric as though he were a wart that had acquired sufficient sentience to knock on doors.",
      "\u201cAre you bloody serious?\u201d asked Osric.",
      "Fairhrim, taken aback by the wart\u2019s rudeness, straightened. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d",
      "\u201cSummoning me? In broad daylight? In a public place? I told you that my condition mustn\u2019t be discovered.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been discovered,\u201d said Fairhrim. \u201cYou\u2019re hooded up like death personified. And anyone who did see you will think you\u2019re suffer- ing from folliculitis.\u201d",
      "Osric pointed at one of the overly detailed posters that had haunted his walk. \u201cYou had to choose arse acne?\u201d",
      "\u201cTo guarantee us privacy,\u201d said Fairhrim. She held the door open. \u201cGet in.\u201d",
      "Osric stepped into the tired little consultation room. The place was lit with new electric lights far too bright for his liking. There was an examination table against the wall. Miscellaneous medical parapherna- lia was scattered about, looking both curative and foreboding, rather like Fairhrim herself.",
      "Her travelling cloak was clasped shut with a silver wing. She re- moved it to reveal her stiff Haelan dress, high about the neck and impec- cably white, save for the sharp silver epaulettes.",
      "\u201cAlso,\u201d said Osric, removing his own cloak, \u201cI\u2019m not at your beck and call. Don\u2019t summon me like this again.\u201d",
      "Fairhrim grew rigid. She turned to him and spoke with a false sort of brightness. \u201cOh? And I\u2019m at yours, am I? You can impose meetings on me, in abandoned barns, at midnight, without offering me any kind of alternative, but meeting during perfectly normal hours under a per- fectly well-thought-out pretext in a perfectly suitable location presents difficulties, does it? I showed your schedule the same respect you showed mine; didn\u2019t you like it?\u201d",
      "She fixed him with a Look. Osric developed a new understanding of what gimlet-eyed meant.",
      "Osric decided not to die on this particular hill. \u201cPerhaps we can each make improvements to our scheduling habits when it comes to the other\u2019s calendar.\u201d",
      "\u201cA compromise?\u201d asked Fairhrim.",
      "\u201cYes,\u201d said Osric, assuming that this was a positive thing.",
      "It was not. Fairhrim sniffed in Osric\u2019s direction, as though manure from the barn still wafted from him. \u201cI\u2019ve compromised enough just being here today. But, nevertheless, we can compromise. Now, disrobe.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2014what?\u201d",
      "\u201cDisrobe,\u201d repeated Fairhrim. Then, slower: \u201cRemove your clothes.",
      "There are gowns in the cupboard. I\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d",
      "She left the room before Osric could make an argument. Nudity in the face of her ongoing animosity felt unwise. But refusal felt\u2014well, pathetic. She was only a Haelan and she was by herself.",
      "Was she by herself? What if she came back with a Warden when he was stark bollock naked? She reeked of hostility.",
      "He would keep his weapons close at hand.",
      "Osric began to undress. This was no small task. After much unclip- ping, unbelting, and unstrapping, he removed the following inventory from his person: twelve throwing knives, his blaecblade, two back- swords, one amputator, and, finally, a dozen syringes and vials contain- ing substances as nasty as they were illegal.",
      "These items he placed upon the examination table with care.",
      "He was less precious about his clothes: waistcoat, shirt, collar, cra- vat, trousers, underthings, and boots were all tossed towards a chair.",
      "Osric opened the cupboard to discover that the gowns were, judging by their colour and size, intended for little girls, rather than men who liked to cultivate an air of sinister elegance.",
      "He pulled a faded pink thing on, which, when placed over his head, left his dangly bits exposed.",
      "He decided to wrap the gown around his hips like some sort of kilt.",
      "Thus attired, he leaned against a cabinet, looking as suave as one could in a strip of puce-coloured linen, to await Fairhrim\u2019s return.",
      "He felt, once again, that Fairhrim was taking the piss. No one took the piss out of Osric Mordaunt with this level of frequency and noncha- lance. She was lucky that she was necessary to him at this moment; he would\u2019ve murdered her for the cheek otherwise.",
      "The Means to an End knocked, and her crisp voice asked, \u201cReady?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Osric. Should the Haelan have brought company to at- tack him while he was naked, he had throwing knives threaded between his fingers.",
      "Fairhrim swept into the room. Her hard eyes passed over Osric and rested on his knife-bristling fists.",
      "\u201cReally?\u201d was her unimpressed comment. \u201cI can assure you that if I\u2019d planned any harm to you, it would\u2019ve happened already.\u201d",
      "Well. That was cocky.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got a high opinion of yourself,\u201d said Osric.",
      "\u201cDeserved, I assure you,\u201d said Fairhrim. She jutted her chin towards his gown. \u201cThat is quite the ensemble.\u201d",
      "\u201cFetching, isn\u2019t it?\u201d",
      "\u201cDid you try the adult cupboard?\u201d asked Fairhrim. \u201cWhat adult cupboard?\u201d asked Osric.",
      "\u201cThe one you\u2019re sitting on.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Osric.",
      "(He had not tried the adult cupboard.)",
      "Fairhrim advanced into the room with a critical air that made Osric feel like he was back in the barracks as a young Fyren, awaiting his warchief\u2019s inspection.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to need the examination table, if you wouldn\u2019t mind moving this\u201d \u2014 Fairhrim made an impatient gesture towards Osric\u2019s weapons \u2014 \u201cmess of an arsenal.\u201d",
      "Osric moved his things under Fairhrim\u2019s watchful eye.",
      "\u201cIs there a single inch of you that isn\u2019t covered in scar tissue?\u201d she asked.",
      "Osric looked down at himself \u2014 at his chest, decorated by reminders of various blades; at his forearms, ridged by burns; at his shins, scat- tered with memories of a long-ago explosion.",
      "\u201cThere is,\u201d said Osric. \u201cA few inches, actually. Under the kilt.\u201d"

      "From her grimacing smile reaction to Kate's unexpected political leanings, even Bibb's haircut has had fans of the hit HBO show reeling.",
      "Bibb tells TODAY.com she first heard the vulgar name of the hairstyle from a friend of her co-star, Aimee Lou Wood, who plays Chelsea on Season 3 of \"The White Lotus.\"",
      "\"Aimee Lou is British. Aimee Lou is like my sister. So we're very close, so we talk a lot, and do voice memos to each other,\" Bibb says. \"I think it was maybe the first episode or something, and she sent, 'My friend wanted me to tell you that he's f------- loving you and your c----y little bob.\"",
      "Bibb then went to her hairstylist, Chris McMillan, whom she worked with on this season of \"The White Lotus,\" to get a haircut after the season began airing. (McMillan is also the mastermind behind Jennifer Aniston\u2019s iconic hairstyle on \u201cFriends.\u201d)",

      "McMillan's post has garnered more than 43,000 likes, and details exactly how he cut Bibb's hair to make a short, blunt bob.",
      "\u201cContinuity plays a big part when you do a TV show and/or film, so having something really easy and simple to maintain, especially in that humidity of Thailand, I think we nailed it,\u201d McMillan says in the video. \u201cAnd then we also created a kind of iconic look.\u201d",
      "Bibb adds: \"I think Chris cut it a little shorter in the back, but a little A-line so it's not so heavy. OK that's the scoop! That's the secret, not so heavy!\"",
      "Some fans have likened the cut to a photo of a dog with a blunt cut, which she responded to live on TODAY on March 27.",
      "\"Look at this dog,\" she says as the photo was put on a monitor in the studio. \"Wait, I have the same haircut!!!\"",
      "\"I sometimes will look at people and go, 'Do I look like a Cocker Spaniel?' When I saw it I was like, 'I do have a Cocker Spaniel essence!\"",

      "\"This is a version of the (bob) \u2014 it's gotten longer,\" she says of her current hairstyle. \"I don't know. We'll see. Hopefully I'll get something fun. I'm doing this other show, 'Palm Royale,' so I get to wear a wig, which is really fun, but it's sort of nice to change.\"",
      "\"I'm not attached to hair,\" she continues. \"I'll cut it, I'll color it, you know, it's just hair. It'll grow back.\""

      "The chair of the charity co-founded by Prince Harry has accused him of \u201charassment and bullying at scale\u201d after he announced his resignation last week.",
      "In an interview with\u00a0Sky News that aired on Sunday, Sentebale chair Sophie Chandauka\u00a0cited Harry\u2019s resignation statement as an \u201cunleashing of the Sussex machine\u201d against her and the organization\u2019s employees.",
      "\u201cAt some point on Tuesday, Prince Harry authorized the release of a damaging piece of news to the outside world without informing me or my country directors or my executive director,\u201d Chandauka said. \u201cAnd can you imagine what that attack has done for me, on me, and the 540 individuals in the Sentebale organizations and their family? That is an example of bullying and harassment at scale.\u201d",
      "The Duke of Sussex founded Sentebale alongside Prince Seeiso of Lesotho in 2006, with the aim of helping young people in the southern African nations of Lesotho and Botswana tackle health issues such as HIV and AIDS, as well as wealth inequity and climate resilience.",
      "The two originally set up the charity to honor their late mothers, Britain\u2019s Princess Diana and Lesotho\u2019s Queen Mamohato. Both quit as patrons of Sentebale after a fallout between its chairperson and the trustees.",
      "Harry and Seeiso had told Britain\u2019s Press Association news agency last week that the relationship between the charity\u2019s trustees and the chair of the board \u201cbroke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation.\u201d",
      "Without naming Chandauka, Harry and Seeiso had said in their joint statement that Sentebale\u2019s trustees had asked the chair to step down, \u201cwhile keeping the wellbeing of staff in mind.\u201d They did not elaborate on why the chair had been asked to step down from their position. The statement then said the chair sued Sentebale \u201cto remain in this voluntary position, further underscoring the broken relationship.\u201d",
      "Harry and Seeiso added in their statement that they plan to raise their concerns with Britain\u2019s Charity Commission, which regulates charities in England and Wales. A spokesperson for the Charity Commission told NBC News last week that it was \u201caware of concerns about the governance of Sentebale\u201d and \u201cassessing the issues to determine the appropriate regulatory steps.\u201d",
      "Chandauka issued her own statement last week, calling out \u201cpeople in this world who behave as though they are above the law and mistreat people, and then play the victim card and use the very press they disdain to harm people who have the courage to challenge their conduct.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeneath all the victim narrative and fiction that has been syndicated to press,\u201d she added, \u201cis the story of a woman who dared to blow the whistle about issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir \u2014 and the cover-up that ensued.\u201d",

      "\u201cTwo days ago, we received a proposal from our mediating brothers,\u201d the leader, Khalil al-Hayya, said during a speech. \u201cWe dealt with it positively and approved it. We hope that the occupation will not obstruct it and thwart the mediators\u2019 efforts.\u201d",

      "It is not clear what, if any, objections Israel has to the ceasefire proposal.",
      "If adopted, this ceasefire would come after Israel broke a previously established ceasefire with Hamas, launching a barrage of deadly airstrikes at Gaza and killing more than 400 people. That ceasefire agreement had gone into effect on Jan. 19.",
      "Israel blamed Hamas for the attack, citing the group\u2019s\u00a0refusal to meet Israel\u2019s demand\u00a0to release more hostages in return for the resumption of talks.",
      "But that was not part of that original ceasefire agreement, which included a first phase, where Hamas released 25 living hostages and the bodies of eight in exchange for around 1,800 Palestinian prisoners and detainees by March 1. The second phase was meant to begin 16 days later and would have included the exchange of all the remaining hostages and the establishment of a permanent ceasefire.",
      "The second phase never came. Netanyahu accepted a plan by Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, to extend the ceasefire for 50 days to discuss Phase 2, which Hamas rejected.",
      "After Hamas\u2019 rejection, Israel blocked the flow of aid and goods into Gaza and eventually hit the enclave with airstrikes on the night of March 18. In remarks following the airstrikes, Netanyahu said that \u201cthis is just the beginning.\u201d",
      "The strikes ended nearly two months of relative peace between Israel and Hamas.",
      "It is not clear how the new ceasefire proposal differs from the last, or whether Hamas will accept Israel\u2019s counterproposal."

      "Only a few weeks ago, Hamdan Ballal stood on a stage in Los Angeles accepting an Oscar for the film\u00a0\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d\u00a0a documentary depicting his West Bank village\u2019s struggle against Israel\u2019s occupation.",
      "On Tuesday, Ballal \u2014 his face bruised and clothes still spotted with blood \u2014 recounted to The Associated Press how he was heavily beaten by an Israeli settler and soldiers the night before. The settler, he said, kicked his head \u201clike a football\u201d during a settler attack on his village.",
      "The soldiers then detained him and two other Palestinians. Ballal said he was kept blindfolded for more than 20 hours, sitting on the floor under a blasting air conditioner. The soldiers kicked, punched or hit him with a stick whenever they came on their guard shifts, he said. Ballal doesn\u2019t speak Hebrew, but he said he heard them saying his name and the word \u201cOscar.\u201d",
      "\u201cI realized they were attacking me specifically,\u201d he said in an interview at a West Bank hospital after his release Tuesday. \u201cWhen they say \u2018Oscar\u2019, you understand. When they say your name, you understand.\u201d",
      "The Israeli military did not immediately respond to the claims that Ballal was beaten by soldiers. The settler whom Ballal identified as his attacker, Shem Tov Luski \u2014 who has threatened Ballal in the past \u2014 denied he or the soldiers beat him and told the AP that he and other Palestinians in the village had thrown stones at his car. He said he didn\u2019t know Ballal was an Oscar winner.",
      "The Israeli military said Monday it had detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks as well as one Israeli civilian, who was soon released. Ballal denied throwing stones.",
      "\u2018I\u2019m dying\u2019",
      "The attack took place Monday night in the southern West Bank village of Susiya. It\u2019s part of the Masafer Yatta region featured in \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d which depicts the Palestinian residents\u2019 attempts to fend off settler attacks and the military\u2019s plans to demolish their homes.",
      "At around sunset, as residents were ending their daylong Ramadan fast, roughly two dozen Jewish settlers along with police entered the village, throwing stones at houses and breaking property, witnesses say. Around 30 soldiers arrived soon after. Jewish Israelis in an activist group supporting the villagers showed video of themselves also being attacked, with settlers hitting their car with sticks and stones.",
      "Ballal said he filmed some of the damage caused by the settlers. Then he went to his own home and locked it, with his wife and three young children inside.",
      "\u201cI told myself if they will attack me, if they kill me, I will protect my family,\u201d he said.",
      "Ballal said Luski approached with two soldiers. He said Luski hit him on the head, knocked him to the ground and kept kicking and punching him in the head. At the same time, one soldier hit him on the legs with his gun butt, while the other pointed his weapon at him, he said.",
      "Lamia Ballal, the director\u2019s wife, said she was huddling inside with their children and heard him screaming, \u201cI\u2019m dying!\u201d",
      "Luski told the AP that he and other settlers had come to the village to help a fellow settler who said he was being attacked by Palestinian stone-throwers. He said dozens of masked Palestinians attacked his car with stones, including Ballal. \u201cHe broke my window, threw a stone at my chest,\u201d he said.",
      "He said when soldiers arrived, he led them to Ballal\u2019s house to identify him as one of the attackers but denied that he hit him or that settlers attacked any property in the village. Luski said he had footage of the night\u2019s events but when asked to show it to the AP, he responded with a string of expletives.",
      "On Tuesday, a small bloodstain could be seen outside Ballal\u2019s home, and the family car\u2019s windows were shattered. Neighbors pointed to a nearby water tank with a hole in the side that they said had been punched by the settlers.",
      "Under detention",
      "Lea Tsemel, the attorney representing Ballal and the two other Palestinians detained with him, said they were taken to an army base, where they only received minimal care for their injuries from the attack. She said they had no access to them for several hours after their arrest.",
      "Ballal said he had no idea where he was being held, could see nothing and was \u201cfreezing\u201d from the hours spent blindfolded under the air conditioner.",
      "The three were transferred to an Israeli police station at the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba and were released Tuesday afternoon.",
      "\u201cAll my body is pain,\u201d he told the AP immediately after his release as he walked, limping, toward a hospital in the nearby Palestinian city of Hebron.",
      "Doctors at the hospital said Ballal had bruises and scratches all over his body, abrasions under his eye and a cut on his chin but no internal injuries. The two other detained Palestinians also had minor injuries.",
      "Confrontations with settlers",
      "In a widely circulated video from August, Luski and several other masked settlers are seen arguing with Ballal. Luski shouts profanity at him and tries to provoke him into a fight.",
      "\u201cThis is my land, I was given it by God,\u201d Luski says. \u201cNext time it won\u2019t be nice.\u201d He taunts Ballal with the prospect of being sent to\u00a0Sde Teiman, a notorious military prison holding Palestinians detained from Gaza, where five soldiers have been charged with raping a detainee with a knife.",
      "\u201cRape for a higher cause,\u201d he says in Hebrew, then blows Ballal a kiss.",
      "The film \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a\u00a0joint Israeli-Palestinian production, chronicles the situation in Masafer Yatta, which the Israeli military designated as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered the expulsion of the residents, mostly Arab Bedouin. Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly come in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards.",
      "Settlers have also set up outposts around the area and at times destroy Palestinian property. Palestinians and rights groups say Israeli forces usually\u00a0turn a blind eye\u00a0or intervene on behalf of the settlers.",
      "The film has drawn ire in Israel and abroad, as when Miami Beach proposed\u00a0ending the lease\u00a0of a movie theater that screened it.",
      "Basel Adra, another of the film\u2019s co-directors and a prominent Palestinian activist in the area, said there\u2019s been a massive upswing in attacks by settlers and Israeli forces since the Oscar win.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re living in dark days here, in Gaza, and all of the West Bank,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody\u2019s stopping this.\u201d",
      "Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians want all three for their future state.",
      "Israel has built well over 100 settlements, home to over 500,000 settlers who have Israeli citizenship. Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal.",
      "The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers.",
      "The war in Gaza has sparked a surge of violence in the West Bank, with the Israeli military carrying out widescale military operations that have killed hundreds of Palestinians and\u00a0displaced tens of thousands. There has been a rise in settler violence as well as Palestinian attacks on Israelis."

      "The Japanese defense officials say they are not expecting a significant change in their responsibilities or an increase in U.S. troops in Japan.",
      "Hegseth and Nakatani told a joint news conference that they have also agreed on the need to beef up Japan\u2019s defense posture on the Southwestern islands, which are in critical locations along disputed areas in the East China Sea and near Taiwan to further step up deterrence against China.",
      "He stressed the need to have \u201csustaining, robust, ready and credible deterrence\u201d in the Indo-Pacific, including across the Taiwan Strait, as \u201cJapan would be on the frontlines of any contingency we might face in the western Pacific.\u201d",
      "China claims Taiwan as its own territory. The U.S. is obligated under a 1979 law to provide Taiwan with sufficient military hardware and technology to deter invasion, and its arm sales to Taiwan have always drawn strong opposition from Beijing.",
      "On Saturday, Hegseth joined the U.S.-Japan joint memorial to honor the war dead in the Battle of Iwo Jima as they marked the 80th anniversary of the end of one of the fiercest battles of World War II, praising the strong alliance between the former enemies.",
      "Before landing in Japan, Hegseth stopped in the Philippines where he also ensured Trump\u2019s commitment to step up ties with the Southeast Asian country that faces maritime disputes with Beijing."

    "summary": "In a wide-ranging interview with NBC News on Saturday, Trump said he \"couldn't care less\" if automakers raise prices on foreign cars following his imposed auto tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump told NBC News in an interview Saturday that he would not fire anyone involved in the Signal group chat in which military attack plans were inadvertently divulged to a journalist and added later that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d if automakers raised prices because of new tariffs.",
      "In a phone interview that lasted more than 10 minutes, Trump also discussed his commitment to annexing Greenland and reiterated that a military option was not off the table.",
      "Following a week of headlines about Signal, tariffs and Greenland, the president waved off concerns that his agenda is causing volatility on Wall Street or decreasing consumer confidence, pointing to polling that shows that the share of Americans who believe the country is on the right track is at record highs.",
      "\u201cWhat I see is right track, wrong track. And the right track was the first time in like 40 years where it was right track,\u201d the president said, at one point putting Alexander Stubb, the president of Finland, on the phone as well. The two men were golfing in Florida on Saturday.",
      "More from Trump\u2019s interview with NBC News:",
      "No concern if automakers raise their prices",
      "The president said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t care less\u201d if automakers raised prices after he announced he would impose 25% tariffs on all foreign-made automobiles.",
      "Asked what his recent message was to motor industry CEOs, and whether he had warned them against raising prices, Trump said, \u201cThe message is congratulations, if you make your car in the United States, you\u2019re going to make a lot of money. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re going to have to probably come to the United States, because if you make your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\u201d",
      "When pressed if he told CEOs not to raise prices, as reported in the The Wall Street Journal, Trump added, \u201cNo, I never said that. I couldn\u2019t care less if they raise prices, because people are going to start buying American-made cars.\u201d",
      "Trump continued, \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less. I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars. We have plenty.\u201d",
      "Asked if he was concerned about car prices going up, Trump said, \u201cNo, I couldn\u2019t care less, because if the prices on foreign cars go up, they\u2019re going to buy American cars.\u201d",
      "After the interview, an aide followed up with NBC News to say Trump was referring specifically to foreign car prices.",
      "NBC News reported this week that foreign auto parts would also be taxed at 25% even if the vehicles they go into are assembled domestically. Companies that import vehicles under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will get special consideration until the government establishes a process for levying the 25% duties, according to the\u00a0White House.",
      "Until that time, USMCA-compliant auto parts will remain tariff-free.",
      "The president also said the tariffs would be permanent.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely, they\u2019re permanent, sure. The world has been ripping off the United States for the last 40 years and more. And all we\u2019re doing is being fair, and frankly, I\u2019m being very generous,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump\u2019s tariff announcement on Wednesday came just weeks before his planned April 2 \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d when tariffs on a variety of consumer goods are set to take effect. They drew swift condemnation from international leaders like Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.",
      "In remarks on Thursday, Carney told reporters the tariffs were \u201cunjustified\u201d and that \u201cthe old relationship we had with the United States based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation is over.\u201d",
      "Trump on Saturday maintained that he does not plan to further delay the imposition of the April 2 tariffs, and he would consider negotiating on that point \u201conly if people are willing to give us something of great value. Because countries have things of great value, otherwise, there\u2019s no room for negotiation.\u201d",
      "Signal incident",
      "Trump said he has no plans to fire anyone following news that national security adviser Michael Waltz added a journalist to a Signal app group chat with senior members of the Trump administration who were discussing plans to strike Houthi militants in Yemen earlier this month.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,\u201d Trump said, calling the story \u201cfake news\u201d throughout the interview.",
      "\u201cI do,\u201d the president said when asked whether he still has confidence in Waltz and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was also in the Signal chat and sent a detailed timeline of the planned strikes before they happened.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s just a witch hunt and the fake news, like you, talk about it all the time, but it\u2019s just a witch hunt, and it shouldn\u2019t be talked [about],\u201d Trump added. \u201cWe had a tremendously successful strike. We struck very hard and very lethal. And nobody wants to talk about that. All they want to talk about is nonsense. It\u2019s fake news.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s comments come as he has faced calls \u2014 including from his allies \u2014 to fire Waltz after The Atlantic\u2019s editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg wrote on Monday that he had been added to a chat group on a private messaging app with senior administration officials.",
      "In the chat, the officials appeared to discuss their plans to strike Houthi rebels, which the Trump administration has since repeatedly claimed were not classified.",
      "\u201cI have no idea what Signal is. I don\u2019t care what Signal is,\u201d Trump said on Saturday. \u201cAll I can tell you is it\u2019s just a witch hunt, and it\u2019s the only thing the press wants to talk about, because you have nothing else to talk about. Because it\u2019s been the greatest 100-day presidency in the history of our country.\u201d",
      "Everything is on the table to obtain Greenland",
      "The president on Saturday also said he has \u201cabsolutely\u201d had real conversations about annexing Greenland, which is currently a semiautonomous Danish territory.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll get Greenland. Yeah, 100%,\u201d Trump said.",
      "He added that there\u2019s a \u201cgood possibility that we could do it without military force\u201d but that \u201cI don\u2019t take anything off the table.\u201d",
      "This comes one day after Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland with his wife, Usha, and spoke to service members at Pituffik Space Base, a U.S. Space Force base on the northwestern coast of Greenland.",
      "While there, Vance said, \u201cOur message to Denmark is very simple \u2014 you have not done a good job by the people of Greenland.\u201d",
      "Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen pushed back against Trump's plan to annex the nation, writing Sunday on Facebook: \"President Trump says the United States is 'getting Greenland.' Let me make this clear: The U.S. is not getting that. We don\u2019t belong to anyone else. We decide our own future.\"",
      "\"We must not act out of fear. We must respond with peace, dignity and unity. And it is through these values that we must clearly, clearly and calmly show the American president that Greenland is ours. It was like that yesterday. That\u2019s how it is today. And that\u2019s how it will be in the future,\" he added.",
      "Asked what message acquiring Greenland would send to Russia and the rest of the world, Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t really think about that. I don\u2019t really care. Greenland\u2019s a very separate subject, very different. It\u2019s international peace. It\u2019s international security and strength.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have ships sailing outside Greenland from Russia, from China and from many other places. And we\u2019re not going to allow things to happen that are going to be \u2014 that are going to hurt the world or the United States,\u201d he added.",
      "CLARIFICATION: This article was updated to reflect that after the interview, an aide followed up with NBC News to say Trump was referring to foreign car prices."

      "\u201cIf Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia\u2019s fault \u2014 which it might not be \u2014 but if I think it was Russia\u2019s fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia,\u201d Trump said in an early-morning phone call with NBC News on Sunday.",
      "\u201cThat would be that if you buy oil from Russia, you can\u2019t do business in the United States,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere will be a 25% tariff on all oil, a 25- to 50-point tariff on all oil.\u201d",
      "Trump had criticized Zelenskyy, saying he was \u201csick\u201d of his handling of the war and falsely calling him a dictator.",

      "Trump similarly announced \"secondary tariffs\" on Venezuela, saying on Truth Social that the tariffs would be placed on countries that bought oil and gas from Venezuela.",
      "A few of the top importers of Russian oil products include China, Turkey, Brazil and India, according to an analysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.

      "A government-sponsored junk food ban in schools across Mexico took effect on Saturday, officials said, as the country tries to tackle one of the world\u2019s worst obesity and diabetes epidemics.",
      "The health guidelines, first published last fall, take a direct shot at salty and sweet processed products that have become a staple for generations of Mexican schoolchildren, such as sugary fruit drinks, packaged chips, artificial pork rinds and soy-encased, chili-flavored peanuts.",
      "Announcing that the ban had become law, Mexico\u2019s Education Ministry posted on X: \u201cFarewell, junk food!\u201d It encouraged parents to support the government\u2019s crusade by cooking healthy meals for their kids.",
      "\u201cOne of the core principles of the new Mexican school system is healthy living,\u201d said Mario Delgado, the public health secretary. \u201cThere\u2019s a high level of acceptance of this policy among parents.\u201d",
      "Mexico\u2019s ambitious attempt to remake its food culture and reprogram the next generation of consumers is being watched closely around the world as governments struggle to turn the tide on a\u00a0global obesity epidemic.",
      "In the United States, for instance, the Trump administration\u2019s health secretary,\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has vowed to upend the nation\u2019s food system and \u201c\u00a0Make America Healthy Again\u00a0\u201c by targeting ultra-processed foods to\u00a0curb surging obesity\u00a0and disease.",
      "Under Mexico\u2019s new order, schools must phase out any food and beverage displaying\u00a0even one black warning logo\u00a0marking it as high in salt, sugar, calories and fat. Mexico implemented that\u00a0compulsory front-of-package labeling system in 2020.",
      "Enforced from Monday morning, the start of the school week, the junk food ban also requires schools to serve more nutritious alternatives to junk food, like bean tacos, and offer plain drinking water.",
      "\u201cIt is much better to eat a bean taco than a bag of potato chips,\u201d said\u00a0Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has championed the ban.",
      "Mexico\u2019s children consume more junk food than anywhere else in Latin America, according to UNICEF, which classifies the nation\u2019s childhood obesity epidemic as an emergency. Sugary drinks and highly processed foods account for 40% of the total calories that children consume in a day, the agency reports.",
      "\u201cAt my daughter\u2019s school, they told us that future activities wouldn\u2019t have candy, it would be completely different, with fruit, vegetables and other food that\u2019s healthy for kids,\u201d said Aurora Mart\u00ednez, a mother of two. \u201cIt will help us a lot.\u201d",

      "Since Trump\u2019s election and the resumption of his \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign on Tehran, Iran\u2019s rial currency has gone into a freefall.

The Iranian president then immediately toughened his own remarks on the U.S.",
      "Meanwhile, there have been mixed messages coming from Iran for weeks. Videos from Quds, or Jerusalem, Day demonstrations on Friday had people in the crowds instructing participants to only shout: \u201cDeath to Israel!\u201d Typically, \u201cDeath to America\u201d was also heard.",
      "A video of an underground missile base unveiled by Iran\u2019s hard-line paramilitary Revolutionary Guard also showed its troops stepping on an Israeli flag painted on the ground \u2014 though there was no American flag as often seen in such propaganda videos.",

In such a scenario, their bases and their allies will not be safe.\u201d",

      "The last time Trump tried to send a letter to Khamenei, through the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2019, the supreme leader mocked the effort.",
      "Trump\u2019s letter came as both Israel and the United States have warned they will never let Iran acquire a nuclear weapon, leading to fears of a military confrontation as Tehran enriches uranium at near weapons-grade levels of 60% purity \u2014 something only done by atomic-armed nations.",
      "Iran has long maintained its program is for peaceful purposes, even as its officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb. A report in February, however, by\u00a0the U.N.\u2019s nuclear watchdog said Iran has accelerated its production\u00a0of near weapons-grade uranium.",
      "Iran\u2019s reluctance to deal with Trump likely also takes root in his ordering the attack that\u00a0killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a Baghdad drone strike\u00a0in January 2020. The U.S. has said\u00a0Iran plotted to assassinate Trump\u00a0over that prior to his election this November, something Tehran denied though officials have threatened him."

    "summary": "Donald Trump has been giving leaders such as Mark Carney, Mexican Claudia Sheinbaum, Emmanuel Macron and Keir Starmer a popularity boost, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 The second Trump administration may have ruffled the feathers of America\u2019s allies, but there is also evidence it has boosted world leaders scrambling to deal with the White House\u2019s norm-busting approach.",
      "Some have gained plaudits for meeting Trump head-on, while others have taken a more nuanced line between flattering the president and trying to shore up their own interests against the headwinds blowing from Washington.",
      "Canada\u2019s Mark Carney is poised to win next month\u2019s election by volubly rejecting President Donald Trump\u2019s hostile advances to make his country the 51st state. On the flip side, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has earned accolades for becoming something of a Trump whisperer, deftly responding to his tariff threats and seeing her own popularity rise accordingly.",
      "In Europe, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have received polling boosts following their widely praised Trump strategies. And the embattled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has seen his numbers rise as he has tried to cope with Washington\u2019s brusque approach.",
      "\u201cThe standing of politicians who are having to deal with the crisis engendered by Trump\u2019s presidency is leading to a rise in their popularity, if they seem to be doing this in a reasoned and proper way,\u201d said Dominic Grieve, the former British attorney general and an ex-senior lawmaker for the Conservative Party.",
      "To be clear, Trump is no panacea for leaders. Macron and Starmer are still relatively unpopular and face harsh criticisms on domestic issues that will likely decide future elections. Likewise, good polling numbers will be of limited cheer for Zelenskyy while the future of his entire country is in doubt.",
      "Other analysts debate the extent to which this popularity boost is solely because of Trump, rather than the general climate of global instability and uncertainty of which Washington is a part.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure so how much it\u2019s a Trump bounce or more of a international crisis bounce,\u201d said Anand Menon, director of the think tank U.K. in a Changing Europe. \u201cInsecurity means that, initially at least, trust in the government goes up.\u201d",
      "Still, the abrupt change of tone and policy from the White House is an undeniable factor.",
      "Trump\u2019s attacks on Canada have seen a remarkable turnaround for Carney\u2019s Liberals. They were headed for historic losses, but Trump\u2019s onslaught has seen them ride a wave of renewed Canadian nationalism and lead the polls at 45% ahead of April 28\u2019s election.",
      "\u201cThe old relationship we had with the United States,\u201d Carney told a news conference Thursday, \u201cis over.\u201d",
      "Mexico\u2019s Sheinbaum has chosen a different tack, taking action on immigration and fentanyl trafficking \u2014 including sending 10,000 National Guard troops to the border. That earned a delay on Trump\u2019s tariffs, as well as praise from the U.S. president, who called her \u201ca wonderful woman.\u201d",
      "At home, she has mixed this strategy with a cerebral nationalism, telling voters that this is about \u201ccoordination, yes \u2014 submission, never.\u201d",
      "Her already high ratings have risen to 85%, according to the El Financiero newspaper in February.",
      "In the United Kingdom, Starmer\u2019s ratings have gone up 8.5 percentage points from February, according to the British pollster Ipsos. That followed an Oval Office meeting with Trump in which he mixed compliments with candor: talking up a potential trade deal while refusing to budge from a commitment to Ukraine.",
      "He has promised to hike British defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, part of the wider nervousness in Europe about Trump\u2019s commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance.",
      "The economy and health care will likely decide the next election. But defense is now the third most important issue for British voters, most polls show. And it is defense and international trade on which voters think Starmer is performing best, according to the Ipsos poll taken between March 14 and 17.",
      "\u201cPretty much all of his readings have become somewhat less unpopular in the wake of his trip to Washington,\u201d said John Curtice, one of Britain\u2019s most respected polling experts and a professor at Scotland\u2019s University of Strathclyde. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say the public have noticed that he\u2019s risen to the challenge.\u201d",
      "Another man banging the drum on European defense is France\u2019s Macron. He and Starmer are leading an informal \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d \u2014 a group of countries prepared to send troops to Ukraine to uphold any eventual ceasefire.",
      "Likewise, the current international upheaval has seen Macron\u2019s popularity jump to 31% in March, up 7 points from the previous month, according to an Ifop poll.",
      "These numbers are still relatively low, however, and they may well be fleeting. Macron can\u2019t run again in the next election, in 2027, but his centrist heirs risk losing the presidency to the far-right National Rally, the current favorite.",
      "The same is true for Starmer, whose Labour Party has slid from a landslide victory last year to near parity with the Conservatives and hard-right Reform U.K. Most voters are worried about high prices for food, energy and housing, rather than their leader\u2019s Oval Office repartee.",
      "For any leader enjoying a momentary upside, Menon, of U.K. in a Changing Europe, has a word of warning: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get complacent on the back of the fact that, right at the moment, things are looking a little bit better because Trump uncertainty.\u201d"

      "The Taliban has been in control of Afghanistan, one of the poorest countries in the world, since August 2021, when it ousted U.S.-backed President Ashraf Ghani shortly after the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country.",

      "Germany, Italy, Poland and Sweden are among the nations the U.S. Department of Agriculture approached to address the shortage brought on by a bird flu outbreak, according to European industry groups.",
      "But supplying Americans with eggs would be complicated for foreign producers \u2014 and not because of political tensions over the\u00a0myriad import tariffs\u00a0President Donald Trump has imposed or threatened to impose on his nation\u2019s top trading partners.",
      "Even if they were eager to share, European countries don\u2019t have many surplus eggs because of their own avian flu outbreaks and the growing domestic demand ahead of Easter.",
      "One of the biggest obstacles, however, is the approach the United States takes to preventing\u00a0salmonella contamination. U.S. food safety regulations require fresh eggs to be sanitized and refrigerated before they reach shoppers; in the European Union, safety standards call for Grade A eggs to be sold unwashed and without extended chilling.",
      "\u201cThese are two systems that could not be more different,\u201d said Hans-Peter Goldnick, the president of the German Egg Association.",
      "Feathers on eggs at the supermarket",
      "It is common in parts of Europe, for example, for consumers to buy eggs that still have feathers and chicken poop stuck to them.",
      "Farmer David Karlsch described the simple process that gets eggs from hens to customers of the family-owned Saballus poultry farm in Schoeneiche, a town just outside Germany\u2019s capital: The eggs are taken from nests, placed into cartons and sold on the premises or from a refrigerated vending machine just outside the property.",
      "\u201cThe demand at Easter time is of course very, very high, as many children naturally want to paint eggs,\u201d Karlsch said.",
      "Poland, a major egg exporter, fielded a U.S. query about the availability of eggs, according to Katarzyna Gawro\u0144ska, director of the National Chamber of Poultry and Feed Producers. The issue of washed vs. unwashed was a crucial factor as European officials considered such requests, she said.",
      "Eggs are not cleaned in most of the 27 EU nations because of concerns that removing the natural protective coating from eggshells makes them more\u00a0vulnerable to bacteria, Gawro\u0144ska said.",
      "Polish veterinary officials are trying to determine if the country and its farmers can meet U.S. requirements, such as whether the exporting nation has a comparable food safety inspection system or a significant bird flu outbreak.",
      "Powdered egg products",
      "Although European Union regulations state that table eggs \u201cshall not be washed or cleaned,\u201d member countries have some leeway if they authorized egg baths at packing plants decades ago.",
      "Danish Egg Association CEO J\u00f8rgen Nyberg Larsen said national customs are part of it; washed eggs are the norm in\u00a0Sweden, for example. But Sweden and Norway have informed the U.S. they don\u2019t have extra eggs to export, Larsen said.",
      "For now, any increased U.S. egg imports from Europe are more likely to arrive in powdered form or other products that can be shipped frozen or dried, Larsen said.",
      "That\u2019s the response Poland\u2019s trade association gave U.S. officials. If the U.S. certifies Poland as a source, the organization\u2019s members would have a limited number of shell eggs to sell but could supply \u201cvery large volumes of egg processing products,\u201d Gawro\u0144ska said.",
      "Processed eggs usually are pasteurized to prevent foodborne illnesses and then used in food manufacturing or by restaurants, hospitals and nursing homes, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Baked goods, pasta and sauces like mayonnaise are some of the commercial products made with egg powder.",
      "Europe\u2019s own production problems",
      "U.S. officials also tried to sound out farmers in northern Italy\u2019s Veneto region for emergency egg supplies, according to Coldiretti, the main Italian agricultural lobbying organization.",
      "But Italy only produces enough eggs to cover the national demand so most of the region\u2019s producers said they could not help. Bird flu outbreaks since the start of last year also have taken a toll on the Italian poultry industry.",
      "Germany cannot contribute much either. Its domestic poultry industry generates about 73% of the eggs consumed in the country, \u201cand we ourselves essentially have to import eggs from Holland every day to keep everyone satisfied,\u201d the German Egg Association\u2019s Goldnick said.",
      "\u201cWe have around 45 million eggs that we can collect from the chicken coops every day, and in America, there\u2019s a shortage of around 50 million eggs a day. That shows how difficult it is,\u201d he said.",
      "An improving U.S. market and Easter demand",
      "Other countries the U.S. government contacted include Austria, Norway, Spain\u00a0and Denmark. The\u00a0U.S. Department of Agriculture\u00a0said it secured new egg commitments from South Korea and Turkey in recent months, although it did not specify the amount or type.",
      "Brazil, which traditionally exports less than 1% of its total egg production, increased its February shipments to the U.S. by 93% compared to a year earlier, according to the Brazilian Association of Animal Protein.",
      "The detection of Newcastle disease, a viral condition often fatal to chickens, in some parts of Brazil impedes the South American nation\u2019s ability to become a significant U.S. egg supplier, market insiders say.",
      "Imports of liquid, frozen and dried eggs may help free up some domestic shell eggs for consumers, but the U.S. made its appeal for foreign eggs amid a significant deficit; last month, the country produced 720 million fewer table eggs than in February 2024, a decline of nearly 10%.",
      "The U.S. also cut its own egg exports to boost supplies at home, the Agriculture Department said.",
      "While the informal trade talks continue, the U.S. market has shown signs of improvement. It\u2019s been nearly a month since a major bird flu outbreak impacted egg-laying hens, the department said. It reported the national wholesale price for large eggs dropped to $3.27 per dozen as of March 21, or less than half its peak of $8.15 per dozen on Feb. 21.",
      "U.S. consumers are just starting to see those falling wholesale prices translate to lower prices on grocery shelves, the department said. The big demand for eggs that usually accompanies Easter and Passover could cause prices to edge up again next month.",
      "Business is business",
      "Trump hasn\u2019t exactly walked on eggshells with the people of Europe since starting his second term. The president\u2019s repeated\u00a0threats to seize Greenland, a Danish territory, infuriated many in Denmark. His posture toward Ukraine and disparaging remarks from\u00a0top members\u00a0of his administration have alarmed America\u2019s European allies.",
      "The\u00a0European Union, which is the third-largest trade partner of the U.S., was not exempted from the tariffs Trump ordered on steel, aluminum and automobiles.\u00a0Bracing for more, it has prepared counter-tariffs on American products.",
      "But many officials in Europe say none of that would rule out exporting eggs.",
      "Goldnick said an egg producer friend recently told him that \u201cif the price is right, then I\u2019ll deliver.\u201d Any deals made or not would come down to business decisions, he said.",
      "\u201cI have two souls in my chest. On the one hand, I would say, \u2018No, we can\u2019t support this system,\u2019 but that\u2019s not the right answer,\u201d he said, referring to new U.S. tariffs on European goods.",
      "\u201cThe right answer is we have to help where we can, Goldnick continued. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t concern the government. You wouldn\u2019t prop them up or anything, but it\u2019s just people\u2019s demand at Easter, for eggs, and that\u2019s just as important to satisfy in America as it is here.\u201d"

She wrote in The Guardian that she was  detained after she was questioned about the status of her visa, which had been granted following an initial rejection.",
      "\u201cThere is no communication, you don\u2019t have an officer to talk to,\u201d Mooney told MSNBC last week. \u201cYou can\u2019t contact your lawyers or your friends or your family.\u201d",
      "When Rebecca Burke, a backpacker from Britain, tried to enter from Canada in February, she spent nearly three weeks at a detention center.\u00a0In a statement to the BBC, the Northwest ICE Processing Center said Burke was repatriated after being detained \u201crelated to the violation of the terms and conditions of her admission.\u201d",
      "Burke's family said it believes her detention was due to a misunderstanding about her accommodation arrangements, which were free in exchange for helping hosts with household chores and which her father says authorities may have suspected constituted employment in violation of her visa.",
      "And U.S. citizen Lennon Tyler said she was chained to a bench by border agents last month when her German fianc\u00e9, Lucas Sielaff, was accused of violating the rules of his 90-day U.S. tourist permit while trying to enter from Mexico. Sielaff was detained for two weeks before returning to Germany, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Such incidents have prompted some governments to issue warnings for their citizens traveling to the U.S. The updated British travel advisory reads \u201cyou may be liable to arrest or detention if you break the rules.\u201d",
      "Those warnings have potential visitors to the U.S., like Pat Bastow, a Canadian citizen who plans to rent a car to visit Montana in July for a three-week holiday, seeking advice on how to protect themselves.",
      "\u201cA lot of travel agents are warning people not to go just in case Trump deports,\u201d Bastow, a retired cattle farmer, told NBC News.",
      "Hussain, the lawyer, said she is \u201cencouraging people to think about uploading some of their data to the cloud and downloading it once you\u2019re through screening.\u201d",
      "Turning phones off before arrival is also helpful, she said, as doing so disables facial recognition until a passcode is entered.",
      "Travelers\u2019 rights vary depending on their status \u2014 whether they are U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents or foreign visa holders \u2014 and their port of entry. Almost a quarter of the nearly 47,000 searches of electronic devices conducted at U.S. borders in the last financial year were of U.S. citizens, according to CBP data.",
      "Hussain advised legal permanent residents, or green card holders, \u201cwho may have a bit of a complicated situation\u201d to consult an attorney before traveling.",
      "Visa holders who refuse a search of their devices could see their visas revoked and be barred from entering the U.S., she added.",
      "Rules can vary across the country because the courts have largely avoided ruling on electronic device searches. Last year, a federal judge in New York barred CBP from warrantless searches of people\u2019s phones, but that applies only to John F. Kennedy International Airport.",
      "That lack of consistency, Hussain said, is \u201creally why we believe that the Supreme Court needs to weigh in on this issue.\u201d"
